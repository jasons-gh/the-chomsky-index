thank you it's commonly believed that
with the atrocities of September 11th
we're entering a new age of terror it's
the title of the first collection of
academic essays that came out shortly
after September 11th mostly Yale
University faculty the editors of that
collection regarded the anthrax scare
which at that time they attributed to
Osama bin Laden as even more dangerous
and ominous than the events of September
11th according to the consensus on the
issue nothing will be the same as the
united states declares a new war on
terror reorienting the course of history
there was a similar consensus at the end
of the Cold War it was assumed that this
is going to dramatically change the
course of history in both cases the
judgments seemed rather dubious in
retrospect the initial skepticism about
the end of the Cold War seems to have
been verified the end of the Cold War
certainly hadn't introduced changes it
modified pretexts and tactics but the
basic continuities of policy and global
history or for far more apparent I
believe and in fact they were evident
right away so discuss this the other day
and I'll be brief but the first Bush
administration immediately after the
fall of the Berlin Wall issued its
national security strategy report called
for huge Pentagon budget but now it was
not because the Russians are coming it
was because of the technological
sophistication of third world powers
that's why we needed the same budget
we'd had in the
past the we needed the same intervention
forces which as before were targeting
the Middle East there's a huge
intervention system from Guam to the
Azores that essentially targets Middle
East oil resources that's been there for
a long time and that had to stay however
the reasons were different the report
explained that the serious threats to
our interest in the oil-producing
regions could not be laid at the
Kremlin's door as had been pretended for
the preceding half century they also
called for maintaining what's called the
defense industrial base 2 euphemism for
high-tech industry pays my salary for
example and it's also the core of the
how to read the note that what's now
called the new economy for example am
almost entirely derives from the dynamic
state sector of the economy much of it
under a Pentagon cover and that has to
be retained the in fact everything was
pretty much as before except for the
pretexts they were all different that
it's kind of refreshing in a way back in
nineteen ninety stripped the end of the
Cold War did strip away many layers of
illusion and deceit that could have been
highly educational for the public but
they were carefully protected all of
this is very rarely discussed wasn't
reported and is rarely discussed outside
of dissident sectors and those are
scrupulously marginalized and that's
actually a necessity in a free society
far more so than in dictatorships or
totalitarian states facts that have been
understood for a long time that the fact
that the policies reflect reveal
fundamental continuity shouldn't really
be surprising policies are
crucially rooted in domestic
institutions they embody a certain
distribution of power these are stable
they face very little change therefore
it's no great surprise if policy choices
continue within a fairly narrow spectrum
with it most tactical and doctrinal
modifications I think there's good
reason to expect the same to be true of
September 11th contrary to usual
consensus and I'm not alone in that
several leading international relations
scholars that predicted right away that
there will be basic continuity of policy
after September 11th that quoting now
September 11th would at most further
trends already in motion happens to be
Kenneth waltz one of the most
distinguished figures and international
relations studies he also the one of the
trends that he predicted further that
would continue quoting him now is
pro-life proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction by countries that know
that the United States can be held at
bay only by deterrence that's a comment
which has many implications come back to
it seems to me plausible plausible
judgment for essentially same reasons I
mentioned it's reinforced in this case
by the fact that the war on terror was
not declared on September 11th but was
rida cleared it was rida cleared by
pretty much the same people who had
declared it 20 years earlier with much
the same rhetoric they are now menting
them back in power rida clared the war
and they conducted it through the 1980s
410 vicious and brutal years they left a
trail of corpses and devastation in
Central America the Middle East southern
Africa and elsewhere it requires
considerable historical amnesia to
overlook the first phase of the war
terror when the recycled raiga nights
read Eclair it 20 years later just as it
takes impressive self-discipline not to
notice that similar atrocities continued
right through the 1990s to investigate
this it actually suffices to look at the
record of leading recipients of us arms
that's a good way to see what policy is
like and in fact it's well known fact
well documented in scholarly literature
that's a very high correlation between
us arms transfers and human rights
violations and it persisted through the
1980s and 1990s so just take a look at
the leading recipients I'll put aside
the perennials Israel and Egypt it's not
an attractive story but they long belong
to a different category but apart from
them the well just take the year
nineteen ninety nine the championship
was transferred the prize was
transferred from Turkey which had been
the leading recipient up till 1999 it
was transferred to columbia which then
became the leading recipient why well
turkey had been carrying out a massive
state terror campaign against its
Kurdish population which right through
the 1990s some of the worst atrocities
of that grisly decade but it relied
crucially on us arms about eighty
percent of the arms flow was from the
Clinton administration in the single
year 1997 the u.s. arms to turkey that
single year exceeded the combined total
for the entire Cold War period up to the
onset of the state terror campaign
turkey was a strategically placed allies
it was always getting plenty of arms but
it shot up when the state terror began
peaked the 1997 greater that single year
than the entire Cold War period combined
up
to it there was quite ugly outcome
hundreds of made several million people
driven out of the devastated countryside
tens of thousands killed every
imaginable form of barbaric torture
relying crucially on the huge flow of
American Arms 1997 as I said was the
peak year it was an interesting year in
other respects so if you read the
world's leading newspaper The New York
Times 1997 that same year was the year
in which the times commentators
explained to us that US foreign policy
was entering into a noble phase with a
saintly glow none of this what I've just
described was never mentioned or barely
mentioned turkey is now praised for its
achievements in what's called successful
counter-terror counter-terror is the
name that is used for the terror that we
carry out against somebody else that's
not a US innovation I think that's a
historical universal even the most
extraordinary mass murderers said the
same thing so that if you look back at
the Nazi archives they were not carrying
out terror they were defending the
population from the terror of the
partisans who were terrorists supported
from abroad directed from London all of
which had an element of truth to it even
the most vulgar propaganda usually has
an element of truth to it it's true that
the partisans carried out terror it's
true that they were directed from London
and from within the Nazi system that he
massive atrocities that they carried out
and within Europe which we don't have to
describe where counter terror and
defense and I think that's universal
I've never found an exception certainly
the United States keeps to it rigorously
our atrocities are counter terror
there's our terror what changed in 1999
well by 1999 the
counter-terror if you want to use the
official term was successful the
population was crushed but Columbia
which through the 1990s had the worst
human rights record in the Western
Hemisphere and by far was the largest
recipient of US military aid in training
usual correlation by they had not
succeeded in crushing their own domestic
populations therefore they had to move
up the first place so Columbia replaced
turkey and the atrocities there go on
and on several million people this
internally displaced that may be close
to a million fled the country again it
has the level the political killings are
run at the level of maybe 10 or 20 a day
even the state department the tributes
about eighty percent of them to the
military forces and the paramilitaries
which are so closely linked to the
military forces that Human Rights Watch
which does some of the major studies on
this describes them as the sixth
division of the Colombian Army first
five are the official divisions and
there's the sixth division which is that
privatized version paramilitaries to
whom a lot of the terror is assigned if
you look over the years the the
component of the roughly eighty percent
of the terror that's attributed to the
two of them the component attributable
to the military is declining and it's
being replaced by the paramilitaries
that's an aspect of what sometimes
called neoliberalism or privatization
you privatize terror by assigning it the
paramilitaries that's pretty standard
it's done by lots people Serbs did it
Indonesian people in fact the
United States is doing it in Colombia as
well part of the atrocities is chemical
warfare which is being carried out under
the pretext of a drug war to drive
peasants off the land so that
multinational corporations could go in
and strip mine and take out the
resources and
destroy a peasant agriculture and end up
with monocrop agri expert that's being
privatized too it's done by private
corporations consisting of US military
officers totally funded by the US
government but private so it's not the
US Army that's doing it actually these
two examples apart from being
objectively the peak cases also haven't
have a personal meaning for me of just
in the last few months been in some of
the worst parts of southeastern Turkey
in southern Colombia which are the
scenes of some of these atrocities and
they're pretty horrendous but you don't
find out much about them if you keep to
the conventional sources though if you
look at such indices as arms transfers
you get a pretty good sense of where the
atrocities around the world are being
carried out actually this is the United
States which happens to have very good
information I'd be pleasantly surprised
if the british record were any different
or for that matter the minor players
like canada say don i haven't
investigated it closely outside of my
own country the one where my primary
responsibility is for the obvious reason
but you could try it for canada others
to try it for other countries prediction
probably going to come out pretty
similar well there is no doubt that
September 11th did make a difference we
can see it so techie rack before
September 11th Iraq was not a major
threat to anyone rot in place but not a
threat after 911 it's an imminent threat
to our existence George Bush the other
day when he was submitting the draft
resolution to the United Nations said
that Iraq mutt might attack us any day
now with weapons of mass destruction and
as he submitted the draft resolution he
also explained as administration
officials have been doing that we
interpret the resolution as authorizing
us to act whenever we feel like it and
we have to because tomorrow that we
might get that mushroom cloud that
Condoleezza Rice is warning about so
something changed on September 11th Iraq
shifted from not a threat to an imminent
threat to our existence actually if you
look a little more closely the change
was not on September 11th it was this
September up until this summer Iraq was
again a bad place but wasn't threatening
our existence as the electoral campaign
began for Congress it suddenly became an
imminent threat to our existence and
that worked it drove all other issues
off the off the agenda of the debate and
it was a spectacular electoral success
and that's the the threat to our
existence has to be overcome this winter
not next winter for similar reasons by
next winter the presidential campaign
will be underway and this has got to be
behind us by that time the mushroom
cloud that they're talking about is
presumably going to land in New York the
neighboring countries don't seem to be
to perceive the threat even Iran and
queit both of which were attacked by the
Beast of Baghdad when he was a friend
and ally of favored friend of the United
States and Britain they are all trying
to restore relations with Iraq they
despise said I'm saying of course but
they don't consider how much of a threat
except to his own people and that can't
possibly be the reason for any concern
in Washington and London as the history
makes brutally clear people in the
region and the government's in the
region are afraid but they're afraid of
the United States and
some kind of radical change in the
status of Iraq did take place first
partly at nine eleven partly shortly
after but if we want to understand the
world we have to ask whether this is a
change in objective threat or for that
matter even a change in perceived threat
or whether it's change an opportunity a
chance to escalate trends already in
motion as Kenneth waltz put it and to
pursue long-standing goals now with new
pre tapes that's an important question
very serious question it's one that
ought to be a central focus of attention
at least for people who want to
understand something about the world not
just marching parades and people who
feel some responsibility for their own
actions or inaction so let's proceed
I'll try to answer that question and
others like it a good place to try to
understand the emerging framework of
world order is just to look at the
expectations of those with the power to
shape the future who will indeed do so
unless they're constrained by an aroused
public so what do they expect well takes
a president bush he's here i'm quoting
i'll quote something things he says
about the war on terror but i mean
repeat again that the term terror here
is being used in a technical sense it
does not refer to terrorism as its
defined in the u.s. code of laws or the
Army manuals but rather to a subcategory
of terror the part that they carry out
against us not the part that we in our
clients carry out against them which is
typically quite larger that convention
though disgraceful is unchallengeable
and I'll keep to it reluctantly just
noting a fundamental objection so when I
talk about terror all keep to the
convention talking about the war on
terror the president says there is no
telling how many
warz it will take to secure freedom in
the homeland freedom from terror that is
and that comment is quite fair the
threats are limitless they're everywhere
there even at home the anthrax scares
good examples and traced back to a
federal lab so if you want to bomb
places that are potential terrorist
threats there are plenty of you don't
have to send the air force very far
furthermore it's been known for a long
time well before September 11th that
serious terrorist threats and the
special sense of Terror are quite likely
to take place so four or five years ago
technical papers were circulating in the
strategic analysis literature pointing
out that the quote one that a
well-planned operation to smuggle
weapons of mass destruction meaning
nuclear weapons into the United States
would have about a ninety percent
probability of success far higher than a
missile attack with it without missile
defense it's presumably made smuggling
across the porous Canadian border
although one Harvard specialist Graham
Allison before September 11th just to
indicate what it was like I suggested
that the best way to get a nuclear
weapon into new york new york hotel room
would be to wrap it in a bale of
marijuana and send it through the new
york harbor figure that had a high
chance of success the about four years
ago so it's again a couple years before
911 MIT press published a book written
by three major strategic analysts called
America's Achilles heel and it was kind
of like a guidebook for terrorists
here's the many things you could do with
out too much sophistication that would
cause massive destruction the worst are
nuclear weapons by a long shot but
others are not very pretty either and
all of this has been surely been obvious
since 1993
remember that in nineteen ninety three
groups closely associated with the ones
who are presumably responsible for
September 11th and that come out of the
same Afghan operations of the CIA in the
British and so on where they organized
radical Islamists through the 1980s
those groups groups connected to them it
did come very close to blowing up the
World Trade Center and they had much
more ambitious plans this is 1993 they
were going to blow up the FBI building
the UN buildings tunnels under the river
and so on the Trade Center engineers
concluded that with a little better
planning at the World Trade Center they
might have killed tens of thousands of
people well that was 1993 since then no
one who even reads the papers little own
technical papers it could have been very
surprised then should be in the future
surprised if there are large-scale
unanticipated terrorist attacks which
could be extremely destructive the fact
that one of these attacks was successful
on September 11th in a particularly
horrifying way that doesn't actually
change the assessment of risk very much
stays about where it was and it's a
serious risk well there are ways to
increase the risk substantially there
also ways to reduce the risk and they're
both reasonably well understood so one
way to increase the risk was described
to Congress by the CIA about a month ago
namely attack your act they pointed out
to Congress that if the United stall
though they don't know of any Yaqui
connection to terror now and one is
rather unlikely instantly other global
work world intelligence agencies agreed
in this judgement France written and
others but CIA pointed at the Congress
that although there's no terrorist
threat from Iraq now if Iraq is attacked
they'll very likely will be a terrorist
threat for one thing that's going to
such an attack will very likely spawn a
new generation
terrorists who are bent on revenge may
be all over the world and it could set
off terrorist attacks that are already
planned maybe there is a nuclear bomb
already put together in a New York hotel
room nobody knows but remember the
ninety percent probability of success
and it could be there as a deterrent or
for revenge and it might go off or some
other thing might happen if Iraq is
attacked there are also ways to reduce
terror even aside from the obvious way
namely stop participating in it which
would in fact cut it down quite a lot
but I'm not allowed to talk about that
that violates the convention so I'll put
that aside even keeping to the
convention there are ways to reduce
terror and they work the one that works
best is careful police work that has
succeeded since number eleventh rather
significantly primarily in Germany which
recently broke up a major al-qaeda cell
and there are a few others mostly in
Europe in contrast bombing Afghanistan
apparently had little effect and may
have increased the threat at least so US
intelligence believes the FBI and CIA
that's not a great surprise actually the
role of Afghanistan and international
terrorism was never very clear the how
unclear it is was reported by the head
of the FBI Robert Miller when he
testified to Congress a couple of months
ago in early June he informed Congress
that the FBI now believes that's his
word the FBI now believes that the
September 11th plot might have been
hatched in Afghanistan but that the
implementation and the funding were in
Germany in the United Arab republics
that's eight months after the bombing of
Afghanistan we've gotten as far as
believing that maybe the plot was
hatched there the that does raise the
question why bomb
the answer is not to get rid of the
Taliban that was not a worry that was
thrown in at the end practically at the
end of the war one suggestion was made
by Abdul Haq who was one of the most
highly respected of the Afghan leaders
struggling against the Taliban highly
respected by the United States and in
fact by the new government like quite a
few other anti-taliban Afghan leaders he
was bitterly opposed to the bombing
because he said it's undermining their
efforts to overthrow the Taliban
leadership which of course they despised
to overthrow it from within something
which they thought was quite possible
but this is undermining the efforts so
what's his explanation for why the US is
bombing well he said the u.s. is trying
to show it to show its muscle score a
victory and scare everyone in the world
if that was the goal they succeeded in
that at least well that's one analysis
from an interesting source so but
putting such analyses aside there is a
way to reduce terror careful police work
that does have an effect another way to
reduce terror if you serious about it is
to pay some attention to the people who
have the most experience in the matter
so take for example the head of the
Israeli secret police shabak which
basically runs the occupied territories
I mean I alone head of the secret police
up till 2000 he pointed out that those
who want victory against terror want an
unending war unless they're willing to
address underlying grievances the bush
planners understand that very well but
they don't want to address the
underlying grievances in contrast and
unending war would not be so bad in fact
kind of essential for radical
nationalists who have quoting again who
have adopted the classic modern strategy
of an endangered right-wing oligarchy
which
is to divert mass discontent into
nationalism through fears of an external
enemy that they conjure up I'm quoting
the same senior associate of the
Carnegie Endowment that's one of the
reasons why the United States why the
world much of the world does regard the
United States as a menace to itself and
to mankind quoting him again if it
continues on the present course and
there's nothing particularly novel about
this is an old story one of the the
famous American satirist HL Mencken back
70 years ago pointed out that the whole
aim of practical politics is to keep the
public alarm and hence clamorous to be
led to safety by menaced menacing it
with an endless series of hobgoblins
most of them imaginary and he sort of
right there's plenty of experience about
that including again the worst mass
murders it takes a Hitler go back to the
30s he was warning that Czechoslovakia
is a dagger pointed at the heart of
Germany and Germany is in serious danger
furthermore the Jewish Bolshevik
conspiracy is about the destroy the of
the Aryan race the inheritors of Greek
civilization the peak of Western
civilization so Germany is really in
danger and it worked and similar things
have worked many times the tactic as i
mentioned work beautifully for the
recent elections you can read about it
by leading political scientists right
now op-eds in the new york times and so
on pointing out how nicely it worked and
it'll be needed for the coming
presidential campaign so put yourself in
the shoes of George Bush's campaign
manager Karl Rove and imagine what he's
going to want people to be thinking
about when the presidential campaign
starts in early next phone year 2000 for
the last thing he wants people to
thinking about is what happened to their
jobs or their pensions or their limited
health care or social security or about
the Enron crisis and what George Bush
has to do with Ken Lay or destruction of
the environment for their children or
the accelerated and quite extraordinary
concentration of wealth that's being
fostered by the radical nationalist
leadership who are dedicated with
extremism that goes well beyond the norm
to a very narrow sector of the corporate
power particularly corrupt sector rather
what they're supposed to be doing next
year is singing praises to the heroic
leader who saved them from imminent
destruction by a power of awesome
proportions and will by then be marching
on to some new adventure while the
population is clamoring for safety is
makin put it that's all of this remember
is second nature to the recycled
Reaganite who are now the central
planners twenty years ago they were
doing the same thing twenty years ago
another brave cowboy was in the White
House and he was huddled they're
surrounded by tanks while Libyan hit men
were wandering the streets of Washington
trying to assassinate him and the
population in the United States was
properly frightened by this awesome
danger a few years later he was wailing
about how Qaddafi wants to expel America
from the world no less and he was
warning that Nicaragua the Nicaraguan
army is only two days marching time from
Texas Nicaragua's ax is a dagger pointed
at the heart of Texas to borrow some
rhetoric and what the doing is carrying
out a plan to conquer the hemisphere
they're following a script from mine
I'm quoting from the congressional
testimony of George Shultz secretary of
state he was the administration moderate
the Colin Powell of the day and at that
time repeatedly year after year
Americans were frightened terrified by
something or other and it did enable the
administration to ram through domestic
program which concentrated wealth very
narrowly stagnation or declined for most
of the population undercut social
spending and so on but people were
frightened enough to accept it so it's
kind of second nature to do it at the
time well back to ami Ayalon the head of
Shabbat and how to reduce terror namely
by addressing underlying grievances he
was of course speaking of Israel
Palestine we're quoting again the only
solution of the problem of terrorism is
to offer an honorable solution to the
Palestinians respecting the right of
self-determination actually now i'm
quoting somebody else a predecessor of
his oshawott harka be who was the head
of military intelligence and well-known
israeli Arabist and this is from 20
years ago that's after another shocking
outburst of settler and the army
violence in the territories and that was
at a time when israel still remained
complete immunity from retaliation from
within the territories to the harsh and
brutal practice as it was carrying out
including taking the land and the
resources this was all thanks to us
support otherwise they can't do a thing
they can go as far as the u.s. supports
them and permits not any further well
the immunity lasted until very recently
a couple of years ago and therefore the
violence and repression were considered
quite unproblematic by American elite
opinion that takes us back to the
definition of terror then it was
something that we're doing to them so
okay but once the immunity is lost then
there's something that they're doing to
us maybe a fraction of what we've been
doing to them and that's horrendous
again usual situation unless one
addresses grievances and finds the
legitimate ones and deals with them it
is true that you will enhance terror the
way to reduce terror is to pay some
attention to the grievances and try to
address them it's not going to get rid
of everything but it's an effective way
to reduce terror as anyone who's
seriously concerned about doing this
like the high intelligence and military
echelon in Israel understands very well
and it was true in Northern Ireland that
was true in South Africa and it's quite
general unfortunately it was not
recognised in Northern Ireland in South
Africa until after a great deal of
violence and suffering but when the
grievances began to be addressed there
was some step forward and that
generalizes in pretty obvious ways so in
serious scholarship it's recognized
quoting again that unless the social
political and economic conditions that
spawned al-qaeda and other associated
groups are addressed the United States
and its allies will continue to be
targeted by terrorists happens to be a
University of Texas specialist on the
topic but it's very common in the
scholarly literature it's only
intellectuals who are posturing before
the galleries who sink to such mindless
absurdities as charging that explanation
is justification or two claims about how
it's all their fault we play no role in
definition since we're so obviously good
maybe even magnificent that's the common
stance of the powerful through the ages
we're not breaking any new ground just
replaying an old record and in fact the
commitment that this is so strong that
even the crucial internal US government
record which has been known for years at
the highest level
even that has to be rigorously
suppressed so take the question the
George Bush chest why do they hate us
answer because we're so good remember
that well the quest he was not the first
president to ask that question that
question for example was asked by
president eisenhower in 1958 in secret
but it's been public for 10 years in NC
in his internal staff discussions in
1958 eisenhower brought before a staff
the observation that in his words
there's a campaign of hatred against us
among the people of the Arab world and
there was discussion and the National
Security Council the highest planning
body came out with an analysis the
analysis is that there is a recognition
in the Arab world that the United States
supports brutal and oppressive regimes
and blocks democracy and development and
we do this because of our interest in
controlling the oil resources of the
region and that leads to a campaign of
hatred that was the analysis then and it
remains the analysis today we don't have
the classified documents from last year
but we do have attempts to investigate
opinion in the Arab world so immediately
after September 11th some of the better
newspapers first The Wall Street Journal
and a couple of others did the obvious
thing they went to try to assess the
opinions in the Arab countries The Wall
Street Journal investigated the kind of
people they are interested in what they
called money Muslims so bankers and
heads of directors of multinational
corporations and professionals and so on
to find out what their attitudes were
and it's the same as 1958 their bitterly
opposed to US policy they're not opposed
to globalization so-called the right in
the middle of it none of these things
they're opposed to the fact that the
United States continues to support harsh
and brutal regimes and the black
democracy and development because of its
interest in controlling
you're East oil now there's other
particular policies that have
exacerbated this like with regard to the
Palestinians and Iraq which didn't exist
back in 58 but the basic feelings are
about the same these are doesn't only do
with hating America these are people who
like Americans admire them they like a
lot about the United States they admire
American freedom and democracy what they
hate is US government policies that
continue to block it that block
democracy and development and support
brutal and repressive regimes in order
to ensure control over these oil
resources which are not slight back in
1945 the State Department described the
oil resources of the Gulf region as a
stupendous source of strategic power and
one of the greatest material prizes in
world history not a small thing and
therefore the US had to take control
over it I hear you have to be a little
cautious the issue is control not access
a lot of misleading discussion about
this in the press has nothing to with
access control control of the material
prize ensures that a hue is a huge flow
of wealth that goes back to the people
who have a right to it in the United
States and Britain energy corporations
US Treasury high-tech industry that
sends arms and so on you can guarantee
that the flow goes back that way not
somewhere else and strategic power means
a lever of world control that's critical
for understanding us goals right now in
Iraq Iraq has the second largest oil
reserves in the world the u.s. is deeply
committed to gaining control of them
control not access access is not been a
problem in the past and it's not
expected to be in the future well let's
at this point go to the expectations of
the powerful again which bear directly
on this and luckily for us they tell us
loud and clear
and in some detail so you want to learn
about the expectations there right there
on paper so for example the national
intelligence council in the United
States that's a combination of the CIA
the Defense Intelligence Agency other
major intelligence agencies recently
about two years ago three years ago I
put out a document important document
called global trends 2015 that's
projections for within the year 2000
projections for the next 15 years this
was done with the participation of
academic specialists and people in the
business community here's their main
prediction the prediction is that what
they call globalization will continue on
course its evolution will be Rocky with
increasing financial volatility and a
widening economic divide okay keep that
in mind that's the main prediction those
of you who've taken economics courses or
read the stuff know that in it is
technical sense in which globalization
is supposed to lead the convergence
supposed to lead to an integrated market
with a single wage and price so what
they're predicting is less globalization
in the technical sense widening divide
but more globalization in the doctrine
Lee preferred sense that is the people
who matter will do fine and the rest
somebody else's department what does
financial volatility mean financial
volatility more volatility means slower
growth harming mainly the poor so their
main prediction is that globalization
will decrease and the technical sense
widening economic divide though the rich
will make a fine and growth and
development will be slower well that
prediction lifts the veil on a very
striking feature of foreign policy in
the past 25 years I mean known the
professionals or activists but not too
well known by the public and that is
that the so-called globalization
policies the new
liberal policies sometimes called the
Washington Consensus they've been
accompanied by a marked deterioration in
standard macroeconomic measures over the
past 25 years that includes growth of
the economy growth of productivity
growth of investment even growth of
trade has slowed in the past 25 years
there's been stagnation for most of the
population and much higher workload
lower benefits a highly concentrated
wealth that's true of the richest
country in the world dramatically but
it's rather general throughout the world
apart from countries that just didn't
follow the rules the generalization is
quite strong the effect rather striking
is the fact that the the regions of the
world that followed the rules most
rigorously like Latin America are the
ones that suffered the most and the ones
that largely ignored the rules like East
Asia they did pretty well they escaped
the general decline in fact sometimes
did extremely will that's one aspect of
so-called globalization which has
nothing to do with globalization has to
do with a very specific form of
international economic integration even
more striking is the way in which the
neoliberal policies including financial
liberalisation undermine democracy fact
that's sort of their main purpose and
effect and that's well known to it was
known back in 1945 when the post-war
economic system was established based on
a regulation of capital capital states
are left the control capital flow and
currencies are more or less fixed and
the system was set that way to give
governments a certain space to carry out
the Social Democratic welfare state
measures there's and this is well
understood actually is a good book on
this by University of Toronto a
political economist Erika liner but it's
pretty well known and it's pretty
obvious the facts are also very well
understood among
victims notably in Latin America where
the story is being played out right in
front of our eyes in Brazil financial
volatility is the device being used to
ensure that the Democratic choice of the
Brazilian electorate will not be allowed
to function that's a major consequence
of liberalisation of Finance 25 years
ago and of the other neoliberal measures
like privatization and so on well the
conclusion of the powerful is that we
must extend and intensify the global
policies that have these consequences
that's essentially what I was reading
from the projections that's been for the
last 20 years that's given rise to major
popular struggles throughout the world
some of the most important developments
on the world scene put that aside for
lack of time well let's go back to the
expectations what's going to be the
effect of a widening economic divide
well here's the national intelligence
council again as this increases as
globalization in their sense proceeds
deepening economic stagnation will
foster political ethnic ideological and
religious extremism along with violence
much of it directed against the United
States that's the intelligence
projection so we're back to terrorism
and underlying grievances that have to
be addressed unless we prefer more
terrorism of course if we want to prefer
terrorism and unending Wars then yes
ignore the underlying grievances which
were expecting to intensify by the
international economic policies that we
are insisting upon and as I mentioned
that's a pretty rational choice for a
kind of a radical nationalist extremist
leadership such as those who hold the
reins of power today interesting and
important fact is that the same
assumptions are made by military
planners so to indicate how
the spectrum is you can go back to some
Clinton you're a document one that I
mentioned a couple of days ago so I
won't go on with it but the most one of
the most important is vision for 2020 20
the next 20 years a 20 of 25 years
because it was written five years
earlier Clinton's Space Command which
predicts a growing gap between haves and
have-nots the have-nots will be
disruptive they have to be controlled
the same prediction as the national
intelligence council about the
consequences of deepening stagnation and
a widening economic divide and that's
part of the thinking behind the vast
expansion of US military power it's
going to be needed to control the
disruptive masses as the stagnation and
white and economic divide drive them to
things like terrorism the you know I'm
sure that the United States close comes
close to out spending essentially the
rest of the world combined in military
expenditure and that's misleading it
doesn't include us client States so it
takes a Israel Israel is a small country
but it's an outpost of the US military
in many respects so as a huge military
system in fact according to the senior
analysts of the Israeli IDF the Israeli
Armed Forces Israeli air and naval
forces are larger and technologically
more advanced than any native power
outside the US of course and that's only
one written as another major mainly
warrior state that's its comparative
advantage military force 911s temporal
eps so that's all part of the US
military establishment September 11th
was a pretext for a sharp increase in
military spending it's completely
unrelated to terrorism and takes a
ballistic missile defense and remember
that figure of ninety percent
ability of getting a nuclear weapon in
the United States it with a well-planned
effort much higher than any missile it's
nothing to do with defense has a lot to
do with global control what to say about
this talk a little about it the other
day so I will go on with it now well
let's turn to the Middle East which is
the focus of a great deal of current
concern rightly the national
intelligence council projection for the
next 15 years predicts that there will
be a rising demand for energy and that
therefore the Kyoto protocols will be
demolished doesn't matter if anybody
signs them or not so Canada can stop
debating the matter and that will lead
to they predict to increased global
warming one of the major arguments for a
war in Iraq is that when the u.s.
regains control over Iraqi oil it will
be able to lower the price to help
increase the rising demand and the
destruction of the environment another
threat to survival but again rational
within a kind of lunatic framework the
national intelligence council goes on to
say that the Persian Gulf region will
see large increases in oil production
capacity and will rise in importance to
the world energy markets and therefore
the US must control them as it has since
the Second World War that's the
stupendous source of strategic power and
so on they go on to predict that the
u.s. itself is not going to rely on
Middle East oil rather it's going to
rely on more stable sources than the
Atlantic Basin like Brazil and the rest
of Latin America and West Africa and
Canada nothing new about this after
World War two the United States was the
major oil North America was the major
oil producer till about 1972 us didn't
use a drop of Middle East oil since that
time the main importer into the United
State
it's usually been Venezuela but this had
nothing to do with the need to control
Persian Gulf oil we're by now such
secondary sources as Central Asian oil
and others the goal is control not
access that has always been understood
and is completely explicit and is
completely understandable so again in
1958 when there was some disruption in
the system President Eisenhower
reiterated his view that the Persian
Gulf oil-producing region is the most
strategically important area in the
world and to lose control of this
strategic position and the resources of
the Middle East would be worse than the
loss of China notice that he's talking
about control not access because the US
didn't use any of that oil and had no
expectation of doing it but control is
what mattered then and it's what matters
now well the coming war in Iraq this is
one of the underlying factors almost
undoubtedly there are pretexts that are
offered you've heard them all it's
pretty hard to take them seriously I
think I can return and discussion if you
like but there are reasons good reasons
one of them is the long-standing
commitment to regain control over this
depend this source of strategic power
and then one of the greatest material
prizes in world history September 11th
offered a pretext for that instantly
offered a similar window of opportunity
for lots of other countries so Russia
for example increased its atrocities in
Chechnya under the pretext of a war on
terror expecting correctly to get
authorization from Washington China did
the same thing in western China
Indonesia did the same thing in each a
that Israel did the same thing in the
occupied territories and you can run
down the list for the United States to
would offer to pretext to pursue more
actively policies that were already
there domestic political considerations
dictate the time
has to be this winter next winters too
late not because of the mushroom cloud
but for more mundane reasons like the
presidential election there is a
security issue serious one it is it's
necessary to secure the domestic
economic program of service to a very
narrow sector of unusually corrupt
corporate power along with the
continuing assault against the general
population the and also the global
dominance based on absolute military
superiority that program has to be
secured for another four years and
that's a security problem buts the only
major security problem the plans now
underway are expected to increase the
threat to the United States but it's
just a secondary matter well by next
year the next phase of the program might
well be underway Israel's air and naval
forces and remember their scale over ten
percent of them are permanently based
now in eastern Turkey in the huge US
military bases there also Israeli
armored forces are there presumably in
case the Kurds this is a Kurdish region
in case the Kurds get out of control
again and got a repressive but the air
and naval forces are permanently there
and the Air Force is according to the
best sources we have are flying at the
Iranian border looking forward to the
next step in the in the continuing
process of ensuring global dominance
through absolute military superiority
Israel doesn't take Iraq very seriously
but they do regard Iran as a country
that they can't control by themselves
and they want the US to do it for them
it's possible that that war is sort of
underway in its early stages and they're
much broader plans according to US
scholarly sources and according to the
Israeli press which is generally quite
reliable and is particularly
illuminating right now
because of the very close links that
hold between the bush planners and the
far-right in Israel I'm not talking
about Ariel Sharon I'm talking about the
right wing to the right of Sharon so
people like Richard Perle and Douglas
fight close to the planning sectors back
in the mid 90s they were writing
position papers for Netanyahu I mean 10
yahoo off to the right of Sharon way at
the extreme end and the plans are pretty
amazing when you read about them they've
been harshly criticized by the most
influential US strategic analysts who
are warning the government not to be
caught up and what they call some coding
one calls the neocon fantasies of
sillier armchair strategists and more
vocally irresponsible hardliners quoting
Anthony Cordesman he's referring to rich
parole and Douglas faith and others were
quite close to the center of power he
himself courtesan is about as hard line
as when confined within the saner
planning spectrum and he's the leadings
military strategic analyst on the in the
US government too close to the
government who works on these areas
which is another indication of why the
world is deeply concerned about us power
and it's exercise now well a lot more to
say about this there's also some good
news and end with that the good news
which we all know is that folks like us
are highly privileged they were not like
people in Turkey in Colombia we talk
about these things we're not going to be
sent to turkish prisons or be
assassinated by paramilitary terrorists
we can act with without fear of prison
torture assassination and so on things
they're faced constantly with remarkable
courage and dedication actually inspires
humility to see it should among people
who are as privileged as we are we don't
face any of those problems we have the
means to determine whether these
tendencies and there are ominous or
whether they continue or whether policy
takes a far different course a more
constructive course and the enormous
wealth and power that we have in our
hand will be used to build rather than
to destroy and in the Russell lecture it
should be unnecessary even to bring any
of this up there could hardly be a more
inspiring model for what can and must be
done than the great 20th century figure
to whose memory these lectures are
dedicated
