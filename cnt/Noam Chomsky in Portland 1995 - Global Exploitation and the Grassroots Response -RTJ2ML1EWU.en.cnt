you see see
[Music]
what just says you
[Music]
well the Portland Alliance has been
bringing progressive community news and
analysis to Portlanders for almost 15
years now we're just delighted to see
this audience here tonight and we are
especially pleased and honored to have
with us tonight a man who is no doubt
our most famous subscriber in his
writings professor Chomsky emphasizes
the importance of local movements and
local struggles and how essential it is
to build popular democratic movements if
we wish to ever create a more just and
peaceful society with characteristic
humility he downplays his own role as a
thinker writer and spokesperson for the
left analysis study research he
acknowledges he can do those things and
in his own words reasonably well but the
more important work he insists is being
done by those who are working actively
to create a better world
I still remember several years ago
during a fundraising drive for the
Alliance when we got our first
contribution from Professor Chomp
professor Chomsky he's been a loyal
subscriber ever since and in fact I
brought his renewal form for him tonight
hoping that he would pitch in again we
have always appreciated his support as a
significant affirmation of the work that
we try to do Professor Chomsky's work is
inspired by the multitude of movements
for social justice around the world in
turn his work informs and inspires those
of us who are actively engaged in those
movements it goes both ways he has
written about how his activism has
enriched his life because of the people
he's met the friends he's made the
things he's learned we too are enriched
by his presence in our community it's
hard to think of a more principled
determined and tireless proponent of
authentic democracy around the globe the
noam chomsky we are very thankful for
his support over the years and for being
here tonight at this benefit for the
info shop and the Portland Alliance
enjoy the evening
[Applause]
[Music]
sorry I don't mean to steal all the
limelight here there is one more group
that I'd like to thank very much though
and that is the flying focus video
collective there these folks are going
to be taping the event tonight all right
thank you for iying focus and this point
it is my sincere pleasure to introduce
professor Noam Chomsky
[Applause]
[Music]
forgot to leave me the renewal form how
much lesser not well organised for about
20 years now the country has been moving
in a very obvious direction with quite
ominous overtones
it's sensed quite clearly by the general
population with deep and growing and
quite justified concern the general
contours of it are clear enough so that
they're being described not only in
technical literature but even in popular
literature that reaches the public you
can see what's going on just by looking
at very gross statistics in around 1980
the United if you look at things like
say level of inequality in in the United
States it was more or less like other
industrial countries worse than some
better than others now it's by far the
worst in the industrial world the levels
of inequality are back to what they were
in pre depression days if you look at
things like say poverty rate the United
States was always somewhat high it's now
about twice as high in poverty rate as
the next highest country in the
industrial among the industrial
countries and you get the same if you
look takes a proportion of the
population in prison around nineteen
eight again the US has always been on a
high end
around 1980 it was about the same as the
next highest country which is in the
industrial world which is England now
it's the incarceration rate is going way
up crime rates been pre steady but the
incarceration rate is shot way up we're
out of sight unrelated
any other industrial country in fact any
country past South Africa and Russia
back in the 80s Russia finally caught up
with us after the reforms I sit in and
they started learning to do things right
so right now I think we're now second
but unrelated to the industrial world
and the same is true on each on measure
after measure child malnutrition all
sorts of things
these are shifts which are too obvious
not to be noticed and they are noticed
and they're real and they're frightening
if they are very strongly opposed by the
general general population which so far
has not found the constructive response
to them if they continue the effect for
the United States and indeed for the
world or indeed pretty grim given our
power we drag everyone along with us
more so in a more globalized economy and
the move is towards a kind of a third
world structure it's as if the United
States is becoming something like a
third world Society third world
societies differ among themselves but
they have some structural features in
common and those are the that's the
structure towards which we're moving to
pick you know typical third world
society you know Mexico Brazil Indonesia
you know Egypt you pick it typically has
a small sector of often extreme wealth
and privilege that's even true in the
poorest societies there's enormous
wealth in fact astonishing wealth
very highly concentrated there's a large
massive population which is in bad shape
suffering or often in deep misery and
there's a superfluous population which
just has to be either driven away or
killed or something subjected the social
cleansing and places like Colombia and
some send the death squads after them
through something or other and that's
what
we're becoming like the equivalent in
our society to social cleansing is in
fact the huge growing prison population
now when this is described then it's
considered to be somehow a kind of an
inexorable process you know the laws of
capitalist economy international economy
or consequence of automation or
something like that something it's kind
of out of control just happens by
natural law I don't think there's any
reason to believe that that's true these
are specific human decisions that are
made in a certain institutional
structure for particular reasons it's
perfectly true that the decisions are
being made because of conditions that
exist that makes it possible for them to
be made but the continuation the the the
continuation of these processes neither
comes from technology or from some you
know uh immutable properties of an
international economy or anything else
they're well under control if we want to
control them so far they are not being
controlled and that's what's so
dangerous the talk about specific cases
as we proceed there's time we'll talk
about things like automation and others
but I think if you look case by case you
see that there's nothing inevitable at
all and what's happening what's
happening is the result of specific is
deliberate and conscious social policy
in who's carrying it out well in a
narrow sense the government is carrying
it out but there are a couple of truisms
that are worth bearing in mind one
truism which was expressed clearly by
the leading 20th century American social
philosopher John Dewey is that politics
is the shadow cast by big business over
Society now that ought to be a truism
that kids learn in fourth grade or
somewhere it's obviously the case and do
we went on to say that make the outgrow
they obvious conclusion that unless you
modify the substance in other words if
you carry out reforms of the shadow the
basic problems or remains worth doing it
but the fundamental problems will remain
it's the substance that has to be
changed that goes all the way back in
American history in fact the founding of
the of the Republic if you go back to
the Constitutional Convention 1787 the
fundamental question that was debated
was to how to reconcile two
irreconcilable things one was the desire
to construct some sort of maybe the most
democratic society in the world the
other hand and the other thing was uh
irreconcilable with that was what were
called the rights of property and James
Madison the main framer of the
Constitution and the major
thinker whose views in fact were
incorporated into the way the
constitutional system was designed made
it very clear in the debates in the
Constitutional Convention that democracy
is not tolerable because it will
undermine the rights of property which
have to prevail the prime responsibility
of government he said is to protect the
minority of the opulent against the
majority and the system has to be
organized so that that's the case in the
words of the president of the
Constitutional Convention the first
Chief Justice the Supreme Court John Jay
the country should be governed by those
who own it period that was his favorite
maxim according his biographer and
that's the way it was designed that
that's the way it stayed and there been
a lot of changes over the last couple
hundred years but those fundamental
principles remain and they are
furthermore recognized if you look at
the sort of elite theories of democracy
right up until the present that's the
principle that on which that is the core
doctrine that has to be preserved in a
democracy if it takes somebody like say
walter Lippmann the one of the leading
twentieth-century American intellectuals
and the sort of Dean of American
journalism who's noted for his what I
call progressive essays on democracy and
a sort of Wilsonian style he said yeah
we have a democracy and in a democracy
the people have rights they have the
right to be spectators
they have a right to be spectators but
not participants the population he said
are ignorant than meddlesome outsiders
they're too stupid and ignorant to take
part in things
since we're democracy we let him watch
what's happening but that's it the
decisions have to be made on the part of
what he called the responsible men and
he didn't add the fact and maybe he was
unwilling to acknowledge the fact that
you become one of the responsible men if
you're willing to serve the substance
that's casting the shadow as do we put
it then you're one of the responsible
men and yeah then the outsiders these
meddlesome outsiders will continue to be
participants and that runs right up till
today
that's the way decisions are made that's
the way they're supposed to be made
there's struggles and variations and
things change and gets better gets worse
but that's pretty much the course of
history not just here but everywhere
with particularity is depending on the
society and the culture this combination
of circumstances that we're now living
in what's considered to be a right-wing
takeover but remember that's speaking of
the power centers the population is
overwhelmingly opposed to it that's
pretty demonstrate but that takeover is
has happened before it's happened
repeatedly before it's always been
temporary every time it's happened it's
been called something like the end of
history and sometimes words virtually
like that and greeted with great you
know pleasure is the kind of utopia of
the masters finally arriving with the
population with the ignorant and
meddlesome Outsiders marginalized and
suppressed and following orders and you
know wealth concentrating in the wealthy
and so on it's never been true in the
past there's no reason why it should be
true today those again are matters of
decision and choice not inexorable
processes well the United States is so
rich and so privileged that even the
most deliberate social policy
would have a pretty hard time turning us
into something like a third-world
country in absolute terms that would
really take efforts and one wouldn't
expect that to happen it's more the
structure of the third-world countries
that we're we're approaching the how
wealthy and privileged the country is is
often not quite recognized and it's
worth bearing in mind just to give one
indication the American colonists in the
18th century had levels of health and
life expectancy that were not matched by
the upper classes in England until early
in this century and they're the next
most privileged group in the world let
alone the general population there are
elsewhere if but the United States ought
to be far ahead of the world in all the
measures that I described in others
infant mortality access to health care
elimination of poverty and malnutrition
and on down the list we ought to be far
ahead because of the enormous privileges
and advantages that we have which are
really unusual in fact as I mentioned
the United States is a near or at the
lowest level in the industrial world and
most of those measures and that gives
you a very clear testimony as to how
well the economic system is working by
rational standards it's a very serious
failure if not perhaps the absolutely
catastrophic failure that you find when
you look at u.s. domains places that
have been under our influence namely at
the parts of the world towards which we
are heading or being driven or properly
and structural with not absolute terms
incidentally these are more truisms
which also ought to be taught in fourth
grade or somewhere and the fact that
they are not perceived at least by the
educated sectors I think they may well
be in some form by the
by the stupid and ignorant majority but
the fact that they're not perceived that
way by the educated sectors and it's
also talked about the enormous success
of the system and that tells you a good
deal about the intellectual culture as
does the fact that the principles on
which the country was founded which I
just Illustrated from a small sample of
a big set as is the fact that those are
not commonly understood emphasized and
at the core of our educational system
well as I said none of this is a big
secret
at least the description of what's
happening it's not a big secret the
reasons for it you can debate and I
think the reasons that are given are
wrong the just to illustrate any days
newspapers are just adding further and
further often dramatic testimony to this
to illustrate both the way it's both the
facts and the way they're skewed a
little but let me just take the last
couple of newspapers that I saw national
newspapers just before I flew out to the
west gun yesterday morning so that means
Friday and Saturday national newspapers
The Wall Street Journal Friday had a
lead story which was about the
congressional actions on on the medical
system on Medicare here I'll discuss
through the headlines of it a series of
headlines and they could comment on each
first headline says unequal treatment
which is accurate second headline says
Medicare bill passed by house would end
a gala terian approach half accurate for
reasons of logic you can't end something
unless it exists okay anything remotely
like an egalitarian approach so it can't
the end but the point is sort of
accurate despite the falsification
that's implicit in it whatever to the
extent that there was anything remotely
resembling
Galit Aryan system which was pretty
remote it's being ended next subheading
the wealthy stand the game absolutely
correct
second the poor may be hurt almost
correct you just have to change made a
will and you have to recognize that poor
is a kind of term of art it means most
of the population that next comes the
other half of that falsification
trade-offs for the middle class
yeah trade-offs for somebody but when
they talk about middle class they're
talk talking about the top few
percentile right under the super-rich
not the people in the middle by any
means then comes the final question
final part of the headline agree is a
question it says is health care a basic
right well that question is not answered
but it's worth looking at is health care
evasive right well here there are
actually two answers one answer is the
factual one in practice in practice of
course it's not treated as a basic right
and it never has been
in fact worse in the United States then
I think any other industrial society
despite our enormous wealth and
privilege and what there was of a right
is now disintegrated or being removed
because these are conscious deliberate
policy is not inevitable ones so at the
level of practice of course it's not a
basic right what about the level of
rhetoric or for that matter even the
level of law well there is a basic right
and you'll recall about your a half ago
or so at the Vienna conference son there
was a conference in Vienna on the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
with a big controversy between people
called Universalists and people called
relativists the Universalists held that
the principles of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights adopted by
the UN unanimously back in 1948 that
those principles are inviolable you
can't distinguish them they're all you
can't just say some of them were not
pursue those were the Universalists then
the relativists were the bad guys who
said you know we weren't gonna follow
some of them we're not gonna follow
others like say China you know it wasn't
gonna follow the principles and say you
have to free elections and things like
that the United States was leading the
defense of the universality of human
rights with great fanfare and pomp and
you know many exalted editorials talking
about our magnificence and standing up
for the universality of the Universal
Declaration against those third-world
relativists who are trying to say that
some of them don't apply well among the
universal human rights listed right up
there along with freedom from torture
and the rest are the right of health
care right along the right to other
social services to security to adequate
food clothing to housing to proper
working conditions all of those are
fundamental human rights guaranteed by
the Universal Declaration rejected only
by relativists of whom where you having
to be in the lead because about half of
the Universal Declaration the United
States just rejects flat-out it's kind
of intriguing that in all of the huge
flow of self congratulatory rhetoric
about this that fact if it was noticed
it was very marginal you'd have to look
very hard to find somebody noticing that
but it's true and at that level yes
healthy access to health care is a
fundamental human right there is no
question about it
in fact the principles of the Universal
Declaration have been upheld in US
courts as binding customary
international law so it's rhetorical and
indeed legal except that's just a joke
the because the people who own the
country and therefore governance the
people who cast the shadow that's called
politics and their institutions just
made the decision that these are not
human rights so the answer to the wall
street journal' question is duel at the
level of practice no health care is not
a basic right and it's getting worse and
worse at the level of rhetoric and
indeed even
oh sure it's a universal unit right and
we are committed to it committed and in
fact full of self praise for our
commitment and our defense of the
universality against all comers but
putting all this together the basic
message of the wall street journal
headline and the story of the fellows is
reasonably accurate the wealth east and
the gain almost everybody else is going
to be harmed what they call a poor the
rhetorical commitments are into the
wastebasket that's the basic headline
and that's what follows as we are driven
by conscious policy toward the kind of
third world model again not because of
any laws of global economics or
automation or end of work or anything
like that but by specific decisions
which can be made this way and indeed
are being made because of contingencies
that make it possible to carry them out
but don't have to be that way well that
was the Wall Street Journal let's move
over to the other major national
newspaper The New York Times headline
and its lead story was public hospitals
facing deep cuts with which are going to
affect primarily teaching programs and
services to the poor which if they're
targeted for elimination are very sharp
reduction in the poorest and most
underserved neighborhoods that navee
talking about New York City the richest
city in the world with the worst
inequality probably of any city in
equality in New York City is on the
level of Guatemala which has is not the
worst in the Western Hemisphere but is
the worst in any country that provides
statistics that's New York City and it's
being cut so when you cut or eliminate
services to the poor there it's a lot of
people and they're going to be hurt very
very badly and it's not just that they
happen to be talking about New York City
but the same is true in many places like
take say Boston where
I live which is a rich city and the you
know big Hospital Center Medical Center
and so on it has one that city hospital
that that serves the general population
the poor Boston City Hospital downtown a
couple of years ago Boston City Hospital
had to establish a malnutrition clinic
because they were for the first time
getting cases of children with
third-world levels of malnutrition they
also started doing some studies of like
a lot of studies to prove what you know
is true but at least to prove it in such
a way that you can publish it in the
Journal of the American Medical
Association so they did studies looking
at the factors that led to the rise and
fall and severe malnutrition among
children and big surprise shortly after
it was correlated with with the average
temperature so as the temperature went
down and Boston that's pretty cold
winters as the temperature went down a
couple of weeks later and malnutrition
went up well no not a big mystery as the
temperatures go down parents have to
make that agonizing decision about
whether to eat home or feed the kids and
that's not an easy decision to make when
you're being pushed to the wall
so yeah you got to keep some heat there
freeze to death
so therefore malnutrition goes up
correlation is very good that's in the
richest most privileged country in the
world conditions like this are unheard
of and most in any remotely comparable
country that's Boston and we can run
through much of the rest of the country
that way the next national newspaper
that I saw the Christian Science Monitor
its lead story is on the tax cut which
it says headline will benefit mainly the
middle of me a bit middle and upper
income Americans again the term middle
is used here in that Orwellian sense in
fact if you look at the deep
it will benefit mainly the extremely
rich and some sect there is a little bit
below them the rest will be harmed and
that's obvious from the provisions that
they then and everybody else reviews so
cuts in the corporate rate cuts in
estate taxes cuts in capital gain taxes
which constitute half of the income of
the top 1% of the population then
falling off very rapidly even see the
top through the top 2% oh that's the New
York Times also reported the tax cuts
and another story in an interesting way
they said it opens by saying that the
Republicans are following through on
their promise to provide relief to
American families first sentence so you
know therefore at least we have to give
him credit for fulfilling their promises
well its readers go on and then get to
say the last paragraph of this story
they will discover that the bipartisan
joint Taxation Committee of Congress
just estimated that the tax relief for
American families
that was promised and here given will in
fact raise taxes for half the American
families guess which has the bottom half
of families will have their taxes raised
by this tax relief for American families
well of course they will greatly benefit
the the people who own the society and
are making the policies the very the
super-rich
there's incidentally a lot of talk these
days about a flat tax and unless there's
a very major reaction to it it will be
enacted it's moving along that
discussion of the flat tax typically may
be always omits a certain interesting
fact mainly the tax is already flat and
it has been flat since the Reagan years
and in fact it wasn't very different
before if you look at the whole range of
taxes it's already flat because we have
a highly regressive tax system
not only does the United States have the
worst level of poverty in the industrial
world but if you look at the effect of
taxes on reducing poverty it has the
worst record so if you ask how much is
the poverty level overcome by the tax
system we're the worst in the industrial
world for that and the reason is that
the tax rate is this is effectively flat
that is highly regressive so if there's
a move toward what they're calling a
flat tax that'll make a very regressive
tax radically regressive and that's
worth bearing in mind it's very much
like what what's called welfare another
one of those are well in terms what's
called welfare is that small component
those transfer payments administered by
the state that happens to go to the who
are part of the population if you look
at the whole range of those transfer
payments which ought to be called
welfare are they overwhelmingly to the
wealthy sectors the more wealthy the
more they get in ways which are often
which go indeed way beyond the
occasional a disgust category of
corporate welfare that's the small part
of it and that is Cajun aliy mentioned
been condemned though never change but
there are other much more crucial ways
in which that happens I'll come back to
it what about the Medicare Medicaid cuts
again somebody's got to pay those costs
some people get sick and let's just
leave them to die somebody's paying for
it so for example say take the elderly
one out of six of the elderly are
suffering from malnutrition it's not as
bad as it is among children but it's
pretty shocking for a wealthy Society
well that's going to get worse because
what kind of public support they get for
medical aid is being cut and everything
else is being cut so it'll be worse so
what happens to them well maybe they're
children with just leaving the starve or
you know send them off to the North Pole
or something maybe
but if they're going to take if
somebody's going to take care of them
it's going to be the families which
means this is in effect another tax and
a very regressive tax highly regressive
tax and another technique for
redistributing income up with upwards so
cuts in Medicare and Medicaid are not
you know saving the medical system or
anything they're just another regressive
tax you know another way to make sure
that the poor subsidize the rich even
more than they do now and that's pretty
obvious when you think it through the
new york times in fact that they had
another story about a tax hike for the
poor but it's not called that this tax
hike for the poor is a 20% increase in
subway and bus fares well that's just a
tax almost directly the people who pay
who ride subways and buses in New York
City who are not the super rich they are
going to pay 20% more which means their
taxes are going up now to be fair it's
also going up to the executives and the
suburbs who ride the commuter rail lines
but less than half of that it's going up
9% for them so another regressive tax
rise in the background are some other
facts not mentioned there that the state
has just cut about 86 million dollars
from the public funding for buses and
subways and it is increased by 12
million dollars the funding for commuter
rail lines the ratio of public subsidy
to those rides is about 10 to 1 in favor
of the rich tend to want ten times as
much subsidy for a commuter rail line
ride as for a subway or bus ride
that's incidentally create common and
public transportation systems that have
been studied around the country these
are all highly regressive taxes mass so
you don't see them as taxes unless you
look a little bit the by and large the
tax measures all of them you know when
you decode them and disentangle them are
simply making already very regressive
system much
worse well let me finish up the last you
know the last Friday Saturday's papers
with my hometown again the Boston Globe
Boston has a conserved moderate
conservative governor William will
considered a moderate Republican he the
preceding week had had a series of
pretty remarkable stories each one a
headline story and the globe about
attacked by governor weld against
children and poor people which are
pretty remarkable in character and you
can tell which gallery he's playing to
the gallery of hate and fear
so one measure was that it was
legislation saying that if a teenage
mother doesn't go to live with her
parents or her husband maybe something
abusive relationship that she's trying
to flee then they're chiller they'll be
cut off welfare meaning her children can
start so you go back to an abusive or
intolerable relationship or your
children starve it's called conservatism
another one said that people will be
kicked out of homeless shelters meaning
their children will be kicked out of
homeless shelters if they don't act the
way the governor decides they better act
for example they gave a couple of cases
and one mother who has a mentally
retarded child took off the day to take
care of the child kick him out of the
homeless shelter you know because that's
not acceptable mentally retarded child
can sleep in the streets this you're a
disabled vet who didn't want to move his
three children into a well-known drug
bin he's kicked out because according to
our value system that's what he's got to
do when he's told it's not to be as any
choice it's not that it's a job or a
home and sport or anything like that
and
welfare recipients have to be
fingerprinted that's because we increase
the surveillance power of the powerful
state that the consulate Conservatives
call for so they really control people
very carefully they rescinded a state
law which barred the social services
from informing the ANS the immigration
naturalization service of evidence that
people might be illegal well that's a
crucial law because otherwise it makes
the social services simply a punitive
system which is working for the
Immigration Service to deport people
including the porting American citizens
because their children are born here so
they're American citizens but they're
going to be deported under the new law
well there's a series of these things
that when day after day but the Saturday
there was a relief the governor shifted
years and this time the lead story was
about new legislation to hand over 1.4
million dollars of public funds to
racetrack owners well meanwhile
eliminating of Pitons that went to a
program to combat to treat the
compulsive gambling compulsive gambling
is of course an addiction it's kind like
heroin or something a very serious one
and very harmful well all of this is
this subsidy the racetrack owners and
the effort to eliminate the tiny program
for treatment of people who are addicted
in very harmful ways to themselves and
their families that's another part of a
much broader program the attempt to
expand the gambling system and the
gambling system is just another tax on
the poor who goes to the racetrack well
you know who goes to the racetrack and
even though why who takes part in state
lottery well you know not people in
governor wells income level
mind for that matter the these are ways
of getting the poor to pay more so they
amount to another tax and so it's not
that the rich noted those in gambling
they do though it's usually not called
gambling it's called things like say
speculation against currencies or
something like that and they don't need
any treatment to stop compulsive
gambling because it's really not a
danger to them if they get in trouble
the nanny state is there to bail them
out so their compulsive gambling is fine
and then they can always go hat in hand
as in the SNL crisis or the Mexico
bailout or whatever if it if something
went wrong that's the point of having a
powerful state that's at the service of
the rich which is the so-called
conservative image and so that way if
any genuine conservatives existed in the
United States they would be appalled
that what has happened to that honorable
term and conception it's been dragged
through the mud beyond recognition
these are reactionary statuses nothing
to do with any recognizable form
conservatism well that's just the latest
news you know what hot off the press
before I left and it indicates with the
very very great clarity where we're
going and I'm sure that the next week
stories will be approximately the same
surely the business press is not at all
and doubt about it and in fact is quite
euphoric about it so here's Business
Week a couple of weeks ago and its main
story it says the Gingrich Congress
represents a milestone for business the
never before have so many goodies been
showered so enthusiastically on
America's entrepreneurs that's true of
course those goodies come from somewhere
they don't like fall down from heaven
and they don't tell you where they come
from right in that story but there is an
indication and a little tiny item hidden
somewhere else in the same issue of
Business Week a little item which is
headlined the hard
u.s. worker and it goes on to describe
how they share I'm quoting at the share
of national income devoted to wages has
reached a new post-war low the decline
for the fifth successive quarter which
is absolutely unprecedented during a
recovery or probably any time the growth
rate under Clinton is in fact
considerably higher than it was under
Reagan which was not high at all by
reasonable spent by modern standards but
while it's going up wages continue to go
down the share of national income
devoted the wage is hitting new lows
every year the median income is going
down work hours are going up benefits
are falling those are the results of the
social policies that I've been talking
about and that people know about well
the headline of all of this stuff is
return to the trenches that's the one
about the goodies being showered on the
American business beyond entrepreneurs
beyond any historical president
therefore return to the trenches meaning
it's not enough the feeding frenzy has
to continue that message is being sent
to the 2020 3000 corporate lobbyists in
Washington that's up from under 700
about 30 years ago which is part of the
one of many indications of the scale of
this enormous escalation in class war
that's been taking place over the last
20 years a measure 700 this 23,000 you
look at corporate lawyers approximately
the same and so on and the TAT of these
lobbyists incidentally who are pressing
for carrying out these programs they're
also being paid for by the taxpayer
their costs or their like advertising
costs take them off as a business
expense meaning the public is paying for
the lobbyists who are working out the
techniques to shift power and wealth
even more radically toward the rich
public is paying for the privilege of
being a
being harmed severely by corporate
lobbying just as the public pays for the
cost of advertising meaningfully being
propagandized which is exactly what
advertising is well what are the what
are they supposed to do when they return
to the trenches
well they explain first they got to make
sure that the sharp cut in capital gains
taxes goes through what's happening
secondly they have to ensure that the
process of lowering decision-making down
to the state level continues one a week
in the federal government so let's have
block grants to the states instead of
federal standards there are conditions
under which that could be a move towards
democracy but not under the under the
certain circumstances in which private
power which is just pure tyranny
unaccountable private tyranny is being
enhanced under those conditions to move
decisions down to the state level is
simply to guarantee that the tower of
private tyrannies will be so awesome in
comparison with the state that they can
make sure that the money that is
technically going the block grants will
find its way into the pockets of the
rich it's much easier to intimidate a
state and play one State against another
than it is the federal government which
is the point of all of this and it will
go into the pockets of the rich by one
or another device tax cuts subsidies tax
increases like the time that are taking
place right now and call it something
else and so on this is a very efficient
way to dismantle what remains of the
hated human rights that are guaranteed
by the universal declaration to which we
proclaim our endless dedication
another thing that gotta go back to the
trenches floor is to ensure that tort
reform goes through that's fancy way of
expediting corporate crime the reasons
for that are pretty clear for example if
you look at the leading corporate
Thunder to the English army whose
lavishing the benefits of the leading
corporate funders Philip Morris which
badly needs
detection from its victims it's one of
the biggest killers around and you want
to make sure that people have no
protection against its depredations and
then across the board the next and in
fact related enterprises deregulation
deregulation also includes eliminating
the ability of people who defend
themselves against corporate crime
there's a front-page story about this in
the New York Times giving some
interesting details of what's expected
deregulation they're talking about
securities industry but it's true of
everything else the deregulation
proposals are there effect and you look
through the details is to make it easier
to defraud people that's the effect of
deregulating the securities industry it
makes it harder for people to defend
themselves against fraud and abuse and
so on the regulations that are being
proposed according to the Congressional
Budget Office will actually double or
triple the burden of bureaucracy so it's
increasing the federal bureaucracy by an
enormous amount there's nothing do with
cutting down the federal bureaucracy
because it's way more fraud cases to
pursue and all sorts of complicated ways
of doing it so their estimate is it'll
either double or triple the bureaucracy
but that's not a problem because these
won't fund the bureaucracy the
Securities and Exchange Commission just
won't get funded so you increase the
capacity for carrying out fraud and
crime you increase the bureaucracy which
has to regulate it and you make sure
that there isn't any funding for them so
they won't do it well it doesn't take a
genius to figure out the consequences of
that and the same is true of the
consequences of other forms of
deregulation so deregulation eliminate
the federal and drug administration and
not long down the road you'll have
another thalidomide crisis can't predict
exactly which one but it'll be one of
those deregulation of environmental
areas well everybody knows what that is
a deregulation could well increase
short-term profit but with very serious
costs costs to the economy and cost to
the general public and surely cost to
future generations well that's that's
the next incidentally while all of this
fuss about the regulation was going on
there was a another little side item the
find out some of the page and some of
the newspaper right in the middle of it
last December Georges Bank was closed
Georges Bank is the richest fishing area
in the world right off Cape Cod in New
England and it had to be closed because
the ground fish were destroyed by
overfishing that's a very recent thing
it's happened in the last 15 years and
the causes are very clear in the early
1980s as part of the Reagan Revolution
the regulation of fishing was basically
eliminated and since these are guys are
conservatives that was combined with
subsidies to the fishing industry so you
transfer public monies into the pockets
of the rich and you eliminate the
regulations and what happens great
surprise they destroyed the fish the
fishing grounds or may have destroyed
them anyway the stock is so low that
nobody really even knows if they can be
recovered a New England is now importing
its Cod from Norway up in Olympia the
other day yesterday somebody told me
that the Pacific Northwest is all is
importing salmon for similar reasons
I don't know that myself but I'm sure
you know well yeah sure that's the
effect of deregulation combined with
subsidy SNL's are actually a very
similar situation well remember we have
a conservative governor in Massachusetts
so as soon as the Georges Bank was shut
down he immediately went to Washington
to get the nanny state to bail us out
bail out the fishing industry why well
he appealed for this to be called a
natural disaster something beyond human
control why was it a natural disaster
well because some kind of predatory fish
which has so far
undiscovered because it's pretty you
know elusive type creature got into the
fishing grounds and wiped out all the
ground fish so therefore it's a natural
disaster so the taxpayer ought to pay
for it like the Mexico bailout and the
SNL's and you know nationalization of
continental Illinois Bank by Reagan and
so on and so forth you get into trouble
there's always the nanny state to bail
you out actually didn't make it that
time but if the conservative revolution
goes on it'll probably make it next time
anyway back to the trenches still a lot
of work to do
the this is all part of the enormous
escalation of class war and the business
press is also exalting about the results
so far which have been quite
extraordinary
so profits are described as dazzling or
spectacular or stupendous Fortune
magazine which every year has an issue
devoted to the Fortune 500 this year was
just euphoric it was the fourth straight
year of double-digit profit growth rate
at about fifty four percent profit
growth for the fortune 500 with
virtually no sales growth that eight
percent and even almost invisible job
growth bent toward three percent and
that's really spectacular and remember
the Fortune 500 now they say control
about two-thirds of the gross domestic
product of the United States that's
bigger than the entire economy of
Germany or the United Kingdom an
addition to that means a big share of
the global economy that's a
concentration of private power
unaccountable private power that is of
totalitarian unaccountable private power
that has I don't know if it has any
counterpart in history but if so not a
lot meanwhile wages as I said are going
down real wages family income is down
for what are called unskilled workers
which is like 70% of the population
there's about a 20 percent decline in
income since around 1980 when this
process really takes off striking
indication of what's going on is the
change in wages for your first job entry
three level wages first job you get when
you enter the workforce that's down
since 1980 30% for males down 18 percent
for females that's a good portent of
what's going to happen of course because
the future depends on entry-level jobs
well that's unskilled laborers late
workers meaning most of the work force
that's been harmed for the college
educated it all started going down
around 1787 but there's a sector that's
nineteen eighty seven sorry wrong
century but in the right year the the
same has been happening to the never
very substantial welfare systems the US
was always low and in in the global in
the industrial world and welfare systems
but they've been going way down in the
last 20 years AFDC which is the big one
that everyone talks about which was
never very big has dropped about almost
close to half between the 70's and 1990
now it's gone that was the big
achievement
but it had fallen very sharply over 20
years that means that another six
million children of average age seven
can learn responsibility because they
won't be trapped by welfare dependency
any further and there are big effects of
this too you know you destroy support
systems you eliminate day care you
forced two parents out to work longer
and longer hours just to keep food on
the table it's not hard to figure out
what the effect of that is there's a
destruction of family life terrible
effects on children you know latchkey
children abuse of children by children
and so on that's actually pretty well
documented there was a UNICEF study big
UNICEF study that came out two years ago
on child care and rich societies usually
they study poor societies the authors
are well-known American economist Sylvia
and Hewlett I have yet to see a review
of it anywhere excepting something I've
written a magazine but what she points
out is that there's two different that
the round nine starting with nineteen
eighty the industrial societies just
split into two different patterns
there's what she calls an there's an
anglo-american model Reagan and Thatcher
carrying the other you know Canada and
Australia and so on somewhat along with
them and there's a European Japanese
model they were all facing the same
problems you know they're all facing the
same global economy but they just pick
different ways of dealing with it the
anglo-american model simply cut support
systems drove people into the workforce
cut down parent-child contact time and
with the effect that it was as she puts
it a disaster for children families the
European Japanese model following facing
the same problems was much more
supportive and the effects are very
different and you measure them by infant
mortality and nutritional rates and
educational level and everything else
well that's pretty dramatic and clear
and to be expected interestingly this
attack on families and children has been
carried out under the rubric of Family
Values and they've gotten away with it
and that's another real testimonial to
the to the educated culture that we live
in well I don't want to exaggerate
business does have its problems and it's
complaining about them so Business Week
again has pointed out that business is
not likely to reach the profit growth
rate over the last quarter of 1994
seventy one percent profit growth that
kind of not likely to hit that one again
very soon so that's kind of sad another
problem is reported in a Businessweek
headline which reads problem now what to
do with all that cash as surging profits
are overflowing the coffers of corporate
America and dividends are booming thanks
in large measure to profits from
overseas operations that's really
meaning you know a export jobs well you
know pretty upset not all peaches and
cream for those guys who social policy
is showering goodies on now the stata
the standard line is you hear it over
and over that these are just lean and
mean times
everybody's got to tighten their belts
you just can't afford those things you
know we're not rich enough to do this we
all got to suffer together that's
complete and total cynicism the country
is just overflowing with capital the
problem is exactly what Businessweek
says it is what to do with all that cash
and the that's the problem now there is
no problem of lean and mean times this
is just class war straight out class war
lean and mean times for you guys but not
for me we're just euphoric about the
profits pouring out of our pockets
well without going further let's put
this in a little bit of perspective
striking fact to bear in mind is there's
nothing new about this it's happened
repeatedly in the past and the ways out
are known from what happened in the past
so go back to say the first world war
right at the time of the first the
United States a very violent labor
history and a very brutal one
incomparably worse than other industrial
societies but by the end of the First
World War there were big labor actions
they were smashed the Wilson
administration instituted the Red Scare
which destroyed unions destroyed the
labor movement pretty much crushed
independent thought and was pretty
brutal affair it was very it was held
across the board by respectable people
and it was thought that a business rule
was established in a way which was
expected to be permanent it was a kind
of utopia of the masters you know the
end of history I thought that's the end
it's not for the first time and not for
the last time crucial aspect of it was
indeed the destruction of the labor
movement in what the leading labor
historian in the United States David
Montgomery of Yale University calls the
fall of the House of labor in a most
undemocratic America speaking of the
1920s
now the undemocratic America is both a
cause and a consequence of the fall of
the House of labor with all
it's flaws the working-class movements
which are grassroots popular movements
reflecting large parts in fact the
majority of the population they have
always been with all their flaws and
everything bad you can say about them a
popular force a made in D major popular
force probably for social justice so
that's a result of the undemocratic
America but also a cause for it
this was 1920s where the automobile boom
you know the big growth of industrial
production during that period there were
virtually no working no rights for
working people
this amazed foreigners even right-wing
foreigners who like the right-wing
British press was appalled by the
treatment of American workers Stratton
visitor commented correctly that in the
1920s that labor organization exists
only at the tolerance of employers and
the working people have no real part in
determining industrial conditions which
is quite unusual and as I say that was
thought to be the end of history
permanent well a couple of years later
there was vigorous and militant popular
mobilization which brought about quite
substantial changes in fact it brought
the United States into the world of the
industrial societies in the 1930s it
compelled Washington to divert some
public resources at least the general
public which is you know what's called
the welfare state well roughly speaking
that with some oscillations that
continued from the 1930s until right
through the Nixon administration during
that period the United States was in
comparative terms more or less within
the industrial world in this regard
now the that move in the mid 30s the New
Deal measures that he listed a very
strong reaction on the part of the
shadow that the substance that casts the
shadow on a part of the business
community which is very class conscious
in the United States you read the
business press around right after the
passage of the wagon
the 1935 it's warning of what it called
the hazard facing industrialists and the
rising political power of the masses and
warned that unless their thinking is
redirected we're going to be heading for
adversity and a big campaign was
undertaken in the late 1930s to fend off
this hazard well the war put it on hold
it was picked up again right after the
war very powerfully a huge
intensification of the propaganda war
the scale of it is pretty astonishing in
fact the first scholarly work on this
just appeared sort of known that it took
place but the scale is really kind of
mind-boggling the and it was very
conscious the leaders of the public
relations industry in the business
community described their problem
they're there they've got three to five
years to save the system to get back
what they want they have to have to wage
the everlasting battle for the minds of
men and indoctrinate people with the
capitalists story
fast and quickly to ensure that
democracy doesn't spread and that the
government will continue its historic
role to protect the minority of the
opulent against the majority very
explicit and it the scale was incredible
so for exactly that everything was
targeted say schools but by the early
1950s about a third of the materials
used in schools were straight business
propaganda universities churches
everything down to recreational
activities and sports leagues were
organized and controlled to be part of
business propaganda there's a capital T
taft-hartley bill in 1948 gave business
the right to propagandize workers in a
captive audience namely in the workplace
that was used very extensively a
business propaganda trade propaganda
films were reaching maybe 20 million
people a week in addition to that the
vast resources of the huge public
relations industry and entertainment
industry were mobilized with very
specific purpose demonized unions in
fact any democratic structure glorify
what was called Americanism and harmony
and you know we're all together and keep
those disruptive elements like union
leaders and activists
our happy lives another part of the
corporate offensive which is having a
big effect right now was developing
what's now called anti politics that is
setting up the government as the enemy
make people don't like what's happening
but make them focus their attention on
the shadow not the substance
so you want to angry about what's going
on blow up a federal building
you know don't blow up a corporate
headquarters look at the shadow not the
substance that's the mood of anti
politics now there's a lot that's wrong
with the government in fact most of that
is traceable to the fact that it is the
shadow cast by big business over Society
but that's not the reason why the
government has hated its hated because
it's potentially democratic because
people can participate in it and do
something about it
well that mood is now very substantial I
need not talk about it the popular the
end of the 1950s it looked like the
corporate offensive at 1:00 there was
again all sorts of you know delight
about the end of ideology and it's all
over utopia the masters and so on
dramatically wrong the 1960s again
changed everything that led to an even
more intense reaction and we're now back
into the nineteen seventies a huge
corporate offensive now abetted by new
factors in the global economy there's no
doubt of that no time to talk about them
have just been informed but they're real
but they're not inevitable they can be
dealt with in all sorts of ways the
population doesn't like it
overwhelmingly over 80% of the
population doesn't even think we have a
democratic system that's a huge amount
who thinks that the government just
doesn't function for the population
works for a few and the special
interests over 80% of the population
thinks that the economic system is
inherently unfair and so it runs case by
case there's a lot of fraud about this
if there were time I would go into it
but there isn't unless you want me to
say something about it well I just want
to stress one thing about all this which
is the most important thing to bear in
mind and that is it has happened
over and over again 200 years ago at the
founding right after the the framework
was established James Madison who did
not like the consequences of what he saw
he had done
remember that design was to protect the
minority the opulent against the
majority and it was designed that way
but his picture is naive belief was that
the minority the opulent who would be
protected against the threat of
democracy would be nice benevolent
gentleman and would use their power to
make sure everyone was happy well he
quickly discovered by the 1790s that
that was not true
and he denounced what he called the
daring depravity of the times as these
rising business classes became the tools
and the tyrants of government bribed by
its largesses and over owing it with
their powers and combinations that is
using its power first of all controlling
it but also benefiting by its power to
transfer resources into their hands
that's a pretty good description of
what's happening now and has happened
pretty much ever since the since that
time since the 1790s there have been all
sorts of oscillations there have been
long periods of popular struggle there
have been plenty of successes it's a
much more civilized country than it was
in many ways there have been defeats now
and then periods when it when the end of
history was very happily proclaimed as
true 100 years ago it was true again in
the 1920s dramatically it was true again
to some extent in the 50s each time
there has been a great joy and applause
for the you know the finality and
perfection of the daring depravity of
our times each time it has been wrong
and it's been wrong each time because
people simply refuse to sit there and
accept the conclusion that this is
inevitable and it's an iron law and you
can't do anything about it some kind of
inverted Marxism of some sort the same
is true today
these are human decisions in human
institutions they can be changed as
have often been changed in the past and
if this time it turns out that the
daring depravity of the times is
permanent we don't have anyone to blame
for that but ourselves
good evening know'm my question is when
you're offered two choices by the same
crowd I'd like to hear you comment on
what I believe is real critical that is
we did have this big conference of the
state's movement and you have the right
come out and say no this is wrong we
want the Constitution and now you have
this Federalist movement being back 200
years ago oh you're right they're right
and now there's this Federalist movement
and they're currently meeting I mean I
think it started yesterday for the next
couple of days it's the same group it's
the same answer can you comment on
what's happening well you know that the
choice between more federalism or more
centralization it doesn't mean anything
in the abstract there are conditions
under which I think devolution you know
lowering decision-making down the local
level for that matter would be very good
thing and eliminating centralized
Authority but there's a very special
condition under which that is a
democratizing element when there's no
private tyranny around if you've got a
king in a feudal system and you
eliminate the only counter to them
you're going to be in trouble
now and that's the truck and the point
is that most of this stuff is just
irrelevant
it's tinkering with formalities while
the same substance keeps throwing the
shadow that is politics well in that
case there happens to be among all the
institutions one around which could to
some extent in fact confront private
tyranny and is at least in principle and
sometimes indeed in practice susceptible
to public pressure that's the federal
government under those conditions of
highly undemocratic
organization it's very dangerous to
eliminate federal power I mean like you
know I personally I'm just I see that
dilemma for myself because I'm against
centralized power in principle and in
favor of it in these circumstances
because the only way to protect people
against even worsse centralized power
and unless that issues face we're
basically talking irrelevance ease
doesn't matter what kind of a formal
arrangement you make
is there another mic yeah yes I was
wondering if you could speak to the
issue of racial polarization which
appears to be a growing issue in this
country and specifically more recently
the issue of the Million Man March which
also created further polarization and
what what you think that means and
what's going on around that well you
know if the Million Man March
contributes further polarization that's
our fault not the fault of the people
who took part in the Million Man March
there's actually no reason why
privileged white people like most of us
are should regard that as contributing
to polarization that's a form of popular
mobilization it's fine thing whether it
works
so you know again it's like these are
matters of decision in action they're
not matters of what it is if it's like
something we're observing on Mars as to
the racial polarization you know it's
you know it I mean the other things that
are very similar to the take say the
growing fear and hatred of Jews and
Germany Jews and gypsies in Germany back
in the late 1930s that was a pretty
frightening thing and it led to some
pretty ugly consequences and it had its
sources its sources were in part in
genuine fears and concerns of a large
part of the population which were being
misplaced to a away from real enemies -
enemies that are easy to hate and blame
with consequences that we have seen and
that happens over and over again in the
United States there happens to be a
rather close you know not perfect but
close race class correlation and the
it's it so it's much easier to hate the
guy next to you and say he's taking it
away from me then to look at the real
power that's not just true of blacks and
whites so you go back a hundred years
the working class was very racist but
directed against Huns mean like Slovaks
and Hungarians and people from Eastern
Europe who were coming to these you know
anglo-saxon and nice German areas and
taking away their jobs and that racism
was severe as bad as
white black races and it was overcoming
the course of common struggle so for
example when you get to the Homestead
Strike you find that people cooperate it
and work together same thing happened in
the formation of the CIO and then 1930s
black and white people were working
together they had a common struggle a
constructive goal so who the real enemy
was and they were working together to
overcoming if you don't have those
options people will turn will attack
each other they'll find the fraudulent
objects of hatred and fear and anger and
they'll be easily manipulated to do so
displacing the real concerns and
struggles that they ought to be carrying
out against vulnerable victims next door
that's a great easy things for
demagogues to organize and there's a
popular you know this there's a ample
terrain in which they could work but
again you know we know what this has
been like in the past we know the
reasons for it and you know how to
combat it and when you spoke in your
lecture earlier about corporate
propaganda which was used in textbooks
in schools and recreational activities
for children and also the film's
propaganda films could you be a little
bit more specific about that well if you
want some details about it there is a
good study out now just a couple months
ago it's by a woman named Elizabeth
phones Wolfe
it's called selling free enterprise it's
a scholarly study with a lot of
footnotes and stuff published by
University of Illinois press who gives
lots and lots of details but the fact is
the actual text materials and schools
the things that kids read you know and
studied and the text books about a third
of them were pure business propaganda
written by the public relations industry
in order to create a certain type of
person and and this and
and the same is true of advertising of
business propaganda and indeed of films
so let's take one of the most famous
films of the year which at least people
of my age all saw on the waterfront with
Marlon Brando big you know huge
spectacular success what was the theme
of on the waterfront those of you I
suppose the number of I don't know maybe
it's a different generation or something
but anyway in those days huge film no
big Hollywood success the theme of on
the waterfront was here's this you know
these working people out on the dock
somewhere and they're being exploited
and you know terrorized by these
criminal union leaders and everybody's
afraid to do anything about it and
finally one of them the hero of marlon
brando you know gets it he's gonna fight
back and good independent american type
not gonna be pushed around and despite
all the powers of the union and so on he
finally stands up at the end and throws
the union boss into the water and
everybody cheers and everybody's happy
in other words the images the union
organizers the enemy of the working man
who's the friend of the working man well
you know the hard-working executive
who's toiling 16 hours a day for the
benefit of everyone and the you know the
banker who's trying to figure out a way
to give you money so you can buy your
house and so on we're all one big happy
family
you know we're in harmony and
togetherness and Americanism and so on
and then these intruders come in trying
to destroy our happy lives like by
organizing people and so on and you know
finally
Brando gets up and kicks them in the
face well like any propaganda no matter
how grotesque including Nazi propaganda
it is usually some level of realism
behind it you can't create effective
propaganda out of zero so there's
something there like there was a Jewish
storekeeper charging too much money once
you know there's usually something there
and there's something here to the their
work plan display corruption in the
union's I mean not a fraction of what
there is in the private corporations but
plenty so there's something there and
you make enough of a fuss about it
people see it because it's real you know
you can find it on the waterfront you
can find anywhere else but when that
becomes the theme and you know it's put
into this framework it just becomes part
of a big propaganda system designed to
make you subordinate yourself to private
power now all of this stuff is going
going on in everything from cartoons to
comic strips to televisions to textbooks
and so on and so forth well the real
structure of the society is being simply
hidden like you don't read in your
school books that the huge resources of
the enormous public relations industry
are dedicated to fighting the
everlasting battle of the minds of for
the minds of men and indoctrinating
people with a capitalist story so they
won't give us any trouble because we
have to protect the Goodman minority of
the opulent against the majority and
that all would be taught in elementary
school in a free in a free society but I
doubt that many people have heard that
in elementary school although it's all
you know great the core of our society
now the the goal of all of this stuff is
to subdue people to isolate them to make
them just atoms of obedient consumption
you know you sort of glued to the tube
it tells you what you want you don't
want it but you figure you better want
it or you know you work some somebody
else so you work hard and you don't ask
any questions
and you do what they tell you because
you need that stuff
they tell you one and you never talk to
anyone else because you know they're
down the street and people don't get
together you do theater for yourself and
so on and so forth I mean y-you believe
that we have a free market you for
example you believe that it's that the
Republic let's take a concrete case that
the Republican Congress is cutting the
budget that's not true
they're cutting part of the budget in
fact they're cutting the part that
people want so they're cutting and if
you take a look at the things they're
cutting the population is overwhelmingly
in favor of keeping them now it does
happen that the population is
overwhelmingly in favor of cutting one
thing depending on budget and that's
going up and that's the state security
system so prison systems going up the
security systems the state are going up
the public's opposed to it that's the
one thing that's growing up and there's
a very simple reason for that the the
security system is going up because you
have to have a technique of social
cleansing which I get rid of people who
are in your way the pentagon is going up
because that's what pours money into the
pockets of rich people a perfect example
is Newt Gingrich who's the biggest
welfare freak in the country he gets
more federal subsidies for his super
rich suburban district Cobb County than
any suburban county in the country with
the exception of the federal system
itself No
well you know it's huge welfare freak
how does he get it you know he gets it
through the Pentagon system yeah he gets
in the same way I get my salary one of
the truth MIT where I teach is part of
the funnel by which the public pays the
costs of the research and development
costs for high technology industry and
the profits then go into somebody's
pocket well you know MIT is small
potatoes but Lockheed Martin is not
small potatoes nor is Boeing or is the
computer in or as IBM and so or
Microsoft or any of them and they feed
off at the public trough and there's no
entrepreneurial
in Cobb County Georgia where Newt
Gingrich's from there's just welfare
dependency extraordinary welfare
dependency fueled through the Pentagon
so therefore even though the Cold War is
over and you know we don't want to have
to defend ourselves from the Russian
hordes not only does the Pentagon budget
stay about the same but it's in fact
going up and it's the Heritage
Foundation that says it's going up for
exactly the reasons that the business
community is always understood namely as
you can read in the public business
press back in the late 1940s Fortune
Businessweek and so on high-tech
industry cannot survive in a competitive
unsubsidized free enterprise economy and
the government must be the savior and as
the secretary the Air Force put in under
Truman the word to talk is not subsidy
the word to talk is security that'll
scare people into giving us the subsidy
to keep private profit increasing now
maybe it's a good thing to fund
high-technology ok that's in a
democratic society that's nothing people
would decide but since there's great
fear of a Democratic Society what you
have to do is scare people into paying
for it and not telling them you're doing
so in all to talk about welfare even to
talk about corporate welfare which is
rare but there nobody is talking about
the biggest part of the corporate
welfare system namely the whole Pentagon
system including NASA and the Department
of Energy and so on which is just a huge
transfer system of payments from the
general public to the pockets of the
rich and that's very crucial for the
whole society like you wouldn't have
computers and the internet and lasers on
airplanes or anything else including
pharmaceuticals and the rest of it if
you didn't have these systems by which
the public pays the cost and the profits
go into private pockets well you know
that's is not what the public relations
industry is telling you well you don't
see that in the television of sitcoms
every day and you don't read it in the
school texts that they're designing in
fact you don't even study in the
universities and you certainly don't
read it in the newspapers well ok that's
what a good doctrinal system is like
it's
you go on and on you know if it was take
a turn on the tube and pick up
tomorrow's paper you pick up your
children schoolbooks you'll find plenty
of examples you spoke of America's
violent labor history past I am familiar
with but I haven't been able to find
much information on an incident in
Colorado and around 1910 1915 Ludlow and
there when the National Guard was called
out and American citizens were killed
it's all in all the labor histories okay
I mean you can find an informal
description of in Howard Zinn's very
valuable people's history but you'll
find in any of the standard labor
history I just bought that last night so
yeah it's discussed in there okay
actually if you want some data on the
violence of American labor history there
is a good book on that specific topic
it's by Patricia Kay sexed and it's
called the war against labor or
something
anybody remember couple came out a
couple of years ago it's just a
scholarly study which points out that
the dramatic distinction between
American labor history and European
labor history in fact if I remember her
numbers during the early years of this
century I think about 700 American
workers were killed by the security
forces killed by them at a time when
almost nobody was killed in Europe even
in right wing countries and in fact as I
say the European press was appalled
right-wing press London Times you know I
don't think most Americans today are
aware of that that went on into the late
30s after as late as the late 1930s
security forces were still murdering
strikers and that was just unknown and
Europe think it's still largely today
well you know now they usually don't go
murdering strikers but there are
individual cases but this was a lot and
it's different it's you know that was
true up till the late 30s I don't think
since then the second part I find I
admire you greatly because you say a lot
of things you confirm a lot of things
that I have had vague intuitions about
myself and one thing in particular that
strikes me is how many people also tend
to feel the way but nothing
happening nothing is changing what are
you there seems to be a vacuum of
leadership what do you think it's not a
vacuum of leadership it's a vacuum of
activism leadership comes along once you
start doing something once you start
doing something somebody will come along
and say I'm your leader you know what
and then if you're smart you'll say no
you're not you know that's where
leadership comes from so for example if
you go back to the 1920s or the late
1950s for that matter it looked pretty
much certainly in the 1920s just like it
does now and it's not that leaders came
along and did something it's that people
did something and they can do it now
just like they could do it then I'm just
like they've done it all through history
you know okay I'm sorry I was distracted
I was hoping to get some specific ideas
on what wouldn't organize I mean voting
is not enough it isn't no voting is just
as if is picking you know one or another
aspect of the shadow' may be useful or
may not be useful there's nothing not to
do it if you ask what you can do the
answer is you as an individual can do
basically nothing but you as part of a
group can do a lot so the first thing
you do is find out what you're concerned
with there are a lot of things to be
concerned with in the world find out
which ones there are find out who's
working on them join them and help them
and bring in other people to do it and
find out more about things figure out
other problems you ought to be worried
about you know that's the way you can
change things that's exactly the way
they've been changed forever and they
can the same you know brilliant
technique will work now and if there's
another one nobody's ever figured it out
in the last couple of thousand years
yeah you refer repeatedly to private
power but I have a quibble with that it
seems to me that corporations I always
say well we're after all do these
corporate charters come from that's
right haven't in fact these corporations
been I mean at least since the East
India Company agencies of state
administration that's right this private
power is totally illegitimate it's
granted by people like you and me
through state charters and it can be
revoked now in fact up until
late 18th 19th century up until around
100 years ago charters were revoked not
you know it's frequent in the early part
of the century it was sparse toward the
end of the century but that power was
still being used it's only in this
century that corporations have have won
for themselves the authority mostly
through the courts not through
legislation so not a little legislation
about it they have won the they have
instilled into people's minds the idea
that they are permanent parts of the
landscape with extraordinary powers in
fact the powers of the powers of
immortal persons even with things like
freedom of speech that don't belong to
institutions at all you know those are
powers that they managed to gain for
themselves just through force
essentially and what you say is exactly
right there's an they're not there in
law yeah you can get together and revoke
the charter of a corporation and take it
over and make it up make it
democratically controlled in theory try
to do it if part of that is that I for
instance the nonprofit corporations one
reads about the heavy investments of say
you name it churches MIT universities
are and retirement funds are heavily
invested and they don't want to see
those private corporations go down
either because that's their reason well
I'll see if they invest but remember the
individuals who are let's say part of a
pension plan or something they have no
say in any of this it's true that
formally speaking if you're part of a
pension plan you're a you know 0.000
something owner of General Motors but
that tiny little fraction of your
ownership is totally zero because the
pension plan happens to be administered
by you know a big investment firm or
something and it's managers and you
don't even know what the money is you
know so yeah there are all sorts I mean
there are all sorts of arrangements made
that's part of the genius of the system
to ensure that this remains private
power although not because of you know
not because there's some foundation and
economic necessity or for that matter
even in law just by institutional power
and structure and the fact that people
believe it this isn't
point you know because I'm David Hume
200 years ago and his foundations of the
prince and his principles of government
he had he's a conservative you know Tory
he asked the question how come
anybody obeys power you know he says
power is always in the hands of the
people who are governed not in the hands
of the rulers so how come it ever works
you know why doesn't everybody just rise
up and overthrow it yes well he said it
must be that in the most tyrannical or
the most free societies the way it works
is by control of opinion if you can make
people believe it's got to be this way
and there are no alternatives and not
perceive it and so on okay then you want
that's more or less accurate if you
don't believe it anymore it's gone no I
mean these are not you know it's not
like the way the planets go around the
Sun or something these are not laws of
nature these are institutional
structures which exist as long as people
submit themselves to them and that's
true of anywhere I'm it's true of
abusive family relationships
if a woman submits herself to it it
exists if she doesn't it can stop first
you have to recognize that it exists
which is not so easy the same is true of
slavery you know the same is true of and
the same is true of private tyranny and
of everything else no their structures
have took their totalitarian private
structures that happen to have a state
authorization which could eliminate them
if people were to use it and in fact
people could eliminate them even if they
didn't have a state charter suppose they
didn't have a state charter so eliminate
well there's a formal technique of doing
it by revocation of charter and there's
a much more significant way of doing it
by simply taking over the
decision-making capacity but in that if
you look at the way they're functioning
they happen to be private tyrannies and
as long as people are it's like claiming
look there really isn't any slavery
because the slaves could go somewhere
else and it's just the government no
it's not just the government it's a
whole system of institutions which
include all sorts of devices to force
the slaves to submit including doctrinal
device
and that's true here too dramatically
the formal fact that there happened to
be state charters is correct but
irrelevant as long as people don't do
anything about and if they don't it's
private power so I think the word is
right and I'll continue to use it thank
you Oh we're live okay good I had one
question which is good and I'm concerned
about Social Security and Medicare and
Medicaid cuts I think that's kind of a
new addition to this the cycle that
you're talking about a lot and I think a
lot of people in this room according to
studies by the time we reach your age
aren't going to have anything and if
they if we do it's going to be I'm sorry
I didn't understand why won't you have
anything because with the baby boomers
getting a little I mean that's if you'll
have something if the economy grows
Social Security is paid out of current
income not out of past income if the
economy keeps growing at a reasonable
rate there's no reason why people
shouldn't have social security and
medical care and so and this is just
scary nonsense so it's I just according
the studies I've read current income is
yeah projections of this and that you
can prove anything but the point is if
the economy sufficiently grows you know
and there's a way to make the economy
grow namely by public spending the way
the economy grows is by having an
educated trained skilled healthy
population with appropriate
infrastructure and so on and so forth
that's the kind of spending that makes
economies grow so we don't need any cuts
the there are problems like for example
medical payments are way out of sight
but that's because we have an
inefficient medical system
if you had an efficient medical system
you know Medicare Medicare and Medicaid
have been going up while other welfare
is going down but the reason for that is
because the medical system is hopelessly
inefficient and the reason for that is
it's privatized so it has layer after
like when you pay a but your doctor bill
you're paying for profits for
advertising for administration for
bureaucracy for paperwork
those are huge costs and you just don't
have them in efficient systems like
national health care systems of a
reasonable sort so sure if you have a
highly inefficient bureaucratized system
costs are going to be out of sight but
the way to get rid of that is to make an
efficient system that gives health care
to people not profit not profits to
people I mean I don't want to make the
question sound trivial like there are
questions to ask about the nuts and
bolts of all of these things but I've
never seen any evidence there's any
qualitative problem you know there are
sort of technical problems about how to
deal with this that and the other thing
and mostly they're met by economic
growth and in fact the current spending
cuts are cutting economic growth so they
are in fact exactly what is harming the
potential for the future you don't have
if you cut what the economists call
human capital costs you know getting
healthy educated skilled people in a
livable environment you know and so on
and so for the assure you'll cut
economic growth and then there'll be a
problem I'm concerned with the the law
of nature as it relates to each
individual human and and it seems that
the growth of business is concerned with
the the ever-increasing bottom line so
Dostoevsky said that one sacred memory
from childhood is perhaps the best
education that what the one sacred
memory from childhood is perhaps the
best education and and it seems that the
sacred memories from for our children
are coming straight from the Simpsons or
the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and and
there's no effort to to bring
the law of nature is or could be like
through nature like through a visit to
Glacier National Park er you know
children grow up in a concrete society
and there's no effort to bring to bring
to them any any sort of balance and and
I hear a lot of economic talk and I hear
a lot of number crunching yet I still
don't see any effort to to D economize
our children's minds to be able to see
it well I don't know what I mean let's
take the question of letting your
children live with nature and there's a
way to do that that's to be rich and
live in the suburbs then you're like oh
then your children live with nature is
this another way and that is half public
parks and there's a way to do that
instead of having 54 percent profit
growth for the fortune 500 and having
the problem being what to do with all
that cash and the corporate coffers you
redesign society so that doesn't work
like that and though and the ample
resources that are available or used to
make public parks available to children
is to D kaanum eyes like to get kids out
of the TV mentality out of the TV men
yes out of the television mentality
which is basically the socialization
structure of today's children or or to
is this you can't just get people out of
the socialization structure you have to
construct the alternatives for them yeah
well that's what I'm saying it's like my
kids my kids never watch television I
mean they watch their life a little bit
this wasn't part of their culture and
then you encourage them not to but they
don't learn well look why should the
schools train people to be free and
independent and creative people are
going to challenge authority and so on I
mean they will if we make the schools
that way but it's kind of like what the
man before you said about corporations I
mean in principle we can make the
schools free Liberatore and so on and so
forth there under our control but you
got to do it okay thank you
okay great I just first of all thank you
very much for the work that you've done
I really appreciate it as a sociologist
and I've just sometimes find myself
enraged to the point of paralyzation by
some of the things I hear you say for
one thing you know to hear you speak of
the fortune 500 who are responsible for
two-thirds of the gross national product
and in the same well and in the same in
the same speech be able to speak about
the children that come to the hospital
in Boston with distended bellies from
malnutrition now I work in a field where
I work with abused children down in
Eugene and I work for Oregon social
learning center and I work with children
who are literally screwed by their
parents beaten by their brothers
molested tormented and really horribly
you know treated badly badly by their
parents and their families and so my
field of study is going to be going into
assisting children that are from the
very families of which you speak you
know do I heat the house do I feed the
child or am I going to stay with this
man who threatens me with a gun daily in
order to stay in the home so I don't
have to go to the homeless shelter where
my child will inevitably be safer even
amongst strangers now you know I was
going to ask you what you thought I
should do because I don't know really
after hearing you speak and having all
these things that you say you give me
this wealth knowledge this wellspring of
information and it's very difficult at
times to come to a point where I can
actually encompass one point as opposed
to this broad spectrum of things that I
think I possibly could do you know and I
mean everything you say is exactly right
and as a human being working with
particular very serious problems you've
got a narrow scope of choices like in
the framework that you've described
you're not giving yourself the choice of
changing the social structure so that
those conditions don't arise but on but
that's the answer short of that you can
put a band-aid on a sore and you do it
in the best possible way Gordon I said I
didn't
want you to just be like my guide and no
I mean look you know I don't have
anything to say that is not this
I mean it's everyone is facing even you
are facing the problem because you're
working really hard you know important
things but everyone faces in some
respect if you accept if the so if the
structure of the system remains
unchanged certain things will happen and
you can try to adjust around the corners
to make it less harsh for people and you
should it's important to do it crucially
like you can help one child you know
that's a tremendous contribution but
meanwhile the system will stay like it
is and the next kid will come along
so while trying to help that one child
which is a marvelous thing to do and if
only more people would do it we'd have a
better world apart from that you want to
change the system so it doesn't keep
happening and that nobody can do alone
that you can do by being parts of
organizations of people who are
dedicated to that that's the way social
change comes about I mean you know take
anything you like take a look in the
1930s American workers did finally get
the rights they had in most of Europe
Wow
not by people sitting alone and you know
no television then but listening the
radio they did it by all the struggles
that it took to build functioning labor
organizations and other popular
organization which finally rammed
through the programs that they wanted
what why'd why does Canada now maybe not
for long but now have a more or less
efficiently relatively efficiently
functioning medical program as compared
with us well a large part of the reason
is they had a functioning labor movement
up until around the 1960s their system
was very much like ours then it changed
it changed largely because of no not
huge phenomenon an organized labor
movement a kind of a populist based
party which had a labor component which
pushed through a reasonable provincial
health system which was then duplicated
elsewhere and succeeded these are small
changes but with big effects on people's
lives and and you cannot do those things
alone thank you
okay sorry sorry folks but we can only
take up so much of Professor Chomsky's
evening so that's going to have to be
the end of it four nights professor
Chomsky thank you
[Applause]
in a sense you don't really run out of
oil you change the costs okay uh yeah
and or maybe you just use more expensive
oil or maybe you shouldn't be using oil
we want to know we're running out of
trees here and the reason is we have
driven that country down to such a level
of poverty that people can't survive
unless they go up into the hills and cut
the trees so the rivers are dying and
the lakes are dying and so on and maybe
in a couple of days we'll be
uninhabitable but that's not because
there's too much use of tree that's
because of actions and decisions that
were made in between a big port yeah
there's just too many people in this
micro that there's too many six three
you know zillion no but first of all it
doesn't work like that so they say Italy
you know accused of a huge population
growth it's no not it's not the act the
absolute population is declining and it
usually reflects these factors it
reflects the opportunities for women to
control their lives in a reasonable
fashion which means education and
opportunities and you know breaking down
our Therrien relations and so on and
that means that population birth is
under social control kind of critical
mass where they're doing so many
disfranchise or marginalized people that
this question I mean you can't predict
tomorrow's weather you know you can't
certainly you know something as
complicated as a human society but the
point is it's not the kind of thing
you've got you care to predict one way
or another about what you do given you
see negative tendencies and try to stop
them whether they're sustainable or not
sustainable thank you but you know the
answer the question is nobody knows here
so people can see there are many
questions but I was struck by your
response to many people upstairs when it
came to the issue what we need to do to
change and I feel that there is a
leadership vacuum and I know that you're
saying that there is an activist vacuum
the problem is we don't have we don't
seem to have like a galvanizing body
[Music]
wonderful point direction and really
become the expressive voice where people
feel belonging to and what I felt was
missing when you said just go do
something because we all act we all like
that everybody here is involved in the
community in one way or another but why
aren't we really picking up the pieces
and do excuse me doing change don't you
think we do need some sort of the
quality or a leadership type of well
there is a balance between the activism
and if maybe a party would be a good
idea like I mentioned the NDP in Canada
but which was I didn't do anything
different when it was an office from
anyone else but it was a popular based
party which brought together working
people and then the people
by our mental interests and feminists
and by anybody and it was a kind of like
a cover for them and it meant that
actions could be for the public benefit
so for example takes a health care
unions in the United States better
unions in the United States didn't get
pretty good health care benefits for
their members
so like the UAW got pretty good health
care benefits for auto workers but not
for the general population and the
reason is that these were you know that
the society here is sufficiently
atomized so that even organized groups
worked themselves on to the public in
Canada when the same labor unions worked
for health care they did it for the
public and they did it in fact through a
party but where that party come from
they did come because of his leadership
no it came because people decided to get
together and organize and once you get
together and you work to organize it
yeah leaders will come along and if
you're serious you won't want to get too
much power I just you know it would be
nice if there was some other where would
a galvanizing vision come from well from
the people who are working for things
where did a galvanizing vision come from
for the civil rights movement company
leaders no it did not come from leaders
it came from kids work Freedom Riders
and snake workers and it's out there
every day and out of that came a vision
which later somebody came along and
could articulate and that's the way
everything works
I'm aware devastates Palestinian society
where the Intifada come from well it
came from the people but there was also
a balance between an organized form as
there was a reservist form it wasn't if
he at all but nobody wasn't you know
that I mean I don't you were in where
were you at that time I was here today
okay well you know if you were over
there you see it was not coming
I went through whispering no no it
wasn't coming from defeated to do that's
right me too
that's what it was yeah it was coming
out of you know hole and in a sense it
came out of the pea low because Theo had
been responsible kind of inadvertently
for the development of the network of
organizations of various kinds it was
partially responsible for that and out
of those organizations yeah it came sort
of you know nothing is fun he's alleged
to put oppression there was a
progression and I agree with you we
survive from the leadership which was in
that particular case no yeah okay but I
think that case is typical hmm you know
has its own particularity in every case
is different for every other yes but I
think that it's mostly like that mm-hm
visions come from people who think
through the problems ahead of them and
work together with other problems to get
people to get their vision and from
gains and achievements and failures and
learning from the failures and so on as
far as I know that's been true of
everything so you know it's there'll be
plenty if you have a effective enough
campaign and program and achievements
and so on there'll be plenty of people
to come by and say I'm the leader
they're happy to do that
making one of the very few predictions
that has never been proven valid in the
social sciences as far as I know it
ought to be study just for this reason
alone is a analysis by but conan back
around not forget win
the middle of the 19th century when he
predicted that the there was a kind of a
rising a new class he called it a new
class in fact of intellectuals who are
different than you know the old priests
and so on and they were just part of
developing industrial society and he
predicted that the new class of more or
less professional intellectuals would by
and large break up into two categories
there would be one category who he
called the writ bureaucracy as long
before he was talking about early Marx
waited for Lenin they would be the red
bureaucracy and they would you they
would exploit popular struggles to take
power in the name of the people after
which they would construct the most
brutal and repressive systems and human
history of all in the name of the people
that's one thing he said there'll be
another path of same kind of people
maybe the same ideals will just have a
different analysis of the situation and
see the power actually lies and what we
would nowadays call state capitalist
institutions I call it that and they
would recognize that the way to gain
power is to work for them and beat the
people with the people's stick put it in
what are called democracies but being
basically the Thomas artists for the
groups of power well that's the liberal
intellectuals or you know something like
that that prediction and that prediction
came out rather crew and I think we see
it every day and the ease of transition
from one category to another you see
yeah I mean I think that the United
States is in a very strange state at the
moment and it's always been a kind of an
odd Society always but right now it's in
Madhuri's I mean the the proliferation
of fanatic calls is extraordinary
and it's on any topic you want I mean I
know perfectly well I could get it I
could come to any city in the country
and give it talk and a lot of people
that come out now which I tell them look
the real thing that's going on is that
you know Bill Clinton is a vampire told
that forces from Mars and he's sucking
the blood of children then that's why
everything can go on and on and that's
why everything's wrong and probably
people would stand up but you know the
point is people are so dish you know are
the societies kind of dissolved social
bonds of collapse people are people are
enjoying bowling leagues when you get
that a state in which over 80% of the
population thinks it's just no
functioning political system and you
know cynicism about institutions keeps
going up and you hate everybody you're
afraid of everybody and you're alone and
so on you know people react in some
fashion
they don't just sit there in no fashion
and one of the ways in which people
react in such circumstances is by
millenarian cults and exercise craze
Felicia
religious fanaticism and so on and so
forth that's very typical of devastated
societies you know like was kind of true
of Europe after the Black Plague or the
devastated peasant society actually
something similar is going on in the
Islamic world
so like anymore but you know as could
they better me what why is Hamas getting
power in in you know in the Palestinian
areas
well secular nationalism collapse in
part the PLO and part through its own
corruption and dishonesty but in part
just because of the powers that were
used to demolish of which the United
States was the strongest well you know
when secular nationalism secular
nationalist options collapsed or
destroyed people just don't say okay I
commit suicide they turn to something
else and one of the other things they
rather typically turn to us is religious
fundamentalism which offers people
things and in fact often even offers
them services
you know like honest not corrupt social
services combined with fanatic messages
and you know a vision of the future that
they can hopefully now the United States
is probably the most fundamentalist
country in the world or certainly close
to it I suspect if you actually did a
study it's probably more than Iran and I
think it's partly a reflection of the
dissolution of social bonds and the
conception of constructive alternatives
and it's a very frightening
no doubt about it you know those those
institutions that were all so cynical
I don't appear to push the line and let
people look these people then we went to
building closest at ten that's ten
o'clock I'm terribly sorry for the folks
in mind
