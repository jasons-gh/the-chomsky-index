the US military industry is just high
tech industry
I mean military industry is
indistinguishable from the general high
tech industry the military the
military's kind of cover for the state
sector of the economy I mean like at MIT
where I am everybody knows this except
the economists and everybody else knows
it cuz pays their salaries you know so
the money comes in to places like MIT
under military contracts to produce the
next generation of you know the high
tech economy you know they take a look
at what's called a new economy you know
computers internet that's driven yeah
it'll come straight out of places like
MIT D under federal contracts for
research and development under the cover
of military production and then it gets
handed over to IBM when you can sell
something so like my wife for example in
the 1950s was a program or a military
lab at MIT which Lincoln laboratories I
was supposed to be top secret and
everything except everybody knew exactly
what was going on just so totally open
and people flowing up I was in the
electronics lab at MIT and under 100%
military contracts also and every it was
perfectly clear they were working on
what they called an air defense system
so she was programming for an air
defense system was a total joke no I
mean everybody knew we couldn't defend
anyone against a first world war
bomber piloted by snow beater or
something like that and besides nobody
cared about bombers anymore cuz they
were going on to intercontinental
missiles but it what they were actually
doing was changing it was developing
computers and in those days in the 1950s
a computer would have filled a single
computer this entire building with
vacuum tubes blowing up all the time and
papers are going all over the place
you know it's just unwieldy and by the
end of the decade around 1960 they had
succeeded in reducing a computer to a
mainframe
like you know half the size of this room
at that point you could start selling
them so the head of the project that
pulled off and founded the first
mainframe front deck meanwhile IBM had
been ripping off the research at MIT and
Harvard on government contracts and they
were kind of figuring out how to make
smaller computer - - and then they went
on through the early 90s developing
computers under government contract for
the Pentagon or the National Security
Administration and so on and finally
they got to the point where they could
sell them and then you you know you have
computers same with the Internet 30
years it was in the government system
they started at places like MIT and the
same with everything else you go across
the board now if you take a look at MIT
now Graham the around surrounding area
used to have small electronics firms now
it has small biotech firms the reason is
because the next cutting edge of the
economy is going to be biology based so
funding from the government for biology
based research is vastly increasing and
if you want to have a small startup
company that will make a huge amount of
money and somebody buys it someday you
do it in genetic engineering or
biotechnology and so on and ultimately
it'll make profits for somebody and
that's military industry so yes military
industry wants it but so does industry
because it's the same thing you know
they're just one component of it in fact
there's almost no element of the economy
it doesn't work like this that's and
that's why in fact it goes right through
history you know that's yeah it's
usually dynamic state sector that gets
economy is going so military industry
wants it and not only for this reason
but you know they want one of the
reasons they want to control the oil but
they don't want access to the oil that's
a mistake it's kind of commonly
discussed but the u.s. didn't care about
access to the oil they expect to use
Atlantic Basin sources which are much
more
you know like West Africa Venezuela and
so on but they want to control it and
you control it because it first of all
the profits flow back and and they flow
in a lot of ways I mean it's not just
oil company profits it's also military
sales so the biggest purchaser of arms
of us arms at least probably British I
mean yearly it's either Saudi Arabia or
the United Arab Emirates that's one of
the rich oil producers they they draw
most of the arms and that's profits for
high-tech industry in Britain in the
United States and they are just money
goes right back to the US Treasury and
Treasury securities in various ways this
helps prop up the primarily British and
US economies and Britain it was
traumatic I mean in Britain I don't know
if you ever looked at the records but
probably have but in 1958 when Iraq
broke the anglo-american condominium oil
production they pulled out of the system
Britain went totally crazy
I mean selendroid it was in foreign
secretary flew to Washington and these
are out and both the British and
American records and they just you know
discussed what to do to prevent I said
witta that time maybe still were very
reliant on quaity profit the quaity
Investment Corporation was in London
under British control and Britain was
getting you needed the petrol dollars
for supporting British economy and it
looked as if what happened in Iraq might
spread the quake so at that point
Britain and the u.s. decided to grant
queit a nominal independence up till
then it was complete just a colony and
they say okay you can run your own post
office and pretend you have a flag and
that sort of thing
I but of course Britain will run it and
they said you know Lloyd said if
anything goes wrong with this we will
ruthlessly intervene to
sure maintaining control and the u.s.
agreed and said yeah they do the same
thing in Saudi Arabia and the Emirates
and but that's control that's not access
I mean at that time North America is the
biggest producer in the world you know
they didn't use it one drop of Saudi oil
