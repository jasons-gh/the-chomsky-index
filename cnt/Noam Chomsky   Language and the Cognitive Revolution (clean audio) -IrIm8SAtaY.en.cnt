but nevertheless over some period uh
this was reinterpreted and given the
contemporary naturalistic approach
namely aspects of the world can be
studied at various levels and that
whatever property they have if it's
counter Darren common sense intuition to
bed for intuition that has no status so
if in fact I can affect the moon by
moving my arm sounds crazy but that's
what it turns out okay if it turns out
that the world is really n dimensional
with infinite no one dimensional strings
will okay sounds crazy but if that's the
way it turns out fine intuitions are
relevant furthermore there are many
levels of which we can study this
reality whatever it is we're gonna try
to integrate them that's the sensible
version of the unification problem there
is no notion of existence or reality
apart from what figures in our best
explanatory theories in particular there
is no theory at all of the physical or
the material these concepts of dispute
therefore we have no coherent question
to ask about what lies outside the
physical there no longer is a mind-body
problem except just by arbitrary
stipulation and the reason is there's no
such thing as body till somebody tells
us what physical means there's no
question about what lies beyond the
physical and physics has no concept of
physical just whatever we come to
understand or maybe more narrowly
whatever we come to understand in such a
way that there's at least a reasonable
prospect of integrating it with the core
Natural Sciences how loose idea but
there's no concept of physical or
physical reality beyond that I trying to
the case of thinking or solving problems
are speaking a language right now we are
more in this sense of physical reality
we're most confident about the physical
reality of computational
representational systems at least by
naturalistic criteria so let's take a an
actual case there are recent studies in
case of language interesting studies of
it within the study of computational
representational systems you find many
different categories of expressions I
won't give details but for example is a
category well-formed expressions
perfectly grammatical and then various
kinds of deviant expressions and they
fall into all sorts of different types
Matic incompatibility violation of some
principle violation of another principle
and so on that's internal to the study
of computational representational
systems a
recently there's been some work on uh
electrical activity the brain called
event-related potentials in which people
have pretty surprisingly but
interestingly discovered specific
carlitz to these categories so a
particular kind of category of deviant
expression yields burka characteristic
event-related potential the Pacific kind
of uh brink of electrical activity in
the brain well that's kind of
interesting uh but why is it interesting
well it's interesting because it the
think notice the thing we're committed
to from a scientific point of view is
the categories of expressions given by
the computational representational
system those are the categories that
come out of a background of theoretical
explanation than miracle just occasion
and so on the event-related potentials
are just curiosity I mean what's
interesting about them is that they
correlate with what we understand to
some extent and therefore maybe they're
interesting notice these are two the
studies of brain at two different levels
one its electrical activity one its
computational activity in the case of
the computational activity we have
reasonably real well ground the Furies
with explanatory character and so on in
the case the electrical activity we know
nothing just a lot of noise up there but
now the study of the electrical activity
the brain has made progress because it
has found something that correlates with
what we understand much better namely
the computational representational
systems now maybe if these correlations
are extended and placed in a richer
theoretical framework will actually
begin to rely on them for some inquiry
that'll tell us something about the
computational representational systems
but that's the order of priority and
groundedness from the point of view of
the Natural Sciences the usual
enterprise stress that because the usual
interpretation again is the opposite and
mistakenly of course in this
naturalistic approach we would never ask
such utter ly pointless questions as
weather airplanes fly or whether
computers think or whether algorithm see
triangles or whatever ah what are the
real empirical questions and the
reasonable research programs well I
think they're the ones stitched earlier
to see if we want to learn something
about humans or pigeons or whatever we
should begin by considering something
that though that they do well and we
should try to figure out
are they do what they do well uh we
postulate some particular faculty of the
mind meaning the brain relevant level of
abstraction we try to determine its
properties and it's interstate stable
state in its initial state we look at
the problems of state transitions
learning and growth the problems of
interpretation and a fixed state
receptive problems the problems of
execution of action in so far as that
studies feasible which is not very far
that virtually nothing uh we'll look at
the problems of Education one of them
being the integration of various levels
of inquiry the other a question of the
integration of cognitive systems the
first question we expect just their
scientific faith in unity nature or
something we expect that there's going
to be an answer to the first question
whether we can find it or not i but
there's no particular reason to expect
an answer to the second there may be or
they may not be if there isn't there's
no unified cognitive science for the
moment there's rural progress in a few
areas including vision at the
computational representational level and
in this case also at the cellular level
there's progress and language but almost
solely at the computational
representational level on some
performance things like acquisition
there's a studies of conceptual
development closely related language
quite interesting their studies of
probabilistic reasoning and error and
various other topics ah they're all
sorts of areas where there's interesting
results concerning human cognitive
function far as I'm aware all within the
framework of highly modular assumptions
which I said seem to be natural ah but
apart from them but we we have a very
but very far from any understanding of
the articulation the architecture
general structure of the mind brain part
from very few specific modules which
appear to have their own special design
that leaves most of the questions one
might like to ask enshrouded in history
and it's entirely possible that this is
mystery of a kind that a human
intelligence which after all has its own
specific biological properties is unable
to penetrate even in principle
anybody wants to say things there are a
couple of microphones around yep I think
if you move every will be well oh yeah
oh good sorry about that yes sir my name
is George Watson I got about three
things on my mind one when you get back
to MIT and see your buddy cited when you
get back to MIT and you see your buddy
study in the nematodes you can pass a
long-term that you got it on a farm in
North Carolina he better than we have
black I'm saying you can pass a
long-term that he got it from a farmer
in North Carolina they really not go put
them into soybeans you'll never do this
crop the market I didn't have any idea
what they were until I read this paper
glad to know they exist the second thing
on my mind as I want to thank you I
probably never see again and I'll
explain about 1973-74 I started reading
your writings on transformation or
generative grammar and I noticed that
about every other paragraph on the page
you put a colon behind the verb and I
said I made a command decision I said
well the chomsky can do it I can too and
I started that got me into linguistics
and the international phonetic alphabet
basically my word of thanks to use that
today I write what I think the way I
look to you I haven't looked up for
punctuation rule or grandma rule since
then glad I had some impact on the world
and my attitude toward the prescription
is if they don't like it that's more of
a judgment abandoned me
don't care but he started me thinking I
I said good gracious if the if the way I
have been told the structure of the
language is wrong what's the impact on
the interpretation of the meaning and I
had to start going back to everything
again I got more out of philosophy the
second time around a bit first didn't
understand at first time I can't
understand a little bit second first
it's uh you talked about the 17th
century i went back Red John done and
for the first time I understood what he
was saying in his poetry and I remember
people falling out like flies trying to
read it the first time when I was an
undergraduate school but you triggered
the change of thinking and me and I'm
happy today thanks to it I want to say
that the third thing is I got a question
this is more along the lines of what you
were saying last night Sydney for oil
embargo gas money went sky high interest
went up everything went high I President
Carter came in you think man being a
peanut farmer he had sense enough not to
putting embargo on the soybeans when the
Russians invaded Afghanistan but he did
and we don't have those markets today
thanks to dump peanut farmer from
Georgia I mean it's tough matters and
things like trade deficits we started
losing the smokestack interest at least
what I was reading in the paper is about
eighty two three four and five we're
going to become an information society
and a service society and I noticed that
we started laying off people fiercely
here of late IBM 20,000 GM 74,000 the
car manufacturers which chief will
always consider stable companies in this
country or got these horrendous problems
but my question is what is the trend
what are the trends they're going on
that we still aren't picking up on
because we don't have the cognitive
interpretation process figured out well
enough to look at the evidence to tell
us what's really going on because my
instincts are telling me that the
infrastructure of our society is being
heavily damaged and that I'll quit more
than an instinct I mean every year
statistic and study will tell you
exactly the same thing but I only one
comment I think I
make suggestion for thinking about this
uh I think you should be more skeptical
about the use of the word we when you
say we are losing our infrastructure we
are becoming information society we are
losing industry who's we is we the
investors who who own those industries
well they're not losing it they're just
transferring them elsewhere so suppose
that auto parts are being produced in
Mexico let's say or computers are being
computed on chips are being produced in
Taiwan or something and it's being done
by industries with the corporate offices
in New York well from preview the worker
in the United States yeah you're losing
your industry from the point of view of
the owner yeah i was in industry at all
you're just making more profit out of it
with cheaper labor now it just happens
that the people who own the industry are
the ones are setting policy by and large
so it's not too surprising that the he
gets consequences you see and in order
to understand it since the first thing
we got to do is be willing to kind of
disentangle ourselves from the webs of
ideology enough so that we at least ask
who the references when we talk about we
in the end from google people who are
making the decisions about social
planning what happens the country isn't
all that important what happens to the
profits and power of those who dominate
it that is important and those two
things may very well diverge I think
they've reversed resharpen West in your
Steve can't buy precious enough things
worse for last night i have about two
days ago okay at least 20 hours to
formulate questions ah one of your
principal arguments for the maintenance
of our specialized in laws of classical
world which car is the rapidity with
which child wires line and one thing
that struck me from your talk was that
the statement to the child acquires
language rapidly is interest relative
and exactly the same fashion that the
statement boston is near to New York
which was your example and how do you
answer some mind brain function list who
comes to you and says the child acquires
language excruciating explose slowly we
have this huge neural net there are
billions of synapse firings and billions
of weight changes i'm not a good leader
because um you see if it is genuinely
interest relative and is the child of
ours right language rapidly is only a
true statement within some shared
interest how do you establish between
yourself and my brain person a shared
interest that is that
that your statement is just a very good
point in fact when I say that language
is acquired very rapidly that's all
that's you're absolutely right that's
like John's almost home what's rapidly
that's only meant to stimulate your
imagination it's not meant as a proposal
the way to answer the question is to
construct an explicit proposal as to how
language is acquired now there are
specific proposals based on an eight
structure there are no specific
proposals based on these nets so the
arguments over if somebody can propose
kind what I was saying before and if
somebody can propose a general learning
mechanism or some kind of a network or
something that does anything then we'll
all something to talk about so far the
only thing we have is highly specific
structures and when I give these
qualitative comments about it's done
rapidly I simply mean to say look what
what else would you expect I mean
children are picking up 12 words day and
every single one meaning on one
presentation and every single one of
them has the intricate complexity that I
only barely began to illustrate in a
case of one word you know and if the
same is true of structural properties
what else would you expect in fact what
do you expect below the neck so true
those are only qualitative comments not
suppose convince anybody just sort of
make you think that what seems to be the
case is pretty natural but the real
answer is let's try let's construct a
theory that tries to explain why I take
sentences I gave last time you know why
does John is too clever to expect anyone
to talk to me and precisely what it does
people know that without any evidence
that's easy to show they know it before
they've ever been presented with such
expressions so let's look for a theory
that accounts for that there is one
theory they stun principles which are
pretty well established they applied a
lot of different languages they seem to
work and so on and so forth that gives
an answer I so they can come along and
say well I think its neural Nets last
part maybe it's angels too but tell me
how um I had sort of brainstorm just on
what here last night friend of mine
record that will be hopefully but uh
what the first gentleman Pope said uh
caused me to think and uh something you
said uh kind of general being remote eat
during your talk day really struck an
interesting chord with me oh the idea
that dog
we seem to be wrecking our energy
studying things that people are don't do
very well on it that maybe we should we
could learn more by studying things that
people do do well armed that seems to
point to something on um even on a
mundane level for me oh I I get feeling
that are the what might be called
infrastructural problems society today
are when it comes down to it moral
problems we treated economics problems
and these sorts of things really I think
all the we have to be solved on a moral
level and I believe that will have to do
with people concentrating on things that
humans do well and what I think about it
I think that a lot of the things that
people do well are very simple subtle
things that people also take for granted
and that most of the people in this
world seems to be running around trying
to impress each other by doing things
better that people don't do very well I
just wonder what what you thought about
this kind of thinking I'm not sure I
understand the implications of what
you're saying I mean it does seem to me
we ought to agree with particular
statements we ought to be studying the
things people do well if we want to
understand people I also agree that the
problems of society are in substantial
part moral problems but only in a sense
that when we plan our actions we try to
change things or whatever we're we're
doing it in terms of a of some kind of
moral values we ought to be as clear
about that as we can some conception of
what's right for people and so on and
good to be clear about that but beyond
that I know where to go I mean I think
these subjects are too intellectually
fin for deep analysis to carry us very
far you are pretty much by instinct and
intuition I have I think that most
people tend to agree on these instincts
and intuitions when you sort of clear
away a lot of ideological cover and if
you can you want to sort of work with
other people about it or clarify your
ideas or whatever you want to find that
level at which you have agreement about
moral values and then ask yourself
rational questions like
those moral values and given the way
society actually is what should I be
doing to make it adapt better those
moral values that's being you know
responsible human being whether it's in
a small area like the family or a big
area international affairs I we try
Claire by a little bit more I I guess is
the word world because I didn't think of
of things more as being armed really
more practical and taking place on a
simpler level I guess that's the idea
that thought but um I say that there's a
lot of people in the world to be
concentrating on undoing things that
people don't do well and they should be
concentrating on things that people do
do well the things the examples that you
gave of what people do well were things
like well walking and talking in and
very simple things like this whereas the
examples of things that people don't do
well are things like for alting and
maybe perhaps spinning a big deal money
to go to Mars by the year 2000 well you
know going to Mars is certainly not
something people do will but I don't
think that answers the question whether
we ought to be doing it or not the
question is is there any point in people
going to Mars well you know you go back
and have a look at the origins of that
program and I think you get a pretty
straight answer to that question that
program originally came out of the
failure of the bay of pigs invasion
Kennedy needed a political victory to
overcome the effect of that and he
decided to set up a big crusade Apollo
program we got this fantastic thing
we're going to put a man on the moon was
there any point to that well it was a
big point for the electronics industry
they made a killing out of it there was
a big point for a lot of you know
scientists got huge research grants but
there is a question did it make sense to
put a man on the moon as distinct from a
little receptor of some kind you put a
bunch of receptors on the moon you don't
have to worry about an oxygen support
system you know precautions for survival
and so on and so forth obviously going
to be vastly cheaper cheaper and vastly
easier from an engineering point of view
get any less information in other words
is a man the best instrument to be on
the moment well you know scientists life
answer that but I'm quite certain the
answer is no but a man human being is
probably very poor instrument to be on
the moon the choice of human beings on
the moon was to have something dramatic
to have something that get people
excited and distract them from their own
problems and subordinate empower and
give a shot for the electronics industry
and so on that was the motive for it and
I don't make any sense except you know
for ibn maybe uh but those that seems to
me the kind of questions that one should
ask not is it the kind of things people
who well or badly sometimes kinds of
things people do badly are worth doing
like say quantum physics is the kind of
things that people do badly that's why
they're so few people who can do it well
it's kind of pole vaulting kind of quark
some people do it most people can but
that's worth doing you put me in mind of
a possible modification of Turing's test
which if you fall cartoons i'll call the
mark Alyn stillati test which is whether
you can tell a difference between the
cliche generating program and your
typical political candidate the typical
political candidate has more insults
that's very true in fact our a wife that
he wrote a scientific I'm in a science
fiction story where all the insults have
been standardized so that we say my
opponent is an eight and a three and the
reply would be my opponent is a four and
a six save save a lot of television time
exactly I want to ask you what may not
be quite a question but when you talked
about this wonderful program which it
generated more whatever it was
excitement interest than anything in the
history of intellectual world or
whatever what they said it reminded me
of a conversation that dr. staying over
at NC State head with a student that I
witnessed some years ago and the
students the doctor Sam what are we
going to have work of a fusion energy
and dr. stem said well maybe in 50 years
maybe in a hundred years I don't know
and the student said well why do we
always see all these things in the paper
about fusions just around the corner a
great breakthrough etc etc and dr. stem
replied you have to say such things in
order to get your research grants that's
kind of like the quote that I gave
except in that case at least there's
something real
going on in this case the advertising is
not obviously for anything real at all
well I guess the question or possibly
non question I want to ask is you know
there obviously is a good bit of
research money going into these a iphone
and I mean a lot of people pay good
money to make chess-playing programs
funny thing i found i was working with a
friend of mines commercial one and the
thing was awfully cowardly and i found
that if I told it to make a move that I
thought might work and then let it keep
me from getting killed then it worked
pretty well but if you just let it work
it took forever or do anything well I
don't say on the I didn't say much about
it but I'm not quit you know I'll just
get my own the question of chess-playing
programs I only describe the way i
thought one ought to evaluate one of the
first ask because it is it an
interesting question at the current
moment of science to figure out how
people play chess the answer that's
probably know it's not an interesting
question at the current phase of our
understanding of the mind but let's
assume for the sake of argument that it
is an interesting question so just for
the sake of argument then we take a look
at the progress on program would say it
does as well as Kasparov or you know
grandmaster now we ask does that program
tell us anything about the way humans do
it and the answer to that is flat no
their design so as not to tell us
anything about the way humans do it the
programs are designed to exploit the
capacities of computers which are
different than the capacities of humans
so they have deep search and fast you
know big memory in a life kind of stuff
so we therefore throw out the system's
instantly at least on scientific grounds
because they are doing so they're
studying what's probably a dumb question
and they're giving an answer which is
totally useless so what's the point well
as far as I can see the only point is
either advertising getting research
grants or maybe taking the fun out of
playing chess if there's some other
point I don't know what it is I felt
this for about 40 years I should say and
I've never been able to convince anybody
so maybe I'm wrong the general attitude
remains the one that I quoted from every
time that this is the sort of core feels
like drosophila no it's the sort of
fundamental question in the field and
listen I mean as far as I can see and
have always felt it's totally pointless
questions the waste of time I mean maybe
some
useful come out on the side you know
like maybe by accidentals lots of
spin-offs like maybe it'll help somebody
figure out more complicated software
ideas or something anything can always
have side effects but as a research
program to see me make any sense if
that's the core program of the field and
I think we just get rid of the few okay
let me try to ask my possible question
here then in your talk about well in
this tall you've described in the
natural science methods and ways of
doing things that are useful but then
obviously a lot of research money is
going into these things which are
apparently much less useful this wasn't
quite the point insightful I think is
the thing a lot of things are worth
doing even though they're not useful
because they give you understanding
understanding as a value in itself yeah
these things don't even give you an
understanding all they do is maybe fool
people or something like that so what
I'm wondering is is there is there a
connection in your opinion or what do
you think of the idea that there might
be a connection between the kinds of
things that get funded that you know
white real progress in science and the
kinds of things that get funded in the
economy and politics and so on well
first of all I don't regard this stuff
of science so I don't know if that's
what is from what I was saying but I
most of it doesn't seem to be science at
all it seems to be kind of height or
maybe injured maybe sort of badly
organized engineering or something like
that uh but within real science you know
people make mistakes but I think there
are you know there's for a reasonable
interaction about what's the right thing
to do on sort of a rational basis unless
you know their self advertising and
power trips and so on and so forth but
when I move toward subjects that have no
intellectual substance you move towards
more integrity not because the people
have better genes but because nature is
a hard taskmaster and it doesn't allow
you to fake so the more you understand
the harder just fake so you get more
honesty just kind of like that in areas
like say the economy and the political
decisions and so on the stuff is usually
for power interest doesn't mean with
only marginal things to do I'm very low
order factors are things like humans
human significance or anything like that
which again is pretty you know I'm not
terribly surprising you just look at
institutional structures in society
comes in a position influence decisions
you know what their institutional roots
are sort of predicted kind of run
trivial assumption thank you very much
I'd like to close this comment if
somebody makes a computer that can do
the sort of analysis that you do then
I'll believe they've achieved something
don't forget you can't make you can't
design programs that do simple things
like talking like a three-year-old hi I
wanted to raise the point with the
chess-playing computer I think I would
take issue with the fact or with your
opinion that they're useless right now
or they don't tell us anything um I
think if we might be looking at it the
wrong way to say the computer plays
chess but it doesn't model human thought
makes it useless I don't think it's not
useless it would be useless even if it
didn't model human thought maybe it
would be interesting but it would be
useless if it model chemical I'm
suggesting it's not useless which is not
necessarily a major right here in but
pointless but isn't it possible if you
look at it from a different viewpoint to
say can we design a machine that can
solve a problem within a limited domain
that humans are difficulty with and in
which case I think a chess-playing
computers does very well there's no
point to designing programs that will
solve in general that will solve
problems within limited domains there
would only be that's like an engineering
problem the thing wouldn't it be useful
to build a big machine well not in
itself if you build a big machine it
helps you make a bridge or something
yeah that was useful but there was no
point in building a big machine and
similarly there's no point in
constructing a program that'll solve
some arbitrary problem that you can do
undoubtedly presumably it's trivial you
do it you can do it in your spare time
if you've taken the first semester of
computer science to write a program that
will run for some decision procedure for
some simple part of mathematics okay
then once you learn the decision
procedure and you learn how to program
you can do it so what but maybe we're on
taking steps towards something we can
use but that has to be shown see that's
if somebody came along and constructed
some big machine and said well you know
this big machine I constructed maybe
it's a step toward something useful but
maybe but I'll wait until I see okay
well my point is that it seems kind of
selfish to think that feeling telligence
that we can have or the only way we can
solve very very complex problems is to
use human brain truth nobody
leaves that you know you want to do
weather forecasting an easy human brain
he'll use all kind of statistical
analysis of winter weather patterns
certainly using computers going away
beyond the human brain that's an
assignment intelligence that's you know
you you want to solve take your problem
you look for the best methods of doing
it for example if you want to solve the
decision problem for some elementary
branch of mathematics you'll use the
city procedure that's not the way humans
do it right that's because you have a
goal you want to solve that problem for
whatever reason so there's one thing to
say that we only see the reason you try
to understand what humans are doing is
because you're interested in human
beings right that's if you're interested
human beings you want to understand what
humans are doing that's pretty logical
if you're interested in solving a
problem you try to solve that problem
okay like if there was a purpose to
playing chess you know if there's a
purpose to winning chess championships
know that had some by a chest it's just
a convenient a convenient setting to
work to try algorithmic methods for
different litters out there's zillions
of possible algorithms I mean you make a
slightly different game you make up a
different algorithm there's no point to
it it's like growing machines to
arbitrary as I think there is a point
what's the point the point is that we
know if it's doing a good job now look
we can set up endless numbers of tasks
and we can design computer machine do
those tasks and we can do it forever it
is no point well I believe this to doing
arbitrary tasks you know sometimes it
may turn out that having tried an
arbitrary test you'll get something of
some value but you got to show that so
like suppose somebody said look I can
build a machine which will you know
randomly interchange the chairs in this
room and I can do it very effectively oh
maybe can maybe can't this very point in
building well I would argue that the
point for chess plane computers is that
a experiment with brother too I think
Theory's right now one is the chunking
theory that beuerlein our uses and
there's the other one which just kills
it hardware a new theory has any
intellectual interest there is related
to any problem of that that's an opinion
if you can show that it is you got to
show it
well I just here's the way I do it
therefore it's worth doing if you have
to say look here's the way I do it if
there's no reason why is worth knowing
the answer that question tell me the
reason the reason can see that it beats
somebody in a chess game because that's
of no interest well what I'm saying is
that maybe we could use these a movie
it's moving the guy who designed the
machine to randomize the chairs in the
room will get something that's useful
for some purpose to know okay so I
believe that a random thing anything
else you like take any test you like you
know he crazy test you like you could
work on a machine that we do it as fast
as possible and you know it's not
inconceivable that as a result of having
done that absurd thing something useful
might come out but that's not the way
you design unless you can't think of
anything different something random well
I'm compare it with course alkaline
people in genetics didn't study
drosophila because well you know let's
do something a random they looked at
their sample because their particular
questions to ask and one know the
answers to them in drosophila happen to
be the right system the best system as
far as I knew to look at get those
answers similarly this guy who's looking
at me because they just say okay I'll
try to save him but name it does he
picked them because of the simplest
organism with a wiring diagram worked
out on know something about wiring
diagrams I mean doing rational inquiry
you're trying to understand something
you organize your task your research
program so it may lead you to understand
it you don't just do something and I
hope that something will turn out well I
don't think it's that's true right now
well what is what is the goal well what
we have in the world are just we have a
huge environment and we have to do if
you want to maybe compute it is you have
to be able to make up searches from a
wide variety of places I mean we have so
many choices we can do I can walk back
to my chair I can stand here I could
skip back to my chair you know we have
someone on study then and i think i'm
studying that either because there's no
everything is there's the multitude of
choices give a look there's there's
endless numbers of areas where you can
set up problems
multitude of choices what thickness you
know if you only take this what do you
think I'm gonna learn something from say
if the model really is Ursula then let's
do with the basalt biologist did with
Drosophila ask a question that's worth
having an answer to show the chest
planning is the way to answer that
question no but nobody's doing that okay
I'll say no mas looks like me touring
test is fooled by algorithmic systems
only said something like that well how
will we know when we do have an
intelligent computer talk to it longer
well we're not weak but we won't know
ever know whether we have an intelligent
computer anymore than we will know
whether we have an airplane that flies
that's when the English question exactly
stirring said how suppose I ask you this
question where we're less they were back
in 98 you know or whatever the first
right thing was and still am you wanna
said suppose I make something that goes
up in the air how we want to know if it
flies that's just a dumb question you
know it will fly if there's no question
as to whether it's going to fly if you
want to call that start flying okay line
in English you have to decide to call it
flying some other language you call it
something else but there is no empirical
question as to whether an airplane flies
and there is no empirical question as to
whether an algorithm things for exactly
the same reason flying is something boys
you talk English and thinking is
something humans do is sort of embedded
in a matrix of human interests and so on
and just as airplanes don't do whatever
his birds are doing I even think it
pulls somebody to thinking that it's a
bird that would be irrelevant similarly
algorithms or brains are not doing
things that you must for example is
there a question as to whether brains
think what brains don't think of course
they don't think my brain doesn't see
trying to help my brain let's forget
computers my brain doesn't see triangles
for trivial reasons seeing triangles as
a human action we truly that
characterization to humans in a chrome
work of human interests and concerns and
motives the motion of this notions of
absolutely
use for science I mean we don't study in
the sciences things like thinking any
more than we study things like desks and
the sciences I mean these are concepts
of common sense now belong in the
sciences they don't enter into rational
explanatory theory so you in the
sciences you constantly trying to get
rid of all these things and move to
concepts that have some utility not
things like disk or thinking or
something like that our digestion you
know you look at what's actually
happening try to understand it in terms
of whatever concepts and principles are
relevant but to ask the question whether
a program thinks or whether arrange
these a triangle is as dumb is asking
whether an airplane flies is not going
to have an answer for trivial reasons
there is no answer to the question
whether airplanes fly and there's no
point setting up an analog of the Turing
test that says well can we construct
something that's not a fool of human
under some circumstances that won't tell
us whether it's flying or not you say
you think so and what if we make a
machine with the attributes like the
human brain very complicated human
bringing those attributes like the human
brain the human brain doesn't think well
before humans do but human brains don't
ending within your brain sees a triangle
your brain doesn't see triangle for
quite uninteresting reasons and
correspondingly something with the
characteristics of your brain doesn't
see trying people are the ones who do
things like that just as shirring said
now you can ask pointless questions like
what will be the empirical conditions
under which an airplane flies to ask a
pointless question you're never going to
get an answer of course now it's
interesting that any deal with sort of
phenomenal world like airplanes flying
nobody asks those silly questions I'm if
something tried to start a new science
dealing the question whether airplanes
fly they'd be laughed out of you know we
mean by the left standards for the human
flight contest there were some standards
yes figure eight but you don't ask
whether you Twitter see you don't even
for the human skin plus plus somebody
came and said
how do we know the humans can't fly
integrally the last olympic some guy
went 30 feet why isn't that flying no
Sonny one order of magnitude less than
chicken it has no answer you know it's a
matter of precision what do we want to
call that flying a couple risotto papers
by Roman collar that gaze up he argues
that your grammar windows SAS or so out
of date that much that your grammar
wendys the grammar of a Frenchman
sorceress oh I would date that much of
the recent French intellectual
excitement is also rather pointless do
you have any ideas about the abuse have
you seen the papers that howling yes
with you this Norman Holland the other
do you have these regulations as you'd
like share this day on that top very
hard me to comment on the French
intellectual things as they understand
almost no word of anything that has
happened there for many many years about
whether or not there's unification when
the cognitive sciences do you find any
usefulness at all and you start very
theory and Jungian archetypes well you
know it's actually this many of the
ideas of you stop theory were developed
in a sort of a crazy context admittedly
but nevertheless developed back in the
17th century discussions there's a lot
of discussion of you real people I say
Ralph cudworth and if you're willing to
plow through all the strange framework
and funny ideas what you see is an
analysis of perception in terms of
motions like optimal forms causal
factors you know ground figure ground a
lot of the ideas that later came up
again in your stealth psychology then
there's probably something to all those
ideas in fact you know some of them are
even
we understood as far as the Union
archetypes are concerned I'm cleaning
the understand a lot but I've tried to
read it because as far as never wanted
as far as I've never date I my mother
very few people who ask questions about
huge structure of knowledge systems
which is interesting most people I'm
asking such questions but whether
there's anything to those answers I
don't know I I was wondering he said it
there's no purpose and studying things
that we don't do good let me do bad he
said that there's no purpose in studying
something we don't perform well if you
wouldn't worry about us there may be a
purpose for some other reason but um if
you take an algorithm and you see when
this algorithm collapse I mean first of
all there's so much effort in this
direction i wonder how could you just
dismiss it like just saying there's no
pointless and there's so much research
envisions that in visual illusions and
trying to deduce i mean given the strip
effect you're taking in effect you see
when our system collapse and then you
try did use fax from it and i just don't
excited the same illusions or something
very well yeah but we may be perfectly
in fact that's why it started you're
giving me he'll everybody pees instantly
that's why people study an anchor cute
yeah but but an illusion is an example
of a situation where algorithm for
calculating sucking is collapses you can
do the same thing visuals indecision
behavior you can say that when people
and our intransitive they perform some
kind of an illusion because they dress
the reality and different thing and then
you could try and deduce thing about the
algorithm that really exists in there
that collapse under these circumstances
then maybe you can learn something about
the algorithms well you know the fact
that maybe you learn something about
algorithms is not interesting people
study illusions or people study saying
Darcy style studies of probabilistic
errors because that's something that
people do perfectly in the old wood and
intend to do it alight people do it fast
instantaneously and of course one but
thrown from another point of view one of
you what the objective right answer is
that's not the issue the point is
studying say illusion
like textedit studying let's take even
simpler than illusions take the study of
apparent motion ok that's apparent
motion means you know a couple of dots
on the Kiska scope that show up and
people look at it and I see a line well
what they're seeing is wrong from the
point of view of the physical source
there wasn't any line or just two points
but you're studying something that
people do extremely well very rapidly
quickly without training they all do it
like giving two points in a particular
relation they see a line so therefore
you want when you're talking about yeah
that's a good thing to study yeah but
but strong and bad in this direction
also wrong can bed are a very good
anticipation terminological confusion
what people do extremely well is
misinterpret that illusion and that's
why you study but chess is not like that
cancel it cash nothing too much as well
worry them well I'm talking about
defected and I think basically the
confusion is between what you call
Gooden what I call and I mean you mean
faster accurate or remembering so now I
mean the kinds of there are certain
kinds of action that people do naturally
and they do it alike and they do it fast
and they do it without training and so
on and this was what I mean things
people do well now on one of those
things are for example misinterpreting
illusions okay but they're in that
category is just a terminological
confusion but if we do something bad
doesn't it mean that our system in some
way collapses under the circumstances
very simple collapse if you see two
points on Atticus the scope is a long
and your system didn't collapse it just
gave a delusion which happen to be an
accurate but that's not the system
systems working perfectly systems
working perfectly we might want to
understand how it works and in fact a
good deal of contemporary vision studies
deals with just those things and it
learned a lot about the systems because
those are things that people do affect
David Marr who i quoted whose point was
that you should study things that people
do will was studying exactly those
things because those are things that
people do well mainly misinterpret
illusions and characteristic ways so
what I don't stand I mean my definition
of what people are doing badly is your
definitions people do
settle around terminology Ronnie a
terminological notational dispute we
understand what category or identify
okay the category of recognizing
straight straight lines an apparent
motion experiment is one category one
and a pole vaulting and doing chess is
category 2 and running mazes that's
category 2 now mar is saying and I agree
with them we should study category 1 if
you know Mike Mike terminology for
describing it have any sneaking
terminology I'm sorry I will have to cut
in no I'm sorry we have no I'm Chomsky
has another okay one last person go
ahead yeah you mentioned in the
beginning and you talk about ways that
humans represent their knowledge of the
world which I presume you mean did that
gained through experience I don't mean
that that's an open question I would
assume that most of our knowledge of the
world is not gained through experience
it's in for the same reasons that most
of our knowledge of languages there for
the same reasons that most of our
physical structures okay to ask how that
related your idea this is I mean
knowledge that what you know sort of
knowing about the world is so did you
I'm here we're just guessing my guess is
that that's gonna break down into many
different modules but so little is known
about it that you know we're just
talking up in here that knowledge well
let me come back to what this guy
Charles Rahman said in in the study of a
and 800 cell organism with three hundred
neurons where the wiring diagram has
worked out the connectionist models are
far too abstract and far too remote from
physical reality to tell you anything we
now ask the question in the case of a
system of 10 to the 11th neurons we're
learning about it might these systems be
physically real well I know it's not
ruled out but I don't think one
scientific intuition would lead one to
be very hopeful
okay this completes the circle of talks
that norm has given here at the
University and I would like to take the
opportunity to thank him on the behalf
of the whole university community for
these engaging speeches and interviews
thank you
