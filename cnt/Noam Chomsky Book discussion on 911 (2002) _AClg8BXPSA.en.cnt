called on Israel meaning the US and
Israel to observe international law the
u.s. boycott at the meeting thereby
killing it you can check the coverage
again these acts again contribute to the
escalation of terrorism they are
including its most severe component and
the median contributed in the usual way
well suppose finally that we join the
Martian an observer I'm skipping a lot
of things I think you're interesting you
can ask about them feel like but suppose
finally that we join the Martian
observer and we depart from convention
radically we accept moral truisms if we
can rise to that level we can then and
only then honestly raise the question of
how to respond to terrorist crimes one
answer is to follow the precedent of
law-abiding states the nicaraguan
precedent for example of course that
failed because they ran up against the
fact that the world is ruled by force
not by law but wouldn't fail for the US
however evidently that's excluded I have
yet to see one phrase referring to that
precedent in the massive coverage of the
last couple of months another answer was
given by bush and voice but we instantly
reject that one because nobody believes
that Haiti or Nicaragua Cuba and a long
list of others around the world have the
right to carry out massive terrorist
attacks against the United States and
its clients or other rich and powerful
States a more reasonable answer was
given by a number of from a number of
sources including the Vatican and was
spelled out by the preeminent Anglo
American military historian Michael
Howard last October I think it's
published in the current issue of
Foreign Affairs that's the leading
establishment journal a Howard has all
the appropriate credentials
a lot of prestige he's a great admirer
of the British Empire even more
extravagantly of its successor in global
rule so he can't be accused of moral
relativism or other such crimes
referring to September 11th he
recommends a police recommended then a
police operation against a criminal
conspiracy whose members should be
hunted down and brought before an
international court where they could
receive a fair trial and if found guilty
be awarded an appropriate sentence well
I was never contemplated of course but
it sounds kind of reasonable to me if it
is reasonable then it oughta hold for
even worse terrorist crimes for example
the u.s. international terrorist attack
against Nicaragua or even worse ones
nearby and elsewhere going up right to
the present incidentally well that could
never be contemplated of course but for
opposite reasons so honesty leaves us
with a dilemma the easy answer is
conventional hypocrisy the other option
is the one adopted by our Martian friend
who actually abides by the principles
that we profess with Grant and
self-righteousness that option is harder
to consider but imperative if the world
is to be spared still worse disasters
the quicker we take our break the
quicker he comes back we're going to
take a ten-minute break you can buy
books and t-shirts write out your
questions people will be going down here
a couple people picking up questions and
up there and we're going to start again
in 10 minutes stretch your legs thank
you
what can we do as individuals and
collectively do to change this pattern
of us abuses and murder how can we gain
engage and inspire those outside this
hall this Hall being full of the already
converted and privileged first of all an
apology if I act as if they can't see
you that's because I can't see you it's
all black out there I assume there must
be people but can't see any faces
first of all there plenty of people
outside this hole who are pretty much
the same in fact it's a very powerful
current in the country and in fact
throughout the world there's plenty of
evidence for that as to how you as to
what you can do about it I think we all
know the answer I mean ask yourself why
we don't live under feudalism or why we
don't have slavery or why women have
some rights or you know why there's some
finally concern about trying to save the
environment before we destroy it or
anything else you can think of back
through history there are no magic
answers there's only one answer it's
dedicated committed hard work
educational organizing find your you
know the things that interest you get
involved in them there's just no other
way that's the way it's been done all
through history it's a lot of progress
you know things can make a lot of
terrible things in the world but it's a
lot better than it was and those
achievements have come by people who
didn't just ask the question but acted
on the obvious answer and there isn't
gonna be any other answers no point
asking if anybody had thought of an
answer you would have heard it and there
isn't any the answer is you know just do
it and you know how to do it the same
way everybody else is
if bombing Afghanistan is the wrong way
of going about solving terrorism then
what is a better alternative Thanks yeah
well first of all we have to decide what
we mean by terrorism do we mean by
terrorism what the say u.s. code means
by terrorism or do we mean by terrorism
the terrorism that they conduct against
us okay those are depending on what we
mean there are different answers so are
we hypocrites or not we got to decide
that first well if we're not hypocrites
then one way to reduce terrorism doesn't
solve it one way to reduce terrorism is
not to participate in it that's an easy
way embargoes just means stop
participating in it if you want to know
what that means let's say today just
take a look a look at the list of
leading recipients of u.s. arms
transfers in the world just run through
the list compare them with standard
human rights watch reports and you'll
find a way to reduce terrorism enormous
Li what about the Terrorism of them
against us that is the minor part well
you know the Terrorism of the week does
exist it's serious could get a lot worse
if you look at official studies you know
technical studies some of them
government some strategic analysts some
in the technical journals you'll find
that for years now everyone has
understood that the major terror threat
against the United States is not
missiles no country is going to be crazy
enough to launch a missile attack
against the United States and ask for
instant obliteration but there is a so
the missile defense business you can
forget about it's just a cover for
militarization of space projects which
are extremely dangerous
but there are there is a possibility of
serious terrorist attacks and it's not a
joke
it doesn't take enormous expertise these
days to figure out how to bring the
pieces of a nuclear weapon into New York
and assemble them in a hotel room and
set off a nuclear explosion in fact you
know even people with limited talent of
most of us could figure out how to do
that and a plutonium bomb you know
weighs like 15 kilograms there's nothing
like that and the same is true of
bioterror and many other things there
are many possible weapons of the weak
and there's a good chance that they'll
be used that's not the most the biggest
part of component of terrorism in fact
it's the smallest part but it's very
serious
like what happened on September 11th
wasn't a joke it's not what do you how
do you deal with that well there a
couple of ways I mentioned a couple of
ways at the end and I think some of them
are quite reasonable repeat but the
basic it's somewhere along the line if
you want to deal with the problem with
terrorism you got to think about the
reasons for it so for example take say
one of the very few cases in which the
week actually did carry out terrorism
against the strong namely IRA bombs in
London which were not a joke I mean at
some stage they plan didn't succeed in
killing the whole British Cabinet well
it was one possibility
I'm putting aside questions of
feasibility let's put that aside one
possible reaction would say have been to
bomb Boston which is the source of most
of the financing I supposed well okay
that would be in one response another
response would have been to flatten West
Belfast okay probably the RAF couldn't
handle that wouldn't even feasibility
aside this have been lunatic responses
those are the responses we're doing now
a sensible response was the one that I
quoted from Michael Howard
I find the perpetrators it's a criminal
criminal it's criminal act find the
agents the criminal act get evidence
about him bring him to a proper court
tribunal and sentenced them and then he
didn't say this and then look into the
grievances that lie behind it and there
are usually are grievances I mean any
criminal act
do you think of whether it's a robbery
in the streets or September 11th or even
worse terrorist crimes of which there
are unfortunately numerous it gave a few
cases there's usually something that's
lies behind them and when you look at
what lies behind them there often are
some of the grievances are quite
legitimate and they ought to be dealt
with quite apart from terrorism
independently of terrorism so one of the
things I didn't get to talk about but
good is the question why do they hate us
that George Bush's plaintive question
which has actually been asked for a long
time and we have answers to it back to
the 1950s from the internal Declassified
record so Eisenhower for example raised
exactly the same question back in 1958
he said look secretly in secret
discussion he said there's a campaign of
hatred against us in the same area of
the world not by governments but by the
population and what's the reason and the
National Security Council gave him the
reason and the reason is that there's a
perception which we can't counter
because it's true that the u.s. supports
harsh and brutal status quo in order to
pursue its own interests in obtaining
the energy resources of the region and
therefore supports brutal and oppressive
regimes and we have a hard time dealing
with this because the perception is
correct and they say it's natural that
we should do that
yeah that's not very different from what
the Wall Street Journal reported a
couple of days after the September 11th
attacks went to their credit they began
to do some studies which long should
have been done long before
asking what's you know what are people's
attitudes in that region of course they
looked at a narrow sector the sector
they're interested in what they called
moneyed Muslims the rich guys so they
were thinking of bankers and
professionals and international lawyers
and people in business meant and you
know tied up with US multinationals
people right in the middle of the US
system you know and they found pretty
much the same responses as back in the
1950s and that perception still is
correct so it's hard to counter but it
shouldn't be correct we should not be
supporting harsh and brutal regimes we
should not be blocking as we have been
for 50 years their Democratic options
possibilities of independent development
and we shouldn't be carrying out the
kinds of policies that really anger
people like supporting Israeli
occupation which is now in its 35th year
and it's harsh and brutal or devastating
the civilian population of Iraq while
strengthening Saddam Hussein and they
remember even if we prefer to forget it
that the US and Britain supported Saddam
strongly right through his worst
atrocities so like when you hear
Madeleine Albright or Tony Blair or
somebody saying this guy is so awful
got to get rid of him even gassed his
own population all of that stuff is
exactly correct except I'm missing a
couple of words namely he gassed his own
population with our support which
continued its strongly after he didn't
care about the crimes cared about other
things we cared about exactly what the
National Security Council was telling
Eisenhower back in the 1950s well you
know if we don't want to pay any
attention to that okay then we're just
guaranteeing further terrorist acts
can't predict what they'll be but you
can be pretty sure they'll come just as
in the case of say Britain and Ireland
if they paid no attention to the
grievances would go on you know there's
some chance of dealing with problems if
you pay attention to what lies behind
them otherwise
and it usually is something behind them
yep
what does the role of Central Asian oil
and other resources play in the current
operations in Afghanistan specifically
pipeline through Afghanistan well you
know anything that happens in that area
of the world there's gonna be a very
likely there'll be an energy connection
because that's why that area of the
world is important to the West that's
true of Central Asia it's even as far
more true of the Gulf region however
that can't be the reason why the u.s. is
bombing Afghanistan I mean those
interests are constant they've been
there for a long time they're gonna stay
there they didn't change in September 11
but now they certainly enter so for
example George Bush's representative in
Afghanistan Aden and he was in fact a
consultant for Unocal and it's not very
surprising unical has been trying to put
a pipeline through there for some years
how important it is you can debate
probably not all that important but of
some interest to them one consequence of
the current war which is very visible
and the Europeans are well aware of it
and in fact all over the business press
is that the u.s. is establishing and
Spri obviously if you just look the US
is establishing a military presence in
Central Asia supporting regimes which
are scarcely different from the Taliban
it's pretty hard to distinguish
Uzbekistan from the Taliban and that's
actually been reported honestly in the
New York Times and elsewhere it's and
it's establishing a military presence
they are linking up as usual with brutal
repressive murderous States horrible
attitudes towards women in the usual
business and it's it's because it wants
a position you know to take a position
and what used to be called in the 19th
century the great game you know the
conflict over control of the region now
that great game has different players
you know then it was written in Russia
and different interests because now a
major interest is who's gonna get access
to the energy resources of the central
asia region which are apparently
significant as far as anybody knows
they're nowhere near on the scale of the
Gulf
I mean Saudi Arabia as far as anyone
whose remains by far the largest energy
source in the world in Iraq second but
they're not insignificant you know and
control over them will be important the
Russians want to have control China
wants a piece the US wants a piece
there's a lot of struggle over whether a
pipeline should go through Iran
the way the energy companies want
because it's the cheapest way but the US
government doesn't want for reasons you
know or whether it should go through
Turkey which is the u.s. main US ally
and a lot of jockeying is going around
and a physician and of power military
base in Central Asia would give the u.s.
some leverage on that and that's
certainly one very likely outcome of the
current war other things well you know
most of this stuff is secret so we
really don't know but it happened I was
in India in November and passed through
Pakistan for a couple of days at the end
and I happened to be in Islamabad for a
day which was the same day is the
meetings of the World Bank and the UN
Development Fund on Slate November on
development projects for post-war
Afghanistan the Pakistani press which is
surprisingly free and open at least
surprised me though I sort of knew it
from reading Iqbal off mittens work but
it's true they were reporting it pretty
straight and they quoted drafts of World
Bank documents which are being presented
at the meeting actually put one of them
up on their internet if you're
interested but what it said I mean I
can't check the original to see if it's
accurate these are internal documents of
the World Bank and people like that but
it looked authentic they were saying
that the Prime a priority for the
reconstruction of Afghanistan
should be investment in the energy
sector including pipelines and then it
went on about that and you know those
are obviously not the priorities for a
country that's been devastated primarily
by the US and Russia for the last 20
years and is a total wreck but if this
is correct that's the projection of the
international institutions are there
concerns maybe maybe not until these
institutions become transparent enough
so when you can find out what they're up
to
we'll just have to speculate and use
what bits of information there are but
it wouldn't surprise me that's how this
region has been viewed so yes there are
there are Central Asian energy interests
related to it they'll probably become
more important than the next in the
coming years with a very likely conflict
among China Russia United States other
smaller participants and antagonists
could be a difficult area okay can you
speak about the current trend of
equating protests with terrorism on how
the media government and people of the
US view these protests for example
anti-globalization protests well you
know it was completely obvious the first
moment after September 11th they have to
say when I was first asked by reporters
for comments within a couple of hours
the first thing that came to mind is
what I suppose is obvious that every
harsh and repressive force in the world
is going to use this as a window of
opportunity to pursue their own agendas
I mean it might be USA massacring people
in Chechnya or it might be disciplining
the population in the United States and
trying to get them to shut up well we
rich and powerful guys do whatever we
want like cut capital gains taxes and
things like that and that's exactly what
happened
I mean if anybody surprised they're just
not living in this world I mean what do
you expect powerful groups to do when
they have an opportunity use it of
course so in the United States for
example the Bush administration has used
the opportunity and a particularly crude
and vulgar fashion I mean exploiting the
fear and anguish of the population in
order to ram through programs saying
they know that you'd never get through
if there was any discussion and debate
their favorite programs I mean you read
the newspapers I have to run through it
Andy that's what's called
anti-globalization which is a terrible
word and incidentally I mean it's a term
of propaganda remember we should never
use that term there is nobody who's
opposed to globalization so for example
in fact the the main you know the modern
left the left in the modern sense the
workers movement of the left oh it began
with it and retains a commitment to
globalization that's what the first
international was about what's an
international you know I mean it was
interested in international integration
but in a form which serves the interests
of the general public not a small sector
of investors and lenders what's called
globalization is a specific form of
economic integration which happens to be
to benefit the interests of those who
designed it not very surprisingly and
the interest of everybody else are kind
of incidental you know benefit doesn't
matter
well that's called globalization and
therefore anybody as opposed to what is
called anti-globalization so then they
can be described as you know primitives
and want to go back to the Stone Age or
something like that
but that's all just pure propaganda I
mean the question is what form of
international integration do we want so
in next week there's gonna be two
meetings about this one of them in New
York that's the Davos meetings another
one in Porto Alegre in Brazil it's the
world Social Forum Davos is the people
who the leading business journal in the
world the Financial Times
their last meeting called the Masters of
the Universe there was a touch of irony
in that but not very much it's pretty
accurate so there'll be a basically
secret meeting of the Masters of the
Universe here in New York and there'll
be a very public meeting in Porto Alegre
of popular groups from all over the
world and so on and so forth
Jeff's gonna be there I'm gonna be there
lots of other people from all over the
world will well they're both they're all
in favor of globalization the question
is what form should it take so none of
the people in Porto Alegre are opposed
to globalization that is they're not
opposed to the fact that they're going
to be in Porto Alegre right which is a
kind of globalization these are terms of
propaganda we should drop them the
question is what kind of international
integration should there be you know and
there are a lot of different ideas about
that of course those who want to ram
through the air program people will be
meeting in the davidis meeting they
would like everyone else to shut up so
they can do what they want without
anybody paying any attention to it and
anybody who criticism criticizes it can
now be called any patriotic or
anti-american or you know moral
relativist or one of the other terms of
abuse but that's just ridiculous
I mean nothing I mean the first reaction
of the US Trade Representative Robert
Zoli to the terrorist attacks was that
if you're in if you're opposed to
terrorism you have to grant the
president Stalinist style authority to
reach international agreements without
congressional involvement or public
knowledge there's a name for that it's
called fast-track or trade enhancement
it's like the old Kremlin days that's
the way you're gonna make
osama bin laden you know quaking his
boots if you give the president that
authority and that's what they managed
to get it you know they managed to ram
it through congress i think with one
vote by pleading patriotism well yeah
sure that's exactly what they're gonna
do i mean they would do that if there
was an earthquake you know whatever is
gonna happen yes
they'll try to use that opportunity this
one happens to be particularly vulgar
and in fact things like the
disgracefully name us Patriot Act which
is really reminiscent of Stalinism
including its wording yeah they'll try
to impose things like that using the
current fear and concerns of the
population naturally that's what you do
if you're in power but there's no reason
why it should succeed my suspicion is it
probably won't but that's in our hands
really you know you just are you gonna
subject yourself to efforts that the
imposing submissiveness and discipline
or not there's no more reason to shut up
about things you think are important now
than there were pretty September 11th
certainly the people with power aren't
shutting up they're doing exactly what
they always do figuring they have a
chance to do it even more easily under
these conditions what do you think what
do you think the Al Gore response would
have been to September 11th
probably about the same can't see I
don't I mean I should say you know these
are distinctions that are the
differences are awfully hard to make I
mean like for example in in 1968 if you
wanted US troops out of Vietnam should
you vote it for Humphrey or Nixon well
you know personally I didn't vote but my
feeling was probably it would be more
likely with Nixon and in retrospect I
think it's probably true you know these
are differences that are so marginal and
subtle that take a position on them is
almost impossible
[Applause]
we have to finish about five homes is
there credit this came from many
different people as their credible
evidence that some part of the US
government was complicit in the
September 11th attacks well that's an
internet theory but it's hopelessly
implausible in my opinion so hopelessly
implausible and I even see any point
talking about I don't think so yeah has
the u.s. now found or created a
satisfactory substitute for the Cold War
II that means I presume the war on
terrorism well you see Eric going back
to our Martian he could tell you right
off that that can't possibly be true and
the reason is because the war on
terrorism was declared on in 1981 with
the same rhetoric and the same people
and we know how it was waged now nobody
wants to talk about that for a very good
reason if you talk about it you come up
with the kinds of answers that actually
we all know that I reviewed so therefore
you can't talk about it but it's a fact
that's nevertheless and in fact you have
to ask what the Cold War was well you
know one of the the reason that they
came up with the war against terror as
the core of u.s. foreign policy in the
early 80s was because everybody realized
the Cold War is not gonna serve as a
pretext for very long you know you gotta
kind of have to find other pretext for
the kinds of policies that are carried
out before the Cold War after the Cold
War during the Cold War for the same
reasons let's go back to Eisenhower the
things I was you know I'd have a chance
to quote them but the things I was
referring to about you know why do they
hate us here are the reasons from the
National Security Council that happen to
be 1958 I was a very important year in
US and world history for a lot of
reasons actually the u.s. faced three
major crises that year according to
internal debate we have a huge internal
record on this it'd be front-page news
and Mars because
goes right up to the prison everything
that happened then goes right up to the
prison the three and we know a lot about
it because it's Declassified so any
journalist who wants to find out
just open the official records same with
any commentator 1958 the Eisenhower
administration identified three major
crises in the world all in Islamic
states all in oil producers one was
Indonesia one was Algeria one was the
Middle East what had happened in Algeria
was that the French which is an oil
producer the French were having a hard
time
suppressing national independence
movement despite huge massacres and
terror and savagery and I was bad in
Indonesia the problem was that the
government was too independent and to
democratic it was allowing a party of
the left to participate the parties the
peasants and it was getting more and
more it was gaining more and more and in
fact it looked like they might actually
take over the government or at least
become influential there in the Middle
East what was happening was that Iraq
was broke out of the anglo-american
condominium over energy Iran had tried
with a conservative nationalist
government but they were put back in
their place by a u.s. British coup but
Iraq actually got out it was assumed to
be NASA right that is independent
nationalists all right all right
there was discussion and the internally
instantly every one of those three
crises goes right up until today the US
reacted in Indonesia by organizing the
biggest clandestine operation in
post-war history to try to separate
split breakup Indonesia and to take it
over the outer islands where most of the
resources are failed and led things are
gonna have to talk about in the Middle
East it's quite interesting what
happened among other things the u.s.
sent troops to Lebanon my wife that's
the New York Times crossword puzzle and
asked me the other night around 1
o'clock in the morning
what I thought the answer was to a
seven-letter blank space for us
peacekeeping operation in 1958 I tore my
hair out thinking it can't be this but I
said well maybe Lebanon Lebanon was the
u.s. invasion
it wasn't a peacekeeping mission which
said in fact the US troops that landed
were authorized to use nuclear weapons
apparently it was connected with Iraq's
breakaway and what happened in Lebanon
afterwards enough to describe to you
this goes straight up to the Gulf War
you know you take a look at the meetings
between Britain in the United States
then they lay it all out ok so right
after the president's a man Algeria's
monstrous terrorist acts going on a lot
of them by the government a lot of them
probably supported by French
intelligence a very messy story anyway
they're all going on ever since there
was discussion internally was naturally
raised what's the role of the Russians
and all this and the conclusion was
nothing Eisenhower in fact himself
intervenes according to the minutes
vociferously to say there's no Russian
involvement in any of this that's very
typical if you look at the internal
record we have a rich internal record
about intervention throughout the third
world turns out the Cold War is mostly a
pretext it's it was a pretext for of
course you know there's a superpower
company in the background and each
superpower for completely cynical
reasons supported the opponents of the
other just like the US organized
radical Islamic fanatics in Afghanistan
in the 1980s but that's for cynical
internal reasons and though they were
cool the actual struggles were different
the Russians used the Cold War as a
pretext for intervention their own
domains we used the Cold War as a
pretext for intervention and our much
broader domains that's true in case
after case is not time to run through it
but the evidence case by case is quite
substantial so they're the it's true
that there's a need for a substitute for
the Cold War as a pretext
in fact a month after the this was
obvious a month after the Berlin Wall
fell Berlin Wall fell in November 1989
okay that ends at any o'the going back
to why international terrorism they were
looking for something what are we going
to use if the Russians aren't there so
you know Hispanic narco traffickers
international terrorists something or
other
this came to a head in November 1989
Berlin Wall fell absolutely no
possibility of pretending the Russians
are coming
what happened right after well the first
thing that happened is us stepped up its
terrorist attacks against Nicaragua
another thing that happened is the u.s.
invaded Panama that wasn't the
Panamanians don't think this is
particularly trivial like for example
the Panamanian press like everywhere
denounced the September 11th atrocities
very harshly but they added as did many
people around the world
we're not unfamiliar with it in Panama
they referred to the bombing of the
barrio
choryo slum we referring to them a
couple of thousand people were killed in
one bombing raid we don't know whether
that's true because it's a Western crime
so they're first never investigated
that's the same principle but could be
true the u.s. invaded Panama certainly
killed a lot of people veto to Security
Council resolutions the purpose was to
kidnap a minor thug not a saddam hussein
who was brought to florida tried and
convicted for crimes that he committed
mostly when he was on the CIA payroll
well you know that's like a footnote to
history
you don't even mention it but it was
after the Cold War so it had to have
different pretexts and it did it was to
defend ourselves against Hispanic narco
traffickers wasn't because the Russians
were coming also as the current the
human rights adviser to the National
Security Council Elliott Abrams advised
he had just been kicked out of the
government for
crimes he pointed out correctly that
this is the first time that the United
States can carry out an intervention
without any concern that the Soviet
Union might react somewhere in the world
you know for their own reasons but use
the opportunity so now we don't have to
worry about it we can just intervene
straight out other than tactics and
pretext its as soon as everything else
and it continues that way right through
the 90s and in fact it was that way
before the Cold War broke out I'm in
Cold War began in 1918 you know all
right and you know right before that
Wilson had invaded Haiti and the
Dominican Republic devastating invasions
but that was to protect us against the
Huns because the Russians weren't there
yet the and so it goes I mean this and
we know that it's mostly a pretext I
mean there's a superpower conflict in
the background but prefixed in fact that
became extremely clear and I mean
anybody who wanted to know anything
about this would certainly have looked
at a public document namely George Bush
the first first presentation to Congress
calling for a huge military budget after
the fall of the Berlin Wall right
there's one every year so the
interesting one was well what about the
one in March 1990 and it was interesting
it was the same as all the others no we
need a huge military budget but it
wasn't to defend ourselves against the
Russians because you couldn't pretend
that anymore
we needed a huge military budget because
of a I'm quoting the technological
sophistication of third world countries
that's what we needed and also we had to
maintain what was called the defense
industrial base that's a euphemism for
high-tech industry I shouldn't complain
about it pays my salary for the last 50
years but the way you maintain high-tech
industry is by socializing the cost and
privatizing the game and one of the ways
of doing that is under the cover of the
military budget so we have to maintain
the defense industrial base to maintain
very dynamic state sector of the economy
I say we have to maintain the huge
intervention forces which had always
been aimed at the Middle East and have
to continue to be aimed at the Middle
East then came an interesting phrase we
have to maintain intervention forces
aimed at the Middle East
no quoting where the threats to our
interests that required intervention
could not be laid at the Kremlin door
Kremlin's door okay so but sorry folks
we've been lying to you for 50 years but
we still need him and we need them for
exactly the reasons that were brought up
in 1958 and in fact throughout the whole
period because of independent
nationalism and the threat that it poses
however the clouds lifted at this point
you know you couldn't pretend anymore
that it was the Russians incidentally
the threats could not be laid at Saddam
Hussein's door because he was a friend
an ally at that time a couple of months
later that he committed his first crime
and disobeyed orders but and so there
you have it I mean sort of spelled out
and everything that happened since
supports it in fact you know it's not
that the Cold War didn't exist you know
it's not it in fact it came close to
blowing up the world several times it
was real but it's not primarily a
superpower conflict it was primarily
what's called a north-south conflict
used to be called imperialism in the old
days we don't like that word anymore so
what's called a north-south conflict and
the concern was primarily independent
nationalism and what was called its
virus effect you might have a virus that
would infect others No so Cuba let's say
the US for years the pretense was we
have to carry out terrorist actions
against Cuba and they have been
extremely severe and an embargo which is
very harsh the harshest in the world
even food and medicine and we need that
because it's a tentacle of the Russian
Empire you know it's gonna strangle us
just like Nicaragua was going
conquer the world that's why we needed
it in 1989 that was gone so we had to
have some other reason for maintaining
it notice that it all got harsher after
1989 so you need but with some other
pretext we also know why it started
because now we have the Declassified
records so the u.s. decision to
overthrow the government of Cuba match
it was considered in the summer of 1959
that's after about two months by the
National Security Council
two months after Castro took over but it
was formally made in March 1960
there's no Russian connection in fact no
they knew he would Castro it was
regarded as anti-communist I the Kennedy
administration came in they were gonna
focus on Latin America so Kennedy
naturally had a Latin American mission
which was headed by historian Arthur
Schlesinger you know he submitted a
report to the incoming president of the
conclusions of the mission of course he
discussed Cuba and he discussed the
Cuban threat the Cuban threat is the
threat of the spread of the Castro idea
of taking matters into your own hands
and then he pointed out that's an idea
that has a lot of Appeal around Latin
America or impoverished people are
facing very similar problems he
mentioned the Russian connection namely
the Russians are hovering in the
background offering development loans
and presenting themselves as a model for
development in a single generation it's
another case of the virus threat those
are the reasons you know then came the
Terrorism the Bay of Pigs the whole
business and if you look case after case
that's what you find it's I can't try to
prove it now but there's a ton of stuff
in print about this so what about a
substitute for the Cold War yeah are you
gonna have to have other pretext and the
new phase of the war on terrorism
remember it's 20 years old is a search
for some such pretext it's not that they
it isn't real that terrorism is real
enough it's some small part of it but
it's real but it is a pretty going to be
used as a
texts for everything else whether it's
giving the president you know the right
to negotiate agreements and secret or
you know cutting taxes on the rich or
forcing people to shut up or intervening
somewhere or whatever yeah it'll be used
for those purposes
