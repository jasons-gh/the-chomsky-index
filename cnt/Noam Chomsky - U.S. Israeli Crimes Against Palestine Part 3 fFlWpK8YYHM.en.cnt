is it winnable I mean that's like a
debate in the nazi general staff after
Stalingrad you know did Hitler make a
mistake in opening a two-front war you
know should we have knocked out England
first I mean that's the kind of debate
that takes place here now decades after
the Vietnam were that try to find check
and see you know history book press
journals a debate over whether it was
simply a monstrous crime the kind of
crime for which Nazis were hanged at
Nuremberg go on I mean insane today I
mean it takes a Obama he's considered a
principled opponent of the Iraq war a a
lot of praise of what was his criticism
his criticism was that it was a
strategic blunder like Nazi generals
after Stalingrad or what you could read
in Pravda 1985 when a lot of people were
saying openly have a strategic blunder
to invade Afghanistan we don't call that
principle critique when others do it and
what we call it criminal but to try to
look at ourselves is extremely hard I
mean not just in the United States
almost anywhere your own history is
whitewashed consistently amoo even do it
in personal life if we're honest it's
pretty hard to look in the mirror but
it's crucial if you want to understand
the world and it's crucial for the
entire world in our case because the US
are so powerful porton you don't answer
my second question sure I what's your
happiest moment in life happy that one
as I said I'm not going to answer
so clam chowder or something that's good
you just say clam chowder no no a lot
happier than that thank you again for
coming to speak to us today was very
informative in your talk you discussed
the importance of the Geneva Conventions
today and setting an appropriate
standard and code of conduct and
behavior and international affairs
especially in times of conflict you used
to give at conventions and we apply it
to Israel especially in the last of the
war and got some of the actions that
Israel's on the past I want to ask your
opinion do you think that these same
conventions and stands there should be
applied in moss even though they are
non-state actor you don't have
conventional military forces and also do
you think that you neva conventions need
to be adapted today for a question that
asymmetric warfare well on the second I
don't see any reason whatsoever why the
Geneva Conventions should be modified
for what we call a symmetric warfare a
symmetric warfare refers to our
invasions of other countries and
resistance to the invasions by people
who are weaker we didn't call it a
symmetric warfare when we were
supporting radical Islamists to try to
drive the Russians out of Afghanistan
okay we didn't call the partisans and
Europe a symmetric warfare when they
were fighting the Nazis a symmetric
whoever means when somebody tries to
defend themselves against us or our
clients and there's no reason now the
Geneva Conventions have to be changed
for that anymore than they were when the
Nazis killed the partisans you know so
the second question no as far as Hamas
is concerned Hamas is a political party
okay and I you can't really apply
international law to a political party
you can say that actions of the criminal
of a political party or criminal right
and some of Hamas is actions are
criminal so sure if
we'll take say the Amnesty International
report i mentioned it didn't just say we
should stop supplying arms to Israel
it's it we should stop applying arms to
Israel and Hamas you don't supply arms
to Hamas but if we were doing it we
should stop okay so sure same standard
should fly but it's just you know it's a
fantastically disproportionate that
Simoes meeting was to raise the question
I mean if Hamas for example says we'll
never net recognize Israel okay that's
there's political party has a right to
say that I'm its political party in
Mexico says I'm never going to recognize
the United States which sits on half of
Mexico obtained by conquest that's a
legitimate position the ruling party in
Israel the Coon happens to have as its
platform you can pick it up on the
internet it's official platform is there
cannot be a Palestinian state anywhere
in what they call the Land of Israel
stir it into the sea okay it's a kind of
like phimosis for a great plan nobody
talks about it because there are a lie
and clients so you can say whatever they
want and they're not only talking about
it they're doing it but sure if Hamas
fires rockets at stay wrote that we
should stop helping them do that and in
fact we should take actions to prevent
them from doing it now we know what the
actions are except the ceasefire when
the US and Israel did accept this is
fire the Rockets stopped and that's
officially conceded you can read it on
the Israeli government website official
website so sure we should take actions
to prevent criminal acts by sub state
actors sure I know my name is David
target one of the deans here and I
wanted to answer the question that
had about how what we can do about the
various political situations that we're
hearing about and actually the answer to
that question lies right here in this
room on 18 years ago the East Timor
Action Network on established if its
kind of core in here at an event that
took place in Solomon 101 when Allan
Nairn a journalist and Amy Goodman
another journalist had come here to talk
about a recent massacre in East Timor on
one of the last massacres one of the
most recent massacres that was part of
an ongoing series of massacres that had
killed roughly one-third of the
population of these teamwork and about
that quite a bit on and um people here
actually it only took a few hundred
people there's only you know four or
five hundred people in this room got
together and figured out strategically
who to talk to who to write to within
Congress on to end military aid to
Indonesia I mean that was actually the
very first step of the very first action
by the United States to it's a lie and
say that we really disapproved of what
you're doing in killing innocent Amore's
people and it was the beginning the end
of the occupation and killing a tease
for more on right now unfortunately
we're back on yeah well right now we're
back at we're back on in a similar
situation on and that is that we're
about to about to resume military aid to
indonesia and i was wondering what your
thoughts about that word and what we
could do about that at this point
history yeah actually
affirming eat ND e steamer action
network was quite an important action
the indonesian invasion of East Timor
began in 1975 with strong you escort all
the way through also support of Britain
France and others Indonesia's rich
country you know 10 pages to be friendly
to them and as he said it killed you
know maybe the worst act of genocide in
the late twentieth century or one of the
worst all completely with us support
opposition actually began in 75 but it
was minuscule on he talked to people
about it it did build up and after the
dealy massacre the one you're talking
about when Ellen Erin and Amy Goodman
were attacked by Indonesian forces it
did get some publicity and groups and
eat n was formed and I was extremely
important and remember that was 1991 and
the killing went on for another eight
years the Clinton administration
strongly supported support oh he was our
kind of guy the Clinton administration
said right through 1999 atrocities and
massacres continued is particularly
striking because this was the same year
that there was a lot of agonizing about
the Serbian atrocities in Kosovo which
were not near as severe as what was my
auntie steamer of course the background
didn't even come close finally there was
a major massacre in August 1999 and at
that point international protest and
domestic protest which by then had built
up and eat then I'd like to do with this
international for the protest against
Clinton was so strong that he took a
very simple step he told the Indonesian
army it's over literally they had sworn
they're never going to depart this is
our province we're going to leave soon
as they got you know a word from the
mass
same games over they immediately
withdrew okay that tells you something
that tells you for the first the
preceding 25 years the United States
could have stopped it you know with the
flick of the wrist you didn't have to
bomb Jakarta you know you didn't need
sanctions didn't eat anything just stop
supporting it it's over it's kind of a
little like what happened with South
Africa and it could happen in this case
200k students do what can we do now will
young protest about it I fiallan Aaron
who's pretty much living in Indonesia
now I'm taking very dangerous steps Alan
this fantastic person is now challenging
the Indonesian army to arrest him in
Indonesia he's publicly charging them
with the atrocities that he's exposed
and to be not a trivial thing to do in
Indonesia not a nice place so he's
protesting it quite openly he's
insisting on being allowed to appear on
television to denounce them do something
about it and he's calling of course for
an end to military aid to thee to them
and eat n is 2 so sure we can join those
efforts and support him he's still
facing serious danger thank you so much
once again for coming today professor
Chomsky and is a member of grad students
for justice in Palestine we would really
like to thank you for your message of
support but my question relates towards
the nuclear weapons particularly
American the American facilitation of
both the expansion of weapons programs
in Israel Pakistan and India which all
seem to be rather schizophrenic given
their complicated histories not only
among India and Pakistan but
particularly among box line in Israel
and India's vacillating relationship
with Israel so I was hoping you could
comment on that on the Israel into your
relationship on just all three in the
ways all three and the second I guess
equally schizophrenic policy of the US
supporting really just brutal regimes
particularly the South Ian like Arab
monarch to and the Egyptian government
who
in no way respect human rights and how
that facilitates American policy within
the Middle East and how that relates
very straight I mean let's take each it
yeah one of the worst dictatorships in
the region very harsh brutal
dictatorship you all read about Obama's
trip to Cairo now how he was praised you
know for opening his heart to the Muslim
world everything's going to be different
you know we love you and so on what
didn't get much play maybe almost
nothing is a press conference where he
was asked on his way to Egypt what are
you going to say about Egypt's as they
put it authoritarian regime I'm an
authoritarian is quite an understatement
but what are you going to say about
Egypt's authoritarian regime well take a
look at Obama's answer he said I don't
like to use labels for folks when a
politician pronounces the word folks you
just get ready for the next series of
Lies that's coming out otherwise you
talk about people but if you've heard of
folks you know so the next thing that
came out is he's a good man Mubarak he's
running a stable society and he's our
friend so I'm not going to criticize
anything okay what do you think
Egyptians or anybody in the Middle East
can how seriously can they take his
comments about human rights violations
in Iran how seriously should we take
them and Saudi Arabia is even worse you
know so what does this do for us I mean
these are loyal clients the Middle East
energy reserves are one of the most
important issues in the world you go
back to the 1940s high-level US planners
we're talking about you know this is
what they called a stupendous source of
strategic power I mean
and one of the greatest material prizes
in world history if we can control that
region we can control the world and so
on and that hasn't changed that's why
the US has a massive intervention in the
Middle East all the way through
replacing Britain which used to be in
the forefront and yes they support
dictatorial regimes I mean it's very
well understood you recall the George
Bush's plaintiff question why do they
hate us and the answer you know they
hate our freedom and so on I mean the
press was kind enough not the report or
commentators that the same question had
been asked by Eisenhower in 1958 he
raised the question why is there a
campaign of hatred against us among the
people of the Middle East not the
government's but among the people and it
was a little surprising in 1958 because
that was right after the u.s. it
intervened to kick Israel England and
France out of Egypt which they invaded
but still there was a campaign of hatred
well the National Security Council
released highest planning body released
the study of it and said it's true that
they said there's a perception in the
Middle East that the United States
supports harsh and dictatorial regimes
and blocks democracy and development and
we do it because we want to gain control
over their resources and I went on to
say well you know perceptions more or
less accurate and that's what we should
do okay then don't hate us because they
hate our freedoms they hate us because
they want their freedoms and they
understand that the u.s. supports the
tutorial oppressive regimes blocks
democracy and development and we do it
because that's the way we control things
and it's the same today actually after
Bush's rather ignorant question of the
defense Science Board one of the main
advisory panels of the Pentagon it came
out with a study you know why do they
hate us study and they said you know
it's not our freedoms it's our power
these they hate our policies for good
reasons as long as we so why do we
continue the policies when they we know
it's going to lead to hatred because
we're trusting the dictatorships to hold
down their populations just as we're
trusting Keith Dayton's army to keep
control of the Palestinians so there
will be a legitimate partner for Israel
I mean that's our policy not only there
but all over the world and we didn't
invent it the British did the same you
know the French did the same and so on
those are imperial policies we were in
favor of them okay let's be honest about
it at least and not pretend we're some
kind of a messianic wilsonian state or
not the three countries with nuclear
weapon oh the three thousand agree
women's well even the Pakistan develop
nuclear weapons during the Reagan years
and the Reagan administration pretended
it didn't though of course they know the
reason is they were supporting zeal Huck
who's the absolutely the worst and most
atrocious of the many military dictators
that Pakistan had zeal Huck was also
carrying out radical Islam ization of
Palestine of Pakistan with sooty support
most of this the kind of intellectual
roots of terror go right back to Saudi
Arabia and they were giving plenty of
money so they were providing lots of
funding for developing you know madrasas
actually means schools but special
religious schools where children are
trained just an extremist you know all
they do is read the Koran and you know
learn about extremist versions of Islam
the sooty versions and Reagan was
supporting that so we supported part of
his legacy is you know al Qaeda style
terrorism another part is Pakistani
nuclear weapons and the reason for it
was
you know they were the Reagan
administration was and also the
Democrats were very excited about
Afghanistan they were gathering up the
most extreme radical Islamist fanatics
they could find anywhere in the world
and sending him to Afghanistan and
arming and with advanced weapons and so
on the goal was not to liberate
Afghanistan in fact the head of the CIA
station in Islamabad Pakistan who was
running the operation was very straight
about it he said we don't care one way
or another about Afghanistan the point
is to kill Russians and he said that's a
noble goal and that's what we want to do
when they got that goal they left
Pakistan in the hands of us back were
looks were so vicious that when the
Taliban came they were welcomed so
that's Pakistan India actually the US as
long as India was either neutralist or
you know had pretty good relations with
the Russians the US was opposed to their
developing nuclear weapons and imposed
sanctions but by the Latin last ten
years or so India has been drifting
towards a closer alliance with Israel
and the United States so and part of
that context is well they can have
nuclear weapons if they like and will
support it the treaty that granted in
the the right to develop nuclear weapons
with our support has a somewhat broader
context for one thing it was sold here
straight out as for commercial advantage
that opens up India to arms sales from
the United States sales of nuclear
technology and so on you know like a big
market and growing country but also it
has to do with Iran I mean a centerpiece
of US policy is to isolate Iran now
India is energy short and the obvious
way for them to get energy is with a
pipeline from Iran and Iran Pakistan
India pipeline because Iran is rich in
energy but the US doesn't want that it
wants them not
to get Iranian energy part of the way to
talk them out of it was to give them
support with developing nuclear energy
which meant freeing up nuclear weapons
development and actually the invasion of
Afghanistan has to do with that too I
mean in the background of the invasion
of Afghanistan this goes back 20 years
is the idea of setting up a pipeline
from Turkmenistan Central Asia which is
very rich in natural gas one of the
biggest and world pipeline from there to
India which would run through
Afghanistan in fact it would run through
Kandahar the place that's there now
planning to attack and that pipeline if
it could be established would have two
functions for one thing it would
undermine efforts to establish Iran
India relations and it would also
undermine Russia's efforts to maintain
control of its former you know parts of
what used to be the Soviet Union that's
a kind of a background consideration for
the invasion of Afghanistan nobody know
it's just how significant it is but in
that context understandable can approve
of it but it's understandable why the US
government both Republicans and
Democrats would agree to support India's
violation of the non-proliferation
treaty and develop nuclear weapons as
far as Israel's concerned that goes back
to the Nixon administration Nixon
administration made a deal with Israel
that if you're in turn the details this
is a main book about it as by an Israeli
analyst of Newark Cohen that's in
English what he reports is that it's not
on paper but assume that Nixon and prime
minister golda meir just made a deal
that the US would permit Israel to
maintain its policy of silence you know
not admitting that it has nuclear
weapons and not denying it and that the
US would not interfere with that and
Obama reiterated that
after the international atomic energy
agency called on israel to open up its
facilities so yeah it's a client state
to valued US ally so if they want to
have nuclear weapons okay you started
addressing the question but you've been
talking extensively about what
international laws we violated and how
we violated them but maybe what what I
would like you to elaborate a little bit
on is why we violated them and as a
follow-up to that is what concern to
local populations / international law
which would give in our quest to global
domination and our access accessing
local local natural resources look I'm
supposed some unbelievably powerful
country from Mars that decided to take
over us agricultural and mineral
resources because they wanted them I
suppose they were powerful enough to do
it what would we say they should do we
know what we would say they should do
okay same when we carry out what's
calling literally called protecting our
resources so you go back to top US
planners you know George Kennan and the
rest we say we have to use force to
protect our resources which happened to
be in other countries but that's not
like an accident of history a Clinton
for example his official doctrine which
was worse than bushes was but it was
quiet so he made a fuss about it but the
official doctrine was that the u.s.
maintains the right to use force to
ensure our control over markets and
resources elsewhere okay that's our
commitment should we do that should any
other country do that I mean should
should do we did we support Saddam
Hussein when he invaded Kuwait why not I
mean he was trying to take control of
their resources which he actually had a
claim on you know there's an a serious
Iraqi claim to
quake which was sort of stolen from Iraq
by the British to block Iraqi access to
the sea when I stoves but did we say
okay that's fine you can protect your
you can take your resources by invaded
Kuwait I mean we have a principle about
this and we apply it to everyone except
ourselves for our clients okay that's
should we do that well it depends
whether you like to live in a criminal
state in a criminal society as far as
why we violate international law and
it's just pretty straightforward because
we can get away with it there's nobody
else in the world is not do anything
about it and as long as the American
population is passive and obedient no
but nobody will do anything about it
here I mean takes a the the World Court
case that i mentioned to repeat the u.s.
is the only country now having lost the
companionship of albania and libya the
only country that has violated a World
Court decision take a careful look at
that World Court decision it's very
illuminating the court Nicaragua brought
a case to the World Court run by a very
distinguished international lawyer
Harvard Law Professor the World Court
threw out most of the case almost the
entire case and just drew a decision on
very narrow grounds bilateral Nicaraguan
us treaty why'd they throw out the case
because the world Court's rules require
that it cannot adjudicate a conflict
unless both parties agree to the
jurisdiction now when the u.s. accepted
world court jurisdiction in 1946 okay it
added a reservation saying that the u.s.
is immune to any case that relies on
international law meaning anything
involving the UN Charter or the charter
of the Organization of American States
the u.s. is immune to anything brought
up under those
conditions meaning the US this is 1946
when it was pretty much running the
world essentially said look we do not
accept jurisdiction we do not accept the
application of international law to
ourselves so though in the World Court
you know accepted that that's the way
its rules work and it even goes on I
mean in a couple of years ago I forget
early 2000s Yugoslavia brought a case to
the World Court about the NATO bombing
of Serbia okay one of the charges in the
in the indictment the petition that they
brought to the court was on genocide
well the u.s. withdrew from the court
proceedings on the valid grounds that
when the u.s. signed the Genocide
Convention after 40 years it added a
reservation saying it doesn't apply to
us ok so we're free to commit genocide
well ok we're free to commit genocide
we're free to violate the the UN Charter
and any other international treaty
because we say so ok and we can say so
first of all practically nobody knows it
you know you have to be kind of like a
specialist in the topic to know it I
mean if we care about our freedom you
teach this kind of thing at elementary
school but almost nobody knows that
except the few specialists and it's if
it's brought up it would be considered
perfectly legitimate imma take say the
International Criminal Court when the
International Criminal Court was
established a couple of years ago it was
not permitted to include the crime of
aggression the most serious crime of all
because the US wouldn't tolerate that we
don't want the charges of aggression to
be floating around because we do too
much of it so that was knocked off then
even after that the u.s. refused to
accept the jurisdiction of the court now
the public wants to I mean the public is
strongly in favor of accepting
international jurisdiction but elites or
not so the US rejected the jurisdiction
of the internet
criminal court and in fact a couple of
years ago Congress passed a law which
the president sign which in Europe is
sometimes called the Netherlands
invasion act the law authorizes the
President of the United States to invade
Holland if any American is brought to
the Hague to the international court to
rescue them visit oh and can anybody
else even say that you know yeah okay if
you're a big enough bully and you have
an obedient population you can do what
you like thank you very much hi um I was
I was thinking um you talked earlier on
that the USA in America and Israel work
hand-in-hand together committing war
crimes and breaking international laws
and I know that the US USA gives over a
billion dollars to Israel annually and
we as US citizens up we just paid we
recently just did our taxes and I can
help but think wow some of my tax money
is going to go to Israel to help kill my
family and friends in Palestine and then
as Americans we go and try to enter
Palestine / Israel and we were given
denied entry and our American
citizenship are stripped away from us
and we give no they give us no reason
why like they give no explanations
denied entry and that's it who are you
referring to whom um I guess a lot of my
friends and families who are not
necessarily Palestinian Americans but
also asian-american are just not allowed
in not allowed entry you mean yeah are
given denied entry but are given no
explanations
that's the least of it yeah that's
actually this there are few Jews were
not allowed entry like Richard Falk the
UN Rapporteur for Gaza or Norman
Finkelstein maybe others Americans you
know about going to be Jewish but sure
that's bad but you know that doesn't
begin to compare with the crimes that
are being committed in the occupied
territories and certainly when you when
American citizens pay taxes that not
only are they helping fund Israel but
though they don't know it they're
funding an organization which is
committed by law in Israel to work for
the benefit only for the benefit of
people on quoting of of Jewish race
religion and origin and that
organization is not a small when it
happens to control about ninety percent
of the land in Israel and Americans are
contributing to that because that
organization has tax-free status it's
called the Jewish National Fund I mean
would you want to contribute to an
organization that is bound by law to in
say in the United States to control
ninety percent of the land for the
benefit of people of you know white
religion race and origin or something I
mean that's kept very quiet because of
Americans don't do anything about this
they wouldn't like it so okay that's the
task of people who care about the world
let people know
you
you
