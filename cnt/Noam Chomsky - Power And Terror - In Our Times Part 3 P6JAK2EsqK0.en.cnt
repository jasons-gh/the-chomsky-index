so than it used to be so like take MSNBC
I mean you know since September 11th
from each of the media have opened up so
much I mean I was on MSNBC for a long
discussion program on November for the
first time ever it's a reflection of
public concerns that are forcing the
media to open up a little and I hope
you're right it slowly move this country
yeah I should be I mean there's constant
trigger the concentration is true but
there are other pressures which I think
are more important section Thank walk
professor was me why is why does the
control Republican leaders water what's
the mechanism by which the government
influences the media to control or I
mean the government only shows but so
how does it happen like why I mean
what's you know like and it's like and
motivations that this conversation how
does de mean how does expose somebody
asked how does the government convince
General Motors to try to increase
profitez not going to sense the media
are huge corporations which have the
suite which share the interests of the
corporate sector that dominates the
government the government can't tell the
media what to do they don't have the
power to do it here and let me give you
a simple example really simple when the
you know the current Intifada started in
helping the occupied territories started
on number 29 ok October first two days
later Israel started using us
helicopters there are no Israeli
helicopters they all come from here
started using us helicopters to attack
civilian targets apartment complexes and
so on killing and wounding dozens of
people that went on for two days note no
Palestinian fire stone throwing from
kids on october third after two days of
this clinton made the biggest deal in a
decade to send military helicopters to
Israel
the media here refused to publish it to
this day there has not been a report
that was a decision of editors like you
know I happen to know the editors of the
Boston Globe I've been living there for
35 years I know all these guys I
actually went and talked to them and
they simply made it clear they're not
going to publish it and the same
decision was made by every other
newspaper in the United States the
government literally everyone the
somebody did a database search the only
reference to it in the country was a
letter to the editor in raleigh north
carolina now the government how long not
to publish it no if it had told them not
to they probably would have published it
just that I've been indignation you know
that happens to be an unusually narrow
and easily identifiable case but it
generalized somebody that's how come
welcome humanity is under the best
unheard than 200 years ago how come yeah
you mean in what respect right anything
it was better to have slavery and came
yeah I want to I want to see how did it
get better know what I'm fine i want to
say that we have to leave me right now
put it on but it's not like it was 200
years but how come now we are in the
past when we didn't wedding 200 years
ago on the photo was another thread yeah
Thank You Man no man it has itself
because now there's more about theirs
were means of violent the means of
violence are great question in other
words would be do you think that
humanity could leave peacefully under
capitalism or do you think that lemme
see another ideologies are facing well
first of all Gandhi was once asked what
he thought about Western civilization
and his answer was he thought maybe it
would be a good idea and you can say the
same about capitalism maybe it would be
a good idea we've never had anything
remotely resembling it and the reason we
haven't is powerful you know the owning
class would never permit it because they
know that they know perfectly well
capitalism if capitalist institutions
were established it would destroy the
economy in no time so therefore they
insist on a powerful state that
intervenes to protect them from the
ravages of the market okay everybody
seems to know this except it comes and
it's a system that whatever you have
this kind of state capitalist structure
that does what it does I mean I think
they're much better system as possible
and I think we should just like I think
there were better systems possible to
feudalism so you got to try them out and
establish me because there's nothing
special about this one I have this book
that they would like to present oaks let
me ask you a little compassion he's had
a very good weekend Mama's watch naps
I'll just my sister thank you what's
suggesting another system yes okay thank
you thank you thank you somebody I'm
going to really have to leave to say I
started it nine o'clock this morning dr.
Chomsky thank you okay I can't even
write anymore sorry what's new business
and you won't introduce us to you Oh
miss did I see you Ernest I asked you a
question Oh Monday yes thank you don't
be any picture with you yes greater
oxygen truth is illegal in decisions
about what to do to their lives
like for people who have understanding
if the need for greater social change
it makes more sense way to keep you my
full time country or it's a pencil York
okay I mean nobody knows this except you
you're the only person who knows
yourself and your interests and your
choices and your you know your degree of
connection and you're the only person
post a nice ever going to give me
answers to this goodness
so the Joe
Oh
Oh
no number
are they
fine
booty mama
show me
ah
show
Oh
I
the first article I wrote I know exactly
when it was because I remember the event
it was februari 1939 after the fall of
barcelona and it was about the spread of
fascism in Europe I'm 10 years old it
wasn't an activist but I it's a large
part of my life ever since then there
was a period of quiescence in the late
50s when old country was quiet but as
soon as things began to heat up again in
the early sixties got back into it with
some regret and trepidation I should say
because I know very well you can't do
these things part time if you get
started it's going to be all consuming
and I had lots of things I was very
happy doing and didn't want to give him
up but you chose to somehow warhead
cathal o by the time you know the
beginnings of the Vietnam War were
coming along it was just impossible not
to become involved the Vietnam War
actually began for the United States
1950 and from 1954 to nineteen sixty the
US had a kind of a Latin American style
terror regime in place and it wasn't any
joke they killed about 60 or 70,000
people but there was no protest zero
when Kennedy took over they escalated it
to a pretty soon it became a direct the
US attack still no protest I mean
through the early 60s
you couldn't get anybody to sign a
petition I mean nobody would come to a
meeting I remember we used to try to
organize meetings on Vietnam some of the
few people student couple of students
few others who are interested but we'd
have to put together half a dozen topics
I mean Iran Venezuela you know Vietnam
six other top then maybe you get more
people than organizers by the time by
nineteen sixty-five or 1966 it was
becoming a big issue but protests were
met with extreme hostility I'm going
take Boston right here there's a pretty
the rural city but we couldn't have
public protests against the work they'd
be violently broken up the speakers
would be saved from being murdered only
by hundreds of State Police and it would
be praised that the protests would be
the attack on the protesters would
recede be praised in the liberal media I
remember my my wife had two little girls
my wife and the two kids went to a
woman's protest it was no you know it's
like not throwing stones just people
walking around with children and this
was in Concord it's a suburb quiet
professional upper-middle-class suburb
and they were attacked people throwing
tin cans and tomatoes and so on and the
I was considered right it wasn't until
late nineteen sixty-six that there was
enough of a change so you could you
really had substantial public opposition
and as five years after the war was
started by then there were hundreds of
thousands of American troops rampaging
around South Vietnam and the word of
course extended to the rest of Indochina
and then nobody knows how many people
were killed because nobody counted so
I'm in another interesting thing about
the Vietnam wars we have no idea what
the costs were to the Vietnamese I mean
for the United States we know down to
the last person and the big post-war
issue is finding the bones
American pilots but nobody has any idea
how many of you Tamizh do it
and now I'm not going to take any more
time I'm not going to give any long long
glorious talk about Noam Chomsky I don't
have to the fact that 3,300 people
bought these tickets in about six hours
the fact that he is not just an icon
he's a voice of reason and conscience
and intelligence which is missing in
this country outside of a very few
people I am really honored very honored
that known after my nudging him for the
last eight years that that's why he came
you know because he just couldn't take
it anymore I am so grateful and lucky
and happy to introduce professor Noam
Chomsky
you
unfortunately I can't see anybody out
there but I assume they're people there
i'll be talking primarily about the west
asia what which overlaps pretty closely
with what we call here the Middle East
or the Near East some of these remarks
are going to be highly critical of the
practices of states in the region
including the currently most powerful
States Israel and Turkey in a situation
of conflict and threat the state
authorities will resort to any means
that they can get away with that
includes serious war crimes crimes
against humanity and they will do so as
long as their crimes are tolerated and
supported and sometimes encouraged by
the Overlord if the master says that's
enough they stop therefore it follows
that our criticisms should be directed
primarily to ourselves indignation about
the crimes of others is easy and cheap
and not particularly attractive
sometimes even shameful looking in the
mirror is far more important much more
difficult and in these and many other
cases our participation in crimes is
quite real and it proceeds at several
different levels they couldn't go on
without us support I'm the US have been
blocking any diplomatic settlement for
about 30 years the use of course
provides the military and economic
support and when israeli settlements
spread over the region to sort of
integrate
Israel it's the US taxpayer 50,000
people are tortured which is the
estimate its US taxpayer nothing counts
I'm the only when they invaded Lebanon
and killed twenty thousand people us lab
nani provided the means but vetoed
Security Council resolutions try to stop
it and so on doesn't matter I mean none
of this is an atrocity the only atrocity
is when they do something to Israel so
now the only issue now is suicide
bombers the when did the suicide bombers
begin last year as their crimes
undoubtedly terrible crimes one year of
Palestinian crimes against Israel after
34 years of quiet his rayul had been
immune I mean there was some terrorist
attacks on Israel but not from within
the occupied territories under the
occupied territories were remarkably
passive and that's how it's supposed to
be that's like Europe and its colonies
but when it goes the other way it's a
horrifying atrocity and in fact the u.s.
is escalating right now the last
December the Security Council and tried
to pass a European Union initiated
resolution calling for a dispatch of
monitors international monitors just to
reduce the level of violence and which
it has that effect I mean if they're
international observers around it tends
to reduce violent the USB dude it was
not it was barely a few words here not
reported yeah that enhances atrocities
back to the axis of evil
why an axis of evil well what's in the
mind of George Bush's speech writers
when they give him that phrase to read
the I mean we don't have internal
documents so I'm speculating now but a
reasonable speculation i think is that
all of this stuff is really aimed at a
domestic audience primarily well how do
you keep people silent and submissive
everybody understands this the best way
to control people is by fear and the
easiest way to
