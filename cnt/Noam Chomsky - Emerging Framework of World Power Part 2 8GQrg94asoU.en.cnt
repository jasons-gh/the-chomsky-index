with Drew they didn't stop there
terrorism against the Russians because
they love Russians they hate them but
rather because they had achieved their
objective which was clear and explicit
the objective was to drive the infidels
out of the Muslim lands so that they
could initiate their own reign of terror
as they immediately did in nineteen
ninety they turned against the United
States for essentially the same reasons
from their point of view of the United
States is occupying Saudi Arabia even
much more significant than occupying
Afghanistan for them their own terrorist
record goes back 20 years to the time
when the CIA and British intelligence
and its allies organized and trained
them in 1993 they made their first
attempt to blow up the world trade
center actually had much more ambitious
plans the sure you know there was a
Dutch government inquiry into the river
Nietzsche atrocities was just released
last week from it we learned that at the
same time that they were trying to blow
up the world trade center us c-130s were
flying radical Islamist Mujahideen from
Afghanistan to the Balkans also
iranian-backed Hezbollah fighters and
also a huge flow of arms going through
Croatia which took a substantial cut
they were there to support the US side
and the Balkan wars while Israel Ukraine
and Greece were arming the other side
which explains why unexploded mortar
bombs landing in Sarajevo sorry Ava
sometimes had Hebrew markings quoting a
British political scientist reviewing
the report that was published last week
by the Dutch government well why are
radical Islamists attacking the United
States while continuing to work as its
agents I think there's every reason to
take them at their word on their answers
to this as the scholarly literature does
and I suppose the world's intelligence
agencies as well roughly what I just
said so that's the
the traders but then there's another
very relevant population a population in
which bin Laden's horrendous words have
a certain resonance for example the
moneyed Muslims as they were called by
the wall street journal when it surveyed
the attitudes of wealthy Muslims on
September 14th right after a couple days
after the World Trade Center bombing
that means banker they were interviewing
in the Middle East bankers and lawyers
other professionals managers of
multinationals some of whom described
bin Laden as in their words the
conscience of Islam even though they
despise him and they fear him they fear
him for good reasons they know that they
are his primary targets there are very
strongly supportive of US policies in
general but very bitter about us the
u.s. role in the region the and they
state their reasons the Wall Street
Journal to its credit reported them
accurately namely the u.s. supports
corrupt and repressive regimes that
undermine democracy and development and
then there are particular policies such
as the support for the harsh and brutal
Israeli military occupation now in its
35th year actions that devastate a rocky
civilian society while strengthening
Saddam Hussein others nobody surveyed
opinions in the slums and rural villages
but if they had they'd find similar
reactions but harsher ones because
unlike the moneyed Muslims the people
there don't understand why the wealth of
the region should be drained to the west
and to local collaborators rather than
being used for the domestic population
well these attitudes which are not
exactly secret provides some of the
answers to George Bush's plaintiff
question why do they hate us and those
who want to add some historical death
can easily do so you can look back at
the Declassified internal wreck
so say back to nineteen fifty-eight
which was a crucial year in u.s. foreign
policy in that year there and the
records are declassified in that year
there were three major crises in the
world Eisenhower and Dulles president
secretary of state insisted that there
was no Russian connection in any of them
which is incidentally rather typical of
the Cold War period when you look
closely at particular cases all three
were oil producers all three were it's
Islamic Indonesia North Africa Middle
East but they were secular Islam in the
three cases in the Middle East
Eisenhower pointed out to his staff that
I'm quoting him the problem is that we
have a campaign of hatred against us not
by the government's but by the people
why well while this is 45 years ago not
after September 11th the National
Security Council explained highest
planning body I'm quoting them they said
in the eyes of the majority of Arabs the
United States appears to be opposed to
the realization of the goals of Arab
nationalism they believe that the United
States is seeking to protect its
interest in Near East oil by supporting
the status quo that means corrupt and
brutal governments and opposing
political or economic progress and they
point out that that perception is
difficult to counter since it's accurate
our economic and cultural interests in
the area have led not unnaturally to
close US relations with elements in the
Arab world whose primary interest lies
in the maintenance of relations with the
West and the status quo in their
countries so that's the policy we do
follow and we should follow and it will
lead to a campaign of hatred against us
much as the Wall Street Journal and
others found after September 11th when
they surveyed the opinions of the
wealthy and the privileged who are
closely linked with Western power and
support its basic objectives
well it's easy to go on with this and
it's not hard to understand but educated
opinion here prefers a different story
the one you've read over and over it
prefers ruminations about how they
resent us because of our freedom and our
love of democracy or because of their
cultural failings which go back to the
Middle Ages or be happy because they've
been left behind by the form of
globalization in which they happily
participate and so on and we can if we
want choose self-serving fairy tales but
it's not particularly wise nor is it
wise to pretend that we don't know the
answer to Bush's question we do it's
very hard to miss well those policies
continue to be operative not only in the
Middle East let's go back to Latin
America here are the policies are
similar and they are just as natural to
quote the National Security Council as
in the Middle East and they're also
deeply rooted not a great surprise to
Latin Americans or two people here who
want to understand our own country for
example by looking at the rich
Declassified record of internal planning
for example you can look back to a
hemispheric conference in 1945 which
laid out the framework for subsequent us
Latin American relations in that
conference in Mexico the United States
instituted what was called the economic
charter of the Americas and its goal was
and quoting the State Department now its
goal was to counter the philosophy of
the new nationalism that was sweeping
Latin America it's a dangerous doctrine
which embraces policies designed to
bring about a broader distribution of
wealth and to raise the standard of
living of the masses and holds that the
first beneficiaries of the development
of a country's resources should be the
people of that country quoting the State
Department and of course that's a
serious misunderstanding the first
beneficiaries of the country's resources
must be US investors
we have to protect our resources as
George Kennan put it top State
Department planner he was referring to
the material and human resources that by
accident lie elsewhere but are ours and
as he made clear and explicit violence
may be the only way you may recall that
Kenan was at the dovish extreme of the
planning spectrum he was removed in 1950
because he was considered too soft for
this harsh world he's now revered as a
great humanist the threat of the new
nationalism was overcome the US had the
force to do it one of the consequences
was described by the World Bank just a
few years ago they pointed out that the
region has the most unequal income
distribution in the world and there will
be chaos unless governments act
aggressively against poverty which is
appalling and its depth and scale and
that situation is expected to become
worse last year the US intelligence
community with the assistance of
academic specialists and people from the
business world published their
projection for the next 15 years their
projection is that what they call
globalization will proceed proceed on
course leading to a widening economic
divide and greater financial volatility
well a widening economic divide means
less globalization in the technical
sense of convergence to a single market
but more globalization and the
doctrinally preferred sense of
concentration of wealth and power and
more financial volatility while that
means slower growth and even more harm
for the poor majority so that's the
optimistic scenario these predictions
were a few months before September 11th
there's no indication that the these
tendencies of the emerging world the
framework of World Order there's no
indication they're going to change
except in one respect they're likely to
become more pronounced
with consequences as grave as those that
the world bank predicts and they're very
deeply rooted not the kind of policies
that change easily you can get some
further insight into the effects of
likely effects of September 11th by
looking back a few years to the late the
preceding moment when it was widely
argued that there would be a crucial
turning point in world affairs namely
the end of the Cold War that was
definitively over by November 1989 with
the fall of the Berlin Wall so what do
we learn from that historic break well I
think if you look back now with 12 years
13 years experience we discover
primarily continuity some tactical
modifications lots of new pretexts for
old policies but basically the same
policies the ones I've just outlined
which are indeed natural just as the
National Security Council recognized
deeply rooted in our institutions and
therefore persistent so let's take
October 89 right before the fall of the
wall a national security directive on
the Middle East recommended continued
support for our friend Saddam Hussein
called for the use of military force
where necessary and appropriate to
defend our vital interests against the
Soviet Union or any other regional power
not Iraq notice a couple of weeks later
the Berlin Wall fell a few months later
in March 1990 George Bush number one
sent the annual message to Congress on
the Pentagon budget same as previous
years we need a huge Pentagon budget but
now the pretext were changed so we still
needed a huge intervention force
directed at the Middle East where I'm
quoting the threats to our interests
could not be laid at the Kremlin's door
that's contrary to the preceding October
and all the years before in fact threats
were exactly the same as they had always
been namely indigenous nationalism just
as
1958 when I was internally conceded
there were no Russians or in Latin
America or South East Asia or Africa in
fact if you look closely consistently so
the policy is therefore continue but now
it's not in defense against the Russians
because they're not there anymore other
policies remain intact as well in March
1990 we still needed the enormous
military system not to deter the
Russians but in defense against the
technological sophistication of third
world powers and it's necessary to
maintain what they call the defense
industrial base it's a euphemism for
high-tech industry as before the
Pentagon system has to remain in order
to provide a cover for the dynamic state
sector of the economy that serves to
socialize risk and cost while
privatizing profit and it's yields
concentrated private power from market
discipline it's a leading factor in
economic development than in the
creation of the so-called new economy
and it also has to be extended without
substantial change same after September
11th but just intensified well back to
nineteen ninety military tactics did
change the Pentagon explained at the
time that the in that the international
environment has changed from being
weapon from the targets being weapon
rich that's a name reference to the
Soviet Union to being target rich that's
a reference to the south former colonial
world where there are increasingly
capable third world threats it's the
joint chief of staff at March 1990 quite
in conformity with the public message to
Congress targets are now going to
include nations capable of developing
weapons of mass destruction well who are
they any nation is capable of developing
weapons of mass destruction if it has
some laboratories a little bit of
Industry some infrastructure so that's
just about everyone the south is to be
specifically targeted
as indeed was true had been true
throughout the whole Cold War period but
now new options are available because
the deterrent is gone so we can do it
more openly and with less fewer devious
means nuclear weapons remain the
centerpiece of us strategy but now
enhanced to include the were called mini
nukes which are tailored for use against
rogue elements and these change now and
then so in 1988 shortly before Nelson
Mandela's African National Congress was
designated officially as one of the most
more notorious terrorist organizations
in the world while South Africa was a
valued Ally having killed only a million
and a half people in the surrounding
areas forget South Africa itself just in
the Reagan years at that was part of the
war on against international terrorism
which is now rida cleared by the same
people a few years later that
calculation changed and the recent past
goes right down the memory hole teaching
us absolutely nothing returning to post
Cold War planning Clinton's Strategic
Command recommended that nuclear weapons
should be used when needed in what they
called pre-emptive reaction leave it to
you to figure that one out but even if
they're not used they cast a shadow over
any crisis or conflict so they must be
available and visible to adversaries the
US must also move on to placing
offensive weapons in space it's in
violation of the Outer Space Treaty of
1967 which has so far been observed and
at the UN it's been reaffirmed in the
last few years the US and Israel
abstaining it's being reinvented and for
good reasons which are clearly explained
in Clinton Europe documents of the Space
Command they point out that in the past
navies were created
in order to protect commercial interests
and investments and space is the next
frontier and we are powerful enough to
monopolize it war planners furthermore
accept the same projections as the
intelligence community they also
anticipate a growing gap between what
they call the haves and have-nots as the
preferred style of globalization
proceeds therefore follows that we need
enormous destructive power in space on
hair-trigger alert in order to control
the unruly have-nots who are going to be
extending with globalization well these
clinton-era documents go on to give a
quite a chilling analysis of the
intended future they're actually not
very different from the recently leaked
Nuclear Posture review of the Bush
administration which created a
considerable stir when it was leaked to
military analyst William Arkin a couple
of weeks ago and published the
difference in reaction raises a number
of questions but I'll put that aside and
keep to the main point which is that the
basic policies remain stable through to
recent critical moments the collapse of
the Soviet Union and September 11th the
primary effect of the rida clared war on
terror has been to provide the United
States with a major military base in
central asia for the first time that
puts the u.s. in a strong position to
dominate the energy resources of Central
Asia but also and I think more important
it complements the intervention system
that's aimed at the far richer Gulf oil
reserves that goes from Guam to the
Azores but the closest nearby base up
until now was the island of Diego Garcia
in the Indian Ocean from which the
population was expelled the British
courts have since accepted their pleas
British Island their plea that they have
a right to return but there's a higher
authority which overturns that decision
the next target in the war on terror
supposed to be Iraq according to bush
and Blair and Clinton administration
officials and others we cannot tolerate
Saddam Hussein because he is so evil
that he committed the ultimate crime he
even used chemical weapons against his
own people those charges are completely
accurate they're missing only three
little words namely with our support
which continued without any change for
years after the ultimate atrocity he's
also charged with seeking to develop
weapons of mass destruction which I
presume is probably true but that charge
also emits a slight fact namely that the
US and Britain continued to provide him
with the means to develop weapons of
mass destruction well after his worst
crimes when he was a far greater danger
than he is now all of that means
straight out that we can't possibly take
these official pretext seriously and
anyone who even repeats them is just
saying I'm a servant of power and a
total hypocrite but there are more
obvious reasons there are reasons I mean
there are reasons and obvious reasons to
overthrow the old friend and trading
partner of George Bush the first namely
he's sitting on the largest oil reserves
in the Middle East after Saudi Arabia
and one way or another the United States
is likely to try to regain control over
them and the post-september 11
circumstances may provide a do provide a
window of opportunity however the
project faces several problems the most
fundamental one I think is trying to
find an acceptable successor regime
that's not simple the successor regime
has to meet some conditions it cannot
allow any Democratic tendencies because
if it does the Shiite majority might
influence policy towards accommodation
with Iran and the u.s. doesn't want that
furthermore the Kurdish minority might
gain rights that would threaten us back
to repression of turkeys Kurdish
population which remains very severe
that issue is not a new one it rose in
april nineteen ninety one right after
the Gulf War at that time Shiite
rebellion took place in the south which
might have overthrown the monster but
the Bush administration intervened it
refused to allow rebelling Iraqi
generals access to captured equipment
and it authorized Saddam to use military
helicopters and other arm means to drown
the rebellion in blood later Stormin
Norman who was in charge claimed that
he'd been snookered by the devious
Saddam he hadn't realized that when he
authorized him to use air power he would
actually use it the basic problem at
that time was explained by Thomas
Friedman who was in chief diplomatic
correspondent of the New York Times so
he's articulating State Department
concerns he pointed out that the best of
all worlds for the United States would
be an iron-fisted Iraqi military junta
ruling Iraq just as Saddam did much to
the pleasure of US allies Saudi Saudi
Arabia and Turkey and of course the boss
in Washington but since clones couldn't
be found the US was stuck with second
best namely Saddam himself well that
problem still remains currently the
State Department and the CIA are
reported to be developing contacts with
Sunni Iraqi generals recent defectors
and they might be suitable replacements
as clones but here there are some
problems to the favorite general has
Raji who's Saddam's former chief of
staff he may not be able to make it to a
planned meeting in Washington in a
couple of weeks because he's under
investigation in Denmark for war crimes
charged with participation in the
gassing of the Kurds
Halabja so some difficulties another
problem is one that's all over the front
pages namely strong regional opposition
even from queit which of course has been
exacerbated by the recent us-israeli
operations in the West Bank and they are
joint operations that's well understood
in the region even if a different story
is preferred hear the story preferred
here is that the United States is an
honest broker trying to deal with two
naughty children one of them is a man of
peace Ariel Sharon who sometimes gets
out of control and the other is the evil
Palestinians who refused to renounce
terror and to maintain this pose which
is close to a hundred percent it's
necessary to overlook as few small facts
namely that one of the adversaries is
the leading military power in the region
in fact one of the most powerful in the
world fully supported by the global
superpower the other is a weak
defenseless population that the
us-israeli alliance has ruled with
considerable violence and brutality for
35 years meanwhile rejecting every offer
at every effort at diplomatic settlement
while they proceeded to integrate the
territories within Israel and gross
violation of international law war
crimes severe grave breaches of the
Geneva Conventions and all that
continues I already mentioned the
Washington's renewed steps last December
to bar the obvious measures to reduce
violence and it takes considerable
discipline not to see what seems obvious
to commentators elsewhere particularly
in the Middle East namely that Powell's
mission was very carefully crafted to
ensure that the man of peace would have
time to complete his terrorist
operations in the newly occupied
Palestinian cities now it's true that
the president insisted that he must
withdraw without delay
but Powell was quick to explain in a
press conference right away that the
words without delay mean as soon as
possible kind of recalls Clinton's
deliberations on what is means you may
remember the man of peace is not asked
to renounce terror and of course the
master in Washington rather it's the
adversary who is imprisoned by Israeli
tanks unable to flushes toilet he has to
renounce terrorism in terms acceptable
to the master even though everyone
understands that those statements are
completely meaningless have no effect
whatsoever why well the story's familiar
again it's useful to look back a bit
Powell who's the administration's good
guy is following the model of Secretary
of State George Schultz who was the
official moderate back then in the
Reagan years this was at a time when the
United States was becoming an object of
international ridicule late 80s because
of its unwillingness to hear that the
PLO was calling for negotiations and
political settlement with increasing
intensity while the United States and
it's Israeli ally were refusing on the
alleged grounds that the PLO had not
renounce terrorism unlike say the United
States and Israel which can't carry out
terrorism by definition in his memoirs a
Schultz recalls all this with pleasure
he describes how he informed the
president President Reagan that Arafat
had said uncle hunk and Cole Cole Cole
but he hadn't yet said uncle with
sufficient humility to be acceptable to
masa the purpose is humiliation and
degradation not of our effort
specifically but of the Palestinians as
a whole for whom he's a national symbol
and they have to be taught that they
cannot lift their heads in standard
Israeli harland's 20 years ago during
another one of the periodic outbursts of
state terror in the occupied territories
very respected centrist commentator in
Israel your um Perry wrote that fifteen
years that's what it was then 15 years
of occupation have taught Israeli
soldiers that the task of the army is
not only to defend the state and the
battlefield against foreign enemy but to
demolish the rights of innocent people
because they are a bushing living in
territories that God promised to us our
aboushi ms the Hebrew word that's the
equivalent of niggers or kikes he and
others were horrified and not only by
the vicious brutality but also by the
techniques of humiliation for example
writing identification numbers on arms
of prisoners on a day of the Holocaust
which is a practice renewed in the past
few weeks again arousing heart ten years
before that Moshe Dayan had informed his
cabinet colleagues that the Arabs must
be told that they will live
