as Extreme as the political spectrum is
right now in the US there's still almost
complete uniformity on the war on terror
the stance toward Latin America
sanctions on Iran and there's really no
anti-war candidate despite popular
opinion agreeing on that why can no
candidate touch that the spectrum is
broad but in an odd sense the spectrum
is basically from center to extreme
right extreme right way off the spectrum
so the Republican Party about 20 years
ago basically abandoned any pretense of
being a normal political party in fact
distinguished respected conservative
commentators from the American
Enterprise Institute right-wing
think-tank like Norman Ornstein
described the Republican Party as a
radical insurgency which is abandoned
parliamentary politics they just don't
want anything to happen there were only
policies or don't do anything or bomb
that's and that's not our political
party it's that what happened is that
the party during the whole neoliberal
period both parties shifted to the right
as everywhere in the world and the
Republicans just went off the spectrum
they became so dedicated to the the
interests of the extreme wealthy and
powerful that they couldn't get votes so
they had to turn to other constituencies
which are there but were never
politically mobilized the Christian
evangelicals nativists who are afraid
they're taking our country away from us
people who are so terrified that they
have to carry a gun into a coffee shop
and that's their base essentially and
when you when you look at what that and
take a look at the primaries I mean any
candidate who has a semblance of
rationality is not even competing
it's so that's the Republicans the
Democrats have shifted to the right as
well the today's Democrat mainstream
Democrats are pretty much what used to
be called moderate Republicans somebody
like Eisenhower for example would be
considered way out on the left so for
example Eisenhower strongly made it very
clear as he put it that anyone who
questions the program's of the New Deal
is just not part of American political
life well by now that's a left-wing
program it's basically Bernie Sanders
it's a program that's eisenhower so the
spectrum just is it's true that it's
broad but in a very strange sense as far
as anti-war candidates are concerned if
they ask what it means so for example
Obama's considered an anti-war candidate
he described the Iraq war as a mistake
strategic blunder as he put it I mean
that's like Russian generals in
Afghanistan in the early 1980s who
criticized the invasion as a strategic
blunder that's not criticism of the war
saying you're making a mistake the
debate about the Obamas is running a
global terror program of a kind that has
never been envisioned before the drone
program it's now being discussed to an
extent because of recent leaks but the
the the questions that are being raised
overwhelmingly not not by Jeremy scale
and Glenn Greenwald but why most of
those who were talking about it is are
you killing too many civilians what
about just assassinating people because
you think some day they might want to
harm you
I mean suppose for example that Iran was
murdering
the people in the United States because
they think with some reason that they
might want to harm them
for example the editors of the New York
Times in the Washington Post who publish
articles op-eds they're calling for
bombing of Iran
so suppose they said well this is an
imminent threat let's kill them would we
accept that these the idea that we have
the right to use force and violence at
will is except that pretty much across
the spectrum
