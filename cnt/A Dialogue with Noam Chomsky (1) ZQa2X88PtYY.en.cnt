on the 2-ton on behalf of the organizers
of this event and on behalf of the cinta
de linguistique e'terica
at the Universitat Autonoma de barcelona
it's a great pleasure to welcome
professor Noam Chomsky and all of you to
this dialogue with him the organization
of this event will be as follows first
professor join muscular will introduce
professor Noam Chomsky and then
professor Leo Burnett will read aloud
some of the questions that different
members and associate of our Research
Center the CLT have sent to the
organizers for this occasion
let me say that the organizers of this
event are very grateful to the CLT
members and associates for the
collaboration and for the having put up
so many interesting questions professor
Chomsky received them as they were
originally formulated by our colleagues
but now for reasons of a space some of
these questions you will see on the
screen in the PowerPoint have been
shortened have been reduced and finally
let me point out that this event is
expected to last until 1:30 more or less
and okay so now professor join Muscato
professor of catalan philology and
member of the CLT will introduce
professor Noam Chomsky okay I'm going to
just say a few words and - no it's
almost impossible to introduce our
speaker I mean maybe if he was
introducing me he would might say
something new or something interesting
but not the other way around and I'll
just say that we are very thankful for
your willingness to share some of your
time with us and we are very thankful in
general for the time you're devote not
just by doing your work but sharing
directly with people what the meaning of
following Bertrand Russell's words are
some of the main passions that have
governed that govern your life thank you
very much la primera pregunta question
one says the following joint research of
linguists and experts from other fields
biology of physics etc should help us
understand the Faculty of language
better however in practice such
cooperation seems not to be feasible for
various reasons do you think that
relevant questions about the Faculty of
language can still be asked and pursued
with the theoretical tools that have
been used in generative grammar this
question is perhaps particularly
relevant for young linguists my own
feeling is that the current period is
one in which these connections and
contacts can flourish to an extent that
has not been possible before for one
thing it's now 50 years almost exactly
since Eric Klinenberg published his by
now classic work that founded biology of
language what later came to be called
bio linguistics that was a major
contribution set in motion lots of
research a great deal has been learned
about language the techniques of
psychological experiment
have become far more sophisticated just
in very recent years largely thanks to
new technology there's been a very
exciting work going on in
neurolinguistics which is beginning to
connect and quite interesting ways with
crucial issues in the study of language
could give many examples but I don't see
why if prac if in practice cooperation
seems to be not feasible I think that's
a failure of the individuals involved
the fields are certainly ready for close
integration and achievement the on the
50th anniversary of Eric Meno Berg's
book there's a new book coming out by
uncle infra Richie which is a major
summary of mostly recent work on
neurolinguistics it's a very impressive
array of materials that couldn't have
been imagined a few years ago and her
own ideas are also quite striking
including an effort to try to
demonstrate that quite specific some sub
areas sub regions in general general
Broca's area and their connection
through white matter which hadn't been
investigated
dorsal path to a posterior temporal
region apparently considerable evidence
that that's the locus of the special
capacity to of adult humans to develop
and comprehend and produce complex
hierarchical syntactic structures and
interpret them and there's even evidence
that the increase in myelination of
these fibers corresponds to an auto
genetically a development to the growth
of the increase of the capacity observed
capacity with psycholinguistic
techniques in analyzing and
comprehending and internalizing complex
linguistic structure that's if it can be
sustained it's a really substantial
breakthrough and attempts to relate the
the neural basis for language to
specific and quite intricate linguistic
capacities there's other work so for
example the studies and another domain
these studies of Ross Thornton on the
cont what's called the continuity
assumption the idea that a children
simply progress basically they must
start with not knowing what language is
the local language and they simply
explore the range of possible languages
as data comes in to converge on specific
for a specific class of languages
Charles Niang has done quite interesting
work on this
Russ Thornton's work is particularly
interesting and that she's been
investigating how children produce
spontaneously expressions which conform
to languages other than the local
language which they've never heard
evidence about so children who produce
long distance wh-questions
in the manner of some say German
dialects with an element left in that
the successive positions of course they
never heard it though children
apparently don't produce innovative
sentences that don't conform to
universal grammar principles that are
exemplified elsewhere the work of that
kind is extremely interesting a couple
of years ago some of the most exciting
work that I know of came out in the
connecting these fields one of the
critical questions about the general
architecture of language a general
question is to what extent does the
externalization process the mapping of
internal syntactic structures to some
sensory modality typically speech though
as we know now doesn't have to be speech
but the sign can be touched how to what
extent this externalization is appended
to the internal language system that
yields syntax semantics interpretation
at the what's called the conceptual
intentional interface and to what extent
the externalization actually feeds
processes internal to the core semantics
and tactic processes a strong thesis is
that it doesn't feed it at all that it's
ancillary but the properties of
externalization simply do not enter into
a syntax and semantics so for example
linear order which doesn't appear to
play any role or maybe it could be
argued plays no role and the syntactic
and semantic processes but of course
required by sensory modalities so for
speech has to be linear for sign there's
number of other options because of the
nature of modality some of these things
were explored by Tim level years ago the
differences between the modalities but
now there's quite a serious question
it's important critically important for
the general architecture of language as
to whether the externalization system is
completely separate from the core
syntactic semantic processes and as many
of you know there has been there have
been quite interesting psycholinguistic
and ignore linguistic enquiries that
shed considerable light on this question
began with the work of neil smith and
the attempt leon a subject they call
Chris who's cognitively extremely
limited very limited cognitive
capacities but quite extraordinary
linguistic capacities he can pick up
languages very quickly though it doesn't
really understand anything they can't
remember
I had to his bedroom for example but
what they should they began to
investigate how Chris would react to
invented languages that of two types one
type that conformed to Yugi principles
another that used principles that
arguably are not available to Yugi like
linear order so for example if you
construct an artificial language in
which negation it works the way it does
in say Italian and another language in
which negation uses the much simpler
rule of placing the negative particle
say a the third word of the sentence is
a trivial computational rule the actual
rules of the language are much more
complex so when you present Chris this
subject with the two types of invented
language how would he react to their
prediction which in fact was verified
was that he would be completely unable
to deal with the language with a simple
computational procedure using linear
order but would master easily the one
the invented language that conformed to
say
in fact was exemplified of the languages
and confluent energy principles they
then studied that and that worked out as
they expected they then studied the same
question with normals and had a very
interesting result which hasn't been
pursued more fully though it would be
quite important to try to do so their
preliminary result was that normals
could easily relatively easily deal with
the language that informed ug principles
the one that involved linear order they
could handle if it was presented to them
as a puzzle but they couldn't handle if
it was presented to them as a language
as if the set that was established by
establishing the conditions of the
experiment determined whether the
linguistic system was going to operate
or other cognitive systems are going to
operate these are preliminary results
which would be very interesting to
pursue the model was suggested to Andre
Amaro
many of you know to initiate neuro
linguistic studies and they carried them
out and be long they've since been
replicated many times it looks quite
solid what they found is naturally is
there with normals in the same
conditions if you present the uninvented
language which conforms to ug modelled
in fact on some language that none of
them know then you got normal activity
in Broca's area if you presented the non
linguistic example say negation being
the third word or using linear order in
other ways you've got diffuse activity
many parts of the brain indicating that
the people are somehow trying to solve a
puzzle not treating it as a language
that's quite interesting that's all of
this supports the conclusion that in the
architecture of the linguistic system
there's a fundamental break between
internal computation and externalization
with and it's it couldn't turn out to be
the case it's a far-reaching thesis that
I think we're finding evidence for that
the internal system is close to uniform
among languages the very little
variation among it may be none if we
ever learned enough and that the
apparent complexity and variety and easy
mutability of light which is quick
changes and so on is our properties of
the externalization system and the
externalization system you would expect
to be complex because it's trying to
relate to systems that have nothing to
do with one another the internal
linguistic system which I think there's
reason to believe evolved pretty
recently and suddenly in human evolution
and sensory motor systems which had been
in place for hundreds of thousands of
years and have nothing special to do
with language like gesture vocalization
and so on so matching these two systems
that of course raises many complexities
and it could be that that's the locus of
apparent linguistic complexity and
variety there's some similar
observations that can be made I think
about the nature of electrical meaning
word meaning which in deep respect seems
to be in complex ways common delight
Universal while there are external
peripheral aspects that very cultural
effect well these are this is just a
barest sample but indications of the
kind of work that can be done
integrating the psycholinguistic
experimentation which is by now quite
sophisticated neuro-linguistic work
which can be carried out in ways that
wouldn't have been imagined a couple of
years ago with more sophisticated
technology and experimental
sophistication and in advances I think
it didn't straight linguistic analysis
that tend to lead to particular
conclusions about the architecture of
language these things can be made to
converge it becomes quite exciting
prospects of them and all of that is
open many avenues for inquiry and
research so when I'm feeling about the
question is that we're right in a
position now which we were not fifty
years ago when Eric wrote his book to
carry forward the kinds of inquiries
that contemplated that many of us
thought about but couldn't be couldn't
really be carried forward at that time
now should be able to if there are
difficulties in pursuing it it's a
problem of the academic inefficiency
separation of academic departments which
shouldn't take place separation of
professions which tends to happen in the
or shouldn't and the great progress I
think could be made by overcoming these
barriers and pursuing the opportunities
that are now available for quite serious
far-reaching research so for example if
it could be established as many of these
results seem to indicate that the
continuity hypothesis what Crain and
others are investigating can be
established that children are simply
following a path dictated by ug
principles and exploring the range of
possible languages and converging on
their own if furthermore we can
establish or even approach conclusions
of the depth of where I suggested that
the external ization systems are tacked
on to the core linguistic processes but
don't interact with them these would
have far-reaching effects on the
descriptive study of language on the
historical linguistics and dialect
Studies on many other fields so that
looks to me like a period of very rich
prospects time one's very good to be a
young student so questions who
interdisciplinary approaches seem to be
necessary in space in such context much
theoretical research takes into account
psycho and neuro linguistic experiments
and other types of evidence this brings
back the possibility to incorporate
usage based approaches to language with
tools statistical analyses corpus based
research etc that are not always backed
up with theoretically sound research
questions what is your perspective on
this matter
the usage based approaches as they're
called are very tempting they don't
require knowing anything which is always
easy you can collect with contemporary
technology you can collect huge amounts
of data
you know billions of bits of data store
them in your computer you can there's
some elementary statistical analysis
that come up with some correlations
isn't that it requires very little
thought for a little understanding the
approaches basically assume that there's
nothing to learn that there are no
principles there there's no general
theories there's it's just that you say
language acquisition is basically a
matter of memorization you memorize
structures you know make minimal
generalizations and you're all done
nothing general to say about languages
it's just a lot of the collection of
data so it's very tempting it's easy to
do you can get a lot of money for that
Google was willing to pour tons of money
into it a lot of jobs incidentally if
just want to collect data and organize
it so there's a lot of temptations to
support usage based approaches and for
that reason they're for it popular the
question is does anything come out of
them well it's pretty hard to find
anything there have been some careful
attempts to try to analyze the claims
that are made within these approaches
the most comprehensive I know or by
Stephen Crane who's that
and he and his associates Russ Thornton
couple of others have done pretty close
analysis of the proposals that have been
made
Robert Berwick my colleague and I and
others have investigated the proposals
to deal with that there's one topic that
has been the study focused of more
attention within all of these approaches
than any other that's the question of
structure dependence of rules and we
went through the various attempts to
show you could that you could account
for these in statistical terms and
everyone is not only a total failure but
they would be a failure even if they
succeeded because they're all asking the
wrong question they're all asking the
question how could speaker Irving a
child an english-speaking child learned
that say in auxiliary inversion you move
the structurally highest auxiliary and
not the linearly closest vocally degree
even if you could show that there's a
way of doing that what you can't it
would tell you the zero because the only
question is why is it universally the
case that why doesn't the next language
do it a different way that's the
question and even if you could which
apparently is quite impossible show it
for a particular language it would be of
no significance whatsoever would be
amusing footnote so all the work is
totally beside the point it's asking the
wrong question and doesn't and cannot
get anywhere with the question it is
asking
now the crane has gone through many
other proposals about binding theory
many others and everyone collapses
totally so my feeling is despite the
popularity nothing comes out of it
except useful devices like a google
translator it's kind of useful it's
based on nothing but
you know association among correlations
and find among millions of words yeah
you can find things and tells you
something but it's kind of good to have
if you want to understand roughly what
might be said in some article increase
Greek you can stick it in and so on so
it's like having a better bulldozer
that's a good thing if you want to build
a road it's nice to have a big bulldozer
but it's of no scientific interest in
the vacancy and although I'm sure this
is going to continue it to be very
popular for the reasons I mentioned it's
intellectually almost vacuous you don't
have to know anything and it's in
principle vacuous because the claim is
there's nothing to know there are no
principles there are no you know uniform
things there's a ton of money behind it
because you can get moderately useful
devices it's the technology simple you
know accumulate huge amounts of data
elementary statistical analysis so it's
and plenty of jobs so it's it's bound to
be a major field but my feeling is when
the way the question is put I think it's
to the point understated when it says
not always backed up by theoretically
sound research questions I think the
right way to put it is never backed up
by theoretically sound research
questions that's a pretty strong
statement and I would suggest that you
challenge it to show that it I'm wrong
but I think that would be the fair
statement that's anyway s what my
perspectivism
so baby I would say mr. Martinez here
maybe we would say that those that you
know machine learning kind of approach
by Google and others will eventually
uncover complicated nonlinear relations
which are you know in the data which are
just merely correlational information
about something more sophisticated that
might map in complicated ways to the
kind of theoretical structures that you
and others favor when do you think
that's a correct respectable totally
misguided room I can go again okay right
so I was just I was just asking whether
so maybe we would say that machine
learning approaches to language
comprehension would uncover nonlinear
relations in the data that would
eventually map on to the kinds of
theoretical structures that you and
others favor so the idea would be that
that kind of statistical correlation is
not at all simple it's actually
extremely sophisticated it might be
another way of getting at the same kind
of hidden structure you can't say in
advance that nothing can come out of
this and in fact some things do come out
there are things you can do with what's
called the complex neural net systems
with many many layers and so
and so forth so for example one thing
that's done extensively is image
recognition if you put in billions of
examples and you have you always have to
have tutorials so you have to have human
tutorials and helping picking things and
so on then it turns out you can finally
after a long period of time get a pretty
good capacity for the machine learning
to distinguish this from this say which
could be useful for many purposes now
the next question is and this has been
pursued can we account for word learning
this way the way in children children
learn words by saying well they just
have billions of exposures to various
images and there's some kind of
reinforcement that picks things out and
the answer is a I think yeah there's an
answer at two levels but one level is it
can't be right because children do
they're learning words at about one an
hour during meaning on one presentation
during the peak periods of learning and
not hundreds of millions of examples and
tutorials and parents reactions have
apparently almost no say they just pick
them up automatically that's one level
of answer a deeper level of analysis of
answer is it cannot work in principle
and it cannot work in principle because
of the nature of word meaning a human
human language differs from every known
animal communication system in many ways
but one of the ways is that the
electrical atoms that you know the words
like atom elements that are the mineral
meaning bearing elements simply do not
have the properties of picking out an
extra mental entity every word this is
understood already in classical Greece
every work the meaning of every word is
in part determined by internal mental
processes so this thing is cup not just
because of the way it looks but because
of the way it was designed the way it's
used of characteristically other aspects
that Aristotle called form as distinct
from matter which are internal
properties attributed to things but the
mind and no matter how much image
recognition you do you never gonna find
it because you're looking under the
wrong lamppost of the meaning is in part
determined by the way in which humans
automatically reflexively interpret an
object as a so and so because of
features like design and tension
characteristic use and so on which you
can't see which a physicist can find
it's not in the extra mental world so
it's it's going to fail in principle
from the beginning actually this bears
on the question that I mentioned before
of whether there are going to be we're
going to discover some of the universal
properties of work meaning which are
invariant and are only modified slightly
in actual languages by peripheral
elements of cultural accident and it
probably will turn out to be true for
just these reasons these intrinsic
properties of lexical meaning are
universal so every language has children
just they don't learn them that's part
of what they bring into the analysis of
language very much like syntactic
principles I suspect that's what we're
gonna find so going back to deep
learning there are things that can be
done in a manner which is radically
different from anything that a human
does but I don't think they're gonna
they're aiming at the wrong target and I
think you can see in advance why they
will have to fail no matter how complex
and sophisticated they get that they're
maiming at a target that's here but the
actual target is over here so isn't more
parsimonious and more biologically sound
hypothesis to suggest that language for
organ may be a variation of modality in
the sense of wagner 2014 of some already
existing Oregon with homologs in other
extinct or excellent species possibly
serving their different functions from
communication or thought well frankly I
don't think the question arises it's
like asking Savior a chemist in the 18th
century and somebody said say at the
time when Dalton's theories of chemical
structure were being developed and
someone argued as in fact some people
did it wouldn't it be more parsimonious
if instead of all of these you know
complex notions you're introducing like
nucleus and
electrons and so on you could just do it
on the basis of Newton's laws period
like objects and motion like the planets
wouldn't that be more parsimonious it
doesn't mean anything
no the question is what are the facts is
it a fact that the chemicals the
chemical reactions can be accounted for
simply by Newton's laws or other special
laws of chemistry that we have to
discover that have to do with the nature
of the intrinsic nature of matter that's
the question there's no question of
parsimony so in this case the question
should be reframed I think as asking are
there homologies with other species if
they are what are they well the answer I
think is that human language seems to be
unique in fundamental respects that
doesn't seem to be anything analogous or
even homologous in other species
actually going back to Leno Burke's book
that was one of the fundamental things
he was trying to argue expressing the
general views of the day among the small
group of us who were interested in these
topics not very many but seemed to us
apparent from the earliest days of
generative grammar in the 1950s that
when you looked at the structure of
language you were finding properties
that had no analogy elsewhere in the
animal world and that's at a very
fundamental level so for example the
simple fact that language involves
discrete infinity most trivial thing you
can think of about language so there's
six word sentences and seven words
but no six and a half four sentences and
it goes on indefinitely that property of
discrete infinity is very rare in the
biological world if you look at say an
animal communication systems they're
they're either finite like monkeys calls
you know a monkey you know but half a
dozen calls or they're continuous like
the famous waggle dance of these
determining a distance height
orientation of state of flower which can
in principle can vary continuously
insofar as any physical the system can
be continuous you find one of the other
but notnot know discrete infinity and
any in fact down to the level of DNA
there doesn't seem to be any other
discrete infinite system in the
biological world so and as you go under
takes a word meaning it seems to be
completely different from animal
communication systems the the calls of a
monkey do satisfy the referential
criterion so vervet monkey for example
how does say half a dozen calls if
leaves are moving in a certain way the
vervet monkey reflexively produces a
certain call which we interpret as being
a warning call meaning maybe there's a
eagle coming by or something but the and
as far as is known every symbol in
animal communication systems is of this
type and as you go on to hierarchic
structure binding theory anything else
you look at there simply is nothing
homologous seems to be a fact one of the
things that Glenn over discussed in his
book which is the first
ever to have a comprehensive approach
for this is the plausibility of
discontinuity in evolution it's not like
what you learn in elementary school that
everything happens by small changes
there are sharp changes that can take
place that lead to small changes in
genetic structure that can yield huge
phenomenal differences then averts book
was actually written at the time when
there were only the earliest
understanding of this right at the time
he was writing the 1960s the Minoan
chicag had discovered the role of
regulatory genes in controlling complex
arrays of genetic processes and began to
understand that small changes in
regulatory circuits could lead to huge
phenomenal changes of the way Jacobi put
it in his work popular work the change
the difference between say an elephant
and a fly could be the result of a small
very small modification in the circuits
of regulatory genes that control a
variety of other change that leads to
sharp discontinuities and phenomenal
what we see among and phenotypes though
with small genetic variations and that
makes plausible that what appears to be
the case makes biologically plausible
what appears to be the case
descriptively that human language just
is radically different from other
systems that didn't just about every
dimension you can think of if what I
mentioned is what I said before about
the distinction between externalization
and internal processing turns out to be
correct and my own feeling is there's
mounting evidence for that would show
that there's another fundamental
distinction of the in animal
communication systems it's all
externalization there's essentially
nothing else and they are used for
communication a human language doesn't
seem to have those properties there's an
internal system which is a common which
is common to both production and
perception both input and output they
both access a common knowledge base and
communication of course communicate with
language but that is nothing special to
do with its architecture and in just
about every dimension you look at a
human language just seems to be a very
special unique development and it's not
surprising if you look at the nature of
human beings in the biological world
there's just nothing remotely like human
beings for kind of obvious reasons but
other animals are having this discussion
for example for doing anything that
other animals don't have
responsibilities we do and everywhere
you look it's just a totally different
species every imaginable respect and
most of it probably traces back to
language shielded capacities that other
organisms just don't have as you know in
the night from the 1970s on there have
been extensive efforts to try to show
that other organisms typically apes that
can have some rudiments of human
language the major project was the NIM
project organized by herb terrorists and
others every single one has been a total
failure you simply cannot get
and otherwise intelligent aid that has
about the same auditory system that
humans have to get anywhere in acquiring
most elementary rudiments of language
with the most elaborate training efforts
duplicated the environment of the child
nothing goes anywhere it just they
simply lack these capacities that just
as you couldn't train humans to carry
out the to the net to duplicate the
navigational capacities of ants they're
way more sophisticated than we are we
can't just don't have the capacity to do
it or the waggle dance of bees let's say
you no matter how much you've trained a
human could never do that we're just not
built for and other animals don't seem
to be built for having anything like
language as far as we know but so that I
don't think the question really is would
it be more parsimonious but is it true
is it a fact you know it seems not to be
Partho she supports a bin Brio he been
maybe just so we exist the problem is
just equating uniqueness with absence of
homology I think this is wrong so it is
not the it may not be true maybe it's
true
uniqueness with the absence of homology
is that a key is really meaning that
there is no homology because some
characters are unique like flight inbox
but still the structures that allow
flight in Bath's are homologous to any
vertebrate limb so you cannot jump from
uniqueness which is a basically a
taxonomic or fellow genetic notion from
homology or absence of it so you can
almost always leave open the possibility
that some homology exists independently
of uniqueness sorry
there could be commonalities underlying
apparent variety so even if you had
something unique to things that are
unique they might have common features
the point that's certainly true
I mean bees and humans have essentially
the same DNA you know if you take a cell
you just look at a cell from a fungus
and a human unless you're a highly
skilled biologist you can't see any
difference between them the eukaryotic
scalp cells look uniform across all the
whole animal world so yes there are deep
commonalities but that doesn't change
the fact that a fungus and a human are
very
different object
