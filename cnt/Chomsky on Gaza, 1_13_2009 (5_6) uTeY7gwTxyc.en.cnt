in fact the Apocrypha
latent that really is an impressive feat
for Western journalism especially
American journalism and intellect
culture to suppress it one day before
Hamas captured shall eat Israeli
soldiers entered Gaza Gaza City and
kidnapped two civilians the muammar
brothers their names are not known they
brought them to Israel and of course in
violation of international law to join
the thousands of other prisoners held
there close to a thousand without charge
and of course that had been regular
Israeli practice for a long time I
mentioned some of the cases now
kidnapping civilians is a far more
serious crime than capturing a soldier
of an attacking army but all that
remains in memory allegedly blocking
peace is the capture of shall eat again
that reflects the difference in
treatment between human beings on the
one side and two-legged beasts on the
other surely should be returned in a
fair prisoner exchange
but try to find an honest comment on
this anywhere
it was after the capture of Shalott that
Israel's military attacked passed from
vicious to truly sadistic but it's well
to remember that even before his capture
in June 2006 Israel had fired more than
seven thousand seven hundred shells at
northern Gaza since its September
withdrawal of eliciting virtually no
comment maybe none Israel has maintained
the siege ever since it rejected the
June 2008 ceasefire that it accepted a
siege is an act of war justifying
massive violence in response that's a
point on which Israel has always
insisted when its own access to the
outside world is hampered in any way in
fact it's the justification for major
Wars so if that's true surely should be
a justification for rockets the Israel
went so far in the siege is to prevent
the UN relief and Works Administration
the UN agency that keeps Palestinian
alive I kept them from even replenishing
their stores so when the ceasefire broke
down we ran out of food for the 750,000
people who depend on us that's John King
the Irish director of Lanois informing
the BBC well despite the continuing
Israeli siege again a serious act of war
rocketing sharply reduced during the
period of the ceasefire the ceasefire
broke down last November November fourth
with an Israeli raid into Gaza the raid
was very carefully timed as usual it
came shortly before from us talks with
Hamas Fatah Fox in Cairo that were aimed
at reconciling their differences and
creating a single unified government
that would have been the first such
meetings since the Civil War
in June 2007 that left Hamas in control
of Gaza and it would have been a
significant step towards advancing
diplomatic efforts so it was quite
useful to undercut that danger by
violating the ceasefire and then evading
Gaza killing six people the civil war
itself was instigated by the United
States and Israel it was a very crude
attempt to set up a military to carry
out a military coup to overthrow the
democratically elected government that
the United States opposes again pretty
standard practice
well the blockade was tightened further
after November 4th disastrous
consequences for the population both
sides escalated violence all the deaths
were Palestinian and that continued
until the ceasefire formally ended on
December 19th and Prime Minister Olmert
authorized the full-scale invasion a few
days before that about a week before
Hamas had proposed to return to the
original July ceasefire agreement which
Israel had not observed the that offer
was transmitted to a senior official in
the Israeli army by Robert pastor he's a
academic historian and a firm former
Carter Administration high official but
Israel did not respond except by
launching the invasion of course Israel
was aware that the head of Shin Beit
that's the Internal Security Agency was
quoted in Israeli sources on December
21st as saying that Hamas is interested
in continuing the calm with Israel while
its military wing is continuing
preparation for conflict okay so no calm
we'd rather have conflict
Israel's senior diplomatic correspondent
Akiva Eldar reports that shortly before
Israel launched its full-scale invasion
on Saturday December 27th Hamas I'm
quoting him from us
Politburo chief solid Michele proposed
cease fire and return to the arrangement
of 2005 which permitted continuous
opening of the cross of crossings to
four desperately needed supplies the
response was the invasion in a front
page think piece on the latest Gaza
invasion New York Times correspondent
Steven Lee Myers writes that in some
ways the attack on Gaza was reminiscent
of the gamble Israel took in Lebanon in
1982 when it invaded to eliminate the
threat of Yasser Arafat's forces is
correct there is a similarity and the
threat is the same he's correct but not
in the sense he had in mind
in 1982 as in 2008 the threat was the
threat of political settlement and it
was crucially necessary to eliminate
that threat that's again standard
practice and it's not that Israel does
not want peace of course it wants peace
everyone wants peace Hitler wanted peace
for example the question is on what
terms from its origins long before the
establishment of the state the Zionist
movement has understood that to achieve
its goals
it would have to delay political
settlement that mean while slowly
building facts on the ground as the
basis for some eventually settlement
even the occasional agreements as in
1947 were recognized by the leadership
to be temporary steps towards further
expansion the 1982 war is a dramatic
illustration of the need for
undercutting the threat
of political settlement it was called a
pre openly in Israel of war for the West
Bank we can get rid of the diplomatic
efforts of Palestinians which were
becoming very annoying we can continue
to take over the West Bank at the cost
of the destruction of Lebanon and the
killing of thousands of people the 1982
Lebanon War was followed by Israeli
support for Hamas so as to undermine the
secular PLO and it's dangerous peace
initiatives another case that should be
familiar if it isn't is Israeli
provocations before the 1967 war which
were designed to elicit a Syrian
response that could be used as a pretext
for Israeli violence and for the
takeover of more land that's at least 80
percent of the incidents according to
defense minister Moshe Dayan the F this
efforts persistent effort to delay
political accommodation has always made
perfect sense it's not irrational and
the same is true of the hysterical lies
about how there is no partner there
simply is no other way to take over land
where you're not wanted
