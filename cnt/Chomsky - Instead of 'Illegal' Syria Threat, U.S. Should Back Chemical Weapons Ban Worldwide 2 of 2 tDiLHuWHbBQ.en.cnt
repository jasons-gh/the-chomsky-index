chimes of freedom Bob Dylan here on
democracy now democracynow.org the war
and peace report I'm Amy Goodman with
nermeen Shaikh our guest for the hour is
Professor Noam Chomsky we're going to
turn again back to President Obama who
addressed part of his speech to the
nation last night two opponents of
military action on the right and left
my fellow Americans for nearly seven
decades the United States has been the
anchor of global security this has meant
doing more than forging international
agreements it has meant enforcing them
the burdens of leadership are often
heavy but the world is a better place
because we have borne them and so to my
friends on the right I asked you to
reconcile your commitment to America's
military might with a failure to act
when a cause is so plainly just to my
friends on the Left I ask you to
reconcile your belief in freedom and
dignity for all people with those images
of children writhing in pain and going
still on a cold hospital floor for
sometimes resolutions and statements of
condemnation are simply not enough
indeed I'd ask every member of Congress
and those of you watching at home
tonight to view those videos of the
attack and then ask what kind of world
will we live in if the United States of
America sees a dictator brazenly violate
international law with poison gas and we
choose to look the other way that was
President Obama addressing the nation
last night professor Noam Chomsky your
response to his description of those who
oppose military strike against Syria for
a chemical weapons attack once again
what's particularly interesting is what
he didn't say so yes
good idea to look at the videos of the
gas attack in Syria but then we could
also look at the photos of deformed
fetuses in saikhan hospitals still
appearing the decades after John F
Kennedy launched a major chemical
warfare attack against South Vietnam
1961 dousing the country with poisonous
dioxin laced Agent Orange dioxin is a
one of the major carcinogens the attack
was aimed at food crops in an effort and
ground cover the part of the general
assault against the country a huge
number of atrocities millions of people
killed that chemical the effects of
chemical warfare are felt until today
partially by American soldiers do or we
could look at the photos of other
deformed fetuses coming regularly in
Fallujah attacked by the US Marines in
November 2004 the killing several
thousand people destroying much of the
town using weapons which of unknown
character but which left radiation
levels that epitomy ologists has
estimated are comparable to Hiroshima
under the effects of that on high cancer
rates on deformed fetuses on children
devastated by horrifying deformities
that we could look at too those are the
ways in which the US has brought has
been the anchor for global security for
seven decades can run through the record
if there were time but everyone should
know it these of course that's not said
the USB the idea that the US has
introduced and imposed principles of
international law
that's hardly even a joke that the
United States has even gone so far as to
veto Security Council resolutions
calling on all states to observe it
national law that was in the 1980s under
Reagan no state was mentioned but it was
evident that the intention was to
request the United States to observe
international law after it had rejected
a World Court judgement condemning it
for what was called unlawful use of
force means international terrorism
against Nicaragua in fact the US has
been a rogue state a leading rogue state
vertically violating international law
refusing to accept international
conventions there's hardly any
international conventions that the US
has accepted and those few that it has
accepted our condition so as to be
inapplicable to the United States that's
true even of the Genocide Convention of
the United States is self authorized to
commit genocide in fact that was
accepted by the International Court of
Justice in the case of Yugoslavia versus
NATO that one of the charges was
genocide the u.s. appealed to the court
saying that by law of the United States
is immune to the charge of genocide self
immunized and the court accepted that so
the case proceeded against the other
NATO powers but not against the United
States in fact the United States when it
joined the world court it helped
introduce the modern world Court in 1946
and joined the world court but with a
reservation the reservation is that
international agreements laws do not
apply to the United States so the UN
Charter the Charter the Organization of
American States that the u.s. is immune
to their self immunize to their
requirements against the threat and use
of force intervention and so on it's
kind of astonishing I mean why now it's
hard to be astonished but
it should be astonishing that a
president of the United States who is
furthermore a constitutional lawyer a
graduate of Harvard Law School can say
things like this in the full knowledge
that the facts are exactly the opposite
radically the opposite and there are
millions and millions of victims who can
testify to that
today is happens to be an important date
the 40th anniversary of the overthrow of
the
parliamentary democracy of Chile with
substantial US aid because we insisted
on having a vicious dictatorship which
became a major international terror
center with our support rather than
allowing a democratic socialist
government well that's these are some of
the realities of the world of the
picture that the president presented is
that doesn't even merit a name fairytale
well professor Noam Chomsky why do you
think that the u.s. so quickly started
to push for military strikes and what do
you think the u.s. or the international
community should do to deal with this
alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria
what do you think the appropriate
response would be the appropriate
response would be to call for imposing
the Chemical Weapons Convention in the
Middle East in fact beyond but we'll
keep to the Middle East which would mean
that any country that is in violation of
that convention of whether it has
accepted it or not would be compelled to
eliminate its with its chemical weapons
stores just maintaining those stores
reducing chemical weapons all of that's
in violation of the Convention and now's
a perfect opportunity to do that of
course that would require that the US
ally Israel give up its chemical weapons
and permit international inspections
incidentally this critics extend to
nuclear weapons as well we the further
step would be to to move towards the
kinds of negotiations Geneva
negotiations that the UN negotiator our
left our Brahimi has been calling for
the with Russian support and with the
United States kind of dragging its feet
the Obama misstated that to last night
that's one thin hope and it's pretty
thin for some way to allow Syria to
escape what is in fact a plunge to
suicide or suicide
and why do you think the u.s. started to
push for military action so swiftly as
it always does the United States is a
violent military state it's been
involved in military action all over the
place that invaded South Vietnam
practically destroyed Indochina vated
Iraq this elicited a sunni-shia conflict
which is now tearing the region to
shreds I don't have to run through the
rest of the record but the United States
moves very quickly to military action
unilaterally that can sometimes can get
some allies to go along in this case you
can't even do that and it's just the
routine the United States is self
immunized from international law which
bans the threat or use of force and this
is taken for granted here so for example
when President Obama repeatedly says all
options are open with regard to Iran
that's a violation of fundamental
international law it says we are using
the threat of force in violation of
international law that to which we are
self immunized
there's nothing new about this can you
think of any other country that's used
military force that
anything remotely like the scale of the
United States during these seven decades
when according to Obama we've been the
anchor of global security
well Noam Chomsky supporters of the u.s.
plans say that the only reason that
Assad agreed to hand over a relinquish
control over commit chemical weapons was
because of the threat of military force
of US military force and what interest
does the u.s. have in striking Syria
militarily the first comment is is
correct the threat and use of force can
be effective so for example the Russia
was able to control Eastern Europe for
50 years with the threat and occasional
use of force Hitler was able to take
over Czechoslovakia with the threat of
force yes it often works no doubt that's
one of the reasons it's banned under
international under international law
the reason the pretexts for him for
imposing for preparing out a forceful
act have generally declined to the point
that even the British government hasn't
accept the government of Congress's
early by reject them and the United
States the government resorted resorted
to the what is usually the last the last
resort when everything else fails saying
our credibility is at stake that's
correct
u.s. credibility is at stake Obama
issued an edict and it has to be
enforced that's a familiar doctrine as
one of the leading doctrines of world
affairs at credibility of a powerful
violent States and must be maintained
its
occasionally called it the Mafia
doctrine it's essentially the doctrine
by which the godfather of rules his
domains
within the mafia system that's one of
the leading principles of world order
credibility has to be maintained but
that has many variants sometimes it's
called the domino theory if we don't
impose our will here the dominoes will
start to fall others will begin to be
disobedient in the case of Chile 40
years ago go back to that with Latin
Americans called the first 911 Henry
Kissinger explained that Chile under a
yen day he said is a virus that might
spread contagion elsewhere all the way
to southern Europe he wasn't saying that
Chilean troops were going to land in
Rome he was concerned rightly that the
model of peaceful parliamentary
democracy might spread in which case the
contagion which spread beyond and the
u.s. system of domination would would
erode just earlier on the program you
had an interview with soil and all the
latest Orlando with regard to Chile and
exactly the same doctrine applies there
the u.s. carried out invaded Cuba Pigs
invasion when that failed Kennedy
launched a an enormous terrorist
campaign murderous terrorist campaign
the goal was to bring the terrors of the
earth to Cuba as Arthur Schlesinger
described it and it is advisor about an
American advisor was in the hands of
Robert Kennedy and it was no joke was
very serious that's been followed by 50
years of economic warfare a very harsh
economic warfare all unilateral the
world is overwhelmingly opposed to it
but it doesn't matter we as a rogue
state we do what we like and the reasons
are explicit in the internal record are
the reasons you go back the early
sixties of your internal government
record
explains that Castro is guilty of what
they called successful defiance of us
principles going back to them under a
doctrine 1823 and no Russians just the
Monroe Doctrine which established in
principle our right to dominate the
atmosphere of us wasn't powerful enough
to do it then but that was the principle
and Castro is carrying out successful
defiance of that principle therefore he
must that Cuba must be subjected to
massive terrorism economic warfare and
strangulation that's been going on for
50 years same principle of the Mafia
principle the same was true in Vietnam
of the primary motive for the Indochina
Wars going back to the early 1950s it
was presented here as the domino theory
but what that meant was if you read the
internal records that there was a fear
or justified fear that successful
independent development in Vietnam might
spread through the region might spread
contagion through the region others
would attempt the same path as Vietnam
itself is have no great significance but
it might spread as far as Indonesia
which has rich resources and there -
there might be a move towards
independent development independent of
u.s. domination and it was even feared
that that might bring in Japan
John dower famous Asia historian
described Japan as the super domino the
US was concerned deeply concerned that
if Southeast Asia moved toward
independent development Japan would
accommodate the word that was used to
East and Southeast Asia
becoming its technological industrial
center and creating a
a system and Asian system and from which
the US would not be excluded but at
least which wouldn't control of the US
had fought the Second World War to
prevent that that's Japan's new order
and it was in danger of being
reconstituted if Indochina gained
independence
that's the domino theory and that was
understood McGeorge Bundy Kennedy
Johnson national security adviser in
retrospect observed that the Vietnam War
the United States should have called off
the Vietnam War in 1965 that why 1965
well because in 1965 a us-backed
military coup took place in Indonesia
slaughtering hundreds of thousands of
people at wiping out the only mass based
political party and instituting regime
of torture and terror but opening the
country up to Western exploitation with
its rich resources and that meant that
the Vietnam War was essentially over USA
1 its main objective is pointless to
continue it this policy is these are
major principles of world affairs and
they're understandable and they're
understood so go back to Cuba again when
Kennedy came into office he was
concerned with changing Latin American
policy developed the set up of Latin
American research Commission it was
headed by Arthur Schlesinger as a
historian it was an advisor and they
came out with a report was submitted by
Schlesinger to the president and in its
listener described the problem of Cuba
he said the problem of Cuba is the
Castro idea of taking matters into your
own hands an idea which may have
resonance in other
of Latin America where the mass of the
population is subjected to the same kind
of harsh repression that they are in
Cuba and if this idea spreads the US
system control erodes well going back to
the Middle East it's the same no we're
gonna go back to the Middle East just
when we come back from break we want to
ask you about Syria and the larger
Middle East context particularly looking
at Iran and looking at Israel and of
course as you point out this is a major
date in history forty years ago today
September 11 1973 in Chile Salvador
Allende died in the palaces the Pinochet
forces rose to power and it is also the
12th anniversary of the September 11th
attacks this is democracy now we'll be
back in a moment
