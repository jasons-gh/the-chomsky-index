one good u.s. critic Harold Rosenberg
once described intellectuals as the herd
of independent minds they think they're
very independent but their stampede in a
herd which is true when there is a party
line you have to adhere to it and the
party line is systematic the party line
is scored nation state power and two
state violence now you're allowed to
criticize it but on very narrow grounds
you can criticize it cause it's not
working or some state or denying
intentions that went astray or something
now you see it right now in the Iraq war
there's a ton of debate about the Iraq
war but take a look at it it's very
similar to the debate in Pravda during
the invasion of Afghanistan actually
wrap it up to a Polish reporter recently
and asked him he'd been reading Pravda
they just laughed
so yeah it's his name reprieve there in
the 1980s it's you know the the travail
of the Russian soldiers to negative
killed these terrorists you prevent us
from bringing justice and peace to the
Afghans we of course didn't invade
intervened in order to try to help them
let the requests for the legitimate
government and the terrorists are
preventing us from doing all the things
we want to do you know yeah I've read
Japanese can surgeon see documents from
the Second World War from the 1930s and
check same no we're trying to bring them
an earthly paradise but the Chinese
bandits are preventing it but like I
don't know an exception in history maybe
like the British Imperial and it's the
same and even people of the highest
moral integrity like John Stuart Mill
we're talking about what we have to
intervene and Indian conquer India
because the barbarians can't control
themselves they're kind of trosset ease
with the bring them the benefits of
British rule
civilization and so not in the United
States the same I take customers over
there was a critically important event
for the American intellectuals and the
reason had to do with what was going on
during the nineties the nineties are for
the rest not just the US and France and
England were it's probably the low point
in intellectual history for for the West
I think it was it was like a comic strip
and I'm making a satire of Stalinism
literally and you take a look at the New
York Times and the French press the
British press it was all full of talk
about how there's a normative revolution
that has swept to the West for the first
time in history a state namely the
United States the leader of the free
world is acting from pure altruism
Clinton's policy is entered into a noble
phase with a saintly globe on a nun
quoting particular this particular
that's a memory and charade that's what
we Kosovo right and it was it was
specific in a sense because it was based
on the claim that it was preventing
genocide
let me just read something that you said
in an interview around the time of the
bombing you said the term genocide as
applied to Kosovo is an insult to the
victims of Hitler in fact it's
revisionists to an extreme what is
remain rather the first let me just fix
the timing the things I've been quoting
are from the late 90s before Kosan yep
now they needed some event to justify
this isn't massive self adulation okay
Along Came Kosovo fortunately right so
now we have to stop genocide
what was the genocide in Kosovo I know
from the Western documentation but it
was a year prior to the bombing
according to just the Western sources
about two thousand people were killed
killings were distributed a lot of them
we're coming in fact could the British
government which was the most hawkish
element of the Alliance up until January
1999 a majority of the killings were by
KLA guerrillas we were coming in as they
says you know to try to incite a rush
serbian response which they got in order
to appeal to Western humanitarians to
bomb I will we know from the Western
records and nothing changed between
January and March in fact up until March
20th they indicate nothing
March 20th they indicator increase in
KLA attacks but it was by international
standards I mean almost invisible
unfortunately and it was very
distributed if the British are correct
the majority was coming from
KLA guerrillas and as it later turned
out to Calais it was also receiving
financial and military support they were
being split by CIA nearly in those
months okay so that's not to call that
genocide is really to insult the victims
of the Holocaust what Western
intellectuals were praising themselves
for their magnificent humanitarianism
and much worse atrocities were going on
right across the border in Turkey that's
blue side native matter the borders is
native they were saying how can we allow
this at the borders of NATO yeah I've
had inside NATO
where turkey was carrying it had driven
so probably several million Kurds out of
their homes destroyed about 3,500
villages laid waste to the whole place
every conceivable form of torture and
massacre you can imagine killed nobody
knows how many people who don't know
their victims tens of thousands of
people how are they able to do it the
reason is because they were getting 80
percent of their arm
and Clinton and as the atrocities
increased increased the arms flow
increased affecting one single year 1997
Clinton sent more arms to Turkey when
the entire cold people were period
combined up until we have insurgency
that was not reported in the West do not
report your own crimes that's critical
and minutes of all of this how can we
tolerate a couple of thousand people
being killed in Kosovo next to the
guerillas 'im yeah in fact the 50th
anniversary of NATO took place right in
the middle and we were Lamentations
about what's going on right across
NATO's border not a word about the much
worse things going on with inside NATO's
border thanks to the massive flow of
arms from the United States and that's
only one case however things were going
on all over the US and Britain
supporting them much worse but this you
had to focus on this that was the topic
for the heard of independent minds
played a crucial role in their
self-image
because they had been going through a
period of praising themselves for a
magnificence in their normative
revolution and the noble phase and so on
and so forth
so the bad sin and therefore you
couldn't ask many questions about it
incidentally the same happened in the
earlier phase of the Balkan wars so if
it's awful and so on and so forth
however but if you look at the coverage
now for example there's one famous
incident which just completely reshaped
Western opinion now that was the
photograph of the Thin Man and the
concept behind the barbed wire right oh
you remember the Thin Man hide the bar
wire so that was outfits and we can't
have Auschwitz again so you know
everyone with the intellectuals went
crazy French were posturing on
television and the usual antics well you
know it was investigated and carefully
investigate fact was investigated by the
leading Western specialists on the topic
Philip Knightley is a highly respected
maybe analyst and his specialty is
photojournalism his most probably the
most famous Western and most respected
Western annals do this he did a detailed
analysis of it and he determined the
effect was probably the reporters who
were behind the barbed wire and the
place was ugly there was a refugee camp
that people would leave if they wanted
right near the thin man it was a fat man
and so on well you know there was one
tiny newspaper in England and then 33
feet called L M which ran a critique of
this the British who haven't the
slightest concept of freedom of speech
that is total fraud the major
corporation I think media corporation
had publicized thee so the corporation
seed the tiny newspaper for libel
well British libel laws are absolutely
atrocious a person who's accused has to
prove they think what he's reporting is
done with malice you can't prove that so
and in fact when you have a huge
corporation with batteries of lawyers
and so on carrying out a suit against
women through people in offices they
were not private money it's obvious
what's going to happen especially under
these grotesque libel laws so yes we
were able to prove the little didn't
prove that has done that
put out of business there is just a
euphoria in the lip left liberal British
press after they put the newspaper out
of business under this utterly grotesque
legal case and British laws
left liberal in those papers like the
very and were just in a state of
euphoria about this wonderful
achievement they had managed to destroy
a tiny newspaper because it questioned
some image that they had presented and
they were very proud of themselves for
which was probably misunderstood or
misinterpreted
well fortnightly wrote a very hush
critique of the British media for
behaving in this way and tried to teach
him an elementary lesson about freedom
of speech we also added that probably
the photograph was misinterpreted they
couldn't get published well you know
that's when Kosovo came along it's the
same thing again cannot tell the truth
about it like I've gone through a ton of
reporting on this almost invariably they
invert the chronology the real
atrocities occurred as they were after
the bombing the race presented is the
atrocities took place and then we had
the bomb to prevent genocide just to
convert it
