there was some rhetorical
exchanges there were some superficial
signs of goodwill it was a different
atmosphere than bush and the Latin
Americans were happy that they weren't
insulted and she kicked in the face and
so on and that Obama seemed friendly so
there's a difference in style not a
difference in rhetoric but as Obama
himself said at the summit what matters
is not words but deeds and there were no
deeds to speak of you don't really
expect that at the summit so in a way
it's not disappointing but the only the
main issue that kind of overshadowed the
summit was Cuba the Latin Americans are
adamant that Cuba's should be restored
to the Western Hemisphere system and
Bush bush you know Obama continued
Bush's policy of saying we allow them I
mean he was highly praised Obama for
rescinding some of the more extreme Bush
restrictions on travel and funding these
are so these just wished directives when
it's not hasn't been policy before then
and he resented them in fact these were
so extreme that the even the
cuban-american community was strongly
opposed to them so they welcomed the
rescinding of these agreements but the
opinion of the American people is just
disregarded and at it's kind of an
interesting case I mean for now there
was just another poll i think maybe
seventy percent or something of the
population wants to establish normal
relations but that's been going on for
decades ever since polls have started to
be taken it was the 1970s approximately
two-thirds of the population were in
favor of normalizing relations with Cuba
these strong steps towards that and the
government is
totally disregarded them and Obama
continues he says the embargo will
continue that's the crucial part but one
thing has changed in recent years but
it's not Obama that is the direct
support for terrorist acts against you
that leveled off the 80s probably they
still go on but not this direct us
support with very serious terrorism
under the special Kennedy in later
Johnson and Nixon administration's but
that has declined maybe and we don't
know of any direct attacks for several
years but the embargo which is an effort
to strangle the economy that continues
now there is debate about it here the US
leave us alone in this when the whole
world as opposed you can see it at the
regular the UN General Assembly meetings
of course Latin America is totally
imposed but last vote at the UN I think
was 182 four or something like that it
was the United States Israel which votes
reflexively with the United States but
disregards the embargo and a couple of
Pacific Islands so essentially alone and
that remains in force the it has its
critics so for example the Boston Globe
kind of on the liberal side it's an
editorial right at the time of the
summit saying that we should rethink the
embargo it's not achieving its goal of
bringing democracy to Cuba how do the
editors know that that's the goal well
there's some evidence namely that's what
our leaders say but by that argument
Stalin's goal was to bring democracy to
the world because that's what he said
after all and if you're serious you
don't you don't pay any attention to
what leaders say that's standard oil
boiler plate what you do is look at the
record and this is a very free country
we have
voluminous internal record which
explains why the embargo was established
and why had sustained and it was very
explicitly to punish the Cuban people
punish the Cuban people so they'll
overthrow the government and that stated
very explicitly back to nineteen sixty
picked up in the Kennedy years which was
the most savage years to punish the
Cuban people make them suffer so they'll
realize that the only way they can get
out is to overthrow Castro and we have
to overthrow Castro because of his
successful defiance of US policies going
back to 1820s namely the Monroe Doctrine
which declared the right of the United
States to essentially dominate the
hemisphere was a right that couldn't be
implemented at the time there was a
deterrent mainly Britain just too
powerful so the British fleet prevented
us from incorporating Cuba into the
expanding Empire that the u.s. was
founded as an empire that's maybe the
only country in the world an infant
Empire is George Washington called it
was supposed to keep expanding and Cuba
was a major prize infected by the 1820s
Cuba was considered you know the most
important prize that the u.s. had to
take in order to continue its expansion
it was realized at the time that they
couldn't do it because the British were
too strong but John Quincy Adams it was
the great grand strategist of the period
highly honored for that today his
sensible proposal was that we should
just wait he said by the laws of
political gravitation a Cuba will fall
into our hands the way an Apple falls
from the tree what he meant was we're
going to get stronger British are going
to get weaker sooner or later we'll
overcome the deterrent we'll just grab
the Apple which indeed happened in 1898
the Cubans had effectively liberated
themselves from Spain and the u.s.
intervened and what's called here the
liberation of Cuba but in fact was the
prevention of Cuban liberation from
Spain the Cuban forces assisted the
American invasion date the words they
listened to the words instead of paying
attention to the deeds common mistake so
they helped the American troops land you
know they cleared the area could land
without being killed and so on but then
they were dismissed they weren't allowed
to attend the ceremony of Spanish
surrender and the US then employed him
imposed regulations including keeping
Guantanamo and an amendment platt
amendment which said well we can
intervene any time we feel like it and
from then until nineteen fifty-nine the
Cuba was effectively a colony effect as
mainstream American Historians like
Ernest May Philip Zelikow just say it
was a virtual colony until nineteen
fifty-nine which is correct soon as
castro took over a few months before
definite decisions were made but by late
nineteen fifty-nine internal decisions
were made to overthrow the government
because of its successful defiance of US
policies and for other reasons very
familiar reasons President Kennedy as he
was coming in he intended to turn toward
Latin America it's a little bit like now
he said well we've been neglecting Latin
America early which was neglecting Latin
America incidentally the best thing that
ever happened to its during this period
of neglect that Latin America was able
to take some steps towards independence
and dealing with internal problems
diversifying its external relations and
so on but now a Mama's lying very much
like Kennedy's he likes to compare
himself the Kennedy was ok now we're
going to pay attention to Latin America
so they better take that as a warning I
don't think he'll do it because they
don't have the resources at the moment
but best Kennedy did of course but
Kennedy had a Latin American mission
that was supposed to review the
situation in Latin America I give advice
as to what to do it was headed by Arthur
Schlesinger the very renowned liberal
historian who was his Latin American
advisor close to Kennedy on his young
wrote the description of the first
thousand days and biography of Robert
Kennedy and so on and Kennedy the
mission reported by Ashley zinger said
that there's a special problem with Cuba
and that is what he called the danger of
the spread of the castro idea of taking
matters into your own hands which he
said would have considerable appeal to
others in the hemisphere who are
suffering from the same kind of
repression poverty and so on that you
found in Cuba and that's really
dangerous and that's a very familiar
theme in fact that's the basic principle
of the post-cold war period you might
say it's there's a version of it called
the domino theory that's what's
presented to the public you know the
domino theory is say when Ronald Reagan
declares a national emergency because
the government of nicaragua's only
ex-army is two days away from Texas so
we have to tremble you know but or maybe
if you know Grenada has a fishing
cooperative so maybe the Russians will
lad there in bama's or something like
that or ho chi minh will conquer
indonesia or whatever it may be that's
this public version of the domino theory
which is it's constantly ridicule
