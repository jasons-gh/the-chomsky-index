cuz her know I'm Chlumsky thank you for
taking the time to meet with us very
pleased to be we had to come all the way
to Amman Jordan to talk to you if you
get a free trip yeah well I was thinking
that you should send flowers to the
Board of Control official who said that
you can go into the territories actually
birds ate the lettuce and the thanks
since it publicized the talk which
otherwise no one would have ever heard
of I mean I've talked it appears ate
before nobody ever knew we were meeting
you after the talk the conference talked
the video talk that you gave tubers ate
was there anything in that talk that
might have talked about you it was
mostly but it was about the United
States it was US Foreign Relations so of
course the Middle East came up and i
talked about Israel Palestine but I mean
it doesn't compare it it looks that I've
given in Israel you know the Ministry of
Interior apologized and claimed that it
was a simple misunderstanding that's
certainly false it was perfectly well
understood the the border official was
in constant contact with the ministry
and he was he played in a role he was
simply referring questions and comments
from the ministry and I understood
everything and there were reasons were
very clear and explicit why what do you
think the reasons worth what is done
they're the ones that kept coming back
from the ministry that he kept asking
over and over one was well he did
mention well then they don't like you
you know they don't like your views the
government so I said yes it's try to
find one government in the world that
does like my views has it happened to
many other country in the world Ronan is
one case of the country which wouldn't
allow me in that was Czechoslovakia
under the Russians in nineteen sixty
eight it's hard to think of the case and
outside of totalitarian states where
someone has been refused entry because
they've been invited to give a talk at a
particular University so I guess you're
going to use this I can hear your
lectures from now in them us campuses
that confine haven't intended to say
anything
if I'm asked all and why didn't you try
to come in after the after the ministry
apologized well I just not on time I
have a short trip several countries to
visit will go on to the next country so
you were here in Jordan there's eight
you were planned to go to birth date and
tomorrow you're leaving for beirut and
there's simply another time too and it
is an intention of the fact that you
haven't been to israel in what 12 13
years is it right no more intentional in
the fact that I haven't been to Brazil
for the same number of years or
Argentina that I've never been to
countries that I constantly invited to I
had a very intense series of requests
for visits that can take a christmas is
just a matter of a timetable mainly the
matter the time table and what's high on
the agenda so by the way we could have
conducted this interview in Hebrew right
you speak fluent Hebrew I'm rusty if it
was 50 years ago yes your father was a
Hebrew professor yeah I lived in Israel
for a while in my Hebrew was obviously
an American accent but it was for them I
can still read perfectly well but I
wouldn't trust myself to speak I have to
think too hard to get the words out you
know I think it emphasizes the
complexity of the issue because on the
one hand you I mean you speak Hebrew and
you come from a Jewish family and you
talked about anti-semitism when when you
were young and you you lived on a key
bullets and you actually considered
staying and ribbing it in Israel and on
the other side you the most outspoken
critic of Israel and I mean you
undermine Israel's existence right texts
and its rightful if I don't regard
myself as a critic of Israel I regard
myself as a supporter of Israel the
people who are harming Israel in my
opinion and so I've said many times are
those who claim to be supporting they
are driving helping drive Israel towards
moral degeneration and possible ultimate
destruction I think support for Israel
should be
I support for policies which are through
its benefit you talk about the fact that
you don't support the right of Israel to
exist as Jewish state I don't report and
should we search for droid Israeli
public saw you should go and shake hands
with his fellows leader and that's where
a lot just a couple of days before he
started the bombing Israel a couple of
days before and furthermore they saw
pictures of me meeting nasrallah but
they didn't see pictures of me meeting
his main animate with whom I spent much
more time Wally Jim blood what's
happening is that when I went to Lebanon
as in any other country I tried to find
out as much as I can about the country
if have a little time so I met with the
head of Hezbollah it's a major political
force in Lebanon in fact in the last
elections the coalition that baby but
it's also this this leader who's calling
the demolition of Israel and actually
what Hezbollah's position has been is
that any position that the Palestinians
except they'll accept he doesn't think
Israel should exist I mean he has so
many missiles which are aiming Israel
and now he's aiming to von Televi but
you know even their I'm sorry he
has missiles but they're used for
deterrence now let's go back a step you
said I'm calling for the destruction of
Israel or some words like now that you I
don't think it should exist as a Jewish
state yeah I don't think the United
States should exist as a Christian state
I don't think that Pakistan and should
exist as an Islamic state but there's a
big difference because the United States
and Pakistan there is no nation in the
world calling for their destruction and
having a nuclear weapon like Iran for
example like a brand does not have
nuclear weapons it's not calling for the
destruction it is calling for the
millers many jawed is very specific in
saying these are quotations that are
appearing is really pretty I heard him
say that him in his voice what hear what
he said is I don't approve that he said
in me he's quoting Khomeini during a
period when Israel was very close to
here and I didn't mind Khomeini saying
it he said in the end of time Israel
will disappear words like that no he was
very specific in
and I look the Israel isn't a position
of security well beyond that of many
other states which do not and insofar as
they call themselves not states of their
citizens but states of a particular
category of citizens objective in
principle so what should I understand
from your words but are you telling
Israelis go back to Europe we live as a
minority here in Israel take a chance to
really regard history sit on the beach
history what exactly we understand from
here what was exactly where action
tomorrow exactly what I write a thousand
times though I was opposed to the
existence of the Jewish state and I was
part of the Zionist movement remember as
as as a Zionist youth leader yes I was
opposed to the the forming a Jewish
state once it was formed 1948 my
position has consistently been that
Israel should have all the rights of
every state in the international system
no more and no less now Israel demands
more and I don't agree with it now there
shaboots you know like two weeks ago I
interviewed ership it's on on this show
and he said that quote you are our
enemies biggest assets our Israeli Dash
and Jews like professor Chomsky that's a
problem for Dershowitz I have no
interest in what he said he's a I mean
if you want the truth he's a dedicated
liar who's been exposed over and over
again he didn't quote me you notice he
didn't because he knows better than to
quote by the way he offered to come to
birthday to debate you do you think that
they would invite a person like there
shaboots to come and talk in verse 8 you
have to ask for it that doesn't make any
difference to me but I mean I've agreed
to debate him reluctantly because he's
extremely dishonest but I do it but but
this issue is absurd there's nothing to
debate I mean Israel should have the
rights of any state period it wants more
because it's right to exist is
questionable on other many other states
in the world but no state the United
States doesn't demand that Mexico accept
the right of the United States who
exists sitting on half
sitting on his city rat that's sitting
on half of Mexico because there isn't a
threat when you hear and listen what
Hamas leaders say what Iran leaders says
with his mala leaders say you understand
that there's an immediate threat I you
don't understand that in 1970s when this
claim was made for the first time as far
as I know it was when Egypt in 1971
offered is really full peace treaty full
peace treaty nothing for the
Palestinians 1971 Israel rejected it
because I would've meant we throw off
the Sinai it's the only state I know of
which wants recognition of its right to
exist is there any relevance to the fact
that you're Jewish do you think when you
make these claims when you when you
really do this all right since i'm
jewish and since i have a special
relationship with israel since childhood
and since I care about it I think it
should take positions that are moral
realistic and appropriate for its own
recent survival aren't you afraid that
even you if you feel that you're working
for Israel your arguments and you are
the very articulate in making your
arguments and are well heard because of
your world reputations aren't you afraid
that these arguments will be misused
from the academic boycott to to the
nuclear weapon and Iran well actually
the academic boycott if you bother to
read is one that I've opposed cause it's
free it's true that my statements will
be misused for example by Dershowitz it
was very dangerous for Israel but yes he
he's anxious for Israel stream Lee and
he distorts and this represents my
statements in ways which helped his
cause of supporting Israeli aggression
and expansion which is very dangerous
for Israel but even if I could
understand or try to understand the
academic philosophical approval of a
person like you for the freedom of
speech even if Holocaust deniers but
even which specifically its pursue
specifically for views you detest that
for which you call for a certain point
after certainly because history has
proved otherwise in your doesn't matter
those are taking a lot of responsibility
of your
I believe in freedom of speech for Alan
Dershowitz even though the record of his
exposed lies is in crime you're bothered
by der service lies and you're not
bothered by the lives of the Holocaust
deniers on a country I'm not I'm not I'm
not saying I'm bothered by dearth of
flies I say yes we should insist on the
freedom of speech for dedicated liars
and in the case of say the Holocaust
denial yeah that's of course outrageous
just as it's outrageous to deny what we
did namely wiping up millions of Indians
but you know the number one I think
argument against what you preach for is
the tumble scant double standards saying
that you know from talking of freedom of
speech in countries where freedom of
speech is does not exist you're going to
Lebanon tomorrow or when you go to law
even here in Jordan I don't think it's
limited to compare to Israel is Israel
as bad as other countries did I ever say
that you spend so much time targeting
insulin did Amnesty International asked
me to give a talk that they could use to
criticize human rights violations in
Israel now they did it for Syria but did
you have limit the time looking in the
map in the world there are so many
problems why sizzle in the center Israel
still if you look around is you know is
trying to struggling is trying to give
democracy away and has gay rights and
human rights if you started by asking
why is Israel in the center answer it
isn't not for me of what's in the center
for me is the United States and for a
very elementary moral reason the moral
principle is we are responsible for our
own actions and their consequences every
crime that Israel commits is because of
us participation and authorization so
any decent American citizen even without
a special interest in Israel as I have
should have these in the center of their
attention because those are the ones we
were participating in we're responsible
for and what is worse than your eyes the
actions in Israel and in the territories
or for example what's going on in
Afghanistan
how do you how do you prioritize these
two but there's no way to because I
talked about both of them all the time
but is Israel as what's going on Israel
as severe as what's going on Darfur
Afghanistan that's right down in the
case of therefore yes the crimes are
worse but there is much less that I
could do about them much less was
nothing in fact so yes it's fine design
petitions criticizing them but there's
no moral value delete it and you feel
moral value because you're a citizen of
the US and B you have connections to
Israel and you feel that you're part of
the let's put aside the personal
connection to Israel which is there but
if I had no connection to Israel at all
as simply as an American citizen okay
would be of prime concern because the US
is decisively involved Israel for
example could not attack as it could not
carry out the occupations on without
decisive and direct us diplomatic
military and economic support you know I
think you're taking a lot of
responsibility here a person should take
responsibility for what they are
responsible for yeah but you are so
convinced for many years in your
theories you obviously don't see an
existing danger to Israel there is a
dangerous posing a danger to itself you
see only from that thank you yet you're
asking Israelis it's really government
to take a risk you're saying for I'm
going back to the nuclear issue because
let's take the nuclear issue okay
there's a way to what if you're wrong
that's what I'm asking look you have to
make judgments on the basis of your best
assessment of the facts available so
that there's me as it shouldn't we learn
from history there were voices before
the World War who didn't take Hitler
that series and history unfortunately
prove us wrong how can you be so sure
that many jawed is not going to wipe
Israel amateur so therefore what you
should do is take steps to mitigate the
threat to the extent that it exists the
obvious step to take to mitigate the
threat is to move towards instituting a
nuclear weapons-free zone in the Middle
East region that will
mitigate the threat that is not ready
excuse me that's important now Israelis
who don't want to do that or harming
Israel but in your eyes you're quite
sure that this there is no immediate
threat on his room right now from
outside of Israel the thing is really
what if you're wrong what if you're
wrong and people are using your argument
to to have the international community
look the other way suppose those who
claim there's a threat or wrong and in
fact by making that claim they're
harming Israel yeah that's perfectly
possible in fact it's true so whatever
position you take there's a possibility
that it's wrong if you have the
interests of Israel at heart then what
you would want to do is reduce the
possibility of any nuclear threat in the
region and there is an immediate way to
do that which is supported virtually by
the entire world and that is to move
towards establishing a nuclear weapons
freezer town with and so let's let's do
that well Israel's refusing and the
United States is refusing now they
repeat the words they say oh yes a nice
idea but they say we can't do it until
it was a comprehensive peace settlement
well that's saying we can't do it period
now what's blocking a comprehensive
peace settlement well we know the answer
the United States and Israel are opposed
to the world on the exist on the on a
political settlement on the
international border with maybe along
the lines of the tabla negotiations
which would lead to a comprehensive
peace settlement everyone in the world
is supporting that now by opposing that
in the world and then you go on I it is
it is questionable of people it's not
that sure that the Palestinians can go
through with this agreement they have
the Hamas on one hand they have the
follicle I'm just saying look every
relevant actor is in favor of this now
Israel in the United States are not only
opposed to in words they're blocking it
in deeds furthermore international laws
in favor of it okay that's that's of
course your opinion I want my
that's where the look the occupied
territories Israeli actions in the
occupied territories with us crucial us
backing our first of all illegal Israel
recognize that in 1967 they're illegal
and their harm well that one fortunately
we can solve that problem we can't agree
though it's a complex situation it's not
black and white but I understand that
while your parents were were alive it
was you were more cautious than making
those arguments against against Israel I
don't make arguments against his room
it's for boys are located making these
arguments for Israel as you say was it
was it a factor I mean was it hard for
you because I didn't I was unhappy about
the fact that they were subjected to a
series of tantrums from hysterics in the
united states that i said the same
things and in fact they approve them so
when you when in israel they consider
you to be on someone who is harming
israel does it hurt your personal ages I
mean the public opinion I mean public
opinion is reading what you're planning
to what I'm asking the citizen are you
does it offend you personally are you
upset that that is the Cretaceous it by
the fact that people in other countries
in the world can film the greatest
danger to their country is it tiring
tiring yeah I expected any dissident and
critic can anticipate that they're going
to be subjected to hysterical tirades if
you're a Soviet dissident did you expect
to be treated nicely in fact do you
think of it isn't any country was
treated nicely let's go back in history
I'll just take Israel okay you go back
to the Bible you studied the Bible I'm
sure yeah in the Bible there is someone
who's called a hater of Israel the
prophet Elijah King Ahab you know the
epitome of evil on the vine so no way
you see yourself as a as I'm not saying
that no no I've seen the prophets as
intellectuals so it's your life mission
and therefore even at your my life's
mission it's the mission of any decent
human being take elijah or Jeremiah or
Isaiah
where they treated nicely they're
treated very badly Elijah was called a
hater it will carry through no hater of
Israel centuries later he was honored
but not at the time there were people
who were honored at the time centuries
later they're called false prophets
centuries later that was my visa I'm
laughing because that was funny because
that was my next question how do you
think history will judge you that's up
the history defensive when the Jewish
history it depends who wins the battles
if you had taken the other path in
nineteen in the 1950s and stayed in
Israel where would you think we would
find you I would be with my friends in
Israel and say the same thing and you
can read them in the press every day and
if you wouldn't live in the states where
would you live poor wouldn't anywhere
else twelve years ago you were asked the
question I was asked the question in an
interview in Haaretz and I said well I'd
certainly go to Israel but now I
wouldn't say that it's changed in the
last few years it's changed in ways
which are extremely harmful to the
country you can see it harming itself
day after day it's it's undertake it's
in a mood of not the whole country but
leading sectors including the government
are in a mood of paranoia and
irrationality which is harming the
country very seriously I mean you know
my own case is a trivial it doesn't
matter but just take this trivial case
if the Ministry of Interior had not
refused entry and I'd gone to get it
they wouldn't have to be the end of it
nobody would ever heard of it just as
nobody heard of other talks I've given
in verse 8 but that's minor on the other
hand purposely humiliating the Turkish
ambassador that's not minor but it takes
a the reactions of Goldstone report
which is quite interesting Israel has
turned it into an international incident
if Israel had acted rationally they
would have responded to the Goldstone
report by saying thank you mr. Goldstone
for your careful work
thank you particularly for giving us a
great gift as he did if you're concerned
about the safety of Israel should be
concerned about these matters because in
case after case the irrationality and
the paranoia is very harmful and
destructive and in the long term it
could be a lead to very serious
consequences professor Noam Chomsky
thank you very much Baba between Jeff
