I can think of an example about ten
years ago when I think it was during the
Persian Gulf War when a group of AIDS
activists when both to CBS and PBS
during the evening knew the nightly
newscasts and they started to chant
something like kill AIDS not Arabs and
they got into the actual Network Studios
when dan Rather first came on the air
and the same with the newshour with
macneil/lehrer and they started to speak
out and in Dan Rather's case they went
right to a commercial and in the mcneil
error news hour I went to they they said
you know these people are concerned
about AIDS and but they actually got
into the studios and of course there's
been major protests outside of networks
for a long time media activists who are
protesting their coverage there are if
you're interested the large-scale media
activist groups now being organized so
most of it's being done to my knowledge
by Bob McChesney at the University of
Illinois he was quite a popular network
point I'd like all three of you to
answer the same question but um David
Goodman I already gave you outside a
list of some of the countries the US has
troops and apparently there's 135 I'd
ask you to write something about it Amy
Goodman I'd ask you to have a radio show
which tries to explain to us why there
are US troops in so many countries
tonight I'd ask Noam Chomsky to answer
briefly do you think there are different
reasons why the US puts troops in
different countries maybe 135 countries
barbados Mongolia as well as some of the
ones we've heard of like Colombia and
Haiti what do you think there's
basically one reason why the u.s. puts
troops in so many countries and if so
what is that one reason or many reasons
well I mean there is an overriding
reason namely if you are a world if you
want to be a world dominant power
you going to have to have military bases
scattered as way of exercising that
power when needed so yes there's one
overriding read isn't reason than that
goes right back to the end of the to the
beginning of the Second World War when
before the Second World War the United
States was not a major player on the
world scene was regionally a little bit
cific and so on was obvious at the
beginning of the Second World War that
the u.s. is going to come out of the war
as the world dominant power and it
intended to maintain that power by the
use of force if necessary fact Bush's
national strategic strategy of the cost
so much anger rightly virtually echoes
internal studies of the State Department
and the Council on Foreign Relations
back in 1941 and almost the same terms
so yes there is an overriding reason but
then of course you look at the
particular places there are separate
reasons so the troops and in the around
the Andean region are there because of
the ending regions in turmoil and
they're surrounded by US military bases
it's a very strategically very important
part area for the u.s. it's a potential
source of energy on which the US expects
to rely there are a lot of popular
forces there and my own suspicions was
frankly that if the Iraq war hadn't been
so grotesquely mishandled by the
Pentagon managers an astonishing failure
they probably would have invaded the
andes by now but that's what the bases
are there for and in other places there
for other specific reasons I wanted to
apologize to the long line of people
there because we have had three
wonderful speakers tonight and not one
I'm only going to be able to take three
more questions so next questioner I'll
try to make it
I'll try to make it quick this is
another saddam question i read and share
international magazine over a year ago
that Saddam had died on april twenty
also recently they published that the
Saddam that was found is not the real
Saddam that it's a look-alike I haven't
seen major media delve into this any
further request genetic in you no proof
or anything else to have any comments on
it I'm very skeptical frankly but I
don't there's no evidence but I'd be
very surprised if they were true frankly
I don't think it matters quite contrary
to what was said here tonight the New
York Times did not say that professor
Chomsky is arguably the most important
intellectual alive and for some reason
but the professor has allowed this myth
the persist over the years rather was an
outsider who had a review in the New
Times Book Review section professor Paul
Robinson for some strange reason you
have not corrected that myth now as to
the Goodman book I find much it's
comical and misinformation here
particularly the question is learnt
question why do you perpetuate the lie
in your book that the race of the victim
determines who gets capital punishment
this is a well-known myth debunked by
issue number 116 of the Public Interest
magazine and your biggest lie perhaps is
your failure to acknowledge excuse me
your recent questions please our death
row is because they're killing
committing murders in excess of their
numbers why haven't you got there please
sit down thank you if you would like a
comment on the Paul Robinson review your
correct the line that was quoted was
from a review by Paul Robinson and every
time anybody mentions it and I have a
chance I say why don't you quote the
next sentence which said arguably the
most important intellectual alive how
could he write such
horrible things and terrible things
about the united states that was next
line which also ought to be quoted I
don't know what your point was but yes
that's been said over and over but I'm
glad you brought up the death penalty I
think if you want to get information or
facts on it a great place to go as a
national coalition to abolish the death
penalty that has lots of good
information and the single most
significant factor in whether a person
gets the death penalty because it's
interesting to point out that you know
of all the murders less than one peep
one percent of the people get the death
penalty why is that well the single most
important determinant is the race of the
victim if you're a black victim it is
least likely that the person who murders
you will get the death penalty next
question we started out with Amy talking
about we're being in a bleak situation
and there are two aspects of that that
I'd like to ask any of you to speak to
if you feel like you'd like to the first
is I think as as young Americans mainly
young Americans very young Americans are
dying every day in Iraq and of course
many more Iraqis I think many Americans
are feel completely cut off from the the
young Americans who are over there it's
they volunteered you know it's somebody
else's problem we're going around you
know the Red Sox are back in season you
know how how do you understand this way
in which we are and of course media sure
play an important role in this how we
are cut off from the fact that today
young Americans were killed in Iraq
Iraqis were killed and if we're lucky
we'll get to wait till sometime in
November to cast a vote in a swing state
for John Kerry and hope that it'll make
a difference and the second part of this
bleak situation is about that I would
ask gnome if you'd like to elaborate a
little on what you see those small
all differences and I'm not saying they
don't exist but what do you think are
the small differences that can on given
the scale make a significant difference
and in in this inner in intervening time
that we have where the killing will
presumably continue what else can we be
doing other than wait until sometime in
November to cast that vote well first of
all my own view as you may or may not
know is that elections are a relatively
insignificant aspect of what we ought to
be doing I mean they're the propaganda
system including the media tries to get
you to focus you know laser-like on the
fact that once every four years you have
a chance to vote for two very similar
candidates from the business party
that's not the important form of
political activism if we want to stop
being a failed state and become a
Democratic Society the things are going
to happen to have to happen in between
the four-year period you want to say
take thick Haiti a tech Haiti the
poorest country in the hemisphere how
was our state elected our Steve was
elected because in the slums and the
hills of Haiti where most of the
population lives there was actually a
lively vibrant civil society organized
with a lot of grassroots movements and
other kinds of activism and nobody's
made any attention to it because pay
attention to what those guys are doing
but to everyone's amazement they
succeeded in elekton their own candidate
and vote of the US had a candidate in
that election a world bank official who
everyone assumed would sail through at
all the capital and everything else he
got fourteen percent of the vote they
succeeded in developing a democratic
society that could elect someone of
their own we can't even imagine that we
can take lessons from Haiti about what
democracy is and it's not showing up
every four years and saying vote for me
that's not what democracy is it's all
the things that happen to build up a
democratic culture where you can
you're on candidates now you don't have
to choose between you know two men
warned great wealth and political
influence who went to the same elite
University and joined the same secret
society and our financed by the pretty
much the same corporate sources that
allow them to run yeah upends you'd get
a Democratic Society what are the
difference is i think you know as well
as I do there are differences in the
bush administration there there are very
dangerous internationally they're not
only the invasion of Iraq but many other
things they're pressing for development
of military programs which probably may
very well do us all in I mean Clinton
was pushing them to but not at this
level they've compelled the Russians to
respond Russia has tripled roughly
tripled its military expenditures since
they came in and developing new
offensive military weapons as a
perfectly predictable reaction to the
vast escalation that they are carrying
out their developing new kinds of
nuclear weapons with are called
low-yield nuclear weapons bunker busters
which sounds kind of nice until you read
the technical literature and discover
that both the Russian and the American
strategic analysts agree that the point
of the bunker busters is to destroy
Russian command bunkers with nuclear
weapons hidden inside mountains just
like ours are so that they'll be
vulnerable to a direct attack and
they're responding exactly's everyone
knew by extending their offensive
military weaponry threatening us China's
gonna do the same and so on that's
extreme bush like Clinton might pursue
similar programs but nothing at this
level domestically there's a very
substantial difference if you look at
tax programs
the social benefits programs and so on
the people around Bush are making a very
dedicated effort to dismantle and
destroy the entire array of progressive
legislation and achievements that's been
reached in the last century ok now the
Bush Clinton people aren't all that much
different but they don't have this
visceral hatred for democracy and social
welfare that you find in the bush
programs but they're not going to push
through a tax program like wishes well
those are small differences but they do
translate into big effects I I am going
to have to make this the last question
from the audience I'm sorry anyone who'd
like to comment um is the 911 Commission
a step forward to you and giving the
public more objective information or is
it a step backward into heightened
partisan debate or is it neither to you
well there's something very interesting
about the 911 Commission and about the
Clarke revelations and the O'Neill
revelations and so on and the the
interesting question is why anybody
cares I mean why is anybody surprised to
discover that the priority of the Bush
administration was to invade Iraq and
the terror was a much lower concern and
we know that if we were able to believe
to express to think if we were able to
think what the majority of people in
Baghdad Express if we could reach that
level of you know I don't know
independence and intellectual culture we
see that it's obvious yeah their main
priority was to gain the first secure
military bases and dependent client
state right in the heart of the major
oil-producing region in the world and
the question of terror was quite
secondary in that respect in fact we
don't have to argue about it what was
the invasion of Iraq about I mean they
understood perfectly well
