like anything that we understand about
at all with regard to things as
complicated as human affairs the answers
are pretty trivial if they're not
trivial we don't understand it there is
category of intellectuals who are
undoubtedly perfectly sincere whoo-hoo
if you look at it from the outside what
they're actually doing is using poetic
words and complicated constructions
which apparently they seem to understand
because they talk to each other most of
the time I can't understand what they
kept talking about and you know the
people are supposed to be in my field
and it's over inflated and the lot of
prestige and so on has a terrible effect
in the third world in the first world
rich countries it didn't really matter
that much so if a lot of nonsense goes
on in the Paris cafes or the Yale
comparative learish department well okay
on the other hand in the third world
popular movements really need serious
intellectuals to participate and if
they're all ranting of postmodern
absurdities well they're gone I mean
I've seen real examples but give them to
you but so there is that category and
it's considered very left-wing and very
advanced and so on and so forth well
some of what appears in it actually
makes sense but when you reproduce it in
mono syllables it turns out to be true
isms so yes it is perfectly true that if
you look at scientists in the West
they're mostly men it's perfectly true
that women who had a hard time breaking
into the scientific fields and it's
perfectly true that there are
institutional factors determining how
science proceeds that reflect power
structures I mean all of this can be
described literally in mono syllables
and it turns out to be true isms when
you okay on the other hand you don't get
to be a respected intellectual by
presenting truisms and mono syllables
now a lot of the left criticism so when
the left so-called left prism
left when the left criticism so called
happens to be accurate okay that's fine
so if you point out a lot of things just
like what I mentioned there are a lot of
no that's fine
point it out you know everybody
understand it take a look to see it's
true and so on and it had a lot of
bullets so-called left criticisms these
from pure nonsense
in fact that's been demonstrated
conclusively so there's a very important
book by Jean Rico and Alan SoCal forget
what it's called dangerous allusions or
something where they simply go through
the they happen to concentrate on Paris
which is the center of the rot but it's
all over and they go through the most
respected French intellectuals and run
through what they say about science and
you know it is so embarrassing that you
kind of cringe when you read it actually
sometimes one of my fate was striking
ones is one of the very few who actually
is a scientist and know something about
science let tor has a background in
science and philosophy of science they
go through an article of his and I think
I'm remembering correctly in which he
he's somebody in France had or somewhere
had discovered that one of the pharaohs
had died of tuberculosis and they did it
by you know analysis of whatever DNA or
something Latour wrote an article
ridiculing this this is totally deserved
because because he had welcomed a
tuberculosis only discovered in the 19th
century how could everything's a social
construction and therefore it wasn't
constructed yet so yes so it didn't have
it I mean you know it's kind of at the
level of Bush and Chirac but but it's
taken very seriously and this is
considered very leftist but one point to
look at I think is that the description
of intellectuals the description of
journalists and now the description of
this sector a part of what calls it's
off the left you have something similar
going on even though the price is much
lower you have those guys sitting in the
air-conditioned rooms bombing the hell
out of the world
for their careers for their for their
status because of the reflexive lessons
that they've learned and then over here
you have people who are in literary
criticism or whatever field they might
be in who are also completely divorced
from reality or obscuring it or dialling
it up for similar reasons of course the
price is much less high but it's there
yeah but it's still rich countries it's
just dependent it's still not like that
bombing the world yeah but it's the same
phenomenon they're hard to understand I
mean if you they're nice people a lot of
my friends if you look at what's
happening I think it's it's pretty easy
to figure out what's going on
I mean suppose you're a little literary
scholar or some elite University or you
know anthropologist or whatever I mean
if you do your work seriously that's
fine you know but not very I mean you
don't get a it prizes for it on the
other end you take a look over in the
rest of the university and you got these
guys in the physics department and the
math department and they have all kind
our complicated theories which of course
we can't understand but they seem to
understand them and they have no
principles and they deduce complicated
things for the principles and they do
experiments and you know they find
either they work or they own work and so
and that's really you know impressive
stuff so I want to be like that too so I
want to have a theory in literary and in
the humanities you know Larry criticism
through ecology and so on there's a
field called theory we're just like the
physicists they talk in comprehensively
we can talk in comprehensively they have
big words we'll have big words they draw
you know far-reaching conclusions will
draw foraging conclusions we're just as
prestigious as they are now if they say
well look we're doing real science
you guys aren't that's white male sexist
the you know bourgeois whatever the
answer is how come how are we any
different from them
okay that's appealing other other things
that went on remember that a lot of this
stuff comes from Paris and interesting
things were happening in Paris in the
1970s the French intellectuals were the
last group of intellectuals in the world
who were dedicating Li not 100% but you
know it was very standard and respected
to be a dedicated Stalinist and Maoist
whatever the mid-seventies I was getting
to be a pretty hard position to uphold
so what you had if you take a look at
what happened is there was a sudden
shift people who had been flaming
Maoists and Stalinists suddenly became
the first people in the world to have
discovered the gulag and went on a tear
about how everyone else supports you
know Stalinist and Maoist atrocities and
we're France of course we have to be in
front of everyone so therefore we've
exposed it and now we're open this was
called the new philosophy nor do floss
or something and it went over all kyra
member meaning I won't mention names
cause is embarrassing one of the leading
French cultural theorists who happened
to visit me around 1974 and she was a
flaming Maoist a couple of years later
she was one of the first people who
understood to of the you know discovered
the smallest and Maoist atrocities well
okay when he went through that
transition you got to do something else
how you going to be you know on the
front pages okay along comes the
invention of post structuralism
