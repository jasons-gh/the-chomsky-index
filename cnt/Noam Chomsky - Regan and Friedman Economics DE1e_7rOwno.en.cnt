since early this morning it's one of
those days that was a full of interviews
on all sorts of topics ranging from
literal
threats those human survival which are
quite real to catastrophes as a all over
the world some known Iraq some not known
unfortunately like Western Sahara the
last literal colony in Africa all of
these are kind of tainted by the
realization that we share a lot of
responsibility for misery and suffering
and the possible disaster often by
actions sometimes by inaction with that
and I've just come back from South
America where there are also many vivid
very vivid memories some of them
inspiring some of them pretty grim with
that world in front of us it feels to me
and may seem to you a little bit cold
and bloodless to do what I'm now going
to do is ignore the torment and misery
and threats to survival and so on and
instead talk about problems of democracy
and development at a rather general way
and I think the implications for
day-to-day life are actually quite
direct in particular implications for
the very significant work that has been
done for decades
I just learned 33 years by city life
Vita Urbana
that's quite a record so I'll say a
couple of words about democracy and
development the particular the obstacles
they face among them conventional
ideology so just to
illustrate with one example sure you all
read the many commentaries on the death
of Milton Friedman a couple of weeks ago
the typical one was a front-page story
in The Wall Street Journal full of
accolades among them that the
intellectual foundations of the Reagan
Revolution were provided by Friedman's
work that means reliance on market
forces on fiscal conservatism all of
which led to a grand economy that we've
been enjoying for the last thirty years
25 years well that's pretty standard and
there's one only one problem with it and
that is it's the exact opposite of the
truth in every respect not an unusual
problem for the grand economy the last
30 years have been probably the major
economic failure in American history
that so-called neoliberal period have
been though serious depressions no other
major disruptions but for the majority
of the population they're the majority
population has actually seen real wages
and incomes stagnate or even decline one
stunning figure is that the bottom of
40% of the population has seen a decline
in their net worth what what they have -
debt that greater than what they had
there has been an economic growth
through this period there has been
increase in productivity but the
benefits of on the very few even you may
have seen a couple of front page
articles in The New York Times this past
week on how the the suffering of the
ultra-rich because they are so envious
of the super ultra ultra rich
which is surely the great problem of the
day for some at least telling anything
that you don't know probably in your own
lives let's go back 30 years it's
actually started in Lake Carter years if
you go back 30 years beginning of the
so-called neoliberal period in the
United States wages were the highest in
the industrial world and working hours
were the least exactly what you'd expect
in the richest country in the world with
incomparable advantages by now it's
reversed
real wages are about the lowest in the
industrial world working hours are the
highest close to it benefits which were
never very strong of decline debt has
soared security has declined severely
all of that incidentally is planned the
supervisor economic supervisor of the
miracle alan greenspan when he testified
to congress about the wonders of the
economy that he was organizing and
running pointed out very frankly that
one of the major reasons for the health
of the economy was what he called
growing worker insecurity all of what
happened is not some kind of accident or
you know from outer space it was planned
it's organized so for example apparently
about during the reagan years alone
seems that about 700 million dollars
were spent on trying to encourage
corporations to shift from the united
states just to the caribbean that one
phase of it that was discovered in a
great sting operation by charlie
Carnahan and the National Labor
Committee that he runs you may have seen
it it hit national television where he
actually caught was able to cat
pretended to set up a fake company and
was able to catch US aid officials
explaining how beneficial would
this fake company to shift their
operations from wherever they invented
Ohio or something - to the Caribbean yet
very cheap flavor easily exploited no
benefits
mostly women's it can control them
easily kick them out if they make a fuss
I get pregnant or something like that no
environmental constraints things you all
know about also the Reagan
administration pioneered openly illegal
labor practices that was well reported
in Business Week went it out but during
the Reagan at Reagan had effectively
Reagan administration had informed
instructed the business world that they
were simply not going to enforce the
laws that was picked up by Clinton who
had another way of doing it called NAFTA
one of the predicted effects of NAFTA
and in fact realized it was to undermine
union organizer gives employers a way to
threaten the workers who are trying to
organize a plant that if they continued
shift it to Mexico or somewhere else
it's illegal but when you have a
criminal state it doesn't matter
and when business world knows that it
enjoys the benefits of the criminal
stage it can carry these activities out
a lot of this work as you probably know
it was done by Kate bronfenbrenner
Cornell done a number of monographs on
it and it's quite significant harms
working people also harms democracy
unions not only improve the lives of
working people but they're very powerful
democratizing force what about the
miracle of the market under Reaganism
well that's a standard line to
overlooking the fact that Reagan was the
most protectionist president in post-war
American history fact he practically
doubled protective barriers more than
all post-war presidents combined there's
a reason for that if you go back to say
around the late 70s there was a great
deal of concern
in the business world that US companies
could not compete with superior Japanese
manufacturers u.s. managers hadn't
understood the new techniques of lean
production on-time production and so on
that had been developed in mainland
Japan and the US was industry was
falling falling apart and there were
calls in the business press to
