there's a very good reason to believe in
innate nosov moron put moral principles
which in fact was given by David Hume
who pointed out that we're constantly
making moral decisions in new situations
now we do it pretty consistently and
consistently with others which suggests
that there must be some internal he
didn't put it this way but we wouldn't I
think we would now put it as by saying
that there must be some internal
generative system obviously some finite
system because we're finite objects that
determines given circumstances what a
reasonable moral response would be over
some range that doesn't mean that it's
cultural independent of culture every
innate property like height let's say or
vision whatever may be is affected by
external events in usually in early
childhood that shape what we do
including our language and so on so that
would presumably be the case for moral
principles as well John Rawls picked
this up in his theory of justice and
gave a kind of a neocon thien version of
it which in its original if you in the
original book itself is based in part on
models from generative grammar he
explicitly he came under very sharp a
criticism for that from philosophers and
he kind of put it aside and kept the
things that interested him more but it
was picked up by a young philosopher
John me file
and I guess about 15 years ago who
responded to the criticisms I think
pretty effectively and tried to develop
something like a universal moral grammar
and initiated some experimental work
with an experimental psychologist
Elizabeth's Pelkey and they tried to do
some studies of how children would
respond to moral dilemmas and trolly
type dilemmas of others and try to
develop elicit some principles that
might account for the way they're doing
it that's was later picked up by mark
Hauser and I understand you've been
working on this and others have tried to
show that there are culturally
independent moral principles that are
can be formulated sort of analogous to
principles of universal grammar that
would yield the consequences that Hume
observed that provide the capacity for
making moral decisions in presumably in
principle in an unbounded range of
conditions and circumstances doesn't
mean they're always going to give an
answer often they don't but over some
range would give answers so I think
that's a reasonable project by now an
even part of empirical science with
comparative studies that cross-cultural
so on with children's or incidentally
that doesn't that leaves open a question
an interesting question as to the
difference between our innate principles
and what are the true moral principles
but that's a question that
the cement arresting work on this by a
German for young German philosopher
Matias maman legal philosopher who's who
pointed out among other things that this
is quite similar to problems that arise
in our pistol mala ji so we have certain
methods that we use their instinctive
for trying to find what what Charles
purse called abductive principles
without defining principles that we use
somehow to go from a range of evidence
and a range of background knowledge to
ideas about what might be the
explanation for them and that's our
means of trying to advance knowledge and
understanding but it raises the same
question maybe these are the wrong means
and they lead us away from understanding
and knowledge if so we're stuck
