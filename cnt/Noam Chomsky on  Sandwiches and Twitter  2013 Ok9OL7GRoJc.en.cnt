so there are people I mean I thinking of
actual cases of you know adolescence
let's say who think they have 500
friends because there are 500 people on
their Facebook account but these are the
kind of friends whose relation to you is
that if you say you know I'm florists
and which they say did it taste good you
know that's a kind of interaction but
very different from having a real friend
know somebody can actually talk to and I
think so it has it's a mixed story I
mean it I don't know
obviously it's bad but it makes them
very different actually I can see it you
know I don't use the social media but I
can see the effects and my own
correspondent so I got a ton of
correspondence used to be hard copy now
you take a look was very very limited
amount of hard copy you know actual
letters and people right so it's all
it's mostly email recently I didn't
notice it the pointed out to me because
she you know passes through her before
it reaches me she cuts out a lot of junk
she pointed out that a lot of the
letters that are coming in there a lot
of my queries or comments or something a
lot of them are one sentence long and
she concluded he's probably right that
these are from Twitter and if you look
at the nature of those one sentence
letters you could see most of the time
it's something that you know came to
somebody's mind if somebody's you know
walking down the street never thought
send it out if they thought about it for
two minutes they wouldn't have sent it
very commonly get queries you know
somebody they saw somebody saw something
a mine on YouTube but it of course if
there's a talk on YouTube than any
footnote say one now you know
why'd you say this well and if they'd
bother to look up something in print
they would have seen why I said that
and I often when they ask for source for
evidence I said we'll just take a look
and I mentioned somebody can read that
usually ends the conversation the idea
that you might want to read something
like that's too much can't do that I
often get questions from them say high
school students saying you know I I have
to write a paper and next Thursday on
French Revolution whatever it may be
would I say and usually I tell them well
you know here's something you could look
up and the next question routinely comes
back how can I find it on the Internet
and if I say sometimes these come from
like prep schools you know places with
good libraries educated students
privileged students I say well you know
walk across the street to the school
librarian
look it up I don't have time you know I
want to be able to get it instantly on
the internet and not have to think about
it well there's that phenomenon as well
I mean I'm not offering this is a
particularly internet it's just that
there are a lot of factors involved
that's just it it does offer plenty of
possibilities it also has it can have a
kind of a cheapening effect and I think
both exist and it's true of everything
say the same about the printing press
