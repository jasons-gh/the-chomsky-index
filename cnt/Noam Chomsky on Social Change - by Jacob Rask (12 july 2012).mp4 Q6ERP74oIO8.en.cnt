hmm so yes if it's hard to say anything
about the prospects what about the
obstacles all only what do you see as
the main obstacles in our society and
the main elements of power that has to
be challenged or overcome if if the
demands of yeah movements like you have
to come in 5 to succeed again somewhat
different different societies but
there's a lot similar for one thing
there is but throughout the Western
world there's a highly concentrated the
economic power which therefore carries
with it very strong political power
there are sources of repression which
can be mobilized to prevent popular
movements and developing but there have
their relatively fragile it's not like
fascist state so they're fragile and
they can be undermined by popular
resistance they're not simple you know
but it can be done has been done so for
example takes it is the will rights
movement
in the south where the Gulf repression
was really busy and it was like Sajid
States recall demonstrations there
demonstrator I'm people killed it wasn't
the joke no but it makes them
significant progress the the other but
the major problem I think is kind of a
combination of hopelessness and apathy
hard to distinguish between them but for
most of the popular muscles population
seems nothing can be done that shows in
pretty remarkable ways so for example to
get to the United States the attitudes
towards systems of power are quite
remarkable so approval of Congress is in
literally single digits probably most
kind of population things they already
thrown out
the presidential candidates not hire
banks hated you know corporations
despised you know almost anything any
esters you can pick that people don't
like it they think it's just harming
them but they don't think they can do
anything about it sometimes it's almost
surreal but take it what's called here
the 911 movement first movement people
think that the Bush administration was
responsible for 911 it's a substantial
part of the population and probably
about a third of the population thinks
it's at least plausible may be true so
that means they heard of the population
thinks that we're governed by people who
are homicidal maniacs to want a murderer
soul but we can't do anything about it
so you believe that when you try to go
on with your daily life and this sense
that everything is hopeless is a very
good technique control it can understand
descent there's there are the labor
movements been significantly destroyed
not totally with large media other
popular institutions barely exist if a
if some action takes place in the United
States say a talk or organizing event
and takes place either a university or a
trick because that's all there is if you
go to other countries often we need any
union hole or something but they don't
nothing like that exists here so people
are very atomized they're very separated
from one another they're burdened with
debt there dr. dated from infancy with
consumers culture you can only evaluate
your own that determine who you are what
value you have buy commodities you have
people are separate from or another this
variable interaction but I best
contribute to a sense of hopelessness
and that's a good technique of
indoctrination control and that as we
overcome people have to get to feel that
they can do something every organizer
noses if you're trying to organize them
whatever man to say an anti-poverty
campaign or campaign against the
electoral fraud or whatever it is in the
inner city one of the things you really
have to start with is something simple
get people together to see if they can
maybe get a traffic light put up in a
street where children have to cross the
street to go to school and get the work
on that
and if you can achieve that you get a
sense where we can achieve something you
know then go on something else but the
best way organizing always works in fact
the sitting at the lunch counter was an
example let's see if we can get the
right to have a cup of coffee at a lunch
counter and if you can get that go on to
something bigger which and it's a look
at the history of social movements
interesting to see how they work the
civil rights movement is an interesting
case it did achieve a lot but it hit a
barrier that it couldn't cross take
Martin Luther King if you listen to the
speeches on Martin Luther King Day you
know strolling his great achievement
they end on in 1963 with a speech I have
a dream speech turbine of but Martin
Luther King didn't stop the 1963 he went
on to try to face class issues and as
soon as he did that he was
driven out of polite society and made no
progress on that fact the day he was
assassinated he was on his way to
organize a march to Washington for to
start try to start poor people's
movement and after his assassination the
March took place his wife leaded as
widow it got to Washington they set up
the tent city resurrection city and the
Congress that is the most liberal
Congress in American history quickly
pulled out the police they came in in
the middle of the night a drug monit
destroyed the city driven a lot of town
that's what happens when you try to face
classes so and that's not that part of
life's never discussed virtually never
is good yeah so this leads to my second
question it touches a lot of the things
that I was going to ask you them because
we've been learning about the health
care system here and the health care
system and I'm quite surprised about the
big differences that there is compared
to where I'm from Denmark irka anywhere
yeah the announcers was unique in the
industrial world so I want to ask how
come since you have had such great
characters and movements like you
mentioned King and many others that
there is such a big difference between
the u.s. is to an unusual extent with
business from society I mean all Western
society to facebook business run but the
u.s. is its drink and it has been for
150
and one consequence of that is that
benefit system you know welks work
systems are much weaker in the United
States been in Europe or Australia
Canada you know any industrial country
and start of another way to going to
take the salaries of professionals and
CEOs and it's a corporation I'm they're
ridiculously high everywhere but in the
united states that they're in the
stratosphere the and the power of if you
take a look at the elect elections
elections they're not wonderful anywhere
but in the united states you can pretty
well predict the outcome of an election
just by the amount of campaign funded
and even pretty well predicted policies
by the concentration of campaign funding
that's been pretty well studied
incidentally some of the best kind of
left political science literature and
it's quite remarkable which means that
elections based we don't take place the
campaign funding of course comes
overwhelmingly from the corporate sector
and the wealthy so they essentially by
the election and the result is you get
policies that reflect their interests
but not the interests of the population
so take house gear again for a long time
now 50 years or more
the public has pretty much supported
some kind of national health care system
that what people usually say is a
Canadian Styles distant and not post
Canada's so great but that's the only
country and when those exist it's very
insular country if you ask people where
Denmark is Ethel mostly it's in Africa
literally so it was very internally
directed country so you know that Canada
exists so people say a canadian-style
system which is ok but not the best
plane but they just can't get through I
mean when in the current debate over
health care system there was one residue
of a national health care system was
called a public option it's like one of
the choices would be can people choose
to be in a public system it was about
almost two to one support for that but
Obama didn't even try I try to eat just
abandoned it quickly young and that's
the power of the financial institution
of the United States is I think the only
country in the world as far as I know
where there's our laws that say the comp
that the government can't negotiate drug
prices so drug prices are two to three
hundred eyes they are anywhere else you
look for something
favorite drug and the local pharmacy use
these way higher than it is in Denmark
because the government can't negotiate
prices well that's the power of the
pharmaceutical industry and then a
business learned society that's what you
get strong Decimus centers of power and
normally influential and government
announced works that people can't get a
public health care system even if they
want it that the slits not the only case
but public policy is we usually it did
very different from public opinion
against yvette by checking polls health
care to striking example how scared a
very important example not only for
human reasons most candidates of people
have no oil no access to health care
except in an emergency room yeah but
also just a straight economic time I
mean for example with the United States
had a health care system control was a
down mark or any other society there
wouldn't be a denser they're all the be
surplus but even that
doesn't matter have you read the press
never talked about with Obama's power
program proof things a little nothing
like other countries nothing like with
the public want them so how I guess it's
a question of priorities and we all have
to make up our own mind but then a lot
of the exhibition that I have been
engaged in in Denmark and a lot of the
people i know is a very critical towards
the state and state power it's very
critical to watch The Late power or very
focused on limiting the power of the
state then but isn't that isn't that a
bit dangerous in a society like desert
dangerous in society which has a strong
private power I'm proud of power state
powers better not private art a lot
worse state powers at least partially
accountable to the public private power
is totally unaccountable to the public
like you can vote to influence who your
representative will be in Parliament but
you can't vote for what the major
corporations will do that's in principle
so and in fact if you didn't so yes I'm
opposed to state power to but you have
to recognize there's another major
powers are actually
and it's that once borrowed from the
rural workers in Brazil rural workers
union had an image about living in a
cage they say we're living in a cage and
we what we do is try to grow them push
the butt bars farther out but we also
need the cage I mean if there's a
saber-toothed tiger outside you want the
cage even if you don't like cages well
we're living in a cage with
unaccountable private power there and
unless we have some government partially
accountable institution that can protect
us from Italy total disaster so how do
we reduce without of corporations I
think they just going to be there
already they're already our movement and
they ought to be expanded to just move
to a community and work around
corporation no corporations worker and
community on the enterprise the reason
why I mean some of there are some of
this and some quite successful like
Texas Spain everyone knows Spain has so
cold enough problems fiscal problems
unemployment problems not entirely
monitor gun doesn't
that's the biggest work around
collective in the world quite cute and
they're done okay you know they
obviously are affected by the recession
but not unemployment the bank's against
the hospital's the school learning work
and there's no reason why I can't be
expanded over the whole society it in
fact that's being done to an extent like
in the United States to theirs it's not
massive but there's a growth of worker
owned enterprises it just was just been
an agreement made between Mondragon on
the steelworkers union in the United
States to try to expand similar
enterprises fewer but it could be with
enough popular organization it could
work so a couple of years ago Obama
basically nationalized the banks in the
auto industry that's what it amounted to
you know the bailouts are basically
nationalization so means the public own
well what happened they were given back
to their original owners people very
much like them
at public expense but another
possibility would have been to turn them
over to the workforce and if the Occupy
movement had existed until powerful and
I would feel for estrogen so these are
things it could be they're not utopian
there on the border of possible thanks
for time good see you if you're dating
have a good trip
you
