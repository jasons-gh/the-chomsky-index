George Bush reportedly proclaimed that
God told me to strike at al Qaeda and I
struck them and then he instructed me to
strike at Saddam which I did and then
you wrote and they and now I am
determined to solve the problem of the
Middle East he said also and in your
words also at the command of the Lord of
hosts the war God whom we are instructed
by the holy book to worship above all
other gods and as I mentioned the elite
press dutifully refers to his messianic
mission to solve the problem of the
Middle East in fact the world following
quote our responsibility to history to
rid the world of evil the early English
colonists North America were following
the word of the Lord as they slaughtered
the Amika Al Amalekites forgive me in
the new Israel that they were liberating
liberating from the native blight those
who followed them also Bible waving
god-fearing Christians did their
religious duty by conquering and
possessing the promised land ridding it
of millions of Canaanites and proceeding
to war against the Papists in Florida
Mexico and California now it's visible
again I'm afraid yes but but the
question I'm going to ask you may not be
the one you think so you once told me in
an email when are we talk when I talked
about my concerns about religious
religion that it's that you rightly then
this is a profoundly important thing you
don't care what people believe it's what
they do that counts but beliefs
influence actions and it seems to me and
I want like your comment that if you
really talk about if we go back to your
argument for the response to believe
until intellectuals which is exposed
lies is it not
therefore our responsibility to expose
religious lies if say a third of the
American population believes the world
was created a couple thousand years ago
exactly as it is today yes it is our
responsibility to expose that lie and to
tell the truth on the other hand if say
I'm thinking of a particular person but
could give many examples if a Peruvian
peasant who immigrated to the United
States thirty years ago and has managed
to create a decent life for self under
pretty awful conditions is an
evangelical Christian who has a prayer
group every evening that goes to visit
the sick and pray with them I'm not
going to read her a lesson in
epistemology okay
I couldn't agree with you more it's our
it's our it's our duty to expose lies
when they influence behavior and
especially state behavior in a bad way
and I think that although you didn't
intend it all those quotes of course and
most many wars are justified by
religious arguments although one could
argue if there wasn't God one would
justify them but there's also we should
also remember that there's a secular
religion which is even more devastating
and that's things like the concept of
American exceptionalism
that's a secular
[Applause]
