well it turns out that a lot of the work
that's I and others have being been done
and being been done in recent years
actually recaptures a tradition that an
older tradition that had been forgotten
the effort is to explain how it is that
human being any normal human being can
on the basis of limited and scattered
data acquire a quite remarkable capacity
which is otherwise unknown in the
biological world of the capacity that
you and I are now using right now to
create an unbounded array of expressions
which capture thoughts in fact
constitute thoughts and to convey to
others who have no access to our minds
the internal workings of our thinking
and planning and so on that capacity
that which was recognized centuries ago
can now be studied in ways that were not
possible before thanks to the
development of the theory of computation
by great mathematicians of the 20th
century we know understand well how a
finite object like the brain can in fact
construct an infinite array of
structured expressions which each of
which constitutes a thought and we can
externalize it in some sensory motor
medium which will allow others to
penetrate the work to comprehend the
workings of our minds this is a speak as
a species characteristic of humans every
human group has this
pasady there are no group differences
known no other organism has anything
even closely analogous there's by no
good reason to believe that this
capacity developed fairly recently in
evolutionary time pretty much long with
the appearance of modern Homo sapiens
and it is there a distinctive
characteristic and the source of their
creativity and achievement and within
the last several decades an enormous
amount has been learned about this far
beyond anything that had even been
contemplated earlier these are I think
major achievements of modern science and
thought to which many quite remarkable
people have contributed the kinds of
questions that students are asking now
you couldn't even have formulated the
law imagine eight imagine not many years
ago and it's expanding them flourishing
so it's a very but been a very exciting
period from this point of view
well in the first part of the 20th
century the dominant themes were that
were a structuralist and behavioral the
language is regarded not as a trait of
human beings that has some external
object so for example for a fair
analysis or the founder of structure
linguistics language is a collection of
word images in the minds of a community
not an individual four-letter bloomfield
leading the most prominent American
linguist of the early 20th century
languages the set of utterances can be
expressed in a speech community so it's
something kind of out there not in here
for the maybe the leading one of the
most important philosophers of language
WV coined languages a I'm quoting him
fabric of sentence is associated with
one another and with stimuli but again
something none part not a trait of an
individual human being now that's quite
different from the tradition the last
serious representative of a long
tradition was Otto yes person great
linguist about a century ago identified
the task of linguistics as trying to
discover what he called a concept of
structure in the mind of the person
which enables that person to construct
new expressions free expressions which
constitute the thoughts and their minds
but that notion which
been develop couldn't really be in
pursued because there was no clear way
to understand the notion concept the
structure in the mind now we can do that
the the linguistics of the latter part
of the 20th century until today has
regarded the major strain of it as
regarded language as a property of an
individual structure in the an
organization of in the brain which has
the capacity to create and construct
expressions of thought without limit in
accordance with circumstances and
relevant to experience that's a sharp
change from the structuralist
behaviorist tradition as the if you look
back at structural behavior linguistics
it was very narrow in scope it dealt
mostly with phonology sound structure a
little bit of morphological structure
never never raised the kinds of
questions that I've just mentioned which
had been part of the tradition a lost
part of linguistics was essentially
procedures of analysis how do you take a
corpus of material from some informant
apply various procedures to it presented
and organized form then it's over but
not asking what are the fundamental
principles that enter into this that are
part of the basic Faculty of language
it's uniform across languages that allow
this immense leap from scattered data to
the capacity to create produce thoughts
without limit appropriate to
circumstances that question was not
raised it is a essentially a question of
biology and in fact much of the recent
work is called bio linguistics so the
substantial change is moving from a
concept of language as something
external to people which somehow they
connect to to an individual trait of
individual of people shared among the
species because it is a species property
which furthermore as provides the means
for this creative capacity that provides
the what great linguist the L'Enfant
mobile back in the early 19th century
called a method for infinite use of
finite means in the tradition that was
just slogan but now we can fill out the
details of many fundamental respects
well
like a lot of things in life is kind of
accidental part of one significant
stimulus was in fact the development in
the mid by the mid 20th century of the
general theory of computability great
mathematicians like Colonel Alan Turing
I'm opposed others had made it extremely
they had clarified precisely what it
means for a finite object have infinite
generative capacity that's became well
understood and with those concepts in
mind it is possible to read to return to
the problems that animated the tradition
but that they could not directly address
I should say that all of this happened
in almost total ignorance of the history
of the subject which had been completely
forgotten so even a great linguist like
yes person last represented the
tradition was almost unknown to
structural linguistics by mid-century
this some historical research on this
the entire tradition was unknown but it
was reconstructed then rediscovered and
now with means to a disc traditional
problems that did not exist before in
fact as soon as you begin to look at the
most elementary properties of language
you see that there are very puzzling
things which had never been noticed
because of the restrictions and limits
of the structuralist behavioral approach
to these topics which well it made many
contributions and indeed a great deal
was learned it was very narrow in scope
a small number of the kinds of questions
that could be addressed were very
limited not the kind that I've just been
talking about
you
well just paying attention to the facts
I mean it is remarkable fact that a
young child saying to her three-year-old
child has mastered a rich understanding
of properties of language which for
which the child has had no evidence
whatsoever as soon as you look at that
problem you immediately recognize that
there must be something internal to the
individual that directs the course of
development and growth of the this
incredible competence and the shapes it
and it is common to all human beings so
it becomes a kind of like the question
of why do we have the particular kind of
visual system we have say a mammalian
visual system not an insect visual
system it's not because of the nutrition
to the cell it's because of our genetic
predisposition to grow and develop in
particular ways as soon as you face that
overwhelming fact the next thing you
look at is well what are these built-in
principles and the efforts of the past
years have been to try to refine the
sharp and determine the nature of
principles which will account for this
ability at the same time the the
problems and devices developed in
generative grammar led to an enormous
explosion of empirical research at a
level of the depth and insight that had
never been a dreamt of before so by now
we have enormous amounts of evidence
about typologically differently
which is over a very wide range which
serves as again as a stimulus and
exciting stimulus to try to determine
and discover what are the uniformity 'z
that underlie them on the surface they
look very different but when you begin
to investigate the principles that
generate the structures and
interpretations of expressions you find
striking uniformity that had never been
even thought of before
all of these are stimuli results
interacting which have led to the
flourishing of the field also I should
say that related disciplines have also
been developing and kind of cross
fertilization deriving from these
results and contributing to them like
for example the study of language
acquisition which has progressed far
beyond anything that was known before
the study of language processing how
does a person take the noises that
appear and understand them as an
expression of as a semantically
interpreted expression of thought
there's even by now beginning to be
significant neuro linguistic research
which is seeking to discover and to some
extent is shedding light on the neural
processes that are taking place during
these achievements of use and the growth
of language so we have a number of
different disciplines have developed
which barely barely existed
a century which are contributing to one
another and reaching a level where new
problems on the horizon are being
formulated being addressed a new
technology has helped the many to extent
so I'd say the met many different
factors have entered into the
developments that was taking place
well for one thing we can anticipate in
advance that that's going to be the case
simply by observing the fact that a
child does develop rich and complex
knowledge of language on the basis of
scattered and impoverished data and any
child we know is capable of doing this
for any language so there just have to
be fundamental deep uniform principles
that carry thee that overcome the gap
between data presented and knowledge
attained then why do we next question of
course is to discover what these
principles are and more and more we have
found that languages that look on the
surface very different turn out to be
fundamentally the same and their basic
major properties so there are for
example some languages of 3040 years ago
it was assumed by the most the most
advanced of linguists in the field very
fine linguists in generative grammar
that there are languages which have
simply what's called flat structure the
word order is virtually free no
hierarchical structure of the kind that
you find in English some indigenous
languages were believed to have this
property in fact even even Japanese and
German were thought of sometime this
probably my further research
demonstrated that in fact when you look
carefully at the ways in which sentences
are interpreted and constructed you find
the very same hierarchical structures
hidden behind the surface appearance of
the free word order in flat structure
this is things like this have been
over and over and over and that fills in
the understanding of how this leak from
data to intricate and precise knowledge
does take place there very similar to
the study of other capacities developed
as a take against a the visual system we
know it can vary
we know from experimental evidence that
it can vary tremendously depending on
experience but nevertheless it develops
in a particular fixed way because of a
genetic endowment that determines that
this is what a human visual system is
the task of the sciences is to take that
phenomenal observation and to discover
how all of this can take place and it's
pretty much the same in the study of
language we find very much the same
kinds of things facts kind of
interesting that if you look back say to
the 1950s it was assumed quoting from
one of the most prominent theoretical
linguists that languages can differ from
one another in arbitrary ways and each
one has to be studied on its own without
preconceptions that was sometimes called
the Boas in principle after great
anthropological linguist from spaulos
the same kind of thing was believed
about organisms that they can very
arbitrarily and almost arbitrarily and
infinite number
ways and each has to be studied on its
own by now it's well-known and
contemporary biology that it's simply
not true that there's very limited and
constrained forms of possible organisms
body body plans are pretty much the same
their world pretty much at around the
Cambrian explosion half a million years
ago there's deep conservation of
properties and very similar discoveries
have been made about language what looks
on the surface when you don't understand
the system it looks kind of random and
chaotic the more you become to
understand its internal workings you see
principles that are uniform fixed deep
do not reveal themselves directly in the
surface phenomena one great Nobel
laureate and physics once said that the
goal of science is to discover the
hidden Invisibles that lie beyond the
surface visibles
that's that captures very well the
course of scientific inquiry aimed at
explanation of how surface phenomena of
the properties they have and we finding
that over and over in the case of study
of language in the last fifty or sixty
years
increasingly today by now there are
significant ideas about very simple
combinatorial processes that can provide
surprising explanations for deep
uniformity zuv language found everywhere
with surprising properties
well it's a very strike
in fact that the properties of language
are not found in the essential
properties of language have no serious
analogs elsewhere in the biological
world so just take the simple fact that
each language has the property of what's
called discrete infinity so for example
there's a five-word sentence there's a
six word sentence
there's no five-and-a-half word sentence
and it goes on forever that simple
property is extremely rare in the
biological world furthermore a language
has hierarchical structures which are
the basis for the operations that apply
to form new expressions that are in over
an infinite range again there's nothing
comparable to that even remotely
analogous in the elsewhere in the
biological world in fact even when you
look at the nature of the elementary
concepts of language it was like the
tree house
River and so on you find that they have
properties not not known in other edible
symbolic systems so the mode of
acquisition the manner of use the
internal structural properties all of
this seems to be quite unique to humans
and has long been recognized to be at
the core of our distinctive creative
accomplishments again for pretty
obviously
world
well there are theories that claim I
wouldn't call them theories there are
claims that language is a cultural
product but the problem with those
claims is there's no way to spell them
out in a way which explains any of the
facts that we've been discussing so I
don't see any alternative to the
conclusion that it's a product of
biological evolution which created which
apparently took place roughly at the
time that modern humans developed so it
appears and has a distinctive properties
shared by all cultural groups that
doesn't change the fact that languages
of course do vary and they are embedded
in rich cultural systems which can study
on their own but the fundamental basic
structure of language the properties
that enable an infant to gain the
capacities that say you and I are now
using those same uniform to the species
independent of any culture
well it's in the society in the sense
that each individual in the society
shares not only a general language
capacity which all humans share but
share a particular implementation of
that capacity not identically like take
any two human beings you and me will
look at our language closely we'll find
small differences between them but
enough shared capacity so that we can
interact freely and therefore language
becomes the major means of social
interaction within roughly shared
individuals that's a society
well this the study of language is
uniquely positioned as a science which
is just part of the humanities I mean
the humanities include literature the
arts all of which interact very closely
with language as their medium and a mode
of interaction so it's if you can't
really place the study of language in
one or another domain it struggles all
of them
