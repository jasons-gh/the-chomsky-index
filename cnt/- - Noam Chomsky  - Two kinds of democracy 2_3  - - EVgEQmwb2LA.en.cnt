now there are two functions now in a
democracy then the specialized class the
responsible men they carry out the
executive function which means they do
the thinking and the planning and you
know understand the common interests and
then the bewildered heard there they
have a function of democracy - they are
function in a democracy he said is to be
spectators not participants in action
but they have more of a function than
that because it's a democracy they are
allowed to lend their weight
occasionally to one or another member of
the specialized class in other words
they're allowed to say we want you to be
our leader or we want you to be our
leader that's because it's a democracy
not a totalitarian state that's called
an election but once they've lent their
weight to one or another member of the
specialized class they're supposed to
sink back and become spectators of
action but not participants that's in a
properly functioning democracy and
there's a logic behind that there's even
a kind of compelling moral principle
behind it the compelling moral principle
is that the mass of the public is just
too stupid to be able to understand
things if they try to participate in
managing their own affairs they're just
going to cause trouble and therefore it
would be immoral and improper to permit
them to do this we have to tame the
bewildered herd not allow the bewildered
herd the rage and trample and destroy
things it's pretty much the same logic
that says that it would be improper to
let a three-year-old run across the
street
you don't give a three-year-old that
kind of freedom because the
three-year-old doesn't know how to
handle that freedom and correspondingly
you don't allow the bewildered herd to
become participants in action
they'll just cause trouble well that
consider so we need something to tame
the bewildered herd and that something
is this new revolution in the art of
democracy the manufacture of consent the
media the schools the popular culture
has to divide for the political class
the decision-makers it has to give them
some tolerable sense of reality Oh
it also has to instill the proper
beliefs because remember there is an
unstated premise here the unstated
premise and even the responsible men
have to disguise this from themselves
the unstated premise has to do with the
question of how they get into the
position where they have the authority
to make decisions and and the written
the way they do that of course is by
serving people with real power and the
people with real power the ones who own
the society which is pretty narrow group
and if the specialized class can come
along and say I can serve your interests
then they'll be part of the executive
group you got to keep that quiet but and
that means they have to have instilled
in them the beliefs and the doctrines
that will serve the interests of private
power unless they can master that skill
they're not part of the specialized
class so we have one kind of educational
system directed to the responsible men
the specialized class they have to be
deeply indoctrinated in the values and
the interests of private power and the
state corporate Nexus it's closely
linked that represents it and if they
can get through that they can be part of
the specialized class for the rest the
bewildered herd they just have to be
basically distracted turn their
attention to something else keep them
out of trouble make sure that they
remain at most spectators of action
occasionally lending their weight to one
or another of the real leaders who they
may select among the that that point of
view has been developed by lots and lots
of other people in fact preconventional
so for example the leading contemporary
modern theologian and also foreign
policy critic Reinhold Niebuhr sometimes
called the theologian of the
establishment the Guru of
George Kennan and the Kennedy
intellectuals and others the way he put
it was that rationality is a very
narrowly restricted skill only a small
number of people have it
most people are guided by just emotion
and impulse and those of us of course us
who have rationality we have to create
necessary illusions and emotionally
potent oversimplifications
to keep the
naive simpletons more or less son course
this became a substantial part of
contemporary political science the
founder of the modern field of
communications one of the leading
American political scientists Harold
Lasswell he explained a couple of years
after this that this is all in the 1920s
the early 1930s that we should not
succumb to what he called Democratic
dogmatism 'he's about men being the best
judges of their own interests because
they're not they're not the best judges
of their own interests we're the best
judges of their interests and we have to
therefore just out of ordinary morality
make sure that they don't have an
opportunity to opt to act on the basis
of their misjudgments in a totalitarian
with what is nowadays called the
totalitarian state though it's easy you
just hold a bludgeon over their heads
and if they get out of line you smash
them over the head but as societies
become more free and democratic you lose
that capacity and therefore you have to
turn to the techniques of propaganda the
logic is clear propaganda is to a
democracy what the bludgeon is to a
totalitarian state and that's why isn't
good because again the common interests
elude the bewildered herd they can't
figure them out the public relations
industry not only took this ideology on
very explicitly but also acted on it
that's a huge industry spending hundreds
of them by now probably something on the
order of a billion dollars a year or
something and it's commitment all along
was to controlling the public mind
the first major trial was a year later
in 1936 there was a major strike the
Bethlehem Bethlehem Steel strike out in
western Pennsylvania at Johnstown the
Mohawk Valley and business tried out a
new technique of destruction of labor
which worked worked very well it was
through prop not through goon squads and
breaking knees and all that kind of
business that wasn't working very well
anymore
but through the more subtle and
effective means of propaganda the idea
was to figure out ways to turn the gent
that the public against the strikers to
present the strikers as disruptive
harmful to the public against the common
interests and the common interests are
those of us you know the businessman the
worker the housewife and so on that's
all us and we want to be just together
or we want to have things like harmony
and Americanism and working together and
so on and then there's those bad
strikers out there who are kind of
disruptive and causing trouble and
breaking harmony and violating
Americanism and we got to stop them so
we can all live together you know the
corporate executive and the guy who
cleans the floors who all have the same
interests we can all work together and
work for work for Americanism in harmony
liking each other that was essentially
the message and it was a huge amount of
effort was put into presenting it recall
after all this is the business community
so they control the media and they have
massive resources and so on and it
worked it worked very effectively in
fact it was later called the Mohawk
Valley formula applied over and over
again to break that strike and these
were called scientific methods of strike
breaking and they worked very
effectively mobilize community opinion
in favor of vapid empty concepts like
Americanism who can be against that or
harmony who can be against that or to
bring it up to date support our troops
who can be against that or yellow
ribbons who can be against that
anything that's totally vacuous you know
and that diverts in theft or what does
it mean to be in favor what does it
means it's if somebody asks you do you
support the people in Iowa I mean can
you say yeah I support them or you know
I don't support them I mean it's not
even a question it doesn't mean anything
and that's the point
