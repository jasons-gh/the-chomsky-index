I see that we have very helpful audience
members who are pointing out where there
are open seats so please come on in find
a seat oh wait a few moments until
everyone gets settled before we begin
you
now I had a blue card all right I loved
them everyone and good evening once
again my name is Angela Kelly and I
actually like to start by thanking you
Joseph person as Joseph acknowledged
many of the co-sponsoring groups and
individuals who made this evening
possible I think we should also
recognize his leadership and his vision
as you know we didn't start talking with
us almost a year ago now wondering what
this new moment would be but he had this
vision that we must come together at
this pivotal time as we confront both
new possibilities and worsening crises
before us so the theme of this evenings
panel is the challenge before us of
which there are many and they are both
complicated and interrelated as Joseph
pointed out in his welcome so as we look
ahead to the ways we can confront the
intersection intersecting challenges
before us and as we strive to find new
ways and new strategies for renewing and
expanding our activism in these
uncertain times we are very fortunate to
have two extremely evident and ass games
leaders here to guide our thinking as we
kick off this conference this evening
but before we get into our keynote
panelist remarks which I know we are all
very eagerly awaiting I'm just a few
practical announcements it seems like we
must be doing all set for speeding if
there's anyone else in the hallway
please do come in and find a seat thurs
seats in front that people will folks in
the audience will continue to help guide
straight folks in I'm just want to
remind everyone or announce if you
haven't seen in your program yet that
after the
this evening there will be three
breakout sessions where we will have a
chance to go deeper into the issues
raised by our speakers this evening and
it will also be a chance in the breakout
sessions to continue to build and
strengthen the relationships among us
which we know are really was key to
sustaining our movements and alliances
going forward so just to be thinking
about it as you're listening to the
speakers the topics and locations for
these breakout groups are in your packet
if you have one but if you don't there
will be a group of focus on processing
this panel discussion I'm sure we'll
have a very rich and intense
conversation with our speakers and a
current will stay right here in room 104
there will also be a group focused on
organ it on organizing on how we
translate what we hear tonight into
strategies for action and that
conversation will happen in room 112
which is down the hall in this direction
to my left and your right and finally
there will be a third group focused on
Obama the Obama era how we engage the
Obama administration the movement that
put them into office and that group will
be meeting down the Hawaiian description
to my right your left and Pearson 1060
please do stay and join us for those
discussions so that we can continue
these vital conversations and please
join us tomorrow as well the full day
will be starting with a fresh mints and
tabling the registration at 8am and
cabot hall which is at a 170 packard
avenue and set the top of the hill i
also want to let any students or young
activists who are here know if you
haven't heard you're invited to come
back again on sunday morning at nine
between nine-thirty inside there you
will have a brunch followed by a session
with Tom Kayden and some organizing and
strategizing specifically for students
and young activists so if you can't come
all day tomorrow please do you feel
welcome to come back on Sunday morning
and that will also be in Cabin
auditorium and finally just like to call
your attention to a few of the many
materials in your packets if you have
one tonight and it's not you'll get one
tomorrow as Joseph mentioned it's very
timely that we are meeting here today
after hearing the announcement of
President Obama's policy and plans for
Afghanistan which are certainly
troubling for many of us in the peace
movement who wants to see that
occupation also ended as we know there
continues to be great suffering for
Americans for the Afghan people for the
world community and for the global
economy for each day these wars go on
and on so please do take a look at the
call for national action for peace in
Afghanistan in your packet or
encouraging calls to the White House the
comment line is on there we're also
encouraging folks to march with many of
us within united for justice of peace
afsc many of the post bond buying
organizations are also endorsers of the
march next weekend on April fourth in
New York City the theme of which is
beyond war a new economy as possible so
a way to link together many of the
issues on our mind since we will do this
weekend and there's also a call for
local actions for peace in Afghanistan
April sixth and ninth and I know some
folks in the room already working on
setting up lobby visits and advanced
mobility so please do check that out and
there is also a flyer with more
information on the rally next Saturday
and how you can get tickets for that so
so you said we're bringing up rich
conversations join we want to move
forward taking action so these are a few
concrete ways you can do that in the
coming days so now we can turn our
attention to it I'm sure you've all been
waiting for the remarks by our very
special guests Noam Chomsky and Bill
Fletcher jr. both of them have
contributed so much to our movements
over the years each panelist will have a
little over half an hour to share his
thoughts on the challenges before us and
then we should have some time for Q&A
and discussion so first it is my great
honor to introduce professor Noam
Chomsky but he probably doesn't need
much of an introduction in this crowd we
certainly deserve
one professor Chomsky is a long time
intellectual leader speaker author and
activist whose work has been vital to
many social and political movements over
the last several decades is professor
emeritus of linguistics at MIT and the
author of numerous best-selling
political works his latest books are
failed states they've use of power and
his thoughts on democracy and what we
say it goes and a book about him the
essential Chomsky edited by Anthony
Arnold is a new collection of his
writings from the 1950s the president
that was just published last year so we
welcome and thank you for mr. coffee
how's that ok well the overall title for
the conference is so broad that I was
quite puzzled about how to get started
but as usual the morning papers the lead
story as you heard was that the
president obama announced his new Afghan
policy actually what's called a pack
policies Afghanistan Pakistan that's
actually good name the distinction
between Afghanistan and Pakistan this
imposed by British imperial power what's
called the durand line cuts right
through the question territories the
most troubled regions and the people
there have never accepted they don't
accept British imperial decision the
Afghan government as long as it's
functioning up through the seventies
never accepted so we'll go at a fact
like Obama the new policy as you know as
to the new announcement is to send four
thousand additional troops in addition
seventeen thousand already determined
that he sent there there was a little
item if you search from the Pakistani
Foreign Minister say please don't bomb
anymore but that's not very interesting
so there's also a decision to increase
