thirty-eight years ago a massive rally
against nuclear weapons took place in
Manhattan the New York Times reported on
June 13 1982 that hundreds of thousands
of peaceful demonstrators opposed to
nuclear arms overwhelmed Central Park in
midtown Manhattan yesterday filling the
streets and grows with echoing songs and
hopeful slogans the demonstration was
far larger than any during the anti-war
movement of the late 1960s and early 70s
and was possibly the largest ever in the
city the organizers said it was the
biggest disarmament gathering in the
nation's history late in the afternoon a
Police Department spokesman said there
might be as many as 600 or 700 thousand
people around the park
many of the dozens of speakers during
the day urged the participants to
continue the movement when they returned
to their homes quote we shall not suffer
silently the threat of nuclear holocaust
said City Council President Carol
Bellamy who addressed the crowd near the
United Nations that was a report from
the New York Times from June 13 1982
other reports said there might have been
a million people at the March
[Music]
why highlight this March now during a
pandemic that is killing tens of
thousands of people around the world
because the anti-scientific pandemic
denial that exacerbated the current
situation the anti-scientific climate
change denial that threatens human
civilization is also at work with the
denial of the threat of nuclear war that
will likely end most life on Earth
the 1982 March is an example of the kind
of popular movement that is required now
but more so we need a conscious movement
that on a broad national scale demands
urgent action and defense of the
unemployed and for economic and racial
justice for immediate and profound
action on climate change and concrete
moves towards the reduction and eventual
elimination of nuclear weapons we may
not be able to March for a while but
online and later in the streets and at
the ballot box such a popular movement
will decide if we humans survive now
joining me to analyze this most
existential moment his Noam Chomsky his
latest book is internationalism or
extinction delighted to be with you
so in in the early eighties there is a
massive movement focused on the issue
threat of nuclear war that's your dog in
the background I guess is it yeah that's
okay and you can join the conversation
the threat of nuclear war which you know
in a sense in the short term it's the
biggest threat it's not even being
talked about how do you explain how we
go from massive protests in the end the
80s on this to not even be not even part
of the discourse we should first of all
remember that that those huge
demonstrations had an effect a
significant effect one effect was that
they're part important part of the
background for the 1987 Reagan Gorbachev
agreement to establish the
and if treaty which sharply reduced the
number of the threat of war in Europe is
short term missiles were short-range
missiles were banned which were
extremely dangerous
that gave us a kind of a respite of from
a very likely terminal nuclear war and
of course as you know this was just
dismantled by President Trump in last
August who thumbed his nose at the world
and a still more spectacular way by
immediately launching missiles which
violated the treaty essentially inviting
others please create missiles to destroy
us and give a big shot in the arm to the
military industry which of course loves
well there wasn't but you're right this
severely declined and no matter how hard
you try to bring it up I do you do
others do it just doesn't make a dent
somehow it's for people that just
somehow feels too remote they have
immediate problems how am I gonna I mean
a half the population in the United
States is living essentially from
paycheck to paycheck
they don't have couple hundred a couple
hundred dollars to spare if anything
goes wrong this is one of the triumphs
of the neoliberal period assault on the
population that Reagan inaugurated these
people just don't have time to think
about anything else you remember in the
yellow vest uprising in France a couple
of months ago people are saying that one
of the slogan was you're worrying about
the end of the world we were entering
worrying about the end of the month
I mean if people
really in serious trouble they just
can't think anymore that doesn't answer
the question why privileged elite who
are getting by fine and some of them are
robbing the bank like gangsters why they
don't think about it and that's been
very troubling not just the you and me
but too many others couple years ago
William Perry who former defense
secretary long many years his
involvement in trying to deal with the
nuclear war issues in the government out
of it he commented he's now doubly
terrified terrified by the growing
threat which is very severe and
terrified because he can't seem to get
anyone to pay attention to it
well that's very serious we have a
president who is dedicated to destroying
the last vestiges of arm control arms
control ynf treaty went down the tube
last August
of the Open Skies treaty initiated by
Eisenhower is on the chopping block the
most crucial one the New START treaty
which limits the number of missiles for
the United States and Russia actually
for everyone but they're the only ones
that matter that call me even near the
threshold this is coming up for signing
in early at about a year early 2021 the
Russians have been pleading to negotiate
for an extension of the Trump
administration refuses to talk about it
which presumably means they're going to
kill it
he's reelected that ends it then there's
no arms control structure any longer if
you look at the record over the past 70
years 75 years it's it's kind of it's
just a miracle that we survived
we've come very close to terminal
nuclear war over and over
threats growing the arms control system
that has reduced the threat has been is
being dismantled by our government which
seems to be bent on killing as many
people as it can latest step was
defunding the World Health Organization
which will have exactly that effect they
don't care and the population just seems
a resistant to seeing what's before
their eyes
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
people that are condemning Trump for
pandemic and climate crisis denial what
about the denial of the threat of
nuclear war it seems to be the the the
majority of the intelligentsia even the
progressive intelligentsia do not say a
word about it and then you get to
someone like Barack Obama who early on
in his presidency talked about the
elimination of nuclear weapons in fact
some people think that's part of the
reason he got a Nobel Peace Prize early
practically before he'd done anything
but then he's the one that signs off on
a budget for 30 trillion 32 trillion
dollar investment in nuclear weapons no
that's part of his general posture was
to whether to pretend or to claim I
don't read his mind
that somehow he was making he was
accommodating with the political
opposition and they would forge a joint
policy of course they were just laughing
at him all the way Mitch McConnell
didn't made it was very explicit soon as
Obama was going to be elected elected
that his task as Senate Majority Leader
was to block anything that Obama tried
to do then he succeeded in that quick
will but Obama went along with it with
the either pretence or claim I don't
know and what you just described as part
of it the excuse of the administration
was that this was the only way they
could get compromises on other things
which is of course perfect nonsense
fulfill any of the rhetorical claims
that brought him into power he didn't do
the worse things but he certainly didn't
do the things he could have done in
Kaplan's book on the nuclear war threat
he says that Biden opposed that
investment and modernization of the
American nuclear arms
Arsenal didn't believe that it was
necessary or that the Republicans would
hold up any end of any deals that were
made what expectations do you have for
the what might be the Biden presidency
it's very hard to say he seems to have
pretty much faded into the background he
doesn't say much what he does say is
pretty tepid my impression is that in a
Biden presidency the decisions would be
made by the people around him and he
would be very much of an empty shell
probably at least I would hope
susceptible to popular pressures there's
no doubt whatsoever that he would be
immensely better than the megalomaniac
sociopath he's sitting in the White
House now but you could say that about
the nearest lamppost
threatened by one of the worst
characters in political history and the
highest priorities to get rid of him or
were probably a little toast Wyden I
suspect it would obviously be a great
improvement a great improvement but
whether what he would do I think it
depends very largely on the leave force
of popular movements Bernie Sanders in
his withdrawal speech made a very
important point which he emphasized that
it should be repeatedly emphasized he
said this campaign is ending but the
movement must continue an electoral
campaign is just one moment in an
ongoing process we're kind of trained to
believe that it's the the end will you
just show up once every four years and
then you go home that's a great way of
ducing Thorat Arianism and passivity but
it's not the case what happens on the
quadrennial extravaganza is you take off
a little time push a lever then go back
to work on the hard important things the
kind of activism and pressures that you
described at the beginning that were
part of the background for the important
nuclear deal or the kind that have
recently moved the green new deal which
something like that is essential for
survival moved it from way out in the
margins to the center of the legislative
agenda and many other cases that has to
continue constantly if it doesn't there
are there is a group in the society the
business world which is constantly
relentlessly fighting a bitter class war
doing it right now
they're preparing for the future right
now you know the propaganda line is we
can't pay attention to the climate
crisis because the pandemic is much
worse the rich and powerful aren't
listening to that they're taking every
opportunity they have to maximize the
climate crisis that's why the EPA before
our eyes is canceling regulations to
increase profit and deaths and lead to
and intensify the climate crisis that's
why President Trump in his quite
astonishing budget proposal in February
I'm sure you've looked at that but it
really should be highlight it's mid
February the epidemic already pandemic
is raging of course Trump is denying now
he claims it's the WHI was full but it
was he was denying and see that clearly
right in the middle of this he comes out
with his budget what does it call for
increased
funding of the Center for Disease
Control and other health related parts
of the government
he'd been defunding it since he got into
office new budget in the middle of the
pandemic is defunded further but it
didn't he fund everything for some
things he called for an increase in
funding including subsidies to the
fossil fuel industry I mean these guys
are really relentless they never stop
and if we let them go on without
opposition they'll win and we'll all
suffered badly in fact human survival is
at stake you said earlier that you don't
quite understand why the elites don't
get this whether its pandemic whether
it's climate or nuclear these are
threats to their own system and they
don't seem there doesn't seem to be a
force within capital within the elites
that would rise the way if an FDR did in
the 30s that has even in the defense of
capitalism has a far more farsighted
more rational approach the narrow short
frame of the pursuit of profit it's
going to destroy their own system and
don't they know that sure when the may
and let's take JPMorgan Chase America's
biggest bank Jamie Dimon knows
everything rolling the CEO knows
everything relevant about climate change
in nuclear war but he has a job maximize
profits tomorrow pain that's what his
huge salary depends on his bonuses as
what as shareholder wants its what the
ideology is remember that there was a
time it's called regimented capitalism
basically from Roseville pretty much up
to Reagan in which there actually were
serious efforts on the part of the
government and even on the part of some
court
patience to pay some attention to the
long-term future that changed sharply
when the shifted neoliberalism began the
doctrine I'm in announced by people like
Milton Friedman but of course they're
not the ones who pushed it through
pushed through by corporate power and
others with the free denies Hayek style
ideology which says that your only goal
as a corporate manager is greed try to
make as much money for yourself and your
shareholders very wealthy if you pay
attention to anything else you're
undermining leading foundations of
civilization and this wasn't just don't
pay attention to climate change in
nuclear war Reagan did some things that
are really right on thee in the
headlines right now but they've been
going on for years like there's a lot of
justified protest now about the stimulus
bill which gives the execs money I think
it's fifty billion dollars to the
airline industry which has spent the
last ten years in an orgy of buybacks to
raise stock prices and interfere with
the market and benefits management that
the approximately the amount that's
being given to them in the stimulus why
are they allowed to rob the public like
this not even stock buybacks but with
putting their money in an office in
Bermuda and calling it and using tax
haven and so on that's not small change
that's tens of trillions of dollars of
robbery we can thank Ronald Reagan and
milk Friedman and all the rest up until
the Reagan administration all of that
was illegal
flatly illegal and it was enforced the
Treasury Department enforced it and it
wasn't happening Reagan's on
the neoliberal doctrines appealing to
Friedman and the rest the idea was you
recall government is the problem not the
solution so get rid of government put
all decisions in the hands of
unaccountable private tyrannies whose
purpose as purpose by by in principle is
to maximize a profit
market share for themselves to pay
attention to nothing else so open the
door to stock buybacks to tax havens any
other means you can think of to rob the
public that don't pay attention to
anything that's happening a year down
the road if you can maximize profit
tomorrow all of this follows it's had a
devastating effect that's one of the
reasons why half the population is
living from paycheck to paycheck I don't
have to tell you that wealth has
enormous ly concentrated and for the
general population it's been stagnation
GDP increases productivity increases but
the population stagnates it's part of
the background for the anger resentment
bitterness that's spreading not just
over the United States but over much of
the world
and the webcam the Biden kid with
Sanders Biden says he wants his
presidency to be the most progressive
since Roosevelt what do you think are
the possibilities conditions for that
and clearly that doesn't happen without
a mass movement on a scale perhaps more
than there was in the 1960s what's been
holding back that kind of mass woman
well first of all I think it is taking
place that we should recognize that a
lot of things have happened
much of it under the within the
framework of Bernie Sanders is
inspiration he achieved enormous
successes he just shifted the agenda of
discourse and policy well to the left
things that are right in the center of
attention now you couldn't even talk of
a couple years ago so let's take again
say the green New Deal very significant
in one form or another it's absolutely
essential for survival couple of years
ago was either ridiculed or ignored now
it's is the center of the agenda the
Republicans of course want to kill it
business wants to kill it but it's alive
and well why well we know why there was
a lot of dedicated activism finally led
to the point where the sunrise movement
activists started even sitting in in
congressional offices they were
supported by some of the young
representatives elected 2018 again with
a lot of pressure from the Sanders
movement especially a Alexandria
LoCascio Cortes welcomed them supported
them Ed Markey senator from
Massachusetts who's been interested in
this issue joined moved to the
legislative agenda we have to recall
again Sanders's words this particular
campaign may be terminated but the
movement must go on brought together
things that already existed that black
lives matter occupy the environmental
movements the ones who carried out that
great campaign strike that protests the
climate protests last October shutting
down there wasn't large parts of the
world meant on here to extinction
rebellion all of these things are there
they kind of coalesced more or less onto
the framework of the Sanders inspired
movements and they have to go on so they
go on they can make a big difference you
mentioned earlier about concentration of
ownership and I think we're in a new
stage new phase of concentration of
ownership were these massive asset
manager financial institutions Blackrock
Vanguard - some slightly lesser extent
State Street according to Bloomberg the
three of them have fourteen trillion
dollars under management they vote those
shares which gives the three of them
essentially control of about 90 percent
of the S&P 500 Bloomberg News is
projecting that by 2030 they will have
20 trillion dollars under management two
or three companies essentially
controlling most of the corporate world
not just of the United States the
counter to that if you if you go back to
Biden's claim wanting to be the most
progressive government since Roosevelt
you go back to what Roosevelt said about
that kind of concentration of ownership
he said if there's monopolization in a
sector that's critical to the society
then you have to turn these things into
public utilities either highly regulated
private or if you can't do that public
ownership is it not time to start having
this kind of conversation because I have
to say even in the Sanders campaign
there's very very little of that and and
the sector that needs to be regulated as
a public utility and/or serious public
ownership of at least portion of it
would be financed
because Blackrock and Vanguard don't
just own banking they own the nuclear
arms industry if you look at the 18
companies that make nuclear arms the
majority shareholders I should say the
in terms of voting shares our Blackrock
Vanguard and State Street again of
course they own just about everything
else as well so what I'm I'm asking
shouldn't we start having this
conversation about public ownership
alongside one of democratization oh
absolutely we should also take a little
look back at history take a look at pre
Reagan history the period what's called
regimented capitalism basically from
Roseville up up through the 70s
beginning to erode in the seventies just
given a body blow by Reagan one of the
first things he had to do was bail out a
major bank his term ended with the the
massive real estate collapse goes on
Iran through Clinton and on through the
this millennium and now we're right in
the middle of another one the same
corporations that have been on a feeding
frenzy of stock buybacks raising
increasing wealth and management profits
are now back to the nanny state leading
to be bailed out
that interesting being bailed out as we
learned today with Treasury notes signed
by Donald Trump as part of his election
campaign what we see here is a
confluence of a number of factors one is
the inherently destructive character of
capitalism it's a suicidal institution
now that can be controlled the
regimented capital
through the 50s and 60s that did pretty
well controlled it then comes the second
thing the neoliberal assault which
eliminates the possibility of
controlling the monster then on top of
that you get a megalomaniac sociopath
holding power surrounded by sycophants a
head of a political party which is too
cowardly and has lost even the slightest
element of integrity so though all they
can do is lick his boots you have a huge
echo chamber foxnews that trump says two
plus two equals five but an hour later
Sean Hannity says that's the greatest
discovery in the history of the human
race then
Trump turns to the Fox on friends the
next morning repeats what he said there
in this structure that's developed is a
kind of a Hydra that's destroying us for
many directions bombers are essentially
doing nothing except helping so take say
their dedication of all their efforts of
an impeachment trial it was transparent
at the beginning that this was going to
end up in a victory for Trump it was
almost impossible for anything else to
happen the issue that was raised didn't
mean much to most of the population why
should it so the president who is a
certified gangster we all know that it
was putting pressure on some other
country to harm a leading figure in the
Democratic Party okay probably
impeachable technically but nobody cares
and I was going to end up with with the
Senate which is in Trump's pocket anyway
blocking the impeachment so a great
victory the Tribune of the people was
saved from the attack by the deep state
trying to destroy
little cheer I mean that's what they're
devoting their attention to not his
climate policies which are murderers
will literally lead to the end of
organized human life not his opening the
doors to nuclear destruction and not
even has steps to destroy democracy
which are pretty astonishing know you'll
worry about that he pressures from
country that nobody ever heard of to
harm Joseph okay as if they're working
for a case after case this the only way
out of this is essentially Sanders is
advice the movement has to keep going
the immediate necessity is to get rid of
the malignancy in the White House we
don't do that nothing else is gonna
matter
don't you think that the idea of
regulated capitalism which is more or
less what Warren is proposing going back
to Bernie - really hasn't that horse
left the barn this turned towards
neoliberalism wasn't because they won an
ideological argument I don't think I
think the digital revolution
computerization it created the ability
to have globalization on such a
different scale to play the workers of
China off against the workers of Europe
and America the idea of these fancy
derivative products and the enormous
expansion of Wall Street and speculation
you couldn't do that with a pencil and
paper the digital revolution at least
this enormous strength to this financial
sector and enormous new productivity and
profits going to this tiny 1% and the
political power that goes with that I
mean it's the pandemic now showing us
that one way or the other this society
is being moved towards some kind of form
of socialism and that does shouldn't we
start talking about that more than
honestly well as much as important as
Medicare for all is the concept of
Medicare for all you know a government
health insurance plan we have to look at
that in other sectors of the economy
otherwise I think we're doomed
first of all the digital revolution
could be used for this purpose could be
used to break the whole system down
right ends how you how you use it
technology doesn't care just as it's
just as a amenable to one uses another
now it's not just the minute there are
steps that can be taken right away
not just for to diminish or you can
eliminate the scale of the financial
institutions
break up the banks have a National Bank
all this is feasible but what about the
fossil fuel industry why shouldn't that
be simply bought up by the government
and basically moved to put it out of
business that's feasible yeah that add
to that what would you ask foreign
policy be if if the government bought up
and made public Raytheon and Boeing and
Lockheed Martin take the profit motive
out of war well it depends what kind of
government you had and who runs it
behind it was the government gonna be
run by the same corporate leaders who
run it now or will they turn into a
democratic government there is a way for
that sounds kind of utopian but it is
possible for the United States to turn
into a democracy okay if it does then
socialization of major industries could
be a big step forward it's not the end I
stepped right behind beyond that already
to some limited extent taking place is
for not the government to own them but
for the stakeholders to own them to
working the workers in the enterprise
why don't they own them why don't they
run the enterprise not the state break
it up turn it over to the people who
work there that's quite significant so
let's take a real case suppose there's a
you know some manufacturing plant in
Gary Indiana and the idea comes up of
shifting it to Mexico or China or
Vietnam who should make the decision
should it be a bunch of bankers sitting
in New York and Chicago who only who run
the enterprise or should it be the
people there the workers in the plant
and the community who decide what to do
maybe in coordination
with working people in Mexico in China
that's not impossible either may
remember that unions are all called
internationals know right now that
sounds empty it wasn't when it was
instituted these were going to be the
International working class the
capitalist system is suicidal we can't
get around that the question is going to
be controlled and open till roughly
Reagan it was pretty much controlled
then it just blew out of hands and
you're getting the situation you have no
no I'm I promise not to let this go on
too long so let me just ask you one
final question right and I also hope we
get to do this again sooner than later
well what what do you say to some of the
young people not only young people that
are being very critical of Bernie
Sanders right now for endorsing Biden
even some people that worked with him
quite closely are critiquing him what do
you say to them I say wait a couple
months and then start critiquing him
there is a crucial urgent problem right
ahead of us get rid of the malignancy in
the White House if you don't do that
nothing else is going to matter and
we've been talking about climate a
global warming which Trump is of course
going to accelerate maybe best tipping
points nuclear war which he's
accelerating which means what may why us
out but there's a lot of other things
going on the real evil genius of this
administration in many ways is Mitch
McConnell the White House may be a freak
show but Mitch McConnell is serious he
knows what he's doing I assume it very
effectively
he's packing the courts with young
mostly unqualified or limited
qualifications ultra-right young jurists
who are going to
ensure that for the next generation or
so whatever the public wants
it'll be killed in favor of the
reactionary ideologies that McConnell
and those like him typify another four
years of Trump that may be beyond the
level to control that means whatever
you're gonna try to do will be shot down
okay
we're facing a real crisis in November
this election is without exaggeration
the most important in American or world
history if we don't don't get by that
we're in deep trouble suppose we get
suppose Wyden comes in okay then comes
the time to hold his feet to the fire
Sanders and popular pressures are
probably going to make a mildly
progressive Democratic Party program
make them keep to it make him go beyond
it by the kinds of public pressures that
you open our discussion by bringing up
that progress recently the green New
Deal proposals many other things keep
that happening follow Sanders is advice
to get by this election then turn to
keeping the movement going and growing
and expanding and becoming more militant
than effective that's the hope for the
future it can do all the things we're
talking about can break up the financial
institutions reduce them to being banks
again and take over the fossil fuel
industry socialize it move to put it out
of business that can socialize other
institutions put the Mane's of working
people in communities all of this is
possible none of its you know in fact
the whole system that exists now is
actually pretty fragile that doesn't
take much to dismantle it I'll give you
one last example
there we go you may have seen a memo was
leaked recently from JPMorgan Chase
country's biggest bank
economists in the bank put out a memo
directed to investors leaked it's very
interesting it points out that if we set
up quoting the survival of humanity is
at risk if we pursue our present course
including the lending policies of the
bank and then it says the bank is under
reputational pressure to cut back on
fossil fuel funding what's reputational
pressure that's the presence of the
pitchforks banging on the doors the same
kind of thing that was in the background
with Reagan signing the INF treaty
million other things these are things we
should remember the future really is in
the hands of energetic engaged
population if they take the opportunity
if they decide to sit it out then we're
in deep trouble
thanks very much snow okay and thank you

broadcast I'd like to thank my friend
