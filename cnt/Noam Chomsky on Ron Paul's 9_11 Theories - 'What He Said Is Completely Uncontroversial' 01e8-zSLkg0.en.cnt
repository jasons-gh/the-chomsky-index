to the assassination of Osama bin Laden
Aaron well Noah you mentioned the
changes in discourse between 10 years
ago and today and actually this issue of
the reasons behind 9/11 came up last
night at the Republican presidential
debate congressman Ron Paul of Texas
drew boos from the crowd and a rebuke
from other candidates on the podium when
he criticized US foreign policy in
discussing the roots of 9/11 we're under
great threat because we occupy so many
countries we're in a hundred and thirty
country we have 900 bases around the
world we're going broke the purpose of
al Qaeda was to attack us invite us over
there where they can target us and they
have been doing it they have more
attacks against us and the American
interest per month then occurred in all
the years before 9/11 but we're they're
occupying their land and if we think
that we can do that and not have
retaliation we're kidding ourselves we
have to be honest with ourselves what
would we do if another country say China
did to us what we do to all those
countries over there so this whole idea
that the whole Muslim world is
responsible for this and they're
attacking us because we are free and
prosperous that is just not true
Osama bin Laden and
have been expressive
they have been explicit and they wrote
and said that we attacked we attacked
America because you had bases on our
holy land in Saudi Arabia you do not
give Palestinians a fair treatment and
you have been bombing I didn't say that
I'm trying to get you to understand what
the motive was behind the bombing at the
same time we had been bombing and
killing hundreds of thousands of Iraqis
for ten years would you be annoyed if
you're not annoyed under some problem
that was Republican Congress member Ron
Paul of Texas speaking last night at the
Republican presidential debate Nam
Chomsky responds I think what he said is
completely uncontroversial you can read
it in government documents you can find
it in polls maybe people don't like to
hear it but as I mentioned before it
goes back to the 1950s actually right
after 9/11 The Wall Street Journal to
its credit did a study of privileged
Muslims sometimes called moneyed Muslims
people in the world who are deeply
embedded in the u.s. global project
lawyers of directors of multinational
corporations and so on not the general
population and it was very much like
what Eisenhower had was concerned about
it and the National Security Council in
1950s there was a lot of antagonism a
lot of antagonism the US policy in the
region
partly support of dictators blocking
democracy and development just as the
National Security Council concluded in
1958 also by then by 2001 there were
much more specific things very much a
lot of anger about the u.s. backing for
the way Israeli occupation of the
occupied territories settlements the
bitter oppression of the Palestinians
and also something that didn't discuss
much here but meant a lot there and
remember these are privileged Muslims
leaders of those who kind of carry out
implement the general US economic and
social policies in the region
this the other thing besides the Israeli
but supportive Israeli crimes was the
sanctions against Iraq this is 2001
remember the sanctions against Iraq were
brutal and destructive they killed
hundreds of thousands of people the both
of the international diplomats who
administered the oil-for-food program
distinguished international diplomats at
Dennis holiday on sueance Banach in
sequence both of them resigned in
protest because they regarded the
sanctions as genocidal they were
carrying out a kind of a mass slaughter
of Iraqis they were strengthening Saddam
Hussein they were compelling the
population to rely on him just for
survival and the these were major crimes
of the 1990s and privileged Muslims
money Muslims in the in in the Saudi
Arabia elsewhere they were bitterly
opposed to this not because I hate our
freedoms because they don't like
murderers and brutal policies
