Sheldon Wolin in democracy incorporated
describes our society's institutions as
having evolved in such a manner that
they limit the influence of what looking
elsewhere called but we will they've
heard while protecting the interests of
the elite or specialized class which
dovetails with many of the themes you
discussed as well for example in
manufacturing consent as you like to
remember along with Edward Herrmann you
discussed mass media and its ability to
naturally limit success within it to the
individuals who demonstrate an
internalization of and fealty to the
prevailing accepted myths and
perspectives of elites so Wolin as you
may or may not know call such a system
inverted totalitarianism a form of
totalitarianism which rules through
subtle coercion as opposed to over
brutality so my first question is do you
think would you consider the United
States a totalitarian state either
inverted or otherwise no I think that's
the best exaggeration also it's not
quite accurate about Lippmann okay
the reason that book was called
manufacturing consent was because we
borrow the phrase from over Lippmann who
was in favor of manufacturing consent
right his position was that
manufacturing consent is a new art in
the practice of democracy because in his
view a leech ought to rule mm-hmm the
general public or what he called the
ignorant and meddlesome Outsiders right
who should just be observers spectators
well the responsible men like him should
be in the position to make decisions and
control things and they have to be
protected from the would equal the war
on trampling of the bewildered her
mm-hmm so actually it's the other way
around he was a strong advocate of the
system that the woman calls inverted
totalitarianism but I think the craziest
mislead
okay there's a big difference between
facing you know a terrorist security
force and facing advertising there's
quite a difference and we shouldn't
minimize that difference right there are
lots of techniques of intellectual
self-defense that don't work when
security forces come in and want to blow
your head off or when or in a torture
chamber there is very significant
difference and what actually happened is
that roughly a century ago in the freest
countries in the world Britain in the
United States it began to be recognized
by elites that they're losing the power
to control by force too much freedom was
being won by popular struggle wasn't
being given it was won by hard struggle
so you were getting things like labor
movements parliamentary Labour Party's
women starting to get the right to vote
the general public was beginning to free
itself from coercion and therefore you
had to find other ways to control people
and the other ways are what Lippmann
advocated controlling attitudes and
opinions and that's the beginning of the
growth of a huge industry the public
relations industry which is a in fact in
its early days in the 1920s when they're
kind of more open and honest about it it
was simply called a propaganda industry
the primary text back in the 1920s
actually by an associative Lippman's
Edward brown eyes it was called
propaganda right he was in favor for he
called engineering of consent basically
the same idea
the intelligent minorities have to
control things and it's for the good of
the population one
versus American political science Harold
Lasswell said Brown same time we should
not be deluded by Democratic dogmatism
about people being the best judges of
their own interests they're not we are
and and so we have to control their
attitudes and opinions that drive them
to mindless consumerism we have to
fabricate months we have to a demise of
them separate them from one another
breakdown associations like that destroy
unions and so on mm-hmm we have to
change the public education systems it
was some of their followers a little bit
later we have to improve the
indoctrination of the young
reacted for the liberal reactions of the
1960s and I should say that I'm quoting
just progresses Lippmann were nice last
well for our lateral Commission they're
all progressives that's Wilson Roosevelt
kennedy-carter
liberals you go to the right and it's
much larger right so it's much more
interesting to look at the liberal end
of the spectrum yeah but it's
fundamentally the same it's just too
dangerous to let people make their own
decisions we have to control them like
have to control a three-year-old
even though
around the streets so they're good and
then the only question is well who runs
right a totalitarian state The Dictator
runs it and uses force in a more
democratic society forces are still
there but it's much less available like
in the modern United States the force is
available against people without
privilege right so if you're a black kid
and they get it let's say yeah which is
available but for people like us it's a
very limited and we should recognize
that we're privileged we have a lot of
privilege we can resist the violence to
a very substantial degree but and then
come the more subtle means which are
significant we shouldn't downplay them
agree with one that they're significant
but to say that their forms the pellet
arianism I think is it miss miss tapes
great differences so you take a look at
that painting over there mm-hmm
you see what the adult terrorism is
right that's a depiction of us trained
us armed security forces which are
blowing out the brains of leading
intellectuals and I'll saw the door 1989
we don't hear about that that's part of
manufacturing consent all right but it
happened and there's a big difference
between being one of those Jesuit
intellectuals and sitting here in this
office that's private difference Chris
Hedges talks about how there is an
apparatus that exists currently in the
country with the NSA monitoring and all
of these developments that have happened
that create an atmosphere sort of right
for the rise of totalitarianism
traditional totalitarianism how alarmed
are you at the prospect of that's of
those it certainly doesn't have to it an
in fact it's already being somewhat
undermined so yes it creates the
atmosphere and it's not new
nothing new about it so in the 1960s
there was an FBI operation FBI are the
national political police that's furious
and most of their activities
incidentally have devoted to dissent
independence of thought that was shown
for example of the media files that were
liberated reasonably some discussion of
that the content of those was quite
interesting this is the main FBI Center
for eastern Pennsylvania and most of
their activities were devoted to
independent thought and activism a small
part about car robberies smaller about
Matthew and that's what they are well in
the nineteen sixties there was a program
organized by the as they are the
executive the president all the way down
COINTELPRO which was designed to the
first it was the late fifties attacking
the Communist Party than the American
Indian Movement for Ric independence
movement the black movement the new left
the women's movement to finally just
about all critical opposition to state
power and it was no joke that actually
did go as far as political assassination
that none of people like us but if a
black organizer and the Chicago geta was
murdered we're essentially just
opto-style
attack set up by the FBI okay that's two
adult Arianism but that's the black
ghetto and that was much worse than
anything that's happening now and it was
finally stopped by court order around
the mid seventies but what's happening
if surveillance is a bad bad news but
it's not that we shouldn't make these
distinctions and it's easier to overcome
first of all it's not as it's not as
destructive so you don't want to have
here from
take a look the way it's working it's
just a couple of days ago at grim glenn
greenwald's new media outlet published
their first piece they've spent some
other revelations and it was very
interesting what it showed is that these
NSA techniques for tracing people by
looking at their mobile phones and so on
are being used for the assassination
program Obama has a global assassination
program the biggest global terrorism
program in the world nobody supports it
except in the United States and how are
they finding targets people they want to
kill they decide they're gonna kill well
what do things like they use the NSA
programs to trace the trace where they
are you know their mobile phones or
anything can use any information you can
use about them and then they kill but
they want to say I call them like maybe
I lent you my mobile phone okay that
kill you that's how the assassination
program works and anything him because
he's standing next to your mind okay
that's that's quite different from
checking where you and I are going like
Who am I like maybe your maybe your
phone is on now so okay they can tell
that we're talking to each other that's
nowhere near as bad as being
assassinated
we should make those distinctions yes
it's all wrong and it should be
dismantled the we should also ask some
questions about it the pretext is
security but security is an interesting
word security for whom I mean if you
read if you study international
relations theory they tell you that a
prime concern of governments is security
maybe the prime concern but they don't
tell you security for whom like is it
security for the population overwhelming
evidence that that's not a high
or that they say the drone program again
that's creating dangers for the u.s.
population it's generating terrorists
faster than they're killing suspects and
they know it takes a the nuclear weapons
programs
though they're not defending the
population so why do they persist on
because there's a different kind of
security involved two kinds the one kind
of security is security of state power
from its own population the state is
always trying to protect itself from the
domestic enemy they don't want people to
know what they're up to a large part of
the security system is that if you
invest a lot of time and maybe you have
and going through declassified documents
you read through those documents you
find out very much it's connected with
national security and you know the usual
steps
mostly it's keeping from the popular
keeping secret what we're doing like the
secrecy over NSA are they keeping it
secret from al-qaeda they know what's
going on they're keeping it secret from
you and me because they want the
population to know what they're doing
that's one kind of security the other
kind of security is what you see right
at this moment in international
negotiations over what's called trade
though it isn't really trade like the
trans-pacific partnership TPP that's
being done in secret or partially that
secret from the population it's not
secret from the hundreds of corporate
lawyers and lobbyists who are writing
the legislation right now you can
imagine what kind of legislation they're
writing but it has to be kept secret
from a population because you have to
protect the security of the corporate
sector you have to protect the security
of the wealthy and the powerful that's
an important because they're the ones
who sort of dominate the society hadn't
even run the political system pretty
much so you've had a kind of security
but it's not
right and in fact this came out pretty
strikingly with the Snowden revelations
you may recall that the first reaction
of the government detail examined of the
general charge was that he was asked
what have they done he said what they
stopped he said I think 54 terrorist
operations and there were further
inquiries and he cut it down to eight
and I finally cut it down to one and
that one terrorist operation was some
guy who gave $8,000 to some charity in
Somalia that's what the system has teeth
right there was recently a an
interesting statement by Hadley Stevens
on the third senator who was four years
in charge of it was on these senatorial
committees for intelligence and back in
the seventies the eighties he discusses
what they did he said he said first of
all the intelligence was mostly
irrelevant they were getting everything
along he said what we needed was
cerebral intelligence the ability to
think it not taking information from the
Mossad Israeli intelligence which is
shaped to mislead us for their interests
not you know signal intelligence which
to anything and they missed all the
significant things like they missed
before the Shah they missed the end of
the Soviet Union Robert Gates it gates
you know just wrote his memoirs he
condemned was all over the newspapers he
condemned Joseph Biden for getting
everything wrong and how about gates the
gates was a Russian specialists that's
what he's trended Soviet specials Big
Shot the CIA did he predict the fall of
Soviet Union he totally missed it the
effort happened he was filmed that still
dinner stand this is the top guy and not
in charge of Russian intelligence well
that like cerebral intelligence about
Siemens implanted
actually pointed out that their own
investigations did predict the fall of
the shower without intelligent just by
thinking about local expending what was
happening okay
the idea that this stuff protects your
security should it's very definitely a
challenge actually for two reasons one
reason is but whenever a government is
caught doing something instantly the
plea is security that's reflexive since
it's reflexive it carries no information
it's predictable so you just disregard
it then you try to look at the facts
put aside the Protestant when they look
at the facts it turns out security code
not much to do it except security and
the second special sense security is the
state from its own citizens and security
of the powerful domestic elements in the
state which in our society protected
primarily and you go back to it that our
realtor called Terry and state is
different they are also protecting their
security but there it's clear what it is
the state and the powerful segments
within it are basically identical and
they're using force to protect their
security so it's kind of transparent you
know society like ours it's you got to
think a little bit after you cerebral
intelligence takes Stephenson's words to
figure out what's going on but you know
it's not quantum physics I mean anybody
can figure it out of things but to think
about it but just as you can think about
there are things that aren't talked
about that are massively significant I
so like you took an economics course
when you were in college right so you
were taught that markets are based on
wrecked on informed consumers making
rational choices that leads to the
marvels of markets turn on the
television set what do you see you see
huge efforts being made to create
uninformed consumers making irrational
is a huge part of the economy is devoted
to undermining markets instead to
controlling people that ought to be the
first thing that you're taught in the
economics course that would be chapter
one know everything I have to prove it
just told people look at your TV city
and it's immediately obvious but those
things are it's not conscious deception
there ideologically suppressed you know
part of the ideology to suppress what's
happening and it's not that anyone's I'm
trying to do it it's just it's built in
you've learned it actually George Orwell
have some nice comments about it yeah
you read Animal Farm when you were way
back in high school back in high school
but you didn't read the introduction to
Animal Farm and the reason is it was
depressed it was discovered years later
in Orwell's unpublished papers and it's
kind of interesting in the yeah in the
introduction he he says basically said
look this book is a satire of the
totalitarian enemy but he said in free
England it's not a lot different he said
in England unpopular ideas can be
suppressed without the use of force and
then he talks a little about the way
it's done he says partly it's that the
press is owned by wealthy men who have
every reason to want ideas to be
suppressed but he's but there's a
stronger reason that good education he
said if you've gone through good schools
Oxford and Cambridge you have instilled
into you the understanding that there
are certain things that just wouldn't do
to say like for example that a huge part
of the economy's devoted undermining
markets or that people should not be
allowed to make their own person
we have to control them you know it just
wouldn't do to say that it's fun that's
and it's not a sort of a conscious
choice not to say it look at something
your economics professor was trying to
hide something it's just you have a good
education that's internalized you know
you don't say things like that
just like the press knows for example
that it doesn't report zero reporting of
a very important study that came out a
month ago one of the major international
polling organizations did a study in
which they asked people which at which
country in the world is the greatest
threat to world peace that gets through
one not even close the u.s. was far away
above anyone else way down below was
second place Pakistan which was inflated
by the Indians would be red and you
couldn't even find well you just that's
not the kind of thing you say but nobody
told the editors don't publish that it's
just you know you don't publish things
like that we're supposed to be the
beacon of freedom and so on and Iran is
supposed to be the threat so you can't
publish the fact that the whole world
was it the other way around wouldn't do
and this happens all the time
ok but that's a lot easier to combat and
those security forces that were blowing
the brains up intellectual a lot easy
