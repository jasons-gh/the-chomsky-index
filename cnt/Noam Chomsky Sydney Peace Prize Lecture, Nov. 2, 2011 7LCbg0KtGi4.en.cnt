okay before I invite our distinguished
guests to the stage just a few words
about how we choose the Peace Prize I
used to be able to tell you who'd won
that the Peace Prize in the previous
years and what the title of them that
their lectures had been but we're into
the 15th year next year would take too
long but we did begin with Muhammad
Yunus whose Peace Prize lecture would
was called peace is freedom from poverty
and that will give you the notion that
while we are interested in peace we are
100 times more interest in peace with
justice
that that leads me into explained the
three simple criteria which the jury
ates people from diverse walks of life
used to choose the the candidate the
first criterion has to do with a
commitment to peace with justice
globally in other words it's not good
enough to be committed to it in woolum
Allu second yardstick has to do with the
commitment to universal human rights and
the third criterion is about the use of
the language and philosophy and practice
of non-violence
usually when we deliberate and it takes
about three months a theme emerges that
reflects what is going on politically
socially economically at the time and a
year ago when we were scratching our
heads about 22 nominees the issue of
freedom of speech freedom of the press
the erosion of civil liberties as a
result of laws being passed to reflect
the concern with security became a big
issue in tandem with the WikiLeaks
controversy and the ambivalent attitude
of some powerful people to the
revelations from WikiLeaks and given
those themes of course what emerged
inevitably many of us thought at long
last to the top of the power came
somebody who for 50 years has been a
champion of freedom of speech freedom of
the press and has challenged secrecy and
censorship and in government of all
kinds of spoken truth to power and has
told us the UH about the undue influence
of the media in manufacturing consent
that person of course was a
distinguished social scientist scientist
of linguistics and great champion of
human rights nom Chomsky at this point
I'm going to ask you to welcome
professor Chomsky to the stage and in
front of you I'm going to explain to him
why he really won the Peace Prize
non-trump
he hasn't said anything yet in addition
to the things I've said about the three
criteria at naam which have to do with
the selection of the Peace Prize we were
obviously we obviously were completely
familiar with your your notion that that
academics for example should not make a
distinction between theory and practice
that you I have an obligation that we
have an obligation to say what we
believe in and what we stand for and in
the vernacular of them of the students
you've been one of the key people who
has not only talked the talk but has
also walked the walk and at a time when
education has become such a huge
business of money that's incredibly
incredibly important the citation from
the jury refers to you inspiring the
conviction of millions about a common
humanity and for unfailing moral courage
and we've rewarded you two for
challenging secrecy and censorship in
government and for always questioning
the business of violence as appeal as a
piece of foreign and even of domestic
policies but we were also inspired by
your ability to create hope through
scholarship and activism about the
attainment of universal human rights
that's what it says it may that citation
may as to a language expert like you
sound a bit wordy but it was crafted by
a committee of eight people now you're
way here in 1995 16 years ago to remind
Australians about the human rights
abuses indeed the genocide that was
going on up the road in East Timor and
I often thought then I wonder if you
will ever come back to this stage and if
you did come back all you'd have to do
would be to sit here and the audience
would merely need to come and show their
gratitude but you're not going to get
away with that you're we've come to show
our gratitude but it's now my great
pleasure to invite you to give the 2011
city of Sydney Peace Prize lecture
as we all know the United Nations was
founded quoting its founding document to
save succeeding generations from the
scourge of war these words can only
elicit deep regret when we consider how
we have acted to fulfill this aspiration
though there have been a few significant
successes notably in Europe for
centuries Europe had been the most
violent place on earth with murderous
and destructive internal conflicts and
the forging of a culture of war
that enabled Europe to conquer most of
the world shocking the victims who were
hardly pacifists but who were appalled
by the all destructive fury of European
warfare the words of the British
military historian Jeffrey Parker and
the same culture of war enabled European
European pose on its conquest what Adam
Smith called the savage injustice of the
Europeans England and the leaders he did
not fail to emphasize the global
conquest took a particularly horrifying
form in what is sometimes called the
Anglosphere that's England and its
offshoots settler colonial societies in
which the indigenous societies were
devastated and their people dispossessed
or exterminated but since 1945 Europe
has become internally the most peaceful
and in many ways the most humane a
region of the earth which actually is
the source of some of its current
travail
important topic that I will have to put
aside now in scholarship this quite
dramatic transformation is often
attributed to the thesis of the
Democratic piece the thesis that
democracies do not go to war with one
another not to be overlooked however is
that Europeans came to realize that the
next time they indulge in their favorite
pastime of slaughtering one another the
game will be over civilization has
developed the means of destruction that
can only be used against those who are
too weak to retaliate in kind it's a
large part of the appalling history of
the post-world War two years it's not
that the threat of great power the
conflict has ended the us-soviet
confrontations came painfully close to a
virtually terminal nuclear war in ways
that are shattering to contemplate if we
inspect them carefully
but the threat of nuclear war remains
all too ominously alive a matter to
which I'll briefly return can we proceed
to at least limit the scourge of war one
answer is given by absolute pacifists
that includes people I respect though
I've never felt able to go beyond that a
somewhat more persuasive stand I think
is that of the pacifist thinker and
social activist AJ musty is one of the
great figures of 20th century America in
my opinion this is what he called
revolutionary pacifism must be disdained
peace the search for peace without
justice he urged I'm quoting him now
that one must be a revolutionary before
one can be a pacifist and by that he
meant
we have to cease to acquiesce so easily
in evil conditions and we must deal
honestly and adequately with this 90% of
our problem the violence on which the
present system is based and all the evil
material and spiritual this entails for
the masses of men throughout the world
unless we do so he argued there's
something ludicrous and perhaps
hypocritical about our concern for the
10% of the violence employed by the
rebels against depression and that's
true no matter how hideous they may be
he was confronting the hardest problem
of the day for a pacifist the question
of whether to take part in the
anti-fascist war in writing about Musti
stand forty-five years ago I quoted his
warning that the problem after a war is
with the victor he thinks he has just
proved that war and violence pay who
will teach him a lesson and his
observation was all to act at that time
that was well the Indochina wars were
raging and on all too many other
occasions since then the Allies did not
fight the good war as it's commonly
called because of the awful crimes of
fascism before their attacks on Western
powers the fascists were treated rather
sympathetically particularly that
admirable Italian gentleman as FDR
President Roosevelt called Mussolini
even Hitler was regarded by the US State
Department as a moderate holding off the
extremists of right and left and the
British were even more sympathetic and
particularly the business world
Roosevelt's close confidant
the Sumner Welles reported to the
president that the Munich Settlement
that dismembered Czechoslovakia quote
him presented the opportunity for the
establishment by the nations of the
world of a new world order based on
justice and upon law in which the Nazi
moderates would play a leading role as
late as April 1941 after the war had
broken out the influential statesman
George Kennan was at the dovish extreme
of the post-war planning spectrum he
wrote from his consular post in Berlin
that German leaders have no wish to see
other people suffer under German rule
are most anxious that their new subjects
should be happy in their care and are
making important compromises to ensure
this benign outcome though by then the
horrendous facts of the Holocaust were
well known they scarcely entered the
Nuremberg trials which focused on
aggression at what they called the de
tribunal called the supreme
international crime the differing only
from other war crimes in that it
contains within itself the accumulated
evil of the whole everything that
follows the aggression in Indochina in
Iraq all too many other places where we
have much to contemplate the horrifying
crimes of Japanese fascism were
virtually ignored in the post-war peace
settlement and Japan's aggression began
exactly 80 years ago with the staged
Mukden incident but for the West it
began 10 years later with the attack on
military bases in two US possessions
Pearl Harbor and Manila India and other
major Asian countries refused even to
attend the 1951 San Francisco peace
treaty base treaty conference because
of the exclusion of Japan's crimes in
Asia as and also because of Washington's
establishment of a major military base
in conquered Okinawa still there despite
the energetic protests of the population
it's useful to reflect on several
aspects of the Pearl Harbor attack
seventy years ago that one is the
reaction of historian Kennedy advisor
Arthur Schlesinger to the bombing of
Baghdad in March 2003 Schlesinger
recalled President Roosevelt's words
when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor on a date
which will live in infamy today
Slazenger wrote today it is we Americans
who live in infamy as our government
adopts the policies of Imperial Japan
thoughts that were barely articulated
elsewhere in the mainstream and very
quickly suppressed I could find no
emotion no mention of this principled
stand in the praise for Ashley jinger's
accomplishments that when he died a few
years later we can also learn a lot
about ourselves by caring Schlesinger's
lament a few steps further by today's
standards Japan's attack was justified
indeed meritorious Japan after all was
exercising with the much lauded doctrine
of anticipatory self-defence when it
bombed military bases in Hawaii and the
Philippines two virtual US colonies and
did so with reasons far more compelling
than anything that bush and Blair could
conjure up when they thought that the
policies of Imperial Japan
in 2003 Japanese leaders were well aware
that b-17 Flying Fortresses were coming
off the Boeing production lines and they
could read in the American press that
these killing machines would be able to
burn down Tokyo called the city of rice
paper and wood houses a November 1940
plan to bomb Tokyo and other big cities
was enthusiastically received by
Secretary of State Cordell hall and
Roosevelt as well was simply delighted
was reported at the plans - quoting to
burn the industrial part of the empire
with firebomb attacks on the teeming
bamboo antiques of Honshu and Kyushu
this was outlined by their author
general Tsion owned by July 1941 the Air
Corps the Air Corps was flight was
ferrying b-17s
to the Far East for this purpose
assigning a half of all the big bombers
for this region even taking them from
the Atlantic sea lanes they were to be
used if needed to set the paper cities
of Japan on fire according to General
George Marshall Roosevelt's main
military advisor that was in a press
briefing three weeks before Pearl Harbor
four days later in New York Times senior
correspondent Arthur crock reported u.s.
plans to bomb Japan from Siberian and
Philippine bases in which the earth to
which the Air Force was rushing
incendiary bombs intended for civilian
targets and the United States knew from
decoded messages that Japan was well
aware of these plans history actually
provides
ample evidence to support musti's
conclusion that the problem after a war
is with the victor who thinks he has
just proved that war and violence pay
and the real answer to musti's question
who will teach him a lesson can only be
the domestic population if they can
adopt elementary moral principles and
even the most uncontroversial of these
principles that could have a major
impact on ending injustice and war
so consider the principle of
universality and perhaps the most
elementary of moral principles that we
apply to ourselves
the standards we apply to others if not
more stringent ones this principle is
universal or nearly so in three further
respects it's found in some form and
every moral code it is universally
applauded in words and consistently
rejected in practice the facts are plain
and they should be troublesome the
principle has a simple corollary which
suffers the same fate
we should distribute finite energies to
the extent that we can influence
outcomes typically that's on cases for
which we share responsibility we take
that for granted with regard to enemies
so no one cares whether Iranian
intellectuals that join the ruling
clerics in condemnation of crimes of
Israel or the United States rather we
ask what do they have to say about the
crimes of their own state we honored
Soviet dissidents on the same grounds of
course that's not the reaction within
their own societies these dissidents are
condemned as
anti-soviet or supporters of the great
satan much as their counterparts here
are condemned as anti-american and the
supporters of today's official enemy and
of course punishment of those who adhere
to elementary moral principles can be
severe the house of year depends on the
nature of the society so in Soviet run
Czechoslovakia for example vaselov Havel
was imprisoned and at the same time in
u.s. run El Salvador his counterparts
had their brains blown out by an elite
battalion fresh from renewed training at
the John F Kennedy School of Special
Warfare in North Carolina acting on
explicit orders of the High Command
which was which had intimate relations
with Washington we all know and respect
Havel for his courageous resistance but
who can even name the leading Latin
American intellectuals that Jesuit
priests who were added to the long
bloody trail of the avocado Brigade
shortly after the fall of the Berlin
Wall
along with their housekeeper and her
daughter since the orders were to leave
no witnesses before we hear that these
are exceptions
we might recall a truism of Latin
American scholarship it was reiterated
by historian John cotesworth and the
recently published Cambridge University
history of the Cold War he writes from
1962 the Soviet collapse in 1990 the
numbers of political prisoners torture
victims and executions of nonviolent
political dissenters in Latin America
vastly exceeded those in the Soviet
Union and its East European satellites
among the executed were many religious
martyrs and there were mass slaughters
as well consistently supported or even
initiated by Washington and that eight
1960 is highly significant for reasons
we should all know I cannot go into them
here well in the West all of this is
disappeared to borrow the terminology of
our Latin American victims and
regrettably these are persistent
features of intellectual and moral
culture we can trace them back to the
earliest recorded history and I think
they richly underscore musti's
injunction if we ever hope to live up to
the high ideals that we passionately
proclaim and to bring the initial dream
of the United Nations closer to
fulfillment that we should think
explicitly and carefully about crucial
choices that have been made and continue
to be made every day not forgetting
quoting Musti again not forgetting the
violence on which the present system is
based and all the evil material and
spiritual this entails for the masses of
men throughout the world among these
masses are for example six million
children who die every year because of
lack of simple medical procedures that
the rich countries could make available
within statistical error in their
budgets and it includes a billion people
on the edge of starvation or worse but
not beyond reach by any means and we
should also not forget never
forget that our wealth derives in no
small measure from the tragedy of others
that's dramatically clear in the
Anglosphere so I live for example in a
comfortable suburb of Boston those who
once lived there or were victims of the
utter extirpation of all the Indians in
most populous parts of the Union by
means more destructive to the Indian
natives than the conduct of the
conquerors of Mexico and Peru that's the
verdict of the first secretary of war in
the newly liberated colonies and General
Henry Knox they suffered the fate of
that hapless race of Native Americans
which we are exterminating with such
mercial merciless and perfidious cruelty
among the heinous sins of this nation
for which I believe God will one day
bring it to judgment those are the words
of the great grand strategist
John Quincy Adams the intellectual
author of manifest destiny and the
Monroe Doctrine and that's long after
his own substantial contributions to
these heinous sins Australians should
have no trouble adding illustrations
well whatever the ultimate judgment of
God may be the judgment of man is far
from Adams as expectations mentioned a
few recent cases consider what I suppose
are the two most highly regarded
left-liberal
intellectual journals in the Anglosphere
the New York and London reviews of books
in the former a prominent commentator
recently reported what he had learned
from the work of Edmund Morgan heroic
historian Edmund Morgan as he described
it
what he learned was that when Columbus
and the other early explorers arrived
they found a coating him they found a
continental vastness sparsely populated
by farming and hunting people in the
limitless and unspoiled world stretching
from tropical jungle to the frozen north
there may have been scarcely more than a
million inhabitants calculation is off
by many tens of millions and the
vastness included advanced civilizations
that these are facts well known that to
those who choose to know decades ago no
letters appeared in response to this
truly colossal case of genocide denial
hard to match in the companion London
Journal a noted historian casually
mentioned what he called the
mistreatment of the Native Americans
again eliciting no comment we would
hardly accept the word mistreatment for
comparable or even much lesser crimes
that committed by enemies a recognition
of the heinous crimes from which we
benefit enormous Lee would be a good
start after centuries of neglect but we
can go on from there so one of the main
tribes where I live was at one point the
whompin AAG who still have a small
reservation not too far away their
language has long ago disappeared but in
a remarkable feat of scholarship and
dedication to elementary human rights
the language has been reconstructed from
missionary texts and comparative
evidence and it now has its first native
speaker in a hundred years
little daughter of Jenny little doe
who has become a fluent speaker of the
language herself as she's a former
graduate student at MIT she worked with
my late friend and colleague Kenneth
Hale and one of the most outstanding
linguists of the modern period among his
many accomplishments was his leading
role in founding the study of Aboriginal
languages of Australia he was also very
effective in the defense of rights of
indigenous people in Australia and
elsewhere and also a dedicated peace and
justice activist he was able to turn our
department at MIT into a Center for the
study of indigenous languages and also
active defense of indigenous rights in
the Americas and beyond well a revival
of the Wampanoag language has
revitalized the tribe a language is more
than just words and sounds
it's the repository of culture history
traditions the entire rich texture of
human life and society loss of a
language is a serious blow and not only
to the community itself but also to
everyone else who hopes to understand
something of the nature of human beings
their capacities their achievements and
of course it's a loss of particulars of
severity to those concerned with the
variety and uniformity of human
languages it's a core component of human
higher mental faculties similar
achievements can be carried forward that
would be a very partial but significant
gesture towards the repentance for
heinous sins on which our wealth and
power rests since we commemorate
anniversaries such as for example the
Japanese attacks seventy years ago there
are several
ones that fall right about now with
lessons that can serve for both
enlightenment and action I'll mention
just a few the West has just
commemorated the tenth anniversary of
the 9/11 terrorist attacks and what was
called at the time but no longer the
glorious invasion of Afghanistan that
followed assumed to be followed by the
even more glorious invasion of Iraq
partial closure for 9/11 was reached
with the assassination of the prime
suspect Osama bin Laden by US commandos
who invaded Pakistan apprehended him and
then murdered him
disposing of the corpse without autopsy
I said prime suspect that was recalling
the ancient long-abandoned doctrine of
presumption of innocence the current
issue of the major u.s. scholarly
journal of international relations
features several discussions of the
Nuremberg trials
of some of history's worst criminals we
read there that the u.s. decision to
prosecute rather than seek brutal
vengeance was a victory for the American
tradition of Rights and a particular
particularly American brand of legalism
punishment only for those who could be
proved to be guilty through a fair trial
with a panoply of procedural projections
the journal appeared right at the time
of the celebration of the abandonment of
this principle in a very dramatic way
while the global campaign of
assassination of suspects and the
inevitable the collateral damages it's
called that continues to be expanded to
much acclaim and not to be sure
universal acclaim
so Pakistan's leading daily recently
public
a study of the effect of drone attacks
and other u.s. terror it found that I'm
quoting at about eighty percent of
residents of the tribal regions was
Ariston have been affected mentally
while 60% of the people of Peshawar main
city there are nearing to become
psychological patients if these problems
are not addressed immediately and they
warned that the survival of our young
generation is at stake in part for these
reasons a hatred of America had already
risen to phenomenal heights in Pakistan
and after the bin Laden assassination
increased still more that one
consequence was firing across the border
at the bases of the u.s. occupying Army
in Afghanistan that provoked the sharp
condemnation of Pakistan for their
failure to cooperate in an American war
that Pakistanis overwhelmingly opposed
taking the same stand they did when
Pakistan when the Russians occupied
Afghanistan that stand was of course
then lauded now condemned the specialist
literature and even the US Embassy in
Islamabad the warned that pressures on
Pakistan to take part in the u.s.
invasion as well as u.s. attacks in
Pakistan I'm quoting partly from
WikiLeaks
are destabilizing and radicalizing
Pakistan risking a geopolitical
catastrophe for the United States and
the world which would dwarf anything
that could possibly occur in Afghanistan
last words are quoting the British
military Pakistan and
the military and Pakistan analysts
though the event the assassination of
bin Laden that greatly heightened that
risk in ways that remarkably were
ignored in the general enthusiasm for
assassination of suspects the u.s.
commandos were under orders to fight
their way out if necessary
if that had happened they surely would
have had air cover maybe more in which
case there might well have been a major
confrontation with the Pakistani army
now that's the only stable institution
in Pakistan it's deeply committed to
defending Pakistani sovereignty Pakistan
has a huge nuclear arsenal of the most
rapidly expanding in the world and the
whole system is laced with radical
Islamists these are products of the
us-saudi support for the worst of
Pakistan's dictators geohawk and his
programs of radical Islam is Asian this
program along with Pakistan's nuclear
weapons are among Ronald Reagan's
legacies Obama has now added the risk of
nuclear explosions and in London and New
York which could have happened if the
confrontation had led to the leakage of
nuclear materials to jihadis as was
plausibly feared by specialists it's one
of the many examples of the constant and
often growing threat of nuclear weapons
well the assassination of bin Laden had
a name the name was operation Geronimo
that caused an uproar in Mexico and it
was protested by the remnants of the
indigenous population in the United
States but elsewhere few seemed to
comprehend the significance of
defying bin Laden with the heroic Apache
Indian chief who led the resistance to
the invaders seeking to protect his
people from the fate of that hapless
race that John Quincy Adams eloquently
described the Imperial mentality is so
profound that such matters can cannot
even be perceived actually there were a
few criticisms of operation Toronto of
the name the manner of execution and the
implications these elicited the usual
furious condemnations mostly unworthy of
comment but some were instructive the
most interesting one was by the
respected left liberal commentator
matthew Yglesias he patiently explained
on quoting him that one of the main
functions of the international
institutional order is precisely to
legitimate the use of deadly military
force by Western powers so it is
amazingly naive to suggest that the
United States should obey international
law or other conditions that we impose
on the powerless but these words
incidentally are not criticism but
applause and it follows from then from
them that one can raise only tactical
objections if the United States invades
other countries murders and destroys
with abandon
assassinate suspects at will and
otherwise fulfills its obligations in
the service of mankind
and if the traditional victims see
matters somewhat differently that merely
reveals their moral and intellectual
backwardness and the occasional Western
critics who fail to comprehend these
fundamental truths can be dismissed as
silly the glacis explains
mr. deadly referring specifically to me
and then I cheerfully confess my guilt
well that's 2011 let's go back a decade
to 2001 from the first moment it was
clear that the glorious invasion of
Afghanistan was anything but that
it was undertaken with the clear
understanding that it might drive
several million Afghans over the edge of
starvation that's why the bombing was
bitterly condemned by the aid agencies
that were first forced to end the
operations on which five million Afghans
depended for survival after three years
of drought
fortunately the worst did not happen but
only the most morally obtuse can fail to
comprehend that actions are evaluated in
terms of likely consequences not actual
ones the in which were actual ones were
bad enough the invasion of Afghanistan
was not aimed at overthrowing the brutal
Taliban regime as was later claimed that
was an afterthought brought up three
weeks after the bombing began the
explicit reason for the bombing was that
the Taliban were unwilling to extradite
bin Laden without evidence
in which the u.s. refused to provide as
later learned because it had virtually
none and the facts in fact this still
very little evidence that could stand up
in an independent court of law although
his responsibility is hardly in doubt
the Taliban in fact did make some
gestures towards extradition and we have
since learned that there were other such
options but they were all dismissed
favor of violence which has since torn
the country to shreds it's reached its
highest level in a decade this year
according to the United Nations with no
diminution in sight a very serious
question rarely asked then our sins is
whether there was an alternative to
violence and there's strong evidence
that there was the 9/11 attack was
sharply condemned within the jihadi
movement and there were good
opportunities to split it and to isolate
al-qaeda instead of doing that
Washington and London chose to follow
the script that was provided by bin
Laden helping to establish his claim
that the West is attacking Islam and
thus in fact provoking new waves of
terror the senior CIA analyst who is
responsible for tracking Osama bin Laden
from 1996 and Michael Shire who warned
right away and has repeated since that
in his words the United States of
America remains bin Laden's only
indispensible Ally well these are among
the natural consequences of rejecting
musting Zwart musti's warning and the
main thrust of his revolutionary
pacifism which should direct us to
investigating the grievances that lead
the violence and when they are
legitimate as they often are to address
them and when that advice is taken it
can succeed very well Britain's recent
experiences in Northern Ireland there's
a good illustration for years the London
responded to IRA terror with greater
violence escalating the cycle which
reaches quite a bitter peak when they
finally began
instead to attend to the grievances
which were quite real violence subsided
that error has effectively disappeared I
was in Belfast in 1993 at that time it
was a war zone I returned a year ago to
a city that has tensions but hardly
beyond the norm well there's actually a
great deal more to say about what we
call 911 I should say that in Latin
America for good reasons it's called the
second 911 but I don't have time to go
into that but there's a lot to say about
911 and its consequences but I do not
want to end here without mentioning
several more anniversaries so right now
that happens to be the 50th anniversary
of President Kennedy's decision to
escalate the conflict in South Vietnam
from vicious repression that which had
already killed tens of thousands of
people
and finally elicited a reaction that the
client regime and Saigon could not
control 50 years ago Kennedy escalated
this to outright US invasion and bombing
by the US Air Force the use of napalm a
chemical warfare which soon included
crop destruction the deprive of the
resistance of food and programs to send
millions of South Vietnamese to virtual
concentration camps where they could be
as it was said protected from the
guerrillas who admittedly they were
supporting well there's no time to
review the grim aftermath there should
be no need to do so the war is left
three countries devastated with a toll
of many millions that's not including
the miserable victims of the enormous
chemical warfare assault includes
newborn infants today
since it was genetic modification by
these lethal agents there were as was
known at the time incidentally there
were a few at the margins who objected
they were wild men in the wings bar the
term of Kennedy Johnson National
Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy former
Harvard Dean and by the time that the
very survival of South Vietnam was in
doubt a popular protest had become quite
strong at the war's end in 1975 about
70% of the population regarded the war
as fundamentally wrong and immoral and
not a mistake those are figures that
were sustained as long as the question
was asked in polls for several years in
quite revealing contrast at the
dissident extreme of mainstream
commentary the war was a mistake nothing
more than that because our noble
objectives could not be achieved that a
tolerable cost it's worth noting that
gap another anniversary that should be
in our minds today is the anniversary of
the massacre and the Santa Cruz
graveyard in Dili just 20 years ago that
was the most publicized of the great
many shocking atrocities during the
Indonesian invasion occupation of East
Timor Australia had joined the United
States in granting formal recognition to
the Indonesian annexation after it's
virtually genocidal invasion the US
State Department explained to Congress
in 1982 that Washington recognized both
the Indonesian occupation and the Khmer
Rouge based democratic Kampuchea regime
the justice and justification offered
was that unquestionably the Khmer Rouge
were more representative of the
Cambodian people than Fretilin teamrees
resistance was of the tea Maurice people
because there had been this long
continuity in Cambodia since the very
beginning in 1975 when the Khmer Rouge
took power the media and commentators
have been polite enough to allow all of
this to the languish in silence not an
inconsiderable feat a few months before
the santa cruz massacre the Foreign
Minister Gareth Evans made his famous
statements dismissing concerns about the
murderers invasion and annexation on the
grounds that the world is a pretty
unfair place littered with examples of
acquisition of force so we can therefore
a look away as awesome crimes continue
with support by the Western powers
actually not quite look away because at
the same time
Evans was negotiating the robbery of
East Timor sole resource oil with his
comrade ally a lot US foreign minister
of Indonesia producing what seems the
seems to be the only official Western
document that recognises East Timor as
an Indonesian province years later
Evans declared that the notion we had
anything to answer for and morally or
otherwise over the way we handled the
Indonesia East Timor relationship I
absolutely reject it's a stance that can
be adopted even respected by those who
emerged victorious in the US and Britain
the question is not even asked in polite
society it's only fair to mention that
in sharp contrast much of the Australian
population and much of the media were in
the forefront of exposing and protesting
the crimes some of the worst of the past
half century and in 1999 when the crimes
were escalating once again they had a
significant role in pressuring US
President Clinton to inform the
Indonesian generals in September 1999
that the game was over at which point
they immediately withdrew allowing an
Australian led peacekeeping force to
enter well there are lessons here too
for the public that Clinton's orders
could have been delivered at any time in
the preceding 25 years in terminating
the crimes actually Clinton himself
could have delivered those orders four
years earlier in October 2005 when
General Suharto
was welcomed in Washington as our kind
of guy in the words of the Clinton
administration and the same orders could
have been given 20 years earlier that
when Henry Kissinger gave the green
light to the Indonesian invasion and UN
Ambassador Daniel Patrick Moynihan
expressed his pride in having rendered
the United Nations utterly ineffective
in any measures to deter the Indonesian
invasion he was later to be revered for
his courageous defence of international
law there could hardly be a more painful
illustration of the consequences of the
failure to attend to must ease lesson
and it should be added that in a
shameful display of subordination to
power some respected Western
intellectuals have actually sunk to the
level of describing this disgraceful
record as a stellar illustration of the
humanitarian norm
of right to protect consistent with
musti's revolutionary pacifism the
Sydney Peace Foundation has always
emphasized peace with justice as Stuart
mentioned before the demands of justice
can remain unfulfilled the long after
peace has been declared and the Santa
Cruz massacre 20 years ago can service
and illustration but one year after the
massacre the United Nations adopted the
Declaration on the protection of all
persons from enforced disappearance the
declaration states that acts
constituting enforced disappearance
shall be considered a continuing offense
as long as the perpetrators continue to
conceal the fate and the whereabouts of
persons who have disappeared and the
facts remain unclarified the massacre is
therefore a continuing offense the fate
of the disappeared is unknown and the
offenders have not been brought to
justice including those who continue to
conceal the crimes of complicity and
participation or which is only one
indication of how far we must go to rise
to some respectable level of civilized
behavior thank you
this is big ideas from the ABC
