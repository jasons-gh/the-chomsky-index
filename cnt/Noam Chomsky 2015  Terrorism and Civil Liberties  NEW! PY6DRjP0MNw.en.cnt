as your heart Senna is on trial for the
bombing of the Boston Marathon Europe
shakes from assassination of magazine
journalists in Paris and other incidents
across the continent governments
everywhere in the amid loose talk of
fundamental values patriotic slogans
such as Boston strong paper over anxiety
as everyone now prepares for further
massacres and retribution welcome to the
New World Order ought to be the slogan
of Boston's bid for the 2024 Olympics
instead of whatever it is now my name is
John summers and on behalf of the back
row magazine I'd like to welcome you to
this neighborhood forum on the war on
terror and the rule of law we present
Noam Chomsky 9/11 and many other books
on politics and international affairs
and cade rockville rockford director of
the ACLU of Massachusetts is technology
for liberty project we meet tonight of
course in the heart of Inman Square the
same neighborhood where the alleged
perpetrators of the Marathon bombing
live worked shopped and worshiped among
us take a left out of the lily pad and
walk up a few blocks and remember on
Norfolk Street you'll find the apartment
where the brothers lived walk a few more
blocks of Norfolk Street and you'll find
the bath wares office by myself live
right around the corner the point is
that even for those of us who are not
affected directly by the violence this
is a hard case not to take personally so
we wanted a community forum that would
run in parallel to the first part of the
judicial proceedings the most important
domestic terrorism trial since Timothy
McVeigh was tried for the Oklahoma City
bombings in 1995 because we felt at near
total absence of discussion about the
ongoing damage done to our legal
political and civil institutions as the
trial begins there is a sense in which
we are once again being asked to shelter
in place to stop asking uncomfortable
questions so we're here tonight among
other
to define any such expectation to air
alternative views of the new term in the
war on terror and to imagine what we can
do to prevent the war technique in its
numerous permutations from becoming a
permanent part of our civil life from
the neighbourhood on up
k2 croc they will speak first after
which you know Chomsky will speak at
that point I'll come back to the podium
and we'll take questions and open
everything up for Q&A thank you very
much for coming thanks John can you hear
me
excellent so thanks for coming out
tonight thanks the Baffler for putting
us on we they're definitely a host of
troubling questions raised by the trial
itself as well as the circumstances
surrounding the tsarnaev brothers and
the case against Johar we can start with
the trial there first of all the child
should not be held in the city of Boston
the McVeigh case is a good example of a
counterpoint that trial was not held in
Oklahoma for a very good reason because
the judge agreed with the defense that
the population in Oklahoma in Oklahoma
City could not basically put forth an
impartial jury to look at the facts
without bias in that case and clearly as
we've seen over the past week or so here
in Boston
judge O'Toole's decision to reject
numerous defense motions to move this
trial out of Boston was the wrong
decision the WHA dear process has done
badly
thus far every day we hear on the radio
and read in the press stories about
people who are asked questions by the
prosecution and the defense and answer
things like you know X person in my
family was directly related to the
bombing in Y way or you know I work for
the company
that sponsored the Boston Marathon or I
lived down the street from Richard
Donahue the little boy who lost his life
that day and I cry about it every single
day it's very difficult to imagine
particularly given that the Department
of Justice has already said in motions
to the court that it intends to present
an argument that not only the entire
city of Boston was victimized by this
attack but that the entire state of
Massachusetts was traumatized and
victimized they then want to turn around
and say that it's possible to field an
impartial jury well we've seen that that
is going to be difficult if not
impossible so there's the what dear
issue another really important thing
that people need to realize about this
trial is that it's a death penalty trial
as you know but what a lot of people
don't know about death penalty trials is
that they're more likely to convict
they're more likely to be composed of
people with right-wing politics white
people men women people of color and
people with left-wing politics you know
are more likely to oppose the death
penalty and if you oppose the death
penalty you cannot sit on this trial so
right off the bat we have a major
problem
US Attorney Carmen Ortiz widely despised
both by the computer privacy and
security community as a result of her
persecution of Aaron Swartz and the
Muslim community as a result of her
persecution of Tarek mahana a pharmacist
from Massachusetts a few years back on
dubious material support for terrorism
charges has you know plowed ahead said
no we should hold the trial in Boston
has said you know we should go for the
death penalty although that was
ultimately a decision made by Eric
Holder and I find it confounding not
just because it is going to ensure that
this trial drags on for decades and
costs taxpayers millions and millions of
dollars through appeal after appeal but
also because the death penalty is
illegal in Massachusetts the voters
I've said multiple times that we opposed
execution by the government as a form of
punishment in fact the Boston Globe did
a study a few I think I believe last
year and they found that even Boston
residents opposed execution for Johar
tsarnaev himself
so this flouts the will of the public
and because of the tendency for death
penalty juries to convict the propensity
for them to convict it also I think
threatens Johar's fifth Amendment right
to a due to due process so those are
just a couple of the issues there are
lots more 60% of the motions in this
trial are sealed so the public doesn't
know what's going on the vast majority
of the time in this case there are
allegations from the defense that it's
been very difficult for them to find
witnesses who will testify on behalf of
Dzhokhar tsarnaev in part because of FBI
intimidation that's not terribly
surprising given what happened to
Ibrahim todashev a former friend of
Tamerlan tsarnaev who was gunned down by
an FBI agent from the Boston office in
his Orlando apartment about three weeks
or a month after the Boston Marathon
bombings that incident raises a whole
host of questions related to a triple
murder that took place in Waltham in
2011 on the 10th anniversary of the 9/11
attacks believe it or not at the time
the DA district attorney Jerry Leone
told the public that his office believed
that it was likely two assailants who
broke into a sari were let into a home
known to the victims and killed those
three people Brendan mess Eric Wiseman
among them brendan mess reportedly one
of Tamerlan tsarnaev's best friends we
hear a month after the Marathon bombing
that Ibrahim todashev was penning a
confession to those murders when
he flipped out through a table first we
heard it was a broomstick then an you
know a knife then something else attacks
the FBI agent in the midst of writing
this confession implicating himself and
Tamerlan tsarnaev and those murders and
he's killed he's gunned down by the FBI
well subsequently as journalist Susan
sulk and his doom documented both for
this American life in Boston magazine
the FBI proceeded to harass intimidate
deport basically everybody who knew
Ibrahim todashev so some sort of bizarre
cleanup operation taking place in
Florida again we're told at that time
that the government has evidence through
a leak to Michele McPhee and ABC News
that Tamerlan tsarnaev did kill those
three people in Waltham the Press
reports that the government has forensic
evidence and cell phone location records
curious to know where those records were
for two years when those murders were
unsolved a week after the bombing
suddenly the government has FBI has
evidence pointing to Tim Allen's
involvement but the case was cold for 18
months before that sort of bizarre even
more strange still is that just this
past I believe maybe a couple months ago
I'm not sure exactly when it was Johar's
lawyers submitted a request asking for
the prosecution to give them information
about Tamerlan of involvement in those
murders and the DOJ came back with
something that I found to be really
shocking they said we have no evidence
of Tamerlan tsarnaev's involvement in
the in the triple murders and Waffen in
2011 so we came to the press in May 2013
that Tamerlan killed those three people
and then telling a court in 2014 that
they had no evidence that he was
involved in those murders this is a
pattern that the
government is engaged in not just
related to the CERN I had a child saying
something in public usually through
anonymous leaks through reporters and
then saying something entirely different
in in court it's happened with the CIA
drone operations the you know John
Brennan goes before cameras and says we
are engaged in righteous and you know
precision strikes against terrorists and
then in court when the CIA on the FM
when the ACLU asks for the drone memos
the CIA says we can either conform
confirm nor deny are involved in those
programs well we've seen something
similar happening in this case so again
the week's initially that Tamerlan was
involved in the welfare murders just
weeks after the Marathon bombings a year
later Carmen Ortiz his office saying in
court that they have no evidence of his
involvement and another strange thing
this I think the most disturbing
question that I haven't seen nearly
enough exploration of in the press just
days after the Marathon bombings in May
of 2013 we read in CNN that through
again anonymous law enforcement leaks
that the government has found forensic
evidence that the bombs that exploded at
the marathon were built in Terrell Owens
apartment just down the road they said
we found explosives residue all over the
place in the kitchen in the bathroom you
can look it up the story is still on
cnn.com well a year later in May 2014
Carmen Ortiz's office files a brief in
court in US v tsarnaev that says the
exact opposite it says we actually
didn't find much of any evidence in
tamarins house and we don't know who
built the bombs well that's quite an
admission and it's not the only time
that the government has said that in
court in the Rebell philipose trial not
sure if you remember him he's the young
man who was a friend of Jars who was
yoked up on false statements charges by
the FBI had no involvement in the crime
was prosecuted for essentially lying to
federal agents is going to spend prison
time in prison as a result of that
during his trial and FBI agents
in public again in front of reporters
one of whom tweeted this that the FBI
does not know who built the bombs that
blew up at the Boston Marathon so here
we have Dzhokhar tsarnaev 21 year old
kid bearing the full weight of the
government's prosecution of this
terrorist crime and the government is at
the same time admitting that it doesn't
know who built the bombs that exploded
at the marathon I find that to be
alarming particularly given the
government's omnipotence surveillance
state that it directs that all of us so
Edward Snowden in the wake of the of the
bombings in 2013 said the reason why the
NSA and the FBI didn't catch this guy is
because they were spying on you instead
there's a lot of truth to that
it sounds flippant but I read in The New
Yorker this week a piece called the hole
haystack I encourage you to look it up
and in that piece it opens with a really
alarming statement that I also believe
is true it says the vast majority if not
all of the major terrorist attacks that
have occurred on Western soil since 9/11
have been perpetrated by people who were
known to law enforcement this is not you
know and the same is true with Tamerlan
the same is true with Tamerlan he was
investigated by the FBI they admit for
months at least
you know his defense team says that the
FBI asked him to become an informant for
the government a claim that Senator
Chuck Grassley asked FBI director James
Comey about in a in an October 2013
letter that he got a not sufficient and
insufficient response to in my view but
the fact remains that the majority of
not all of the major terrorist attacks
that have occurred in the United States
and in Europe since 9/11 have been
perpetrated by people who had been
investigated at some point by law
enforcement so the notion that the
government should be recording details
of every phone call we make which is
what they do
sucking up vast quantities of our
private communications through
surveillance programs conducted by the
NSA as well as other government agencies
which they do in order to
stop terrorism is clearly bogus these
dragnet surveillance programs do not
have any more any effective impact on
stopping terrorism
you know surveillance of this sort as
Snowden has said and other dissidents
have said repeatedly over time not just
in the digital age but since the Stasi
surveillance of this sort exists for
political social and economic control
for purposes of control not for public
safety and I don't think that we could
have a clearer example here in Boston
than the Boston Marathon
I actually don't have anything to add
about the terrorist acts in Boston and
how they're being handled so what I'd
like to try to do instead is to bring up
some more general reflections and
concerns about the issues of terrorism
what they raise and what we can do about
it let me begin with something that may
seem pretty for our field a film review
in The New York Times a couple days ago
it begins of quoted by ridiculing
America's coastal intelligentsia which
busied itself with chatter over little
scene art dramas well everyday Americans
showed up on mass for a patriotic
pro-family picture of which broke all
attendance records in its opening days
at the end of this quite low to
Authority review the reviewer mentions
that there was another film that opened
same time but with quite
attendance Selma which was time for
release with Martin Luther King Day well
what was the patriotic pro-family film
that so entranced everyday Americans
it's about the most deadly sniper in
American history
Guinan Chris Kyle who claims to have
used his skills to have killed several
hundred people in Iraq and he wrote
memoirs and in the memoirs he describes
what the experience was like
so I'll quote mV his first kill he said
it was a woman who walked into a street
with a grenade in her and as the Marines
attacked her village hey Chris Kyle
killed her with a single shot and
explains how he felt about it I hated
the damn savages I've been fighting
savage despicable evil that's what we
were fighting in Iraq that's why a lot
of people myself included called the
enemy savages that was really no other
way to describe what we encountered
there the film got a lot of the reviews
I haven't seen the film incidentally but
I read reviews of it so they varied the
New Yorker thought it was great they
kept the cinematic values well done you
know nice photographs and so on there
were others who found it appalling one
of them was Jeff Stein
he's a former US intelligence officer
worked in in Vietnam and he wrote a very
critical review keeping to the content
and he also recalled the visit that he
made he was invited visit to a cliff at
a Marine base to a clubhouse for snipers
and quote him the barroom walls
featured white on black Nazi SS insignia
and other of their mock photos and
regalia the Marine shooters clearly
identified with the mark
specimen of the world's most infamous
killing machine rather than with regular
troops well going back to Chris Kyle he
regarded his first kill as a terrorist
this woman who walked in the street with
the grenade when the Marines were
attacking her village but we can't
really attribute that to the mentality
of a psychopathic killer because we're
all tarred with the same brush at least
insofar as we tolerate or keep silent
about official policy so take for
example the case of Omar Khadr Omar
Khadr is the first it's the first case
that was brought to trial what's called
a trial a military trial in Guantanamo
first case under Obama he went on among
prisoner he was he's 15 it was he was
apprehended my name is 15 year old child
he was in a residential complex which
was attacked by special special ops
Delta Force their slogan is F 3 F find
fix and finish they shot and wounded him
badly he's blinded they didn't finish
him they have a discussion about whether
to finish him off but they decided
instead to send them the Bagram Air Base
which is it's not inspected by anyone
it's off-limits but from the reports of
prisoners it's the worst of the CIA
torture chambers probably much worse
even than Guantanamo no inspection he
was there for a couple of years then it
was sent off to with wanton amo'
altogether he spent eight years in
detention torture and so on with you're
familiar with after eight years he was
granted a trial military trial he his
lawyers were told that he had two
options the one was to plead guilty of
the charge
charge was like the woman in the village
he's alleged to have thrown a grenade
when Delta Force attacked is residential
conflict he had it he could plead guilty
they said in which case he would have
eight more years of imprisonment or he
could be plead innocent and which he'd
be in there forever
so his lawyers advised him to plead
guilty which he did he's a Canadian
citizen and at that point Canada finally
intervened and said they would agree to
take this deadly terrorist
fifteen-year-old kid back to kind of a
serve the rest of the center there
well that's he's that's what we call a
terrorist just like Chris Kyle called
the woman in the village a terrorist and
that mentality is very little commentary
about this sensitively except for
Amnesty International and ACLU and so on
the mentality helps explain why it's so
easy to ignore what is clearly the most
extreme a terrorist campaign of modern
history if not ever Obama's global
assassination campaign of the drone
campaign which officially is aimed at
murdering people who are suspected of
maybe someday planning to harm us if
that's what they're suspected of doing
in the morning sessions with Brennan and
so on then we blow them away and I'd
really advise you to read some of the
transcripts of the drone operators their
hair-raising the guys who are sitting in
front of computers you know in Las Vegas
or somewhere I can't I can't repeat it
Obama you may recall when he won the
Nobel Prize
make no mistake evil does exist in the
world and then he's right
you know there's exactly where to find
it
there are lots of other examples that
are quite pertinent today so in the
context of relaxing or what's called re
normalizing relations with Cuba which
means relaxing our relentless attack on
Cuba for half a century
one thing that's ignored is a massive
terrorist campaign that John F Kennedy
lost against Cuba it almost brought the
world to a terminal nuclear war Cuban
Missile Crisis and after that it was
immediately relaunched this is ignored
dismiss defined almost no reference to
it except for some witticisms about
silly CIA plots so that didn't work that
try to you know poison Castro or
something like that which did take place
but that's the least of it and the same
is true of numerous other atrocities and
by our side in the right after the
latest famous terrorist atrocity the
Charlie Hebdo the the leading of the
head of the Israeli Labour Party Isaac
Herzog meets the prime opponent of
Netanyahu and the upcoming election and
was quoted as saying terrorism is
terrorism there are no two ways about it
that's quite wrong there are two ways
about it and we know about it very well
we look quite differently at the retail
terrorism that's done by them against us
as compared with the wholesale terrorism
that we carry out of us against them
which doesn't count
that's that this observation is one of
the most richly documented and
well-established results in the
large-scale study of terrorism and the
past 30 years ever since Ronald Reagan
declared war on terror as he came into
office
well this usual incidentally it's hardly
a new observation so the George Orwell
defined what he called the National List
he said the Nationalists not only does
not disapprove of atrocities committed
by his own side but he has a remarkable
capacity for not even hearing about them
and Orwell didn't go far enough he also
has we have also have a remarkable
capacity for denying them or even
loading this case after case and this
usual pattern was followed after the
latest atrocity in Paris the the crime
was vividly reported by the veteran
Europe correspondent of the New York
Times
even airliner he described the aftermath
is a day of sirens helicopters in the
air
frantic news bulletins police cordons
anxious crowds young children led away
from schools to safety it was a day like
the previous two of blood and horror in
and around Paris and airliner also
quoted as of surviving journalists who
said everything crashed there was no way
out that was smoke everywhere it was
terrible people were screaming it was
like a nightmare there was a huge
detonation and everything went dark
there linger comments it was at
increasingly the scene was an
increasingly familiar one of smashed
glass broken walls twisted timbers
scorched paint and emotional devastation
as some of you may recognize I'm
cheating that was not his report after
the Paris Charlie Hebdo bombing rather
this was April 24th 1999 didn't make it
to the front page it was buried an
inside page wasn't terribly important it
was the US missile attack on Serbian
state
vision headquarters not the radio
television station off the air
they killed 16 journalists several more
than Charlie Hebdo and Erlanger reports
that American officials defended the
attack as an attempt to undermine his
words an effort to undermine the
government that the u.s. was attacking
and therefore the radio television
station was a legitimate target Richard
Holbrooke distinguished diplomat he was
then the Envoy to Yugoslavia he
described the successful attack as an
enormous ly important and I think
positive development is echoed by many
others but it wasn't international still
is International Tribunal for the
criminal tribunal for Yugoslavia they
were asked by some Canadian lawyers to
look into the NATO attack and they
concluded that it was not a crime but
they did say with them that civilian
casualties were unfortunately high but
they do not appear to be clearly
disproportionate that's in contrast to
Charlie Hebdo where obviously it was
they were very much proportion I don't
know proportionate to what but that's
the food well let's go back to Chris
Kyle some of his exploits were in
Fallujah during the marine attack on
Fallujah in November 2004 one of the
worst war crimes of the invasion itself
the worst war crime of the millennium
here it's regarded as a example of
marvelous heroism of our soldiers and
liberating Iraq if you go back to the
reporting of the Fallujah attack it's
extremely interesting I happened to be
in New York when it took place I had
some talks I stopped all the talks and
each day just talked about the front
page of the New York Times the first day
of the attack the front page of the New
York Times had a big picture right in
the front
of the hospital the Marines had attacked
a hospital which of course a war crime
they had thrown what the picture showed
the photograph showed is that they had
thrown the patients out of their beds
and onto the floor tied their hands
behind their backs had done the same
with doctors there were some questions
about it that reporters asked you know
why attacked the hospital when they were
told that the hospital was a legitimate
target the reason was that it was
producing propaganda for the rebels
namely casualty figures so therefore it
was entirely legitimate to destroy this
to prevent this propaganda agency from
continuing to spew forth its violent
materials they're really easy to
continue I won't go on but you should be
able to add many more examples one of
the more interesting comments on Charlie
the how Charlie Hebdo crime was by a
noted civil light rights lawyer are
noted for his vigorous defense of
freedom of expression Floyd Floyd Abrams
he sharply condemned the editors of the
New York Times because they didn't
publish the Charlie Hebdo cartoons
ridiculing Mohammed that elicited the
terrorist assault and that he said if
they had done so it would have properly
served the cause of free expression in
the immediate wake of the most
threatening assault on journalism in
living memory he's actually right the
Charlie Hebdo attack was the most
threatening assault on journalism in
living memory that's actually a comment
on living memory and I'm not
living memory is a category that is very
carefully crafted that we craft very
carefully to include their crimes
against us and to exclude scrupulously
our crimes against them comparable
crimes often worst crimes these are not
crimes they are noble defense of the
highest values maybe sometimes they are
inadvertently flawed life and
unfortunately civilian casualties were
high but not disproportionate well oh
this is a special case of a much more
general doctrine which is observed with
really impressive
dedication and consistency namely the
more we can blame some crime on some
enemy the greater the average the more
we are responsible for it and therefore
incidentally can do something about it
to end it the less the concern sometimes
tending to oblivion or even denial
well these questions and these
considerations directly inform the
question of what we can do about
terrorism it's serious it's a serious
problem what can we do about it well one
easy suggestion comes to mind at once
but we can stop participating in it we
can stop carrying out large-scale
terrorist atrocities now that would
sharply reduce the amount of terrorism
in the world more than anything else I
can think of and incidentally by doing
so we would also reduce that small
component of terrorism that makes its
way into living memory namely what they
do to us it's will
my question will leave them that the
drone attacks are a very effective
terrorist generating mechanism that's
been demonstrated over and over and in
fact if you take a look at the reports
of offensive discussions of the
terrorists and the Charlie Hebdo case
they made it very clear that what
incited them to jihadism were things
like of a brave the US war an attack on
Iraq and other events the humiliation of
Muslims and violence against them not to
speak of the conditions and the long
view of the suburbs of Paris where
they're subject to contempt and harsh
repression in the lives that they while
they try to survive if you go to the
Senate reports on terror on torture they
were quite interesting to read that they
dealt with a single question
did it work the question is can you
achieve results by torturing people and
they concluded that you couldn't achieve
results so therefore the liberal
commentary on the torture is it wasn't
worth it that's the limit of the
official discussion but there's pretty
good evidence that that's irrelevant
because the evidence is pretty strong
that getting results was not the purpose
of the torture the this Cheney Rumsfeld
torture machine was initially designed
for quite a different purpose pretty
explicitly the purpose was to try to
elicit some information true or false
didn't matter that's why it doesn't
matter if you get false information or
some information that would tie Saddam
Hussein to al-qaeda which is a crazy
idea but that's what they needed in
order to justify the attack on Iraq that
was planned that was the initial purpose
of the torture but it actually gets
worse
the torture from quote now was a lab I'm
quoting from a very well-documented
study and the Seton Hall Law Journal
just came out a study on what's called
what the government called the battle
lab they were seeking the battle lab was
seeking to obtain information on the
most effective ways to torture a human
physically information on the most
damaging ways to break a man
psychologically an insight as to just
how far the human body could be pushed
in pain and terror before organ failure
or death that's the battle lab and that
was a large component of the torture
they have to be talk about what donna
moe other places are worse I will you
can make what you like about that but
that's us not somebody else similar
questions were eyes about this vast
surveillance system which as you know
detected essentially nothing if the goal
were to protect Americans there are much
more effective modes of surveillance
that could easily be designed for
example every home that could have
detectors in every room picking up
everything that's going on linked to the
local police station in hospital that
would prevent many more deaths that have
ever referred from terrorism
I mean deaths from accidents in home and
domestic abuse are far greater than the
deaths from terrorism so that's a pretty
simple way to protect Americans by
surveillance if that's your interest but
the ugly truth of the matter is that
security of the population is simply not
a high priority for states that's a
matter of very great importance one that
there's no time to explore here but I
think it lies behind a lot of what we
are discussing
so yeah just a few things came to mind
while I was listening to talk them one
is that I didn't get into as
specifically as I wanted to the question
about whether or not if Tamerlan
tsarnaev did kill those three people in
Waltham the Marathon bombings would have
happened had he been apprehended before
April 2013 it's an important question
because it gets to an issue that affects
the rest of us as the forum here
advertises the question of dragnet
surveillance as Noam has identified
dragnet surveillance clearly doesn't
protect public safety there is something
that protects public safety which is
individualized suspicion of wrongdoing
so if it's actually true that the
government had evidence way back when in
2011 that Tamerlan tsarnaev killed those
three people as they leaked to the press
that they did after the Marathon
bombings and he had been investigated
for that specific crime given that there
was specific evidence of wrongdoing
against him it would have prevented the
bombings he would have been in prison
having been convicted of killing three
people it's a really perfect very
condensed and local locally relevant
example of why individualized suspicion
is actually a much better public safety
policy than then dragnet surveillance
another thing that is so interesting
about the Paris attacks specifically is
that in the wake of the shootings
al-qaeda took responsibility for at
least you know training some of the
people who were involved if not
financing the operation we don't know if
it's true that they did that but they
took responsibility they told Jeremy
Scahill of the intercept that they were
responsible and they also said something
really interesting
they said I'm paraphrasing why is it
okay for you to kill our propagandists
and we can't kill yours now you'll
recall that the United States government
announced to the world that it intended
to kill Anwar al-awlaki a US citizen
with a drone before they did it the ACLU
working with a lakis father sued and
said hold on you can't kill US citizen
without due process this is absurd all
those lawsuits failed and he was killed
eventually the US government killed him
with a drone a US citizen they alleged
that he was operational there's no
evidence of this at all he was a
propagandist there's plenty of evidence
that he was a propagandist they hated
him because he spoke in English and he
spoke very eloquently denouncing the
United States government they murdered
him they murdered him they murdered
Samir Khan who was another US citizen
who edited the magazine inspire which
you might have heard about al-qaeda's
english-language propaganda outlet so
it's a question that is uncomfortable I
think for the United States government
and for the West's more generally why is
it okay to kill their propagandists and
it's not okay to kill ours
of course I don't agree with killing any
propagandists but and then on the
question of the actual public safety
threat that terrorism poses there was a
study done a few years back that showed
that you're more likely to be killed by
your furniture in the United States than
you are by a terrorist so literally your
television is more likely to fall on
your head and kill you then you are
likely to be killed by someone who has
you know political motives so just
consider that every time you hear the
FBI and the NSA say that they need some
new power or technology or an even
looking local police now to invade your
rights to protect you are they going to
do it to protect you from you telling
your television
it's really the question you should be
asking there aren't quite a lot of
interesting cases of that we've just
routinely the u.s. goes after what it
calls propaganda agencies and destroys
them I mentioned a couple of but some I
saw firsthand I happened to be by
accident in Islamabad right at the time
when the US forces invaded Afghanistan
and of course all the journalists in the
world flock to Islamabad because that
was the way to get into Afghanistan and
if you've ever been in a place where a
lot of journalists flock together you'll
know how it works there's a couple of
hotels they hang around the hotel bars
and they have fun have drinks and talk
to each other and so on and the big joke
among the journalists and the song about
Hotel var was about the u.s. the bombing
of the Al Jazeera television radio
outlet in Kabul it had been attacked and
destroyed by US missiles and the
official story which incidentally all
the journalists reported was that it was
an accident we're aiming at something
else everyone in the bar was laughing
about how ridiculous this is of course
they targeted the Al Jazeera office and
destroyed it but it's not the kind of
thing you report that's routine right
and the u.s. killed al Jazeera
journalists in Iraq as well
we don't have a wireless mic so I read a
very interesting report where they said
that in France pollster Charlie Hebdo
attack that the Muslim population of
France is about 7.5 percent or something
like that but then the incarceration
rate and the number of prisoners is like
70% of all prison inmates in France are
Muslims from mostly Middle East or North
African nations you kind of see some
sort of a trend here - in the US with
mostly people of color and I think
mostly black people and all that stuff
so what are the implications if we
continue doing this and and you already
see that the prisons are the hotbed for
whatever they term as domestic terrorism
within France and there are
radicalization of those populations so
what what are the implications for a
country like the US which is
disproportionately imprisoning people of
color and immigrants well I think the
implications are pretty clear it's
pretty much like defense against
terrorism or surveillance if the purpose
of the so-called criminal justice system
was to protect people prevent crime and
so on you wouldn't have these results so
that tells you the purpose of something
else what's the purpose just look at the
results in the in France it's a part of
the raging Islamophobia which is all
over Europe incidentally my own feeling
is that Europe's
more racist than the United States and
one consequences way to describe if you
go out I've visited the won't you you
know these suburbs of Paris where the
north it was mostly North Africans and
the conditions are pretty awful I've
seen worse poverty but they're pretty
bad but the worst thing the thing that
people complain about is the utter
contempt that has felt towards them
by those rich guys in Paris on our way
and the way they're treated if they dare
to get into Paris this is you know you
have to live with this constant assault
on your dignity your personal rights
there's plenty of violence and
repression to unemployment no hope that
imprisonment will have that out of that
comes crime what we call crime but it
has roots same in the here I remember
the exact figures you probably know them
but the highly disproportionate number
of black males in prison and not because
they're genetically different there's a
history of 400 years since the first
slaves came which has a very strong
resident the current recent imprisonment
the explosion since Reagan is because of
a very clearly racist drug war
designed on racist grounds from police
action all the way through up to
sentencing and even post at the post
release treatment and the result prisons
are full of black it's a happens to be a
repetition of what happened after the
Civil War
go back to the Civil War there were ten
years roughly in which blacks had a
moderate possible access to being part
of the world after that there was a
north-south comfort a compact which
essentially told the slave states they
could do whatever they like so what they
did was criminalize black life pretty
soon the black male population was back
in jail a large part of a labor force
for the Industrial Revolution of late
19th early 20th century now we're doing
it again that's been going on for 400
years no Kate I noticed you tweeted
something earlier this morning about how
I believe it was the judge said that the
presumption of innocence is
kind of just like a bond mo and not
something to be really taken service
yeah term of art I was just wondering if
talking about the possibility or not
possibility of moving the trial out of
Massachusetts do you even think it's
possible in a sense to compose an
impartial jury especially considering
stuff like that and the fact that if you
admit in the jury selection process that
you would ever doubt the word of a
police officer they just kind of reject
you off the bat do you think there's any
hope for the jury at all yeah I mean the
second question points to a larger
problem in the criminal punishment
system right that's not just about this
trial you're right if you say you don't
like cops or you distrust cops you will
never serve on any jury in this country
but certainly yeah I mean I like I said
earlier I don't think that there's that
an impartial jury will be fielded in
this case even if the juries is
impartial by O'Toole standards or even
by the standards of the defense I don't
think that it's possible for there to be
an impartial jury given that this is a
death penalty case as I said before you
cannot serve on the jury unless you
support execution as a political matter
so in a discussion today I think we've
highlighted that there's mass deceit on
part of the government on the American
people and it's largely executed by the
media which is largely controlled by you
know private entities that are also
entangled within the government and it's
highlighting a huge problem that we're
facing as a country where we're going
closer and closer to this police state
Orwellian type way of living so what can
we do now and where do you see that we
can go to take take a step back and kind
of awaken the people in the country that
are passively allowing this to continue
and allow you know this country be great
once again I have an answer for that
first of all you should support the you
know budding black revolutionary
movement
happening right now sometimes known as
the black lives matter movement as Noam
said black people in this country are by
far the most oppressed by the police and
the court system the legal system so
following the lead of black activists I
think in that regard is quite important
but beyond that as far as the police
stay the surveillance state is concerned
and I don't think that those terms are
hyperbolic actually as I said before the
government has kept records of every
phone call you've made over the past
eight or ten years and every call you'll
make tomorrow and the week after that as
well as many many other forms of
electronic surveillance that happen all
the times all of us not people who are
suspected of specific crimes on those
issues I really strongly suggest that
you go to your City Council and try to
deal with this issue at the local level
because Congress is not the place for it
my view we've seen that the intelligence
committees are completely captured by
the intelligence agencies as Noam said
even the one decent report that we got
out of the Senate Intelligence Committee
recently focused mainly on the question
of whether or not torture is effective
not whether it's illegal and immoral
which it is and so you know even in the
wake of the Snowden revelations we've
seen very very little movement in
Congress on even the most milk
milquetoast reforms to those
surveillance programs there's a there's
going to be an opportunity coming up
because the Patriot Act is going to
sunset so Congress will actually have to
affirmatively pass surveillance law and
so I think that's one possible place
where we might be able to apply some
some pressure but it's really very
difficult the Intelligence Agency is
so-called have you know a lot of power
in Washington and I don't think that
that power will be easily dislodged at
the
state and local level however we do have
a much better chance and one of the
largest problems that I've seen over the
past decade plus is that this huge flood
of money from the federal government
from the Department of Homeland Security
the Department of Justice down to the
state and local level to you know
essentially nationally securitized local
police is threatening our rights in a
very significant way unfortunately most
of what they're doing is behind closed
doors the FBI has been forcing local
police departments to sign
non-disclosure agreements to promise not
to talk about specific surveillance
technologies if asked by the public or
reporters this is just one among
countless examples of ways in which the
national security state is trickling
down to the state and local level so I
think we do actually have power at the
state and local level to push back and I
can talk to you more about that after if
you're interested probably clarified I'm
curious no me if you would mind giving
me your feedback on the question thank
you think of that film that I mentioned
that not enough people are going to see
Selma and what's it about it's about the
one of the later state steps and a
creation of a huge mass popular movement
which compelled a very reluctant
government to pass some limited rights
that should have been available
centuries earlier but they did pass them
other were plenty that they were if you
would ask to say in 1960 what can you do
about these things the answer would have
been nothing and look possible but a
couple of people did try to do things a
couple of black students sat in at a
lunch counter and Greensboro North
Carolina immediately arrested of course
could have ended
except that a couple more came back the
next day pretty soon you had snake
foreign student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee Freedom Riders going through
the South facing extreme violence and
far worse than anything we can think of
today in the country killing murder you
know all kinds of attacks but they kept
coming and the greatest courage was the
black rural people who were willing to
dare to get the register to vote finally
you've got things like Selma which was
brutal and vicious but it did get
national attention enough so that it was
possible to create large-scale public
pressure that led to Congress and the
President to put through some act as
some legislative measures that did
improve things things are much better
than they were in many respects so right
now the surveillance is really awful
stuff undoubtedly but compare it to what
was going on in the 1960s and early 70s
COINTELPRO nobody talks about that very
much but that was a program run by the
National political police the FBI under
four administrations started under
Eisenhower took off under Kennedy and
Johnson continued into Nixon this was a
program which started off as always with
the Communist Party but then expanded to
just about everything the women's
movement the new love with black
movements was a main target and it
wasn't just surveillance it went all the
way up to political assassination
Gestapo a style of political
assassination literally police breaking
into the apartment of the black
organizer Fred Hampton murdering him and
another organizer mark cook and their
beds probably drugged 4 a.m. in the
morning
false tips from the FBI that's direct
political assassination they've barely
elicited any interest or attention but
it was severe and there was plenty of it
it was finally terminated by the courts
not by Congress and compared with that
we're pretty well off it's not to say
that it's good now but it's been worse
before we have a question here in the
back
hi I'm reminded in talking about all
this of for nearly 50 years from the
death of Robert Kennedy at the hands of
Sirhan Sirhan was a Palestinian man and
reminded of how little interrogation was
done even at the time of his motives
which by his own kind of candid
admission I had to do with the
deployment of 50 bombers by Robert
Kennedy to assist in the six-day war to
further shore up his israeli defense
forces now we have I'm always moved to
think of the note that Dzhokhar tsarnaev
composed on the side of the boat when he
was awaiting capture and bleeding and he
says something to the effect of you know
know that you were facing men who looked
down the barrel of a gun and see heaven
how can you compete with that and he
said something else about the oume yeah
you know Muslims are all one body you
hurt one of us you heard the rest of us
stop killing our innocent people and we
will stop and I wonder if we someone
someday someone will anthologized
statements of terrorists whose methods
we don't condone and we'll say geez they
were being pretty emphatic and clear for
about 50 years at least and I wonder how
you account the two of you for our kind
of radical a historical obtuseness in
this half century long war you know I
hear myself sounding very anti patriotic
but it is my question I how on earth do
we forgive ourselves for not
internalizing
rather simple message if that makes any
sense
you started talking about it but I'd I'm
wondering if there's more thank you
how do we forgive her so you've got a
lot to forgive ourselves about take the
fact that we're wealthy privileged
people as all of us here are I suppose
weird that all come from well actually a
large part of the wealth of the society
not just the United States also England
and the continent came from slave labor
camps vicious slave labor camps of a
kind that would have impressed the Nazis
literally went on for over a century
that the cotton was much more important
than oil in the 19th century it was the
basis for the development of the modern
economy massive manufacturing finance
merchants commodities trade all
developed out of the cotton production
where cotton production come from slave
labor camps vicious murderous slave
labor camps where productivity which
were very efficient incidentally the
productivity in slave labor camps
producing cotton productivity increased
faster than it did in industry and there
were no technological innovations just
the bullwhip and the pistol and driving
people harder and harder so they could
verse more and more cotton more and more
rapidly more and more efficiently that's
why we're we share in wealth and
privilege and not just us so is that
something to apologize for well yeah we
pay we do apologize for it by throwing
them in jail and claiming that they're
genetically inferior that's why they do
these bad things and this has been going
on as I said for four hundred years one
four hundred others there's also a small
matter that
she was mentioned in the New York Times
this morning interestingly there was an
article on Junipero Serra the was being
considered for sainthood he led the
missions in California which brought
civilization to the Indians by
exterminating them and Christianizing
them so he's a saint
there are almost the same will be but to
the credit of the reporter whoever was
it did quote the Indian activist that
said look as an other side of this
extermination destruction of our culture
or stealing of our lands and so on
well that would didn't happen just in in
California right here where we are the
same thing happened earlier is that
something to apologize for think about
is there plenty of other things how do
we do it well that we have to ask
yourself question here in the back thank
over here thank you both first of all
just for the record there was a response
when Fred Hampton was murdered in his
bed I was in New York City and Richard
Nixon actually came to get the National
Football League award or something at
the waldorf-astoria Hotel five days
later and there was a pretty significant
protest actually it was the beginning
was sort of the cusp of the beginning of
of what became the Weather Underground
some of the people who actually took to
the streets in a very militant way just
for the record it's mark it was Mark
Clark mark Clark but that's fine I have
this feeling that a lot of the alleged I
mean putting bombs and in bathrooms is
not the same as killing people the
violence of so-called violence of the
movement that some people in the
movement turned to I've always felt was
largely provoked by massive police
violence that had preceded the resort to
some of those tactics I wonder if you
and I think it's consistent with what
you're saying about their terrorism and
our terrorism
I don't know if you haven't want to
comment on that but I'd also like to
hear a little bit more about the case of
the individual who was killed by the FBI
in Florida if there's a little more
detail you could share about that
I remember hearing from Kevin Colin and
the woman who co-wrote a book with him
that they were working on the story but
I don't remember whether there ever was
a story in The Boston Globe really
digging into what happened and the
suspicions around potential police
involvement in the characterization of
that killing as a drug deal gone bad
because they it was sort of marijuana
spread all over everybody talking about
the one in Florida or the one Waltham's
so those two yeah so what's the question
about that exactly what else you might
say about what's what is believed to
have happened or what the
characterization of what happened what
actually happened in during the
interrogation the extent that it's
there's been any evidence wouldn't we
love to know you know part of the
problem is that there's been extreme
I think unprecedented secrecy around the
Waltham murder investigation
and what happened in Florida the Florida
State's attorney Jeff Ashton I believe
his name is published a report clearing
the agent FBI agent Aaron McFarland of
wrongdoing in shooting Tadashi
he was shot seven times including twice
in the back reportedly you know the FBI
agent as well as Massachusetts state
trooper who was in the room so what we
know basically is that two state
troopers one who was assigned to the
violent Fugitive Task Force he basically
a fugitive hunter and one who was a
detective assigned to the to the murder
investigation and Walt them as well as
this FBI agent agent Aaron McFarland
went down to Orlando they say in a hurry
a mad rush to interview Sadashiva
one last time they'd spoken with him
before to interview and one last time
because they feared that he was about to
leave the country that is on its face a
hilarious statement to me because if
anybody can stop you from leaving the
country it's the FBI especially if this
guy was connected in any way it's
Tamerlan tsarnayev they would have had
no problem stopping him from leaving the
country so I find that to be bizarre at
its face that they had to rush down to
Florida to interview him at his home at
at night this is a guy who if you will
recall was a very powerful mixed martial
arts fighter he's very strong and
physically threatening in fact I heard
that the first time the FBI interviewed
him
they sent seven agents and he was they
actually while he was walking home up to
his stoop they tackled him from behind
seven guys because they were so afraid
of his physicality justifiably he was a
quite violent and had a hair-trigger
temper reportedly but then you know his
last interview which by the way they
promised him would be his last interview
it certainly was they only sent two guys
into the room at his home you know
highly unusual behavior you know
typically they would want to have them
in a secure environment you know
somewhere they could control what was
going on no you know at night they
interview him at home just two guys in
the room so there's already a lot of
stuff that seems unusual you know
suspicious and then of course you know
the next day the FBI's initial
statements change about 40 times like I
said before first the story was he came
at them with a pole then it was a night
then it was a broomstick you know it's
like a candelabra a samurai sword I'm
not kidding you can read these reports
in the press and then finally they
settle on the story that he's sitting at
a table not unlike this writing his
confession you know confessing to this
more
Susan Zaki and who I think might be in
the room has reported that the things
that he wrote down in this confession
didn't even comport with the facts that
the crime scene in watham so there's
some you know strange stuff there flips
the table somehow at the table
boomerangs and lands on the back of the
FBI agents head giving him a giant gash
in his head there are photographs of the
FBI agents wound made public and then
runs into the kitchen shuffles to find a
knife and boom boom is shot somehow in
the back twice so this is what we're
told and the FBI as well as the Florida
State's Attorney cleared the FBI a
generic font McFarlane said the shooting
was justified FBI officials have been
cleared in 150 out of 150 shootings over
recent years as Charlie Savage of the
New York Times documented so yeah I mean
there's a little there's you know one of
the things that I find to be the most
bizarre honestly about that case is that
some of the text messages between the
officers that night were printed
actually in the state's attorneys report
in Florida and the the next day after
todashev was killed by the FBI one of
the officers texts to another one I'm
paraphrasing but you can look this up
it's on my blog great job men we got
through it and now we're headed home so
I'm confused about that statement
because if I were police officers who
thought that this man perhaps was the
only living witness to a savage and
brutal triple murder in Waltham
Massachusetts where three men nearly had
their heads decapitated
they were sawed so far you know
marijuana dumped on the bodies lots of
cash left in the house truly bizarre
crime if you had killed in an
interrogation the sole remaining witness
to that crime I don't think that it's it
strikes me as weird that you would then
text good job we got through it
we're heading home it's not a conspiracy
I mean you can look it up it's in the
or a state's attorneys report I find it
to be truly bizarre and I don't you know
I don't know I don't know what happened
the the government's mum you know any
any information about the murder
investigation is not being released
because the government says that the
Waltham murders are still under
investigation
even though they've also said at times
that the two prime suspects are both
dead both of them at the hands of the
government so yeah I mean you know your
guess is as good as mine I had a
question I had a word about the reaction
to the Hampton assassination which is
quite illuminating there were some local
protests the biggest one by far was in
Chicago where the assassination took
place actually I flew out to Chicago for
the funeral couple days later there was
a massive funeral must have been a
thousand people there strikingly there
were almost no white faces that's
reflected in the coverage and the
memories and the way it was dealt with
it simply did not enter into the
national consciousness there was
virtually no reporting some but not much
because it wasn't considered significant
so what if the National Police organized
and carried out a Gestapo style murder
murder of two black organizers who cares
about that very strikingly this happened
at the same time as Watergate almost the
same time as Watergate everybody's heard
about Watergate
what happened to Watergate Nixon called
some people bad names
there was an enemies list nothing
happened to anybody's on the enemies
list I happen to know that because I was
on it they didn't fit in didn't even
investigate tax returns and it wasn't
because I was on it it was because the
head of IBM was on
and McGeorge Bundy was on it so calling
important people bad names in private
that's a real clock crime the
foundations of the Republic are
crumbling a couple of other things like
that you take a look at the Watergate
indictment
first of all things like the murder of
the COINTELPRO and the murder of Hampton
of course that's not never even
considered and we care about that as
compared with water here but there was
one crime on the original indictment
that was actually meaningful the bombing
of Cambodia it was taken off that was
not part of the indictment all that
tells you something tells you what we
consider a crime we meaning the coastal
intelligentsia who I quoted before the
liberal establishment it's not a crime
to murder
black organizers in an operation run by
the national political police it is a
crime to call important people back bad
names and Friday that's really terrible
and just compare the coverage and the
memory of just these two events and a
Watergate and the Hamptons fascination
you learn a lot about the prevailing
moral and intellectual culture I just
want to add one thing you know I
disagree a little bit with what you said
about how things were worse under Cohen
tell Pro I mean for one thing the the
FBI has access to information about all
people that you know Hoover would have
salivated over died for perhaps it
certainly killed Walker you're right
about the information but take a look at
the actions well I'm on the question of
actions I think the government has
gotten smarter about how it pursues its
you know devious intelligence activities
so you know are they murdering activists
in their beds no are they incarcerated
activists and journalists absolutely for
long prison terms in federal prison you
know the prison population wouldn't
prove sure sure yeah
one thing though Marcy wheeler who's a
writer who talks a lot about national
security issues and stuff has said she
said something like this why why are
people so worried about drone strikes on
US citizens people like Rand Paul when
the FBI and the police can kill people
and get away with it they never go to
prison for killing people so I mean you
know the question of of political
assassinations in this country I think
just you know a couple years ago a young
man named Kimani gray was shot dead by
the New York Police Department in the
street the police claimed he had a gun
and that he was waving at them everyone
who was in the street watching the
murder take place said that there was no
gun the police completely lied they
rolled up on him two plainclothes
detectives jumped out of the car and
shot him dead
you know they got away with it because
they're police and police don't go to
prison when they shoot young black men
so you know the question of whether or
not the government has simply changed
its tactics or you know it's it seems to
me to be impossible actually for police
or FBI agents to actually get to get in
trouble for shooting black people dead
and so that hasn't fundamentally changed
again I think it has take a look at the
state troopers in Jackson Mississippi in
the nineteenth early sixties police just
can't do that anymore
you mean shoot ecology a mess bloody
murder them killing him when nobody's
looking I mean it was a bunch of
monsters it's you know look at what
you're describing today is bad but I
think we should not overlook the fact
that there's a history that's actually
much worse let me just take a repression
Woodrow Wilson's Red Scare practically
destroyed independent thought in the
country destroyed the unions kicked
thousands of people out of the country
that plenty of violence and that was
Woodrow Wilson you know liberal
administration the COINTELPRO went for
the most liberal administration's in
American history Kennedy and Johnson and
murder of Fred Hampton was just the peak
or other killings there was massive
repression there was breakup of
political movements that was pretty
awful interference with personal lives
and political action and there's a
history of really oppressed minorities
like say blacks is incomparable
I have a question that's a little bit
related sorry you finish I'm not trying
to interrupt anybody but in terms of
like comparing I guess different moments
in history I'm curious about what each
of you would say about the role of
contemporary protest right I read a
piece I forget where this week that was
about sort of the nature of solidarity
and the language of protests that we use
right like after Ferguson it's or after
the murder of Eric garner it's we can't
breathe or it's just we Charlie's or
whatever it is it's all about the
inclusiveness and the show of solidarity
but Noam you invoked the film Selma
right which shows us the sort of very
different historical idea of what a
protest is which involves a very
different look at leadership and the
machinations that go on sort of behind
the scenes I'm sure a handful of people
at least in this room have been involved
in local protests and I know everyone
has different opinions about what the
experience of doing that is or what the
reason they have for doing that is but I
just sort of curious what each of you
think about the efficacy of that how
about being organized today what we can
sort of expect down the line in terms of
that kind of organization I guess in a
bizarre way I'm sort of asking like what
are we supposed to do but I think that's
the sort of something is on people's
minds I'd be curious to hear your
thoughts I don't see why the anyone
should think that the prospects for a
long time learned term political
mobilization and activism are harder
today than they were say in Alabama and
Louisiana and Mississippi in the early
1960s or in the 50s or the 40s the
background civil rights movement began I
think they're much easier today it's not
that it's easy but yes so there'll be
plenty of surveillance of what you're
doing but that's it's a burden but
regarding the back to the saarne I try a
little bit thinking about the secrecy
surrounding it and also the fairness of
the trial I'm wondering if you can speak
to something that you didn't mention yet
which is it's my understanding that
Dzhokhar tsarnaev is under a gag order
he's not been able to speak to anybody
about his motives or or anything all we
have are some sort of cryptic scrawling
'he's on a boat and if you know making
the comparison again with the Timothy
McVeigh trial one thing that is more
fair about that was that he was able to
speak freely about why he did you know
he was it was in response to Waco and
Ruby Ridge and the actions of the ATF
and the FBI and in slaughtering people
awake us so could you speak to that gag
order a little bit please yeah so what
you're referring to are these things
called special administrative measures
if there's a more Orwellian term for the
thing that that describes then maybe
it's special administrative detention I
don't know but yes these Sam's as
they're called forbid SAR and I have
from speaking to anyone except for his
immediate family and his lawyers so yes
I mean he can't talk to the press he
can't give interviews he can't write
statements that can be read by the
general public I'm not sure that his
lawyers would let him even if he could
but he can't the government won't let
him also the government is monitoring
all of his communications with his
family they monitor the visits record as
far as I understand actually wiretap
conversations with his family when they
visit him and those Sam's are not unique
to Dzhokhar tsarnaev I think it's really
important to remember that since 9/11
the government has created this special
category of prisoner there are super
super maxes now there's one in Illinois
in fact the government the federal
government is thinking about building a
new one to where Obama wanted to move
the remaining Guantanamo detainees
before the Republicans barred any
federal funds from being spent on such a
maneuver and at these special super
super maxes we're literally the only
people in them are Muslims and left-wing
so-called terrorists so you know eco
activists who you know wit fires at SUV
dealerships people like that there's
nobody else goes to these places and
their communications are extensively
monitored by the Bureau of Prisons they
have very very restricted rights in
terms of what kinds of publications they
can access while they're incarcerated so
yeah this kind of treatment that
Dzhokhar tsarnaev is subject to during
the trial is likely to extend for the
rest of his life we have a lot of people
here who are very much part of the
social media and the Internet and the
new media and I wanted to ask what are
your reflections on all this access to
media electronically that we have today
has that made a difference or is it a
you know there's some very regressive
factors with that too but I just maybe
want your thoughts when there were so
many more gatekeepers it's got very
positive aspects to it you can get
access to information and material the
woman is very hard to get before and I
say you can read the glenn greenwald's
regular report you can find out
information from the Foreign Press as
all the things that would have had that
intensive research individual research
for not long ago you can now pick up in
the warning by just a couple of
keystrokes and you can also that there's
a buddy
you can present your opinions your
interpretations there's discussions
there's debates things that would be
very hard in the past are now much
facilitated practically all the
organizing that goes on today is through
social media which is of course far more
effective than just trying to find
people so all that's positive but
there's a negative side too it's a it's
a in practice it's it it tends to
separate people from one another it
tends to set up superficial
relationships instead of real live
personal relationships and it tends to
trivialize a lot of communication and
interaction and also to divert people
the tremendous amount of it is just
divergent and that's harmful and
negative so I think it's kind of like
any just about any technology but the
technology is kind of neutral what the
impact of it is up to us how you decide
to use the technology and you can use it
as a very significant force but it's an
effort in a battle like anything decent
Kate furred Noam Chomsky thank you
very much
you
