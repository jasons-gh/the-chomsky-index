you know there's been a general assault
in the last 25 years on solidarity
democracy you know Social Welfare
anything that interferes with private
power and there are many targets one of
the targets is undoubtedly the
educational system in fact you know a
couple of years ago already the big
investment firms like you know Lehman
Brothers and so on we're sending around
brochures to their clients saying look
we've taken over the health system you
know we've taken over the prison system
the next big target is the educational
system so we can privatize the
educational system make a lot of money
out of it and also notice privatizing it
undermines the dangerous there's a kind
of a ethic that's under that has to be
undermined namely the idea that you care
about somebody else in a public
education system public education system
is based on the principle that you care
whether the kid down the street gets an
education you know and that's got to be
stopped
what you have to do is exactly you know
this is very much like what the you know
the workers in the mills and Lowell
Massachusetts were worrying about 150
years ago they were trying to stop the
idea that what they called the new
spirit of the age gained wealth for
getting all but self want to stop that
that's not what we're like we're human
beings we care about other people we
want to do things together we care about
whether the kid down the street gets an
education we care about whether somebody
else has a road even if I don't use it
you know we care about whether there's a
child slave laborer and Thailand we care
about whether somebody else some elderly
person gets food that's Social Security
you care whether somebody else gets food
you know all of that there's a huge
effort to try to undermine all of it to
try to privatize aspirations so then
you're totally controlled
privatized aspirations you're completely
controlled private power goes its own
way everyone else has subordinated
themselves to it well that's part of the
basis for the attack on the public
education system and it goes right up to
the universities in the Universities
there's a move towards corporatization
and that has very clear effect so I mean
see it at MIT you know you see it
everywhere it means that you want to
create them like just like industry you
want to create a more flexible work
force that means undermine security it
means you have cheap temporary labor
okay
like graduate students so not be paid
much and who can be thrown out you know
their temps okay they're gonna be around
for a couple of years and then you toss
them out and have some worth Tim's the
if it affects research strikingly you
see it at research I'm sure you see it
here but at a Research Institute like
where I am MIT you see pretty clearly as
funding shifts from public entities
including incidentally the Pentagon in
fact primarily the Pentagon which has
long understood that its domestic role
is to be a cover for transferring public
funds into private profit when funding
goes from the Pentagon and other and the
National Science Foundation and others
into to corporate funding there's a
definite shift a corporation say you
know some pharmaceutical corporation is
not particularly likely to want to fund
research which is going to help
everybody okay it's not gonna want a
minute there's exceptions but by and
large it's not gonna want to fund say
basic biology which may be a public good
that anybody can use ten or twenty years
from now it's gonna want to fund things
that it can make profit from and
furthermore do it in the short term so a
corporate there's a tendency is striking
tendency in a perfectly natural one for
corporate funding to institute more
secrecy and
short-term applied projects to which the
corporation has a proprietary control on
publication and use well you know
technically a corporate corporate
funding can't demand secrecy but that's
only technically in fact they can like
the threat of not refunding imposes
secrecy they're actually cases like this
some of them so dramatic they even made
the Wall Street Journal now there was an
article in The Wall Street Journal last
summer you may have seen about MIT my
place what it happened was that a
student in a class computer science
class had refused to answer in a
question on an exam he said he knew that
when he'd asked why by the professor he
said well he knew the answer but he was
under a secrecy condition from a
different professor not to answer it and
the reason was in the research he was
doing for this other professor they had
sort of worked out the answer to this
but they wanted to keep it secret
because they wanted to you know make
money or something well you know this is
so scandalous
I mean even the Wall Street Journal was
scandalized but that's the kind of thing
that said that's the kind of thing you
can expect you know as there's a move
towards corporatization after all
corporations you know they are not
benevolent societies as Milton Friedman
correctly says the word of directors of
a corporation actually is a legal
obligation to be a monster you know an
ethical monster their legal obligation
is to maximize profit for the
shareholders the stockholders not
supposed to do nice things if they are
it's probably illegal I mean unless it's
intended for some you know what to
mollify people or something improve
market share or something and that's the
way it works you know it's a you you
don't expect corporations to be
benevolent any more than you expect ATAR
ships to be benevolent I mean maybe even
force them to be benevolent but it's the
structure that's it's the tyrannical
structure that's the problem
and as the universities move towards
corporation you expect all of these
effects and one of the effects you know
away I think the most important is the
undermining of the conception of
solidarity and cooperation and I think
that lies at the heart of the attack on
the public school system on the attack
on social security the effort to block
any form of national health care which
has been gone for years and in fact
across the board and it's not you know
it's understandable if you want to
regiment the minds of men just the way
in army regiments its body gotta
undermine these subversive notions of
mutual support solidarity sympathy
caring for other people and so on and so
forth the attack on public education is
one example incidentally it's I don't
know how it's working here but in
Massachusetts where I see it directly
it's a it's it's not there's a
comparable attack on the state colleges
you know the state colleges which sort
of you know therefore the for
working-class people people come back to
college after they're halfway in their
career you know mothers who come back
people from the urban ghettos and so on
and so forth that's what the state
college system has been and they're
under serious attack by an interesting
method the method has been to raise the
entrance standards for the state
colleges without improving the schools
okay so when you don't improve the
schools but you raise the entrance
standards for the people are trying to
go on kind of obvious what happens you
get lower enrollments and when you get
lower enrollments you got to cut staff
because remember we have to be efficient
like corporations so you cut staff and
you cut services and then you can admit
even fewer people and there's kind of a
natural cycle and you can see where it
ends up it ends up with people either
not going to college or figuring out
some way to spend $30,000 a year at a
private college and you know what that
means
all of these are comparable efforts are
you know part of the general effort I
think to
to create an socioeconomic order which
is under the control of private
concentrated power shows up all over the
place
