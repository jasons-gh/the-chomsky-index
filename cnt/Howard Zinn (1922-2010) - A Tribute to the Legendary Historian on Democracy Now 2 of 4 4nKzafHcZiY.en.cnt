extraordinary things that the most
amazing moments for instance in Atlanta
once we get to the very staid at that
time white college all these very staid
upper class white girls there and their
teachers and how you got up I don't know
how they managed to invite him but
anyway there we weren't even before any
of the changes in Atlanta we were still
battling to get into restaurants so how
he gets up and he goes up to the front
of the room and large rooms for people
and he started talk by saying well I
stand to the left of vowel to drum and
it was just there was such a moment
because the people couldn't imagine
anyone at this in Atlanta saying
something like that when at that time
the Chinese in the Chinese Revolution
just met that you know people were on
the planet he was just going straight
ahead book revolutions or even things to
the laughter that so it's just an
amazing thing I think I felt he live
forever and I feel such a joy that I was
lucky enough to know him and he had such
a wonderful impact on my life and on the
lies with the students excel Minh and
millions of people he has been
incredibly lucky to have him for all
these years 87 that's such a long time
not long enough fun and it's so good to
Alice sir howard zinn was thrown out to
Spelman College right as a professor for
insubordination although recently they
gave him an honorary degree and he
addressed the graduating class why was
he thrown out when he saw not because he
loved us and he showed that love by just
being with us he loved his students he
didn't see why he should be second-class
citizens you do see why we shouldn't be
able to eat where we wanted to and sweet
but we wanted to and be with the people
we wanted to be with and so he was with
us he didn't say back you know in his
cow
are there at the school and so he was
perfect in that in that situation and of
course administration could expel the
students or activism and yeah I left
filmin because I would have lost my
scholarship divided state that was one
of the ways they controlled her and they
tried to control him because she
couldn't show Howie and so they even
waited until he had left for the summer
vacation to find that defy him that if I
am face to face but yeah he was he was
there no radical and acidosis on the
campus as far as they were concerned and
our Freeman was not that important to
the administration what they ate it was
us not to rock the boat um I wanted to
turn to Noam Chomsky who still with us
on the phone from Boston no I wanted to
ask you about Howard sins role in the
anti-war movement in the 60s in 1968
Howard's and traveled to North Vietnam
with father Daniel Berrigan to bring
home three US prisoners of war they
became two of the first Americans to
visit North Vietnam during the war this
is Howards End speaking in 1968 after he
returned to the United States maybe seem
presumptuous enough market with on our
way back in from Paris we set a wire I
think that our last 15 bucks to the
White House saying something like we'd
like to talk to you President Johnson
you know would you please meet with us
you just come back from hello I would
just talk through the Phineas I'm going
down but we just read in the news
that you say the North Vietnamese are
not ready to negotiate what we learn
from pham van dong seems to contradict
that now we'd like to talk with you
about this and about the prisoner
release which we think has been
mishandled but we have not so far seen
an answer from lbk that was Howard Zinn
Noam Chomsky talk about this period talk
about the time Howard Zinn went with
father Dan Berrigan to North Vietnam and
what it meant well it that was a
breakthrough recognizing the humanity of
the official enemy of course the main
enemy with the people of South Vietnam
who were practically destroyed South
Vietnam was had been devastated by then
and that was important but at least in
my view of the most the more more
important was his book that you
mentioned before the logical withdrawal
I mean there was by then I guess must
been 1967 you know a substantial added
warm movement but it was keeping to
palliate is you know stop stop doing
these terrible things and do less and so
on Howard really broke through he was
the first person to say loudly publicly
very persuasively this simply has to
stop we should get out period no
conditions we have no right to be there
it's an act of aggression pull out
actually he that was so surprising at
the time it became more commonplace
later that he couldn't even there wasn't
even a review with a book in fact he
asked me if I would review it in
ramparts just so that which you know
left-wing journal was running then just
says somebody people would see it so I
did that but it's sank in pretty quickly
and it just changed the way people look
at the war and in fact that was one of
his Savio's achievements all along he
simply changed people's perspectives
both by his argument and his courage and
his integrity and his willingness to be
on the front line all the time and his
simplicity and as Alice Walker said is
humor this is one case the war of
people's histories another case I mean
it simply changed the conscience of a
whole generation the it's there had been
some studies you know of sort of actions
from below but he raised it to an
entirely new plane in fact the phrase of
his that's always rings in my mind is
his reverence for and his detailed study
of what he called the countless small
actions of unknown people that lead to
those great moments that entered the
historical record a record that he
simply can't begin to understand unless
you look at those countless small
actions and you know I wrote about the
eloquently but he participated in and he
inspired others to participate in them
and the anti-war movement was 1k civil
rights movement before it Central
American wars and the 1980s in fact
about any office worker strikes is there
anything you can any significant action
for a peace and justice Howard was there
people saw him as a leader but he was
really a participant his you know his
remarkable character made him a leader
even if he was just sitting on the you
know waiting for the police to pull
people away like everyone else no in
1971 you may remember this in fact you
may have been there but Howard Zinn and
Daniel Ellsberg were both beaten by
police in Boston at a protest against
the Vietnam War one day before the
beating as in spoke at a large rally and
Boston Common this is an ex
sir from the documentary you can't be
neutral on a moving train one peep on
troubled by civil disobedience soon as
you talk about committing civil
disobedience they get a little upset
that's exactly the purpose of civil
disobedience you're upset people the
trouble mr. was hoping you'd
thunderstorm too and we mean to disturb
those are charged in the war he said at
the end of his speech remember he said
now let me address the secret police in
this crowd
violating the spirit of democracy my one
to join don't you see that you make any
mistake of felicia fallon various things
well that cost him a bit I think the
next day when we were sitting in front
of the federal building i have a feeling
because again the police chose in the
end to rest almost no one they didn't
want to rest they didn't want a trial
they didn't want the publicity to be
associated with that they only arrested
a couple of ram leaders and one of those
is every city until I killing stops
until we can hold up our heads again the
world cannot go to the dorm a world
without war and we want to try to give
them
