you're right that there's a consensus
among the miniscule number of architects
and engineers tiny number they're a
couple of them are perfectly serious
they are not doing what scientists and
engineers do when they think they've
discovered something what you drew when
you think you've discovered something
what you do is write articles and
scientific journals give talks at the
professional societies that go to the
civil engineering department at MIT or
Florida or wherever you are and present
your results and then proceed to try to
convince the National Academies the
professional Society of physicists and
civil engineers the departments and the
major universities convinced them that
you've discovered something now there
happen to be a lot of people around who
spent an hour on the internet and think
they know a lot of physics but it
doesn't work like that
so the thing to do is pretty
straightforward do what scientists and
engineers do who think they've made a
discovery now when this is brought up as
it has been there are one or two minor
articles like there's one article that
appeared in an online a journal which
claims to have found where someone
claims to have found traces of nano
thermite in building seven I don't know
what that means
you don't know what that means but if it
means anything bring it to the attention
of the scientific community that's a
couple of other fragments like that so
yes there are there's a small group of
people who believe this and there's a
straightforward way to proceed now when
this is brought up there's a standard
reaction scientists and engineers and
professional societies and physicists
are so intimidated by the government
that they're afraid to take to they
don't have the courage to take this
position anyone who has
any part record of quick any familiarity
with political activism notice that this
is one of the safest things you can do
it's almost riskless people take risks
far beyond this constantly including
scientists and engineers I could have
run through and can run through many
examples maybe people laugh at you but
that's about it
it's a almost riskless position so that
can't be the reason why nobody's
convinced however there's a much more
deeper issue which has been brought up
repeatedly and I have yet to hear a
response to it there happens to be
whatever one thinks about building seven
I have no opinion I don't know as much
science and engineering as the people
who believe that they have an answer to
this so I'm willing to let the
professional societies determine it if
they get the information so whatever the
facts there's just overwhelming evidence
that the Bush administration wasn't
involved very elementary evidence you
don't have to be a physicist to
understand it you just have to think for
a minute okay so let's think for a
minute the
there's a couple of facts which are
uncontroversial right one fact that is
uncontroversial is that the Bush
administration desperately wanted to
invade Iraq
that's a long-standing goal it's good
reasons for it you know second largest
energy resources in the world right in
the middle of the world's major energy
producing region you know perfectly
obvious reasons which they affect later
stated but there were obvious anyway so
they wanted to invade Iraq one
uncontroversial fact second
uncontroversial fact they didn't blame
the 911 on Iraqis they blamed it on
Saudis mainly that's their major ally so
they blamed it on people from their
major ally not on the country that they
wanted to invade a third uncontroversial
fact unless they're total lunatics they
would have blamed it on Iraqis if they
were involved in any way that would have
given them a open season on invading
Iraq a total support international
support the UN resolution no need to
concoct wild stories about the weapons
of mass destruction and contacts between
Saddam and al-qaeda which of course
quickly exploded discrediting them no
reason to invade Afghanistan and which
could mostly a waste of time for them
but they didn't well the conclusion is
pretty straightforward either they are
total lunatics or they weren't involved
and they're not total lunatics
