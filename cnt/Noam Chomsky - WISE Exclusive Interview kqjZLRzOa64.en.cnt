right here at MIT leading Science and
Technology University in the world these
senior faculty teach elementary courses
as they should one of the great
physicists of the 20th century Victor
Weisskopf
was famous for what he used to tell his
introductory classes I mean if they
would ask that what are we going to
cover this semester hue his answer was
it doesn't matter what we cover it
matters what you discover if you can
discover things you're on your way to
being an independent thinker and that's
what education should be I'm at the
graduate level mostly where I am you
don't teach and expect people to
students to answer things and tests an
interactive process of participation and
cooperation to try to discover and learn
what it means to discover and that can
be done from kindergarten to MIT
graduate courses
tuitions in the United States to higher
education of just skyrocketed there's no
economic basis for it
the use was a much poorer country in the
1950s that education was either free or
close to free now there are poor
countries in rich ones like say Mexico
or Finland which have free education
systems that do and find all of this is
part of a imposition on the universities
of the kind of a business model which is
seeking profitability not educational
attainment and at some cases it's
reached pretty ludicrous levels for
example state colleges around the
country which were you know the jewel of
the education system public education
many of them are now cutting out
programs in fields like engineering
computer science and nursing which
happened to be the programs where
there's a lot of jobs because they're
too expensive in fact one of the highly
negative aspects of this very sharp
tuition rise is that it entrapped
students it deprives them of their
freedom if you're gonna come out of
college with $50,000 in debt you're
stuck you can't do the things that you
would have liked to do like maybe you
wanted to be a public interest lawyer
helping poor people can't do it you've
got to go to a corporate law firm to pay
off your debt then you get trapped into
that in fact the one of the main effects
of the sharp increase in tuition is just
indoctrination and control and as I say
I don't think it's economically
justified and played evidence for that
but we can see what the effects are
in some place where you don't have the
opportunity for direct participation
live participation in the first place
then that's second best but it but
watchings of the online is nothing like
being in a class a good classroom the
Internet is like other technology in
this respect it can be is to deliberate
to learn to study to interact
constructively it can be used to divert
people into meaningless activities to
indoctrinate them to overwhelm them with
propaganda commercial or political and
so on that's our choice how do we use it
how do we use the opportunities they're
available
should we regard education as like
pouring water into a vessel which is
more and more the way it is or should we
regard it as a way of offering the
opportunities and encouraging the
learner to pursue a partially structured
environment that but to pursue it in
their own ways so they develop their own
creative capacities and learn to become
productive free people in a free society
which way those were the problems in the
18th century they're problems that arise
now
