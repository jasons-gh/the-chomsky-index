well why are radical islamists attacking
the United States while continuing to
work as its agents I think there's every
reason to take them at their word on
their answers to this as the scholarly
literature does and I suppose the
world's intelligence agencies as well
roughly what I just said so that's the
perpetrators but then there's another
very relevant population a population in
which bin Laden's horrendous words have
a certain resonance for example the
moneyed Muslims as they were called by
the wall street journal when it surveyed
the attitudes of wealthy Muslims on
September 14th right after a couple days
after the World Trade Center bombing
that means banker they were interviewing
in the Middle East bankers and lawyers
other professionals managers of
multinationals some of whom described
bin Laden as in their words the
conscience of Islam even though they
despise him and they fear him they fear
him for good reasons they know that they
are his primary targets they're very
strongly supportive of US policies in
general but very bitter about us the
u.s. role in the region the and they
state their reasons the Wall Street
Journal to its credit reported them
accurately namely the u.s. supports
corrupt and repressive regimes that
undermine democracy and development and
then there are particular policies such
as the support for the harsh and brutal
Israeli military occupation now in its
35th year actions that devastate araki
civilian society while strengthening
Saddam Hussein others nobody surveyed
opinions and the slums and rural
villages but if they had they'd find
similar reactions but harsher ones
because unlike the moneyed Muslims the
people there don't understand why the
wealth of the region should be drained
to the west and to
local collaborators rather than being
used for the domestic population well
these attitudes which are not exactly
secret provides some of the answers to
George Bush's plaintiff question why do
they hate us and those who want to add
some historical death can easily do so
you can look back at the Declassified
internal record so say back to nineteen
fifty-eight which was a crucial year in
u.s. foreign policy in that year there
and the records are declassified in that
year there were three major crises in
the world Eisenhower and Dulles
president secretary of state insisted
that there was no Russian connection in
any of them which is incidentally rather
typical of the Cold War period when you
look closely at particular cases all
three were oil producers all three were
it's Islamic Indonesia North Africa
Middle East but they were secular Islam
in the three cases in the Middle East
Eisenhower pointed out to his staff that
I'm quoting him the problem is that we
have a campaign of hatred against us not
by the government's but by the people
why well while this is 45 years ago not
after September 11th the National
Security Council explained highest
planning body I'm quoting them they said
in the eyes of the majority of Arabs the
United States appears to be opposed to
the realization of the goals of Arab
nationalism they believe that the United
States is seeking to protect its
interest in Near East oil by supporting
the status quo that means corrupt and
brutal governments and opposing
political or economic progress and they
point out that that perception is
difficult to counter since it's accurate
our economic and cultural interests in
the area have led not unnaturally to
close us relations with elements in the
Arab world whose primary interest lies
in the maintenance of relations with the
west and the
that is quo in their countries so that's
the policy we do follow and we should
follow and it will lead to a campaign of
hatred against us much as the Wall
Street Journal and others found after
September 11th when they surveyed the
opinions of the wealthy and the
privileged who are closely linked with
Western power and support its basic
objectives well it's easy to go on with
this it's not hard to understand but
educated opinion here prefers a
different story the one you've read over
and over it prefers ruminations about
how they resent us because of our
freedom and our love of democracy or
because of their cultural failings which
go back to the Middle Ages or be happy
because they've been left behind by the
form of globalization in which they
happily participate and so on and we can
if we want choose self-serving fairy
tales but it's not particularly wise nor
is it wise to pretend that we don't know
the answer to Bush's question we do it's
very hard to miss well those policies
continue to be operative not only in the
Middle East let's go back to Latin
America here are the policies are
similar and they are just as natural to
quote the National Security Council as
in the Middle East and they're also
deeply rooted not a great surprise to
Latin Americans or two people here who
want to understand our own country for
example by looking at the rich
Declassified record of internal planning
for example you can look back to a
hemispheric conference in 1945 which
laid out the framework for subsequent us
Latin American relations in that
conference in Mexico the United States
instituted what was called the economic
charter of the Americas and its goal was
and quoting the State Department now its
goal was to counter the philosophy of
the new nationalism that was sweeping
Latin America it's a dangerous doctrine
which embraces policies design
to bring about a broader distribution of
wealth and to raise the standard of
living of the masses and holds that the
first beneficiaries of the development
of the country's resources should be the
people of that country according the
State Department and of course that's a
serious misunderstanding the first
beneficiaries of the country's resources
must be US investors we have to protect
our resources as George Kennan put it
top State Department planner he was
referring to the material and human
resources that by accident lie elsewhere
but are ours and as he made clear and
explicit violence may be the only way
you may recall that Kenan was at the
dovish extreme of the planning spectrum
he was removed in 1950 because he was
considered too soft for this harsh world
he's now revered as great humanist the
threat of the new nationalism was
overcome the US had the force to do it
one of the consequences was described by
the World Bank just a few years ago they
pointed out that the region has the most
unequal income distribution in the world
and there will be chaos unless
governments act aggressively against
poverty which is appalling and its depth
and scale and that situation is expected
to become worse last year the US
intelligence community with the
assistance of academic specialists and
people from the business world published
their projection for the next 15 years
their projection is that what they call
globalization will proceed proceed on
course leading to a widening economic
divide and greater financial volatility
well a widening economic divide means
less globalization in the technical
sense of convergence to a single market
but more globalization in the
doctrinally preferred sense of
concentration of wealth and power and
more financial volatility well that
means slower growth and even
or harm for the poor majority so that's
the optimistic scenario these
predictions were a few months before
September 11th there's no indication
that the these tendencies of the
emerging world the framework of World
Order there's no indication they're
going to change except in one respect
they're likely to become more pronounced
with consequences as grave as those that
the world bank predicts and they're very
deeply rooted not the kind of policies
that change easily you can get some
further insight into the effects of
likely effects of September 11th by
looking back a few years to the
preceding moment when it was widely
argued that there would be a crucial
turning point in world affairs namely
the end of the Cold War that was
definitively over by November 1989 with
the fall of the Berlin Wall so what do
we learned from that historic break well
I think if you look back now with 12
years 13 years experience we discover
primarily continuity some tactical
modifications lots of new pretexts for
old policies but basically the same
policies the ones I've just outlined
which are indeed natural just as the
National Security Council recognized
deeply rooted in our institutions and
therefore persistent
