I really can't mention one book that
people should read it depends on your
own interests and concerns I'm asked a
lot to give people you know reading
lists but until you know the only people
who can decide what they ought to read
or the people themselves they know their
interests they know the concerns they
know their degree of commitment I mean
if you ask a question you know what
should you read about this and that
topic I may have a suggestion but what
books should you read I can't say you
want to know something about the history
of the United States one book I'd
suggest is look my old close friends who
was on this program just a year ago
Howard Zinn his people's history of the
United States which i think is just sold
its million copy there's a terrific
introduction to the history of the
United States in a way in which it is
not usually taught but should be so
that's one suggestion
