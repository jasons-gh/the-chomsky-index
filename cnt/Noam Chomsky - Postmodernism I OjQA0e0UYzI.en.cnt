are the young are the trends you've been
speaking about in US University if you
think they're responsible for a lot of
what's coming out of the academic
collapse mainly post-modernism do you
think that has a particular place in the
doctrinal system mainly people wanted to
be subversive but not rock the boat or
do you think there's some other
explanation for that well you know
individuals have their own reasons and
you have to look and ask why they're
doing this but if you look at the
phenomena as a whole its effect has been
I think the effect is pretty clear it
allows people to take a very radical
stance you know more radical than though
but to be completely dissociated from
anything that's happening for many
reasons one reason is nobody can
understand a word they're saying so
they're already dissociate it's kind of
like a private lingo and it's very you
know there's a lot of material reward
that comes from it like if you're part
of that system you can run around the
conferences and get big professorships
and you know all this kind of stuff so
there's a lot of sort of conventional
material reward and it has this very
radical look to it so you feel you know
everybody well let me just give you an
example I gave a talk couple days less
Saturday less Saturday at piers 8
University the Palestinian University of
the West Bank and it was a you know you
like everywhere big mass audience
political talk mostly criticizing the
Palestinian Authority because I was in
you know you always tell people what
they want here so why criticize Israel I
do it on the other side of the word but
the and the audience most of the
audience very supportive and they liked
and they understood it the guys with the
jackets and ties were pretty angry but
that's normal however as I left with the
Arab friend of mine who organized it he
said actually an Arab but he's Israeli
Arab was a member of the Knesset
Parliament but an old kind of guy he
sort of let he was sitting in the back
of the a he as we walked out he kind of
laughed and he told me eat you know I
said most of the especially younger
people liked a lot but he
one critical really critical comment
from a young woman faculty member who
sort of liked the general political
thrust of it but told him it was very
naive and he said you know why was I
even he laughed and he said well it's
because you said that people do things
on moral grounds and you talked about
truth okay and that's old-fashioned
nonsense you know that's kind of this
old enlightenment stuff we know
perfectly well that nobody does it I
mean I talked about how apartheid was
overthrown
you know how was necessary to have
splits inside the white society which
there were the white society had been
unified they would have smashed the ANC
but there were splits from the inside
and basically on moral grounds people
didn't want to tolerate it that was
quite important something you know
talked about that
well that's naive because nobody doesn't
anything on moral grounds all power
plays you know read Foucault and so on
and so forth if you can understand it
and truth is kind of like an
old-fashioned concept you know there's
no truth and so on and so forth yeah
that stuff goes on all over I mean that
the next day I gave a talk at an Israeli
University and then it was critical of
Israel United States and talked about
Palestinians and there were commentators
and one of the commentators was the Dean
and you know he hated it of course in
the historian and he said he also said
it was naive because I was talking as if
there's there's a objectivity in history
I was running through the history of
what happened and saying how you should
interpret what's going on now in those
terms it is complete naive I mean
everybody knows there's no objectivity
and there's no truth and it's this
narrative and that narrative and so on
and so forth that's very convenient
it sounds very radical you know and it's
extremely convenient you can beat people
over the head with perfect you know
self-confidence because there's no
reality anyway and it's just their
narrative and your narrative in the
third world it has it's particularly
grotesque in my it's bad enough here I
don't like it here or other rich
countries but when you get to third
world countries it's really grotesque
because the you know there the
separation of the radical intelligentsia
from popular struggle is a much more you
know it shows much more dramatically
I'm people are much poorer and they're
suffering much more and these guys are
usually pretty pretty very rich in fact
often and it's ugly but I think it has
served the function I don't want to say
that the people who are involved in it
necessarily do it for this reason in
fact I know extremely good people who
are very active and I respect and like
and so on who are right in this stuff I
don't know why but that's their means
something to them but as a general
phenomenon I think that's the way it's
worked it's worked as a way of
insulating sectors of a kind of radical
intelligentsia from popular movements
and actual activism and serving and it
served as an instrument of power I think
I suspect that's the reason why it's so
readily tolerated in the universities
and it's all over the place in the third
world as well no because of the function
it serves
