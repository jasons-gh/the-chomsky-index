mr. Greenfield mr. Chomsky you stayed in
one of the essays in your book the
unpleasant fact is that if one wishes to
pursue the Munich analogy there is only
one plausible candidate for the role of
Hitler and by that you mean the United
States there are other references to
Nazi Germany's conduct of foreign policy
in our own and you also less
emphatically suggest that a lot of the
internal policies of the ANA States
government have left millions of its own
citizens hungry or exploited if this is
the fact that is to say if the nature of
our society is functionally
indistinguishable in this respect from
from Nazi Germany then doesn't that
legitimate any tactic that one wishes to
use in opposition
well I certainly don't believe that your
assumption that is I don't believe and I
don't think I ever say their society is
functionally indistinguishable from Nazi
Germany no that's a is that what you're
one wants to what is zero in yeah so we
train we prevent 5000 American soldiers
from going to Vietnam to participate in
what you do explicitly call a criminal
war right isn't that a moral act oh I
think that yes it would be if sabotage
would in fact contribute to ending the
war I would be in favor of sabotage let
me give you some concept that's an
impractical decision not a moral
decision in fact I'll give you some
examples what the berrigan's have done
for example that Catonsville in Norwalk
II I think is very heroic in fact
saintly but that is not killing the
American soldier but on it well you were
talking about sabotage blowing up a
troop train I would assume they'll be
loss of life I'm sorry I thought you
meant but say you know stop preventing a
train from going you know I would first
of all make a sharp distinction as for
example the Americans did between
attacks on property and attacks on
people that's what I want on the mental
distinction but then you see if one
raises the question about attacks on
people then I think there are very
tricky issues see one would I can
concede I'm you know I would have been
against assassinating Hitler for example
because I'm against murder but if I
believed that assassination of Hitler
would have really contributed to the end
of the pending war I think one could
have given argument given an argument
now if industry- Lyndon Johnson Park now
that would pertain to Lyndon Johnson but
in neither case incidentally do I think
that yeah I think we would have been
