well with regard to sovereignty and
World Order title there are two
questions that arise at once one is the
question that I'm sure is on everyone's
mind at the moment the question of
intervention forcible intervention and
violation of sovereign rights and the
question is when is it justified and the
other question is has to do with seating
sovereignty to the international
community so when is that appropriate
and when his refusal to do so justified
these two issues which interrelate have
a long history they took a decisive turn
about 50 years ago at the end of the
Second World War when a new
international regime was established
that primarily under US initiative
reflection of overwhelming us power that
was had nothing like it in history that
new regime had a number of components
there was a human rights regime
articulated in the Universal Declaration
an international political order which
is the one I mainly want to talk about
articulated in the UN Charter and an
international economic order developed
at the Britain woods conference on high
school to Britain would system these
three were related closely interrelated
it's maybe less known though it should
be known in the case of the Bretton
Woods system but a primary element of it
was motivated by concerns over
sovereignty in human rights over the
other two issues the Bretton Woods
system was based on as I'm sure you know
on regulation of capital a large part of
the reason for that was the
understanding of the framers of Bretton
Woods that capital mobility is a weapon
powerful weapon again in fact against
sovereignty
hence against democracy to the extent
that the polity is democratic and also
against human rights specifically
against the socio-economic rights that
are a core element of the Universal
Declaration and that were particularly
significant because of the situation at
the end of the Second World War when
they were very strongly support I was a
and the idea is the point is more less
obvious explicit in in bretton woods
planning and discussed reasonably well
in standard economic history so barry
eichengreen in a recent history the
international economic system points out
succinctly the main point he says as
many others have pointed out as well
that by gross measures the level of
globalization today is more or less like
what it was before the first world wars
returning something like the pre-world
War one level but with crucial
differences and the crucial difference
that he emphasizes this is in history
the international financial system the
crucial difference that he stresses is
that at that time pre-world War one
mostly quotes economic policymaking had
not yet been politicized by universal
male suffrage and the rise of trade
unionism and parliamentary labor parties
in other words there wasn't much way of
democracy so therefore the costs of
financial rectitude meaning making sure
that investors and creditors are happy
those costs could be transferred to the
general population who didn't have much
of a voice but by World War two things
had changed there had been a expansion
of democracy and there was a new and
strong focus on human rights as a result
he says the Bretton Woods system imposed
limits on capital mobility as a
substitute for limits on democracy as a
source of insulation from market
pressures again market pressures is that
code word
already described there's of course
that's I think a fair assessment of the
thinking and what happened but it does
have a corollary the corollaries is that
the dismantling of the Britain would
system since the early 1970s you would
expect it to be and indeed it has been
accompanied by a strong assault against
functioning democracy democracy apart
from forms and the sovereignty that is
popular sovereignty and also against
human rights specifically against the
socio-economic provisions of the
Universal Declaration fact that's a good
part of the history of the past 25 years
and looking at it closely shows the
interrelations of these things well
there's a lot to say about that but come
back to it if you like but though drop
that topic though it's a crucial and
central one and has rather interesting
things have happened just in the last
couple of weeks relating to it in
countries as different as Germany in
Brazil and but I'll put it aside and
turn to a narrower question the question
of the international political order and
again the two issues of sovereignty so
what about the right of intervention
which violate sovereignty and what about
the willingness to relinquish
sovereignty that is to take part in an
international community to submit to an
international regime of World Order
there is a truism which I won't waste
much time on unless the most powerful
are willing to accept the rules of World
Order that is to subordinate a degree of
sovereignty to international law and
international order unless that's true
the system is plainly a farce it's
nothing more than a weapon to use
against against the week that ought to
be a truism these two issues the it's
two aspects of the question of
sovereignty and
old order they are related they're the
simplest way to perceive a relationship
is to recognize and other truism namely
insofar as intervention violating
sovereignty might be legitimate the
judgment that it is is based on
judgments of good faith on the part of
those who are intervening to violate
sovereignty and a crucial element of
good faith crucial evidence for it is
precisely the willingness to accept the
rules of world order yourself that is to
relinquish sovereignty under the regime
of international law and international
order so the two points are quite
closely related just none essentially
logical grounds well that much is
obvious and it's also familiar you can
so take say the the reason the most
recent extensive scholarly study of
humanitarian intervention which is a
kind of a hot topic in the last couple
of years this is a book came out of here
through a go by sean Murphy who's now
the counselor for legal affairs in the
US Embassy in The Hague and he looks at
both illegal and historical aspects of
humanitarian intervention it's actually
a PhD thesis turned into a book so very
scholarly in the in the period right
before the New World Order that is right
before the UN Charter so in particular
the period in between the kellogg-briand
pact of 1920 8 which banned the use of
force and the UN Charter which spelled
that out much more explicitly in that
period he points out that there were
examples of what was put forth this
humanitarian intervention he finds three
major examples of states that
articulated the right of humanitarian
intervention a one was Japan and
Manchuria the second was Italy in
Ethiopia and the third was Germany in
Czechoslovakia well no need to comment
much about it they all if you look at
the at the at the declarations and
pronouncements presumably as sincere as
anyone elses
they just exude humanitarian rhetoric
and they're full of talk about
self-defense so quite impressive as I
say there's no need to comment about the
examples though we might ask how they
compare with the post UN charter
interventions that's fair question don't
advise you to write a thesis on it but
it is a fair question and it has
interesting answers when you pursue it
if you want my opinion I've written
about some of the cases comparing them
well that brings out the obvious fact
that unless there is good faith as
illustrated by a willingness to accept
the rules of world order you can't take
very seriously any claims about
humanitarian intervention even when they
have a degree of force as in fact if you
look as in the case of all propaganda
they did in these cases well let's take
a more recent case very recent Bosnia
during the period of the worst
atrocities in bosnia early couple years
ago no one was willing to intervene by
force and that reluctance elicited the
very strong criticism huge torrent of
criticism however there was one fact
that was kind of generally more or less
overlooked or not mentioned at all
namely it seemed that there was one
country that was willing to intervene to
protect the Bosnians from the slaughter
that was going on and it might well have
been able to do so namely Iran well that
could have been feasible maybe the US
could have provided them some logistic
help you know Pirlo c-130s or something
but we don't that was not an option I
mean nobody considered that possibility
if anybody had bothered to mention it
would been ridiculed in fact Iranian
support for Bosnia supply of arms
advisers volunteers that when it was
detected that was considered a very
serious charge against Bosnia and
against Iran uh and we have to ask why
you know well
one obvious answer is there's no
presumption of good faith fair enough I
don't presume it either but there is an
obvious question is Iran's record on
intervention how does Iran's record on
intervention compared with those who did
intervene say with the United States
well fair question not asked but these
questions are plainly worth asking and
everywhere you look those questions
arise well they're not asked in fact
they're unthinkable when they are
mentioned they tend to elicit tantrums
for example on the part of one of the
leading academic specialists on
humanitarian intervention thomas weis
his reaction to this question is that
it's just sound bites and invectives
about Washington's historically evil
foreign policy so we can therefore
forget about the question or we can turn
to Henry Kissinger who explains why
there's no issue writing a couple of
weeks ago he points out that the Balkan
conflicts over many centuries are fought
with such unparalleled ferocity because
the people there lack Western concepts
of Tolerance so there's plainly no issue
about Western intervention because no
question of good faith in the light of
the history of Europe internally where
people French and British Germans
treated each other with such loving
solicitude over many centuries and acted
the same way within the rest of the
world instead of showing the
unparalleled ferocity that you find in
these savage areas well given that
history there's no question of good
faith that arises if the West intervenes
in the Balkans so we can get rid of the
question that way well if we decide to
be serious about the issues departing
from convention then a lot of questions
arise so we might look at some of the
cases that might qualify as humanitarian
intervention a good place to start maybe
the most obvious is the Vietnamese
invasion of
bodiam 1979 which terminated the Nepal
pot atrocities which were happened to be
peaking right at that time the worst
atrocities were in it's now known were
in 78 probably late 78 just at the time
of the intervention which was in
December 1979 the 78 and that terminated
him well what was the reaction to the
Vietnamese intervention to terminate the
Paul Pott slaughters as they were
peaking the reaction was bitter
condemnation of what the New York Times
called the Prussians of Asia there was
an immediate Chinese invasion to teach
them a lesson which the u.s. strongly
supported the united states recognized
democratic kampuchea at the united
nations officially because of its
continuity that was the word that was
used because of its continuity with the
Khmer Rouge regime Vietnam of the u.s.
also gave military aid right away to
Paul Pott a little bit indirectly but
not very subtly and the Vietnam was
severely punished for this crime was
harsh sanctions were imposed that was
for the crime of ousting Pol Pot and
terminating his massacres invading in
violation of international law which
bars the use of force and International
Affairs except in self-defense as was
grandly proclaimed in fact this is one
of the few cases may be the only hard to
think of another one may be the best
case if not the only case where a
self-defense justification for
intervention was actually warranted the
Khmer Rouge Cambodia was carrying out
murderous attacks in Vietnam along the
border so maybe you could justify it
maybe not but in any event that was
certainly not the reaction well that's
probably the clearest case in the
post-war period of an intervento Second
World War period of an intervention in
self-defense plausibly in self-defense
and with humanitarian consequences in
fact very important humanitarian
consequences if not humanitarian intent
and it's kind of interesting to
investigate the
reaction what happened in response to
this well if you're want to be serious
about the question of humanitarian
intervention and how it's understood in
the West that's a another good example
to look at well every one every such
example this one or any other one has to
be looked at closely I mean I have to
look at it carefully a few phrases don't
suffice but they all of these do raise
obvious questions there is questions
about the legitimacy of humanitarian
intervention about the question of good
faith about the record of those who are
exercising the use of force in
particular it they raise questions about
their record in accepting an
international regime of World Order and
therefore seating sovereignty just as in
the case of intervention they are
compelling someone the seed sovereignty
because seating sovereignty is what it
means to participate in a community no
matter what it is whether it's a family
or international affairs participation
in a community involves seating a degree
of what we call sovereignty and
international affairs well the regime of
international order is pretty clear as
these things go the UN Charter strictly
bans the threat or use of force except
in explicit circumstances if explicitly
ordered by the Security Council after
the security council has determined that
all peaceful means have failed or under
the famous article 51 which permits
self-defense against armed attack until
the Security Council act armed attack is
a narrow notion in international law
well the Charter isn't an axiom system
for arithmetic so the rules are not
entirely precise although they're
reasonably clear and they're also not
moral absolutes that is you can they're
not inviolable you can imagine
circumstances in which maybe they should
be violated but there is a burden of
proof how heavy that the burden of proof
is on anyone who violates them how heavy
that burden
proof is is a value judgment so for
example if you think it was fine for say
Saddam Hussein to invade queit there's
no burden of proof on the other hand if
you think there was something wrong with
that then there is a burden of proof on
any move to use force in violation of
the Charter and reasonable principles
well beyond that there's at least
attention if not an outright
contradiction between the Charter and
another one of the pillars of World
Order namely the Universal Declaration
and it's that tension that opens up the
question of humanitarian intervention
there are opinions about this by
distinguished authorities who have taken
strong the expressed strong views on the
matter one the most important one is the
international court of justice in the
case of Nicaragua versus the United
States the court took up this issue the
US had not claimed the right of
humanitarian intervention but the court
discussed it anyway and ruled strongly
on the matter saying there is no such
right specifically the court ruled on a
question that was indeed applicable the
question of humanitarian aid and it gave
an explicit unambiguous determination
that all US aid to the Contras is
military aid including band-aids none of
it qualifies as humanity meant of the of
the court well that judgment was that
decision was dismissed in fact I think
it was ever reported the military aid
was called humanitarian aid called up to
the end until us had won that war and
the in fact the court decision
altogether was dismissed
