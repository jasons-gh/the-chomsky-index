good evening welcome to our hub talks
with Chris Hedges dr. Noam Chomsky and
dr. holida booth phuddle on religious
nationalism and the american israeli
saudi alliance
I'm your host Zachary mark with and I'd
like to thank our speakers for sharing
their research experience and wisdom
with us this evening we have a Christian
Presbyterian minister critiquing
American militarism and the Christian
Right an eminent Jewish linguist
critiquing the Israeli occupation and
Zionism and a Muslim jurist critiquing
the Saudi royal family and Wahhabism
apologies that this ecumenical gathering
of ours could not also include Hindu and
Buddhist critiques of Hindu and Buddhist
nationalism in India and Myanmar there
does however seem to be a common ethical
impulse that runs through all cultures
and religions the heart of which is the
golden rule we read in the Hebrew Bible
love thy neighbor as thyself and in the
gospel in as much as you have done it
unto the least of these my brethren you
have done it unto me and in the quran
whoever slays a soul it is as if he has
slew all of humanity and whoever saves a
life it is though he has saved the life
of all of humanity yet we have failed
ourselves are very humanity if we think
that the Golden Rule
ethics or human rights only apply to
those in our tribe our race our religion
or our nation
indeed nationalism is the new Golden
Calf what are the connections between
religious nationalism in the United
States Israel and Saudi Arabia how are
these three nations allied and should we
reconsider these alliances these are
questions for our speakers but I would
first like to offer a few preliminary
reflections all three nations are
outgrowth of British imperialism at the
expense of indigenous peoples the United
States formerly British colonies was
built by exterminating Native Americans
and enslaving Africa
Israel was built with the support of the
British government through the Balfour
Declaration in 1917 which was addressed
to Lord Rothschild and announced support
for the establishment of a national home
for the Jewish people at the expense of
Semitic Muslims Christians and Jews in
Palestine and the greater Middle East
Saudi Arabia and Wahhabism were also
supported by the British during World
War one against the Ottomans as well as
moderate Sunnis Shia and Suzi's of
Arabia today even though they still
enjoy British support Israel and Saudi
are for all intents and purposes
protectorates of the united states which
supplies billions of dollars in
financial aid and arms to essentially
rule the region by proxy before we
commence I would also like to remember
Jamal khashoggi may he rest in peace who
was murdered at the Saudi consulate in
Istanbul on October 2nd likely at the
behest of the Saudi Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman we can also remember
the 40 Yemen each school children whose
bus was bombed by the Saudi government
with u.s. arms on August 9th and
thousands more who have died in other
attacks we can remember the hundreds of
peaceful protesters in Gaza who were
killed by the Israeli military this year
with American financial support and
political cover while the Trump family
celebrated moving the American Embassy
in Israel to Jerusalem among the killed
was an unarmed Palestinian nurse Rosanna
and a job who was killed on June 1st by
an Israeli sniper while helping wounded
a wounded protester and as we know wars
and crimes against humanity are also
waged directly and at a much greater
scale by the by the United States with
bipartisan support if there is one thing
that links the u.s. Israel and Saudi
today it seems to be their desire to
isolate and threaten Iran with a new war
the moment has come for us to speak up
for peace justice truth and human rights
to not allow neoconservatives the
Christian Right
and hawks in both wings of the
military-industrial complex to define
America and Christianity to not allow
settlers and hawks in Israel to define
Judaism to not allow wahabis and the
Saudi royal family to define Islam the
time has come to pledge ourselves to
building and sustaining of a viable
anti-war movement and culture to pledge
to ourselves our children our neighbors
in the world that we will not support
politicians and businesses that profit
from war that we will teach and embody
peace and justice with one another as
individuals and nations it's my pleasure
to turn to our eminent speakers were
first joined by Chris Hedges a Pulitzer
Prize winning journalist New York Times
bestselling author professor at
Princeton University activist and
ordained Presbyterian minister he has
written 11 books including war is a
force that gives us meaning American
fascists the Christian Right and the war
on America and America the farewell tour
please join me in welcoming Chris Hedges
so I'm going to talk about the Christian
right and American militarism and they
are inextricably linked I come out of a
religious tradition my father was a
Presbyterian minister my mother was a
Seminary graduate and a college
professor I graduated from Harvard
Divinity School for the last ten years
I've taught in a prison in New Jersey
where most of my students are Muslim and
was ordained for that work the
ordination sermon was given by America's
greatest contemporary theologian dr.
James cone and Cornel West spoke and we
throughout the Presbyterian hymnals
hired a blues band and invited the
families of all of my students who had
teach in prison it's on YouTube you can
watch it my father was very involved in
the anti-war movement he was a world war
two veteran had been in North Africa and
Palestine and later Iran during world
war two in fact he was a Farsi speaker
very involved in the civil rights
movement we lived in a farm town in
upstate New York where at that time
Martin Luther King and these rural white
enclaves was one of the most hated men
in America and he was very close to the
Catholic Worker movement he was a member
of Concerned clergy and laity started by
Phil and Daniel Berrigan this was the
formation of my understanding of belief
that it was a constant struggle for
justice and that you stood with the
oppressed and that when you truly stood
with you
eventually you would be treated like the
oppressed this is what it meant for me
to have a religious life it was coupled
with the understanding that when you
held fast to that moral imperative the
principalities the powers would always
seek to silence marginalize you and that
if you spoke in the kind of prophetic
voice that Martin Luther King spoke in
or Malcolm X spoke in they would often
kill you
when I was at Harvard my great mentor
was James Luther Adams in 1936 and 37 he
was in Germany during the Nazi rule at
the University of Heidelberg he was in
the lecture hall watching Martin
Heidegger begin his lectures with a Nazi
salute he once told us that if the Nazis
took over America 60% of the Harvard
faculty would willingly begin their
lectures with the Nazi salute and when
we laughed he said no I I watched it
within the universities in Nazi Germany
he dropped out of the university he
joined the underground confessing Church
led by niemoller Bonhoeffer Albert's
fights are in Carl Bart until he himself
was picked up by the Gestapo and
expelled from Germany a year later
during that year he took rolls of home
movie film not only of Germany and the
confessing Church but the so called
German Christian Church which was
pro-nazi and which had a huge following
especially among Protestants and on one
side of the altar was the Christian
cross and on the other side was the Nazi
swastika and that experience in Germany
deeply revolutionized him and
formed his understanding of faith and he
told us this was 1983 that when we were
his age and he was 80 years old at the
time we would all be fighting the
Christian fascists because he understood
that when you dispossessed your working
class when you created economic misery
and stagnation when a cabal seized power
and directed all of the institutions of
government towards the further
consolidation of that power and wealth
eventually you would vomit up figures
and movements that replicated what he
had seen with the breakdown of vimar
Germany I left Harvard Divinity School I
was gone for 20 years overseas on the
outer reaches of Empire I was the Middle
East bureau chief I spent for the New
York Times I spent seven years in the
Middle East and largely divorced from
America and American culture until I
returned and when I returned the
Christian Right in that two decades had
exponentially grown into a powerful and
frightening political movement and so I
set out to write ten years ago a book
called American fascists the Christian
Right and the war on America I was
trying to reach out to them
I went into that investigation and I
heavily report I'm at heart remain a
newspaper reporter
I like reporting I like listening it it
forces me to confront and often
demolishes my own assumptions that I
carry into a project and it's only I
find with that visceral contact that I
begin to understand what cultures and
societies and movements which are
foreign to me are truly about so I went
into my study of the Christian right
with the prejudices of the Christian
left I'm not even sure I would call it
liberal I don't think the berrigan's
were liberal but I think they were an
expression for me of what the Christian
religion at its best is about although I
would say that I have seen in my 20
years abroad out of every culture and
every religion and every ethnicity
magnificent figures rise up to fight the
oppressor on behalf of the oppressed and
for me these are always expressions of
that deep religious impulse that I
admire that understanding that there are
things that do not have a monetary value
but have an intrinsic value a fight and
a protection of the sacred and so in
many ways although I was biblically
literate theologically literate the
movement that I entered was a foreign
entity and I went with a fair amount of
disdain towards this movement and yet
after interview and numerous interviews
dozens of interviews with followers of
this movement I could not walk away on
moved by the tremendous suffering
dislocation and pain that the rupture of
social bonds in American society had
done to these individuals addictions
domestic sexual abuse chronic
underemployment
unemployment jail time their lives had
disintegrated because of this corporate
onslaught because of the corporate coup
d'etat that's taken place within our
culture the seizure of power by a
corporate cabal I was also appalled at
the way the leaders of these
megachurches almost invariably white men
like Donald Trump preyed on the despair
of these people to become incredibly
wealthy and to hold these people in a
system that is probably most accurately
described as a cult I was at a pro-life
weekend in Valley Forge Pennsylvania
with 400 women and the organizers of
this event asked the post abortive
sisters to stand and the room stood and
when I went around and did interviews it
turned out that these women had not had
one abortion but multiple abortions and
what did the Christian Right do they
gave these women dolls and they told
them that these were the children they
had murdered and they were told to name
the dolls and dress the dolls and bathe
the dolls and sleep with the dolls and
at the end of the weekend they had to
hold up those dolls and begged for
forgiveness and pledged to fight
the culture of death which is us it was
the manipulation of their guilt and
their shame and so while I had an
unexpected empathy and compassion for
what these people had suffered I also
understood how dangerous this movement
was one of the fascinating aspects of
that work was that I'm always upfront
about Who I am and where I came from and
what my religious background is and as
soon as they knew that I came out of a
religious background they never wanted
to speak about the Bible with me because
they don't know the Bible any more than
Isis or al-qaeda knows the Quran they
are fed selected bits and slogans they
are selectively literalists and they use
this to feed in ideologies and of course
what the Christian right has done is
sacralized the worst aspects of American
capitalism white supremacy racism and
American imperialism it is a political
movement and if you doubt me go home
tonight if you have a television I don't
and watch an hour of Pat Robertson on
the 700 club or any of these other Chris
quote/unquote Christian networks that's
the reason 81% of evangelicals voted for
Trump and why he has to this day a 75%
approval rating now what this movement
does is is essentially play on that
despair that desperation and petals
magical thinking magic Jesus
I mean the whole idea that Jesus came to
make us rich or shower us with consumer
products is heretical and one of my
frustrations even anger at the liberal
Christian Church is that they have
failed to call these people out for who
they are which is Christian heretics I
was in the Middle East immediately after
9/11 I covered al Qaeda for The New York
Times in the aftermath of the attacks
and I had frequently heard denunciations
which actually were untrue leveled
against Muslim leaders for not
denouncing a crime against humanity that
was carried out on 9/11 in fact and I
was there Muslim leaders throughout the
Middle East announced the crimes of 9/11
but I couldn't help thinking where are
those Christian figures who are
denouncing the Christian heretics the
Christian fascists now I don't use the
word fascist lightly in fact when I
finished the book Bill Moyers tried very
energetically to talk me out of using
that word in the title and I went to two
great scholars of fascism for its stern
who wrote the politics of cultural
despair and fled Nazi Germany when he
was 18 and Robert Paxton who wrote
anatomy of fascism and is the great
scholar on VEISHEA Colombia and I spent
hours with both of them essentially
laying out for them what I had found and
allowing them to try and argue me out of
the using the word fascist all
totalitarian movements as Hannah Aaron
understood embrace magical thinking they
are non reality-based belief movements
and the system of creating
cults within these megachurches the
system of divorcing tens of millions
Americans from the fact-based world the
world the real world the system of
preaching magic set the ground for Trump
and is born out of despair I was in
Detroit with Tim LaHaye who wrote the
endtime series there was a conference on
the end times with all of the fantasies
of the Christian Right peddle about the
end times like the rapture which are not
is not in the Bible and the only word I
could use to describe the mood in that
Hall was exhilaration about the
apocalypse because it was that
fact-based world it was the
reality-based world that almost
destroyed them that was now being
destroyed you cannot argue these people
out of their magical thinking I was in
the creationist Museum in Peterborough
Kentucky it's a huge museum with large
lots for the school buses and they
brought in the people who did the
anatomic the the the models for
Universal Studios so they recreate the
Garden of Eden with a waterfall and Adam
and Eve plastic figures but of course
position so you can't see Eve's breasts
or anything and there's a t-rex in the
Garden of Eden with a saddle on it and
the guide is taking the group around and
explaining that I'm sure you all wonder
why the t-rex has such big teeth it's
because Adam and Eve used the t-rex to
open the coconut
which is funny here but it's not funny
when you're with 50 or 60 people who
believe it I came to the conclusion that
the only way to break the back of that
movement was to reintegrate these people
back into the economy and then the
latest book that I wrote which is about
the pathologies that are rippling across
the United States the opioid addiction
sexual sadism were a pornified culture
suicide gambling I was especially rooted
in the sociologist Emile Durkheim's book
on suicide where he asked the question
what is it that drives individuals and
societies to carry out acts of willful
self annihilation and he said those
individuals and societies that were
rooted in communal structures for whom
the social bonds were not broken who had
the possibility of self actualization
were the least susceptible to suicide
but once those social bonds were broken
once people fell into a position of
stagnation and despair then they began
to carry out pathologies of self
destruction what sociologists call
diseases of despair so that Trump is not
the disease Trump is the symptom of a
decayed society just as I saw in the
former Yugoslavia now the danger of
these Christian fascists is that they
externalize evil anyone who studies
philosophy
or theology or ethics understands as
primo levy wrote that the greatest
struggle within us is to grasp our own
capacity for evil I saw this in war how
the line between the victimizer and the
victim was often razor thin and primo
levy probably articulates this most
eloquently in his essay on the Lodz
ghetto ghetto with Rahm Kowski and that
it is that awareness of our own capacity
for evil that is the best protection
against our participation in projects of
evil but when you externalize evil the
way the Christian Right does or the way
Trump does then evil becomes embodied in
individuals or groups that must be
eradicated a gnome and I have both been
very outspoken against the New Atheists
Sam Harris and the late Christopher
Hitchens I debated Sam Harris at UCLA I
debated Hitchens at Berkeley not an
experience I would wish on anyone in
this room and they our secular
fundamentalists Noam has called them
religious fanatics for the state
religion fundamentalism can come in any
form it could come in secular form it
can come in religious form it can come
through totalitarian ideologies
communism fascism and that's why of
course the there is a convergence of
political beliefs between the quote
unquote
new atheists and the Christian Right the
Christian Right wants to support and
expand our wars in the Middle East to
attack Muslims who they say embrace a
satanic religion and Sam Harris and the
New Atheists want to attack Muslims
because in the name of Western
civilization because they're barbarian
but it's all at its core fundamentalism
and the projection and the sack
realization of military power which is
at the core of the Christian right and
we are watching within the military a
huge expansion of quote/unquote
evangelical or Christian Right preachers
we are watching the ideological void
because Trump has no ideology we are
watching that vacuum being rapidly
filled by these Christian fascists that
is why they pushed so hard to get Kevin
on the bench and the Christian Right
made it very clear to the Trump
administration that he had to be placed
there before the midterms because they
knew that he would revoke Rovi wait so
what how do we respond we are not going
to break this movement which I think has
a huge crossover in terms of the 70
million people who support Trump I think
Trump in many ways embodies the
cult-like
character of the people who run the
Christian Right and I was in a room with
many of these people including James
Dobson who is as evil as he looks we are
going to have to grapple with what
Durkheim calls the enemy
within american society which literally
translated is rule less nests and what
Durkheim understood is that it's when
the rules as they're laid out however
imperfectly within the society no longer
work you work hard you get a good
education you obey the law there is a
place for you and in fact as Matt Taibbi
wrote in his book called divide which is
a study of the legal system for the 1%
for the Wall Street financier and
criminals Goldman Sachs in particular
and what the judicial system does to the
vulnerable and the poor so these people
have an essence organized attacks
boycott and you have poor counties like
st. Louis County which are extracting 30
or 40 percent or depend on 30 40 percent
of their budget by extracting money from
poor people in Ferguson by imposing
ridiculous fines that's how Eric garner
was killed although he was charged with
selling loose cigarettes but he wasn't
and you're fined for having an open
container or not mowing your lawn I'm
not making any of this up or my favorite
is obstructing pedestrian traffic which
means standing too long in a sidewalk
there is nothing now to halt the
corporate disemboweling of the United
States and that disemboweling is
expanding the kind of despair and anomie
that propels people into the arms of
demagogues who peddle magical thinking
and people wonder how can the Christian
Right make an alliance with Trump and I
say you don't understand the Christian
Right
Trump embodies all of the
characteristics of the leaders of the
Christian Right with at least from my
anecdotal observation one exception and
that is the sexual proclivities of the
leaders in the Christian Right or
probably kinkier it's a seamless fit and
it's a dangerous movement and it is
fascist and it is heretical and it needs
to be called out and as Noam has pointed
out we may get rid of Trump but pence
who is a creature of this movement is
even more dangerous and so we must stop
personalizing our problems in the figure
of Trump
however repugnant and vile and vulgar
and imbecilic he is he is a creation of
a failed democracy and we must mobilize
to fight these predatory systems of
corporate power which means sustained
acts of mass civil disobedience
non-cooperation and organization so that
we can pit power against power because
if we do not address the root cause of
our decline which is anime which is the
externalization of evil and the sack
realization of military force then we
will continue on the road to tyranny
thank you
[Applause]
thank you Chris for that story and talk
it's my pleasure to now introduce
professor Noam Chomsky who's laureate
professor of linguistics at the
University of Arizona and professor
emeritus of linguistics at MIT he's a
public intellectual and leading critic
of u.s. foreign policy the mainstream
news media neoliberalism and the Israeli
occupation of the West Bank in Gaza
dr. Chomsky is the author of numerous
works including the fateful triangle the
United States Israel and the
Palestinians manufacturing consent and
Gaza in crisis reflection on Israel's
war against the Palestinians please join
me in welcoming one of the great
geniuses of the 20th and 20th for 21st
century
dr. Noam Chomsky
[Applause]
thank you very much
first comment can you hear me okay if I
get too far from the microphone start
waving your hands that often happens
well as you just heard I wrote a book 35
years ago called fatal triangle the
three and the triangle were of the
United States Israel and the
Palestinians there were others in the
background Saudi Arabia
among them and what I'd like to do now
is say a few words about a different
fateful triangle the United States
Israel and Saudi Arabia with others in
the background and in the background now
or the Palestinians the shift and focus
over 35 years reflects changes in
policies and practices so 35 years ago
the United States was presenting itself
rightly or wrongly as an honest broker
seeking to resolve the israel-palestine
confrontation again whatever the merits
of the claim but no longer the current
u.s. stance is captured succinctly by
two leading specialists on the region
with long government service Robert
Malley and Aaron David Miller and in
their words boiled down to its essence
the administration's message to the
Palestinians is you've lost get over
which is pretty fair enough so let's a
few words to look into the background of
all of this begin with World War two
which led to a radical change in world
order
the United States emerged from the war
and a position of power that had
absolutely no historical precedent the
primary concern in the Middle East of
the United States since World War two
has been to maintain its dominance over
this critical region it's a major center
of the fossil fuel energy production is
also a geostrategic prize and the u.s.
Israel Saudi Alliant triangle which is
now emerging is the centerpiece of this
strategy so Washington is in fact
constructing a reactionary alliance
which includes the most repressive harsh
Arab dictatorships the oil dictatorships
of the Gulf Egypt now under the most
brutal dictatorship of its history they
fall together and Israel is among them
and the goal is to confront the
influence of Iran which is regarded in
the United States as a grave threat
that's unique to the United States the
fact of the matter is that in the world
there's a different country that's
regarded as the greatest threat to peace
we're part of it there was actually one
poll there are international polls every
year that are study world opinion Gallup
Organization major organisation in 2013
for the first time they asked the
question which country is the gravest
threat to world peace the United States
had no competitors way behind and second
place was Pakistan inflated by the
Indians other countries are barely
mentioned
some likely that many people know about
this because that pole wasn't reported
in the United States you could find out
about it elsewhere and also that's the
last time that that question was asked
in the polls you can ask why but in the
United States commonly Iran as the
greatest threat to world peace why well
we can turn to US intelligence they give
the answer regularly
presentations to Congress and so on
quite different from public discourse
since the overthrow of the US backed a
tighter ship in Iran in 1979 Iran has
pursued an independent course and it
poses a deterrent to the free exercise
of force by those who want to rampage in
the region there are two the United
States and its Israeli client that's a
serious threat and in fact that's the
for the public there's a different
rhetorical stance of course confronting
as Iranian terror and aggression but US
intelligence is very much on target
actually the government of Iran is a
threat to its own population but beyond
that the threat is the threat of
deterrence to those who want to be free
to use force without constraints in this
respect US intelligence is much more
accurate than the public discourse well
in this emerging system Palestinians are
simply a nuisance it kind of like Native
Americans to whom they're often compared
in fact their fate some analogies thanks
in no small part to massive US support
over many years in Gaza
two million people survived barely
survived half of them children the
territory will very soon be literally
uninhabitable according to international
monitors UN and others this is after
years of brutal siege regular
destructive assault and carefully
administered diet as it's called
officially by the occupiers the diet is
designed to keep people barely alive
because it doesn't look good if 2
million people die but barely but to
survive this 5 barely beyond that there
has been one so called lifeline for
Palestinians namely the relief agency
the international relief agency Unruh
Trump has responded to this by cutting
the lifeline that's the way to deal with
the impending catastrophe no more
funding for the relief agency and Trump
was kind enough to announce his reasons
what he said is Palestinians show no
appreciation of respect for him as he
offers them what he calls his ultimate
deal which in fact ends all hopes for
minimal rights
well handing Jerusalem over to Israel
actually it's greatly expanded vastly
expanded Greater Jerusalem about five
times as large as Jerusalem ever was
including Palestinian villages in the
surrounding area and as a special
gesture of contempt he accompanied this
by cutting funding for Palestinian
hospitals in East Jerusalem
well--that's Gaza that's how you teach
them to show respect for their torturer
turn to Lebanon and the miserable
Shatila refugee camp and Beirut Shatila
still reeking of the Israeli coordinated
slaughter that culminated its murderous
1982 invasion happened to be the
occasion for the book faithful triangle
that I heard 35 years ago in Shatila
where I've been children play in the mud
in dark alleys where they're gonna spend
the rest of their lives as will their
children visitors are invited to the
small rooms where the families try to
survive are shown their major treasure
the key to the home and Galilee where
from which they were expelled during the
knock I've seen many scenes of misery
and terror around the world not like
Criss I've seen far more but enough
however I've seen very few that evoke
such pathos these little children
playing in the mud and the dark alleys
with that being their fate forever they
did have one ray of light of the Unruh
school unruhe funded school in the slum
that's now extinguished thanks to the
leader of the free world and thanks to
our silence about it
Turing of the West Bank Israel is
pursuing the systematic policy in which
it's been engaged since 1967 and shortly
after the 1967 war the program of
creating a greater Israel that will take
over everything of value in the West
Bank and effectively incorporated in
to Israel with vast settlement and
infrastructure projects it's kind of de
facto annexation which will sooner or
later turn into the jury annexation all
of this is illegal has been determined
by every relevant high authority but
laws are for the weak if power is not
confronted that's our task well as in
neo colonies generally Palestinian
elites are offered refuge they can enjoy
a western-style of life in Ramallah
well I'm now quoting 90% of the
population of the West Bank live in a
hundred and sixty five separate islands
ostensibly under the control of the
Palestinian Authority but actual Israeli
control that's Nathan thrall who's the
senior Middle East analyst for the
International Crisis group's final
occupied area the Syrian Golan Heights
which Israel annexed in violation of
security counter council orders that's
been forgotten along with its
inhabitants most of whom were expelled
the Syrian Golan Heights I should say
well these policies have been pursued
systematically by all governments in
Israel what are called left-right
including the moderate those government
of Shimon Paris for example former
president considered a leading peace
activist
he's the one who happened to have
initiated settlement deep inside the
West Bank they've all relied crucially
on the enormous economic military and
diplomatic support of the United States
and one might say
it's to Trump's credit that with the
vulgarity that he's mastered that at
least he has exposed what has been the
essence of US policy for many decades
now I don't mean suggest that the
Palestinian cause is lost in fact quite
the contrary but the picture today is
pretty grim can be changed this u.s.
Israel Saudi triangle is it's not
actually new Saudi Arabia has been the
closest ally of the United States in the
region since the discovery of the
incomparable oil reserves there back in
the 1930s during World War two that was
actually a kind of a mini war going on
between Britain and the United States as
to who was going to take over this
extraordinarily valuable prize the
united's our relations dictated the
outcome of the United States
replaced Britain and in the following
years it gradually displaced Britain
which had been the former hegemonic
power and the u.s. took that over
Britain became a kind of client state in
1948 Israel won its independence this as
you know was accompanied by the
expulsion or flight and terror of the
vast majority the digitus population and
that impressed a number of people
including the US military the Joint
Chiefs of Staff were impressed by Israel
the success of Israeli organized
violence and concluded that back in 48
Israel is the second major military
power in the Middle East second after
turkey and that it could become a solid
base
for a projection of us power well took
some time for this to become realized
but the Alliance was formed really took
shape in the current farm in 1967 in
1967 Israel performed a major service
for the United States and Saudi Arabia
namely it destroyed their main enemy of
the main center of secular Arab
nationalism and it's worth noting that
very much like Britain before it the
United States has overwhelmingly tended
to support radical Islam against secular
nationalism which is considered a much
more dangerous force well since that
time the us-saudi Alliance has the u.s.
Israel alliances will they've solidified
in numerous ways theoretically Israel
and the Arab oil dictatorships have been
at war but informal relations have
developed over the years and under Trump
there are no longer concealed this is an
open alliance of reactionary States well
turning Saudi Arabia of course is the
center of radical Islam also a
missionary missing missionary states its
devoted to spreading its version of
extremist Islam throughout the Arab
world mosques madrasas Quranic schools
and so on which happened to be the main
ideological source of what we call
Islamic terrorism turning to the other
two legs of the triangle United States
and Israel there are some interesting
similarities namely in the rise
radical religious right-wing nationalism
it's actually studied in an interesting
study that came out in Israel quite
recently as a report of it you can read
it in Israel's leading journal arts and
it shows that the United States and
Israel are remarkably similar to Saudi
Arabia in certain ways namely in right
wing religious extremism study fund that
study is actually studying the US and
Israel and Saudi Arabia takes for
granted and it finds striking parallels
between the US and Israel in religious
extremism right-wing religious extremism
a differing from the rest of the West
and let me just quote its main
conclusions Israel Israelis and
Americans lead the West in their belief
in a right wing version of God a factor
that can help explain their unique
relationship and shared animosity
towards secularizing Europe in Israel
80% of the dominant right wing north
religious right wing regard Jews as the
chosen people with a god-given right
actually that's 60 percent of the whole
country eighty percent of the religious
right God given chosen people god-given
right to the country that's a view
shared by us evangelicals who form a as
chris mentioned the substantial popular
base for the republican party and by now
the main center of support for israel in
the united states used to be liberal
democrats but that's shifting going on
with a quote from orit's
it's hard to escape the conclusion that
religion in this particular version has
assumed the more pivotal voll role than
ever in the special relation
ship between the US and Israel here's
another backdrop to the rapidly warming
relations between Israel and Eastern
European countries in which religious
religion again right-wing religion plays
a central role usually in tandem with
nationalism and ethnocentrism and the
tense political relations between both
Israel and the European Union and
recently between the European Union and
Washington can also be delineated by
religious beliefs Israelis and Americans
view Europe as godless and decadent but
for the European Union Israel and the
United States are drifting into
fundamental fundamentalist crazy land
that's hearts so the us-israeli Saudi
triangle the Alliance has cultural
foundations alongside the dominant
geopolitical and economic concerns which
go far back well in Israel this is an
increasing tendency in recent years
there is one difference between the
United States and Israel in that respect
in Israel it's the younger generation
that's increasingly drawn to a religious
extremism which is not true in the
United States actually these tendencies
were predicted long ago they're right at
the outset of the occupation in 1967 by
a number of astute Israeli observers
most notably most famously the respected
Israeli sage Yasha oh sure
he understood and warned
a shift of the far-right is a rather
natural outgrowth of the colonization
project just as doctrines of white
supremacy or a very natural outgrowth of
slavery and extermination or dispersal
of the native population when you have
your jackboot on somebody's neck it's
not very good for the psyche labor
that's in fact predicted back in 1969
that as long as the occupant as the
occupation continued Israelis would
become what he called Judea Nazis some
somebody other than labor hoods couldn't
have gotten away with that phrase but he
was so respected that he could well
about 90 years ago from Mussolini's
prison cells Antonio Gramsci described
the roots of the emerging fascist crisis
of the day and as he put it the crisis
is that the old is dying and the new
cannot be born and in this interim a
great variety of more bird morbid
symptoms appear well today is not the
90s not the 30s but as Marc crane once
observed history doesn't repeat but it
does often rhyme these are insights that
merit some thought and concerted action
[Applause]
thank you for professor Chomsky it's now
my pleasure to introduce another giant
intellectual dr. Khalid Abu el fadela
he's one of the world's leading
authorities on Sharia Islamic law and
Islam a prominent scholar in the field
of human rights and one of the world's
leading critics of the Saudi royal
family and Wahhabism his professor of
law at UCLA and founder of the asougi
Institute he is the author of numerous
works including the great theft
wrestling Islam from the extremists the
search for beauty in Islam and reasoning
with God reclaiming Sharia in the modern
age please join me in welcoming dr.
Khalid Abu
[Applause]
thank you very much one hardly knows
where to start what I thought of they
are the most iconic moments that I'm
actually sad to say that I I rather
predicted in probably an undirected God
knows the soldiers an iconic moment in
which your representative of the Israeli
military the IDF delivers a message in
Arabic to Muslims and in this message
the IDF's representives reminds Muslims
the mohammed bin abdul wahhab is a great
reformer and a great theologian and
quotes mohammed bin abdul wahhab he
thinks he accurately quotes a bit a mere
but she doesn't manage that but he does
accurately quote Muhammad Abdul Wahab
calling him the great reformer of Islam
this just happened about a year ago or
even less now it's an iconic moment
because you can all the the the
deceptions are removed all the
camouflage is removed and you can see
the natural and even umbilical
relationship between the outlook of
Zionists and the outlook of waha bees
internally the way Wahabis see the
Muslim world see themselves the truth of
the matter is is that mohab ism has and
in this my way it's rooted in its very
origins has a part of its theology known
as in well bara or the theology of pure
monotheism in
you reject any fertility or any loyalty
to anything but and an Islamic ideology
and so on the one hand you have that but
the other hand it is coupled with a
focus nearly obsessive focus on
ritualism and opposition to ethical
rational thought and human autonomy and
even human creativity and inspiration at
the social level and i underscore at the
social level at the political level
what mojave theology adopts an absolute
pragmatism and realism in which this
theology teaches Zi and whanau al bara
or this strict monotheistic loyalty
cannot be applied critically to the
ruler so on the one hand it has this
sort of revolutionary activists
component in which you are supposed to
denounce any loyalties to anything and
anyone but Muslims who follow the true
Creed on the other hand there is an
obsessive focus on ritualism and a a
doctrine of absolute obedience to the
ruler the in hobbies in the case of
Wahhabism of course it's a Saudi
monarchy and it had never resolved this
tension within Wahhabi theology and on
the one hand you can easily co-opt this
theology into a doctrine of open warfare
and open jihad if you will against not
just heretical Muslims but all Muslims
are all non-muslims Christian Jews at
satsang but on the other hand
is a remarkable emphasis an obsessive
influence on the ruler cannot be
questioned and criticized or criticized
so I'll even give you just so you get a
I'm shooting with the Muslims in this in
this room you probably know what I'm
talking about immediately but to give
you insight into the world people like
me live in since the keshavjee thing
very famous or hobby clergy like siddhis
and his IP these are people who are
recognized all over the Muslim world as
theologians with a substantial amount of
authority in the case of surveys he is
actually the formal official Imam of
Mecca he leads prayer and macabre in
Mecca is a drama baba in friday
congregation prayer they all appeared
recently on various media sites
including Saudi funded television
reminding Muslims that it is a grave sin
not just a great sin to criticize the
ruler but a grave sin to think ill of
the ruler whatever the ruler tells you
you must accept as an Islamic obligation
they even went a step further and said
that the only possible way that you can
interact in or holdin a ruler
accountable rather is that you counsel
the ruler privately now what if of
course if you try to get an appointment
with some man or his grandparents to
counsel him privately good luck so what
do you do if you can't meet with some
man or the Crown Prince counseled them
privately
well say fee and
city s and a whole host of them had an
ready answer to that he said well you
talk to a trusted Imam like themselves
and trust them to communicate the
message to the ruler but your job as a
Muslim is absolute unquestioning
obedience now I'm not gonna bore you
with the theological juristic debates
about this this is sort of a the bread
and butter of what I live with all the
time but this brings why the this brings
us to a sort of the heart of the matter
the big question why were all the
camouflages stripped why was it at this
point in history that the Saudis decided
that they will no longer go with the
pretense of caring about the
Palestinians they will no longer go with
the pretense of not having sold the
Palestine and Jerusalem decades ago why
is it that they felt desperate enough to
lay naked deeply the entire dynamic and
entire relationship towards our colonial
power and their disdain towards their if
their own native culture and the center
of the exploration in my view is quite
simple the Saudis and the Emiratis
especially the Saudis and the Emiratis
saw the Arab Spring remember that the
Arab Spring you had masses of people
saying hurray Sharia direct my freedom
dread and justice and
since the Iranian Revolution there has
been an obsession with something akin to
the Iranian Revolution taking place
anywhere in the Arab world or the Muslim
world for that matter and Arab streamed
terrified Al Saud and the rulers of Abu
Dhabi and Dubai leave I mean far more
than even the king of Jordan or the
Moroccan King far more than the natural
tension between the monarchy and any
revolution as we remember from British
and French history the way Britain
reacted to the French Revolution and so
on
far more than that to have a Muslim ego
that is unbroken and unsub gated and
uncomplete
is unacceptable to the monarchies that
have for decades monopolized the
resources and finances of the richest
countries in the Muslim world to have
anything akin to these cores freedom
justice and bread remember Saudi Arabia
has a very high unemployment rate and
has a serious problem with poverty if
you go to Saudi Arabia
you will meet tons of people who are
homeless who literally eat from the
garbage at the same time that they will
waste billions I mean there is a video
on YouTube you couldn't fish out where
Crown Prince Salman gives his mistress a
gift of two million two million dollars
and someone took a undercover film of
the whole gifting process and it's you
can find it on the net like you could
find a lot of other stuff it mean a
ruling family and theology
exploited and wasted the natural
resources and the human potential and
energy of the of its own native
population when Mohabbatein arose early
on and II in in the 17th century what
was embedded in what the hobby movement
itself and I wrote all of this material
in the 90s at a time that no one talked
about Wahhabis and I'm sad to have lived
long enough to see everything that I
feared actually materialized Wow he's
saw themselves as returned to a pristine
and pure Islam but they were thoroughly
permeated with a attitude of absolute
inferiority as an ethnic and nativist
and racial group towards their
colonizers that seemed race or ethnic
paradigm permeates everything else our
wood and Emiratis who by the way are in
write English and speak English much
better than we can write or speak Arabic
especially classical Arabic they were
educated in Western institutions in the
best British institutions that trained
royalty their culture is a fairly
westernized colonial culture rather than
anything that emerges from the native
roots of the Islamic civilization itself
and as such the always saw the white
colonizer as naturally superior and saw
their own people with a prism of
inferiority and absolute lack of
confidence and ego the only thing they
want from their own people is to shut
that's the only thing they expect from
Muslims shut the hell up and do what
you're told the entire Hazuki affair is
a really good example on the one hand
like all of you your heart is broken for
her sake
on the other hand the sense of
degradation and absolute humiliation as
you see all the media that is not
friendly and I emphasize not friendly to
Saudi Arabia all they care about all
they care about is what the West thought
of the murder of Egyptian what matters
is whether Americans or Europeans are
going to make it an issue or not make it
an issue no one cares about what Muslims
think we even our most enlightened
intellectuals have ingrained in them the
racist attitude the a Muslim by
definition is exotic and foreign an
alien the Wahabis play amazingly well
I'll give you another wonderful example
for years this is from the time that I
came to the United States early eighties
thanks to a heavy influence as a jurist
I got sick and tired of listening and
responding to Muslims that come and say
brother listening to music is Haram you
cannot listen to music you cannot have
this you cannot have that ad nauseam now
let me tell you this position this
Wahhabi position was maintained for
decades decades listening to music is
Haram leave alone singing or rapping
that's you know
now you've got a one-way speed ticket to
hell right lo and behold sent man
decides that music is no longer Haram
and has a fee and others like and
machete who are famous chronicler situs
by the way they recite the Quran and I
don't like the recitation of the Quran
because my ear is used to talk system I
don't like Saudi recitals of the Quran
those reciters of the Quran sing songs
praising Sandman and the crown prince
and exalting the verses of Saudi they
turned from chronic reciters sworn I
have a volume this big about 12 volumes
of the Fatah WA the responsa telling me
that all music is Haram all dancing is
Haram everything is Haram Haram Haram
and an instant like that in an instant
overnight not only is it not Haram
anymore but they're actually performing
songs writing songs and writing music
and performing yeah is Wahhabism for
muslims the danger of Wahhabism is not
because they're going to commit
terrorist attacks terrorism has a whole
ideological menials
that you can find rooted in the nearest
movement in Russia in the early russian
terror campaigns and the early
terrorists in france that belong to the
anarchist movement and and so on so
forth a lot of these thrilled in the
ideologies of those who blow themselves
up and revel in the orgy of violence and
blood goes back to the french an artist
and the National Russian anarchist and
of imagery that they created but the
risk of Wahhabism for Muslims is that it
suffocates the hell out of us and it
makes us is subjugated racially inferior
people no one gives a what a Muslim
says or feels as the Hajji think was
going on I have been keeping track of
assassinations of a journalist in Jordan
the disappearance of people famous
writer who is a good friend of mine and
economists disappeared in Egypt and even
because of a dispute with and one of my
Egyptian singers in the modern age suck
overall you know there is one possible
exception what was her name again
no no I'm Casull she's God no no no
stuff for Allah how can you say that you
can never die no I'm consumers the class
herself yeah I'm a man no I'm talking
about not even ten percent of workers on
consumer woman called a man my hair who
at least was not trash okay any of you
listen to show of hands
okay which is not trash because of a
dispute with a Saudi prince the Egyptian
government bans the music of a man
matter simply be she supposedly married
a Saudi prince of secret secret marriage
he beat her up in the street in front of
Egyptian guards when she filed a
complaint against them the Egyptian
government responded by banning the
music of America and the appearance of a
man man in any media outlet and then a
student of mine and a friend just told
me that in fact she is disappeared in
Egypt this is the life this is the logic
that Wahhabism and Saudi Arabia
rings to Muslims all over shut the hell
up and do what you're told I will tell
you to me I understand the Treaty of
Westphalia and Vienna conventions and
all that stuff about the sanctity of
consulates and embassies something that
but at the same time that we are
outraged at the torture and murder of
Hisashi who by the way think about it
was light-skinned did it look like an
Arab and wrote in The Washington Post if
he did not write in The Washington Post
and he did not have the skin he did he
would be like many of my friends that
were killed or disappeared and no one
cares at the sign that hisagi is killed
15 million people in Yemen are dying
Sisi murdered five thousand people in
rabaa and no one cares
a bomb is dropped on Muslims somewhere
around the world every 10 to 15 minutes
and no one cares as a Muslim and I'll
tell you my stories were Saudi Arabia
since I promised my wife I would share
it they tried to kill me three times
once with a bullet once with a bomb and
the once with a pin was a poison pill
that was stuck in the back of my neck I
assure you and mark my words if Salman
comes out of this thanks to trump and
Christian nationalism and Jewish
nationalism and thanks to the fact
remember that in the same way the IDF
had a spokesman praised muhammad bin
abdul wahab as a true reformer of Islam
Israel made clear in the current events
that they trust
hobbies and they don't trust the Turks
and they made very clear and continue to
make clear right now that if you want to
favor with Israel then support the crown
prince who's going to accept the deal of
the century the dealer the Sentry which
ends the Palestinian issue forever gives
Jerusalem to the Israelis a footnote did
you know that the Emiratis have been
buying up property all over Jerusalem
and selling it to Jewish settlers did
you know that why are they doing that
I'll tell you because they want to end
the whole issue of Jerusalem do you want
to end the ghost the threatening phantom
of political Islam or the Islamist which
basically translates for the one thing
that they are scared of is an Islam that
accepts and adapts itself to a democracy
that's the real threat that's why they
tried to kill me and killed cuts ugly
and will kill many others and as the
crown prince said man survives because I
do think he will survive mark my words
he will come after the rest of us and
meaning rest of us Muslims with a
vengeance I promised my wife that I
would stand here and say if I disappear
all of you know who did it and or if you
find me dead and they say he killed
himself I have no intention of killing
myself this is the gripping fear and the
object racism that we live with as
Muslims you look into the eyes of any
Muslim who has not joined the terrorist
organization you will find them broken
broken as a human being
thanks to hobby theology and thanks for
the death
the dream of democracy and thanks for
the deaths of the call of Egyptians
Syrians Yemenis Libyans Bahrain ease who
said freedom bread and social justice
and the so called protectors of
democracy in the West didn't give a
thank you very much
[Applause]
thank you doctor up who a father I'd
like to begin by asking each of you a
question and and first - - Chris can you
speak about the significance of Trump
moving the American Embassy to Jerusalem
in Israel and Palestine what is the
significance to the Christian Right and
to Christian Zionists in the United
States how's that okay so it's a huge
issue for Christian right because of
their bizarre apocalyptic theological
view that the end times will occur which
is located according to them and Israel
of course advances the Zionist agenda
which is now fused with the Christian
right and it is just one more blow
towards Palestinian rights of course
it's illegal under international law to
in any way bolster the Israeli
occupation but I mean I think you're
right that the the kind of benefit if
there is a benefit to Trump is that he's
lift the veil Barack Obama did nothing
for the Palestinians in no way advanced
the peace process which was always a
joke in fact of course settlements were
expanded in the West Bank more and more
territory was seized in East Jerusalem
and I think it's part of this long
campus kind of slow-motion ethnic
cleansing that has been in place since
1948 and is now accelerating to keep
Palestinians trapped in ghettos or Bantu
stands where they struggle had such a
basic subsistence level in the eyes of
the Israelis that all of their energy
goes into finding enough to eat and
clean water of which there is almost
none in Gaza thank you and don't mind
like to ask you another question that we
discussed earlier recently you said on
Democracy Now that Israeli intervention
in u.s. elections of vastly overwhelms
anything the Russians may have done can
you accelerate on that how is it that
both Israelis themselves and the Israeli
Lobby in the u.s. functions it's kind of
mind-boggling so you may recall that the
Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin
Netanyahu showed up at the invitation of
deliver an address to the joint session
of Congress without notifying which he
condemned he used his address to condemn
Obama's policies initiated the
negotiations joint program
a nuclear deal and this is an a summit
Netanyahu wants the u.s. to support an
attack on Iran so here's a prime
minister of another country showing up
in Congress ignoring completely ignoring
the state executive the White House
telling them we've got a you you guys
have got to completely reverse his
policy it's impossible to think of a
form of intervention the legislative
process that exceeds this is only a very
small part a cat the main funders
ultra-right a supporter of the
ultra-right Israeli the Democratic huge
another huge supporter you look through
the rest of the donors basically
agencies the Israeli government which
are constantly twisting the arms of
people in Congress so far beyond
anything that is attributed to the
Russians that and I should say that come
when we're considering the intervention
and our pristine democratic process it's
worth bearing in mind that even the
Israeli intervention which is far beyond
any other country is miniscule as
compared with the corruption of the
political process by simply funding
candidates this is not just since
citizens united that opened the faucet a
little wider but it goes back over a
century
you go back to 1895 it was a great
famous campaign manager was asked once
what are the important things the first
thing is money political science which
shows that you can literally predict the
outcome of an election with remarkable
precision
simply by looking at the one variable
that's president done for Congress and
it runs through the to 2016 campaign
incidentally and that's just a small
part of it since electability depends on
campaign funding that means your
congressional representative once he or
she is elected the first task is to get
funding for the next election that means
well what happens to the legislative
process
well corporate lobbies are invited to
talk to the staff congressional staff
and instruct them about what the
legislation oughta be and this reaches
the point where they actually write the
legislation they're written by this is
one reason why other work demonstrates
that about first about 70% of the voting
population on the income scale are
completely disenfranchised literally in
the sense that their own representatives
pay absolutely no attention to their
opinions they were listening to the
donor clips you know talking about
interference in the elections in a
system like this is kind of ludicrous in
the first place but if we want to talk
about farm interference there's nothing
remotely Thank You dr. Okoye thought I'd
like you to speak about the we hear a
lot less about the the Saudi Lobby in
the US but we know that it's present
anyone who's been in academia knows how
difficult it is to write a critique of
Saudi Arabia in the United States
because of the endowed chairs that the
Saudi government supports here you're
one of maybe a handful of scholars who
have written anything we also see in
Mohammed bin Salman recent PR tour of
the US this this sort of close
relationship with with government
Washington DC media Silicon Valley can
you speak to how the Saudi alliance
functions in the US I mean there's one
level where there are the actual
professional lobbyists Saudi Arabia
spends billions of dollars under
Emirates and actually now Qatar has as
well on lobbyists they're about 100
lobbyists registered as lobbying on
behalf of the Saudi government right now
and that's public information but the
other level we cannot ignore the fact
that the the Saudi royalty is also have
the title of the guardians of the holy
sites Mecca and Medina and they
that's a very powerful moral position
that you can leverage and they do
leverage now that coupled with the
venues for funding through Saudi Arabia
don't necessarily through go through the
government directly in other words if
you are starting some type of
organization or opening up an Islamic
Center or whatever in the u.s. usually
your best financers your best sources of
raising funds will be people from Saudi
Arabia that are donating money with the
approval of the government but it's not
officially coming from the government
it's the would not dare donate to
anything that the government doesn't
approve of but at the same time the
money is not real leveraged directly up
until 9/11 very few Muslims dared say
anything critical about the Saudi ruling
family because simply of ostracism if
not direct violence it was a very open
secret that the Saudis had funded
numerous institution muslim institutions
and the West's and these institutions
were not going to give you a platform if
you will be critical of Saudi Arabia
that type of that was broken a bit the
the shield that against criticism
constructed by Saudi Arabia was was
cracked a bit after 9/11 where through
critiques of lob ISM people started
accepting critiques against Saudi Arabia
what in the past five years there has
been a very aggressive thrust by Saudi
Arabia to restore that sense of
what is the word I'm looking for
Hilo around the Saudi ruling family so
that people would feel that if they
critique the Saudi royal family that
they're also critiquing the guardian of
the holy sites and they're critiquing
their if not committing a major sin then
on risking falling into some major sin I
mean so this and in his last call came
right out and said called
the crown prince divinely inspired that
and even said that the crown prince he
quoted the Prophet the the report
attributed to the Prophet that God sends
a reformer to rejuvenate the Islamic
faith every hundred years and he said
well that's the Crown Prince Sandman
so we should all celebrate the the
savior of the Islamic face for the
century has been revealed you know that
position towards the holy sites plus the
finances gives him an amazing amount of
influence what has materialized in the
past since country in the past five
years specially is the threat of
physical violence and abductions with
which I believe that the Emiratis and
the Saudis have become far more vulgar
about and of course the election of
Trump has given them a sense of immunity
and that's for is also of us who live in
this world is quite frightened Chris I'd
like to ask you to speak about
nationalism we've discussed tonight
religious nationalism but you've alluded
to the dangers of secular nationalism
and what might be called secular
fundamentalism how is this Wed so
closely to war in our society and how
can we essentially not allow those
in this country or any other country to
define what it means to be an American
well nationalism is a disease because
the flipside of nationalism is always
racism I was in New York for the attacks
on 9/11 and like other reporters from
the New York Times I stuff notebooks in
my pocket walk down the West Side
Highway I was almost there when building
seven collapsed and my son who was 10 at
the time asked what's the difference
between the people in their cars who
have the big American flags and the
people waving the small flags and I said
well the people waving the big American
flags are the really big assholes
the tragedy of 9/11 is that and I was in
the Middle East almost immediately
afterwards where the huge majority of
Muslims were palled at what had been
done in the name of their religion and
if we had not drunk deep of that dark
elixir of nationalism if we had had the
courage to be vulnerable if we had
understood that the only way to defeat
terrorism is to isolate terrorists
within their own society we would be far
safer and secure than we are today but
we reacted in a mirror image of al-qaeda
and began dropping iron fragmentation
bombs all over the Middle East and
nationalism as Dany Lokesh the great
Serbian writer said is always espoused
and promoted by ignoramus
people who are culturally linguistically
and historically illiterate who see the
world solely through the eyes of the
nationalists and therefore see everyone
outside of their nationalist circle as
nationalists like them and it's no great
surprise to anyone in this room that we
have been the most effective recruiter
for radical jihadists throughout the
Middle East we have created one failed
state after another we've uh turley up
ended in 17 years of war the very go
rules that we purported to embrace to
justify the invasions of Iraq and
Afghanistan in Syria we flooded the
place with weapons and then started
bombing the people we gave the weapons
to in essence acting as Hezbollah's Air
Force since Hezbollah was fighting with
Assad Iraq as a unified country is never
coming back Libya is a failed state and
we are just pushing outwards with no
understanding or even questioning of
what our goals are and so nationalism
and we have unfortunately a president
who has just declared himself a
nationalist he's not particularly
sentient about many things but he
certainly understands what using that
word means and it is a signal to his
rabid neo-fascist base so yeah
nationalism is and I watched it in war
after war it's it's a deep disease and
and it it always entails the elevation
of us and the denigration of everyone
else professor Chomsky you've been a
leading critic of u.s. imperial wars in
Vietnam Iraq Afghanistan and you've also
spoken about how many Americans when
asked you know how many people died in
the war in Vietnam I think answered
200,000 and you said it's actually
closer to three to four million and and
compared this to a denial of the
Holocaust and yet since the first Iraq
war through the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan and the sanctions it's
estimated that about six million Muslims
have died
in the Middle East through u.s. bombing
campaigns what does that tell us and how
do we steer this country in another
direction away from violence well I
think the just the main study of
estimates of Vietnamese dead was a
hundred thousand and that was in a
university setting which is what you'd
get if you ask this question across the
country but that was hundred thousand
which is a tiny fraction of during the
war itself that was probably close to
four million and many are continuing to
die from the effects of chemical warfare
so it's it is very much like in Germany
at an elite University people were asked
how many Jews say a hundred thousand you
think there's a problem in Germany a
cultural social educational problem
that's something that we have to face
going back to the very entropy there was
a sanctions
you mentioned the sanctions this is
before the war this is under Clinton not
Bush under Clinton there was a sanctions
program administered by the UN but of
course it was a u.s. program there were
two there were the administrators of the
program
distinguished international diplomats
the first one resigned in protest
because he described the the sanctions
as genocide 'el he didn't want to be
part of it the second one hunts fun
spawning also a distinguished
international diplomat who both had
detailed information about what was
happening in Iraq that investigators all
over the place they certainly knew more
about Iraq than the CIA but probably had
the best information about any
Westerners they were fun sponeck also
was completely appalled after a few
years resigned in protest charged that
they were Jenna Seidel and went on to
write a book an important book called a
different form of war you probably
haven't read the book or heard about it
and one of the reasons is it wasn't
mentioned in the United States the
reviews no commentary scholarship
doesn't refer to it
it's a detailed examination very close
examination of the way the sanctions
were carrying out we're destroying the
society carrying out what he called
genocide killing hundreds of thousands
of people and furthermore strengthening
the tire people were compelled to rely
on Saddam's fairly efficient rationing
system simply to survive it's very
likely that this save Saddam from being
overthrown from within which has
happened to dictators over and over
Somoza
Marco's do
Ceausescu you know one after another has
been overthrown by popular movements
within even though they were brutal and
harsh dictators might very well have
been the fate of Saddam but he was
strengthened by the sanctions which were
carrying out virtual genocide and fun
spontex words against the population the
population was forced that was decimated
and forced to simply rely on well that's
a particular form of the horrifying case
of the estimate of the toll that are you
can add this case after case just take a
look at the days of newspapers huge
uproar about a what's called a caravan
of people from Central America coming to
the United States according to our
leader an invasion of the country
sending a thousand troops down there
about one soldier for every child in the
caravan who are these people these are
people from fleeing from regions that we
destroyed the Reagan's wars in Central
America were vicious brutal the hundreds
of thousands of people killed the masses
tortured widows orphans every form of
atrocity think of the Trump in fact is
imitating his hero you may recall that
in 1985
Ronald Reagan strapped on his cowboy
boots and declared a national emergency
because the Nicaraguan army was two days
march from Harling in Texas just about
to overwhelm us and the country was
terrified just as many people are
terrified now this for whatever reason
is probably the most frightened country
in the world it doesn't take much for
the most ridiculous claim to be made and
this is a case where people are not just
playing but fleeing forward recreated
it's not just reagan's wars which were
bad enough and most of them are coming
from Honduras it's been a pretty awful
state for many years because of long
term u.s. domination but something
happened in 2009 there was a mildly
reformist president Zelaya
was kicked out in a military coup he's
condemned all over Latin America most of
the world with one notable exception of
the Obama administration would not call
it a military coup for a very simple
reason if you call it a military coup
you're forced by congressional
legislation to terminate military aid to
the military that's ruling it so they're
very quickly turned into a real world of
American States American countries again
one exception it was praised by the
United States as a move towards
democracy that just increased the
end-result people sleep well and
therefore we cringe in terror because
we're being invaded by these miserable
families fleeing from thank you my last
question is for you doctor there seems
to be a contradiction with this alliance
many contradictions actually but one of
them is that each of these extremist
groups persecute any group that is
different from them people of other
denominations within the faith people of
other faiths secularists women and so
and other other nations that their war
with yet they're allied together how can
we express solidarity across the
religious divide at a grassroots level
and also among people of goodwill who
may you know may be agnostics or
atheists how can we express solidarity
with the peoples of saudi of yemen of
palestine and and voices for peace in
israel and the united states so that we
can work together you know under before
adversarial solidarity you pointed
something that is really important and
that's that the role of the pathology of
hate in settler nationalism and also in
the type of theological paradigm that
has predominated in Wahhabism and and
the irony is that it's a sorry
while hobbies introduced a theology that
undermined and systematically uprooted
centuries-old theological doctrines of
pluralism and Co Islamic or coexistence
within an Islamic umbrella and that's
sort of the the fascinating thing is
that the Mojave is and also found dead
bodies in Islamophobes because it's
aslam affirms presented and the type of
Islamic history that an Islamic history
of intolerance and dogmatism that they
actually found quite appealing for very
different purposes I you know of course
I came in with it was a lecture that I
completely scratched and used none of
because I said to Chris and Chomsky and
then I thought you know I'll trash the
lecture but I want to read you one quote
that it's it's rather this is from a
British fellow called Palgrave sorry
this is Philby phobia was a British
agent that played a very important role
in the birth of Saudi Arabia at one
point he supposedly converts to Islam
but even as a even when after he
reportedly conversed aslam he he
continued to have a remarkable racist
disdain towards Muslims he has a
wonderful quote describing sort of the
the nature of wahhabis of course what
she actually liked here's a quote the
most compromising characteristics of the
Wahhabis which again i remind everyone
he actually liked the most remarkable
characteristics of no hobbies their
uncompromising hatred of their Muslim
neighbors the Shia are frankly condemned
as infidels and policies but it is for
the Orthodox congregation of the four
Sunni churches Turks Egyptians Hijazi
Syrians Mesopotamians Indians and the
like that the Wahhabis reserved under
their undiluted venom of their hatred
this was written in the late 18-hundreds
early 1900 or remember exactly
that's that see a logical Paragon never
departed from autism it and it it is a
wonderful gift to the elite that
monopolizes power because if you can
demonize everyone else's chris said
externalized evil as belonging and
everyone else and then you can whoever
stands with our monopoly of power can be
the wonderful epitome of goodness it
lends itself to you to colonialism to
ratio them to capitalism to elitism to
consumerism in in a fascinating and
endlessly fascinating way if it didn't
have such tragic consequences I would
write poetry about it so fascinating I
don't know how you express solidarity I
know one thing that definitely breaks
the back of every Muslim who tries to
stand up and take a position and do as
the Quran says justify and justice even
if it's against your own self and your
loved ones and your family and that is
when you find non Muslims endorsing
either explicitly or implicitly
Islamophobes like that
supposedly bro follow you mentioned them
in your talk to us know today was a TV
show
Bill Maher yeah it breaks your back and
so if you want to express solidarity
with Muslims think about how you can
resist Islamophobes and condemned the
ratio so for what it is I'm a strong
supporter of the BDS but I don't see any
other mechanisms the Israelis are
terrified of it obviously it's had far
more currency in Europe than it is here
but I'm also a strong supporter of a BDS
movement for Saudi Arabia
[Music]
[Applause]
I think that there have been legitimate
critics of those of us who support BDS
who have asked that question well if you
promote BDS for Israel
what about Saudi Arabia and I was with
Medea Benjamin and others at a
conference in Washington a couple years
ago to call precisely for that but I you
know I've spent a lot of my life in Gaza
I've seen those bodies of children lined
up in the corridors of Shifa Hospital
it's not an abstraction to me I will
never vote for a political candidate who
betrays the Palestinian people which is
why I did not vote for Barack Obama who
got up and gave a speech to AIPAC that
was written by AIPAC so my personal
response has been to speak in support of
BDS thank you would either of you know
it's actually it was initiated back in
1997 by Marion Shalom in Israel and I
think it's been supporting it since but
we have to be careful when we support
it's a movement we have to start asking
questions a movement has principles I
have to be careful that they don't turn
into a catechism you have to begin to
ask yourself which of the tactics of the
program are the successful ones and
effective ones and which tactics are
just following some principles that
somebody established and that's a
significant question so I think there
are
elements of the BBD programs which have
been extremely successful
so take say the Presbyterian Church
that's a very important move for a major
oh the Presbyterian Church yeah well the
Presbyterian Church was after all a
pretty big organization took a very
strong and I think extremely sensible
position there they called for boycott
and divestment of anything connected to
the Israeli occupied occupied
territories including firstly US
multinationals that are involved in the
in the occupation which brings the
matter home in ways that we should be
not only acting but it's educational and
other programs that are program that are
oriented against the occupation I think
I've been very successful and I think
those are the ones that can affect
policy and they can go far beyond what
they have so for example US military aid
to Israel happens to be in direct
violation of US law explicit violation
of US law the so-called lay law Patrick
lays the law part of US law stipulates
that no military aid can be given to any
military unit that is involved in
systematic human rights violations
well Gaza alone is a testimonial to
massive human rights violations it's by
no means the only case same in Lebanon
the West Bank and so on that's a very
this
this actually supported by major human
rights groups the Human Rights Watch
Amnesty International called for an end
the military aid to Israel folk activism
and education focused on that could
bring in large segments of the American
population who don't like the idea of
military aid anyway if it was known
these are things that could be really
effective techniques I think a lot of
there are many others now there are some
that I think are what are sometimes
called feel-good rather than do good
tactics and you've got to be careful
about those so for example takes a
academic no Israeli policy in fact what
it does is drive them to the right and
it has a negative effect for
Palestinians because the as soon as
those are initiated immediately there's
a backlash which often overwhelms the
protest but furthermore diverts
attention away from the plight of
Palestinians - irrelevant questions like
academic freedom are big debate about
academic freedom that's not the issue
here and it also raises obvious
questions of hypocrisy if you're going
to boycott Tel Aviv University why not
buy Cod Harvard which is much more
deeply involved in atrocities all over
the world not just so you're often
directions that go away from the issue
of the Palestinians and their plight if
you keep to those issues I think it
would be an extremely effective tactic
and a way of organizing protests and
activism and have an educational impact
which can lead further directions but as
in the case of all such programs
tactical issues have to be thought about
very seriously
they're not trivial you have to ask what
are the consequences of the tactic um
pursuing for the victims not does it
make me feel good to do it the
consequences for the victims these are
issues and one of the flaws of the
immune that's these things you have to
be careful about and as soon as I hear
the word movement why is it not just a
set of tactical choices that we have to
decide on case-by-case with careful
evaluation of consequences those I think
are things to be worried about and I'd
like to ask this question to dr. Khalid
Abu fadhl as an expert in US law
international law Islamic law what do
you think about BDS boycott divestment
sanctions in history of Palestine or
even Saudi Arabia
I'm one of the academics who has been
targeted by these fascist watch groups
for adding his name to you I took to
agree with with non-pom ski that I have
very good relations with some economics
at Tel Aviv University and one of them
for instance is is one of the most
inspired critiques critics of Arabs
performing whiteness and the whole
racial dynamics of the type of
psychology where Arabs increasingly try
to pretend to be why and anyway so she's
written some amazing work and I enjoy it
when I invite her to the United States
and I tend to think that yes we did
would get more than in these issues of
academic freedom but part of the problem
is that the US has has laws that
criminalize social boycotts of of
certain countries specifically Israel
there is a famous appellate court
decision that said that that law does
not violate the First Amendment
so the technicality in the law is that
if if the boycott is instituted in order
to back up if foreign boycott of Israel
so for instance if you are supporting an
Algerian boycott of Israel or the the
Attorney General can make that type of
allegation against you then it's a
felony and somehow it's not a violation
of the first
so I always think it's a priority to
become active in fixing our freakin laws
because not be even before the Patriot
Act some of our laws that were
legislated to protect Israel are mind
boggling and people don't know about
them and even there is ZERO discussions
and law schools I mean one of the
amazing things and I don't think my law
school isn't is an exception when it
comes to anything that has to do with
Israel it's a taboo we have faculty that
will do epileptic fits if we even try
attempt a discussion of certain things
but even there is a psychological
oblivion
towards the the topics like the ha the
genocides that we've inflicted and in
Iraq and Afghanistan and even the
international law faculty and and human
rights faculty talk as if these are not
as if these are not realities
I mean you rarely find an actual Human
Rights discourse about what we've done
and are doing in Afghanistan and Iraq in
all of our top law schools including my
own and I have one other point during
Muslims and Arabs were targeted in a
variety of ways from 9/11 after the
passage of the Patriot Act and again our
law schools even law schools that have
very good civil liberties program and
civil rights programs very little was
produced about what was going on was our
and Muslim population I tie all of this
to a colonial racism
and Imperial racism that we have never
rid ourselves off and we can praise our
legal minds we can say this is a
brilliant constitutional orator national
law professor although there are
dishonest in this course although they
will ignore that reality is as gruesome
as the Holocaust and he'd still be
touted as a brilliant legal mind and a
brilliant international law professor I
have a you know then I would understand
that a lot of people not a certain but I
agree with me but I believe that people
who is a humanitarian principle and in
and focused on Muslims I believe that
Muslims must wake up to the importance
of engaging academia funding the
academia starting to introduce their
voice as American Muslims in u.s.
academic institutions or even Western
academic institutions and until that
happens until you know the Dean knows
that there are Muslim donors that will
be impressed if there is a discussion
about what is going on with Palestinians
and there are Muslim donors who will be
very upset if there is no discussion
about what's going on nothing will
change I think that's just the reality
of what happens in our academic
institutions actually quite curious what
Chris think of that because we have far
more experience was that we may have to
cut the evening short but hopefully
we'll pick up the conversation after I'd
like to thank everyone for joining us
tonight and thank our speakers
