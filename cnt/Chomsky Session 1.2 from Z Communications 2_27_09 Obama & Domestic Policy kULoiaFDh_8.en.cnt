now it is that what happened between
2004 and 2008 well no change in popular
opinion the day when those but there is
a change in the sector of the country
that matters concentrated capital
manufacturing industry is being harmed
significantly by the highly inefficient
health care system so General Motors
says you know produce cars much more
cheaply in Windsor Canada than Detroit
because you know they have a semi
sensible health care system so we have a
sector big sector of American Capital
pushing for something it begins to have
political support so our moves towards
dealing with health care problem not the
way the population wants but in that
direction now that's pretty clear in his
Obama purposely pre vague doesn't say
much but but their hands and what he
says is he wants to do something to
extend health the deer of the fact that
like 50 million people don't have
insurance and many the rest are
underinsured which is a very severe
problem but it's not the core of the
problem the core of the problem is the
two things the extreme and efficiency of
the privatized system and the huge
benefits given to the pharmaceutical
industry I mean this is I think the only
industrial country where by law the
government is not allowed to negotiate
prices for the government-run part of
the system Medicare and so like the
Pentagon can negotiate use its
purchasing power to negotiate for you
know paper clips or something but the
government can't negotiate drug prices
using its huge purchasing power well
that alone shoots drug prices way up to
the stratosphere they're also shot up
further by the highly protectionists
provisions of the World Trade
Organization it's called free trade it's
nothing like that and a large part of
the protectionism is to make sure that
pharmaceutical companies have monopoly
pricing rights they
it's for research and development but an
analysis shows that's not true you know
they could Dean Baker's money Cano is
this study that points out correctly
that if most of the funding for research
and development doesn't come internally
anyway if see from the government or
film foundations and if you and if you
read if you increased R&D spending too
if he decreased it entirely 20 and they
were forcing on the market would be a
huge saving to consumers but that
doesn't give enough profits also their
own rd is mostly third the marketing
side copy get drugs and so on and even
this is an underestimate because it
doesn't count fundamental biological
work like what they do in the biology
department here which is it all what
lyrics meant so that's mostly scam but
this this is one big component of the
health care problem the other big
component is the privatization with huge
administrative costs and bureaucracy and
supervision and so on and so forth far
higher than public systems but there's
no mention of any of this not as a tiny
mentioning to be precise Obama did talk
in the budget about reduction of the
Medicare payments to private insurers
that do think that give care out of
Medicare which was another scam I put in
by the the bill that was passed a couple
years ago so he talks about reducing
that okay that's a slight barrier to
privatization of the system but this
skirts the edges and it means that the
health care costs which are going to
overwhelm the federal budget if this
continues are really not dealt with and
it's why people talk about will will
need more resources to cover the health
care reform that's true if you leave it
as it is and you try to extend it to
everyone but it isn't true if you
Institute the kind of program that the
population has the majority is
for decades and that's all kind of off
the agenda the usual way of describing
this in a lot of those two is to say
that it's an entitlements problem so
it's a problem of Social Security and
Medicare that that's highly misleading I
was almost entirely Medicare the part
that Social Security is miniscule in
comparison in fact Social Security is
very efficient because a little
bureaucracy minister of costs and it's a
fully funded for decades ahead and after
that probably requires really minor
adjustments to be viable indefinite
that's probably in as good shape now as
it's ever been but these things are
bundled together as part of an attack on
Social Security and there are powerful
forces trying to destroy Social Security
I mean the Peterson Institute is you
know the forefront but plenty of others
and there's kind of a gesture to the
attack on social security in the amount
a program namely when he talks about
private setting up a government-backed
proud of tax-free private personal funds
for a retirement okay that's a way to
chip away at Social Security Social
Security is the population loves it but
elites don't like it at all for a lot of
reasons some of them just ideological I
mean social security for one thing it
mostly goes to the wrong people you know
namely needy people that's not policing
it's supposed to work it's supposed to
help the rich but also it's just
ideologically wrong Social Security is
based on the principle that you care
about other people like you care whether
you know the liddo across town has food
or a disabled person can survive and
that's dangerous when you have notions
of community responsibility and
solidarity that chips away at
subordination to concentrated power so
it's kind of like it sticks out
ideologically or something it's
kind of inconsistent with our structures
and so this constant efforts to attack
it and unfortunately Obama's sort of
going along with this rule I wanted to
ask about what we can anticipate from
elites on the one hand obama's trying to
save the system from crisis on the other
hand it does entail some redistribution
of wealth he had the proposed tax
rolling back of taxes or the higher
income and good article about it the
wall street journal yesterday if you
want to deal with the deficit that's one
aspect of this it's delayed but you want
to deal with it there are two major
sectors that have to you know what you
have to focus that one is the health
care system as we've discussed and
that's being skirted in fact the
proposals are going to increase the
deficit the other is the military system
which is huge well you know Obama's
perfu look at the budget it again skirts
that there is suggestion namely that we
move away from you know by lauren
high-tech advanced weapons to fight the
Martians or something there's no real
function to do something talk about
China but that's completely meaningless
we should move away from that to
intervention forces okay they really
have a function but you know you could
invade Afghanistan and use them wherever
you want and as a shift in that
direction so we must have increased
those now I don't exactly know what the
cost estimates are but it's unlikely to
be a cost-saving there though there is
support for the generally hawkish stand
with regard to intervention so those two
major components that will have to be
dealt with if there's going to be any
reduction to the deficit or just kind of
sideline there is another part of the
budget is an attempt to slightly reduce
the grotesque inequality that's
developed in the last 30 years and
that's fiscal for tax the tax system is
modified that's one way to do it but
it's again chipping away at the edges I
mean the main way to overcome inequality
is to allow workers to
as well as most of most of the workforce
wants to do when unions are when people
can organize now they can struggle for
higher wages for better benefits and
it's you look at the record you see it
works so that's and it's also a
contribution to democracy if you have
unions that people are not isolated they
can work together they can enter the
political arena in some fashion facing
concentrated capital well there's a you
know there is a measure the employee
Free Choice Act which is badly miss
described in most of the public
commentary it's basically a way for
workers to decide whether there should
be union organizing not allowing
employers to decide and that was meant
brought up in the campaign but nothing
about it since since Obama was elected
when his chief of staff has been asked a
couple of times II kind of sidesteps
it's as well it's on the agenda later on
however you want to read if you really
want to attack inequality and extend
rights and in fact even extend democracy
that should be the top of the agenda and
that's not in there so in general it's a
move back toward the center from the
extreme right and is progressive in that
sense but i think it's skirting the main
problems
