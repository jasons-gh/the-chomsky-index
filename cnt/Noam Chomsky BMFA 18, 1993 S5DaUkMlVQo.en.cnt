well the most interesting way to conduct
this evening would be for you to start
in and raise the questions and issues
that you're interested in and we can
pick up from there I'm always prepared
to speak from zero to infinitely many
minutes but that's much less interesting
so I'm sure many of you have things on
your mind if you would like to just open
up we can do that or also I can talk
about some of the general issues not the
film specifically update us on East
Timor well as of when as if the updating
from when well the the main things that
have happened well let's just go back to
the deal a massacre in on November 1991
Indonesia made a tactical mistake
it's a stupid mistake through conduct a
massacre in front of television cameras
and to especially to practically beat to
death to American reporters when a
country does things like that they
usually pay for it you can conduct all
kinds of massacres off screen and if
you're the right country nothing ever
happens but when you conduct a massacre
on screen especially if there are
American victims you have to go through
a certain well-known charade which is
called an investigating Commission which
constructs the appropriate whitewash and
you tap some lower officials on the
wrists and the media the Western media
applaud you for your magnificence being
willing to face up to the atrocities and
after that the arms keep flowing and so
on and so forth so we went through that
charade immediately afterwards Hill and
Knowlton which is their PR firm
they wrote the script for the for the
whitewash but something went wrong what
went wrong was that by then amazingly I
would never guess that this would ever
happen myself but public the public
reaction in the United States had
reached the point where pressure on
Congress was sufficient to cause
something quite remarkable to happen the
US the Congress terminated we put a
barrier
it'll be evaded but put a barrier on
military in Indonesia that had never
happened before this if you trace it
back was the result of some extremely
dedicated work over many many years by
literally a handful of people actually
you get four or five people you know or
even fewer Arnold Cohen in Washington
probably deserves about 90% of the
credit for this over the last 17 years
after the dealy massacre a grassroots
organization did develop and it
contributed to what he's been doing he
had been able to reach a number of for
the most part right-wing congressmen
through a Bible study group that was
organized by Tony Hall who had gotten
upset about the atrocities and despite
the media cover-up and despite the
government support and so on
enough protests developed around the
fringes so that Indonesia got more than
the expected rap on the on the knuckles
now it doesn't it won't matter much
unless it continues because as I say
it'll of course be evaded these things
always are and other countries like
particularly Britain had been very
cheerful have been very happy to fill
the gap and to enrich themselves by
sending arms immediately after lots of
high-flown rhetoric about the how we
have to stand up against aggression and
the Gulf when so on and so forth
Britain Britain was even you know lofty
or on this than we were the British
immediately entered into the largest
military contract with any a.cian
country British Aerospace entered into a
big contract for fighter planes and
other advanced aircraft Indonesia so
that it can continue to maintain the
repression on the side quietly something
quite important was happening in eighty
and nineteen eighty-nine Australia had
signed a treaty with Indonesia to
exploit the oil of the Timor gap the sea
between Timor and Australia has been
expected for a long time to be a major
oil resource in fact that's one of the
main reasons why the West supported the
Indonesian takeover and Massacre
figuring that be an easier way to
exploit the oil than with an independent
country and in nineteen eighty December
1989 I think it was Australia finalized
that treaty which is approximately
equivalent to say Libya having made a
treaty with Iraq to exploit and kwaity
oil after the Iraqi invasion of an
annexation of Quade be kind of a close
analogue to it the it's an issue in
Australia so the in Parliament one of
the reasons to an issue in Australia I
don't know if this came up in the film
or not is that during the Second World
War
about forty thousand temari's were
killed defending a couple hundred
Australian guerrillas who where they are
trying to keep the Japanese from taking
it over and using it as a springboard
for an expected invasion of Australia
and they did do that
huge cost for the theme worries and in
return and thanks for this Australia is
the only country that has officially
recognized the Indonesian annexation and
has been giving as much support as it
could to the ongoing atrocities and has
now entered into a an agreement with
Indonesia to exploit the oil well this
came up in the Australian Parliament
people were upset the Foreign Minister
Gareth Evans explained that as he put it
the world is an unfair place littered
with examples of acquisition by force
there is no legal obligation not to
recognize a forceful annexation that was
in one voice on the other side of his
mouth at the same time he and Prime
Minister were again lots of inspiring
rhetoric about how thanks to the courage
and integrity of the anglo-saxon
countries defending quake from saddam
hussein small countries now know that
big neighbours can't get away with
attacking them and so on this all goes
on at exactly the same time should say
one of the great pleasures of my life
was to have been denounced by Gareth
Evans the Foreign Minister of Australia
the Foreign Minister of Great Britain
and the Dutch Foreign Minister within a
few weeks in in the case of Australia it
was having having been in London and
quoted these remarks simultaneously
which hidden like for one reason because
he's looking for a Nobel Peace Prize for
helping broker the Cambodia settlement
well this has been when I say Australia
made the agreement on the oil that's a
cover that mean that's cover for all
Western oil companies by now I think
right through the Gulf War Western oil
companies moved in to start exploring
and lifting oil and so on I think by now
last I heard there's about 15 of them
who were stealing t Murray's oil while
the atrocities continue and the terror
continues and the torture continues in
silence continue
be surprised if many of you have read
anything about this anywhere although
it's all going on it's still slipping
between the cracks is Carl Meyer put it
the couple of a couple of months ago the
head of the team raised resistance Shana
now was captured near Diddley nobody
heard from for quite a while
obviously tortured his family and lots
of other people were then started being
picked up around team were evidently
they were able to get information out of
him not because he gave it when people
give information and signed confessions
that's an almost certain indication that
they're being tortured nobody does it
under any other circumstances they're
talking about that again you know the
West has to pretend they don't
understand this and in the case of the
right people it is so they're the terror
has apparently increased again but the
fighting continues as well the fact that
the US is withholding military aid is
not insignificant for the Indonesian
it's a kind of warning a warning that
they may not be able to get away with it
forever despite the loyalty of the media
despite the support of the Western
societies it's not just the United
States it's virtually the entire West
countries like Sweden France hollom all
in there to try to enrich themselves as
much as they can through participation
and what is probably the worst massacre
relative to the population since the
Holocaust but you know that's the way it
works as Gareth Evan put it the world is
an unfair place and when there's money
to be made it doesn't mean how many
people are killed doesn't matter how
many people are killed the case is a
very interesting and important one apart
from the significance of it for the
remnants of the population who do now
have at least some barrier against
further attack it's significant to show
how much can be done the fact that it
was possible on this issue after many
many years to finally get to the point
where Congress intervened under largely
right-wing interviewed say to to call a
halt to military aid that's quite
significant shows what you can do if you
really had a substantial grassroots
movement which was able to evade the
shackles and it explains why the problem
of indoctrination and control is so
important you got to keep people from
knowing about these things because it's
a you know it's a free country there's a
lot of things you can do about it so
that brings it more or less up to today
yeah
my calling
direct democracy
yeah well it'd be interesting to do a
study of the call-in shows I don't think
anybody's done one my strong impression
is that over the last 10 or 20 years
they've been very largely taken over by
sort of far-right fanatics
that's an impression you know I hate to
talk about it just on the basis of an
impression but having been on them for
20 25 years its kind of sense I get at
least they're just you know tuning in
driving around and so on the call-in
shows earn or you know this
electronically Perot electronic business
and so on
this is the antithesis of democracy I
mean it's a sort of a classical
principle of political theory you goes
back to Montesquieu that at least maybe
farther that the way to run an
absolutist state what we nowadays call a
totalitarian state is to isolate people
as long as you can isolate people from
one another you've won the problem is to
keep people from getting together once
they get together they can do all sorts
of things that's been recognized
you know classical insight the way humid
in his principles of government he said
even in the most despotic state he said
forces on the side of the governed and
therefore unless their opinion is
controlled they're going to overthrow
the despotic leadership and the way the
best way to control their opinion is to
isolate them keep them separated from
one another people are alone they can't
do very much I mean anybody who works in
a serious intellectual discipline knows
this perfectly will say the science if
you work in the sciences if you're
totally isolated you don't even know
what you think you know I mean you
figure things out by interaction that's
why graduate courses and physics or any
other field or sort of cooperative
enterprises in which people participate
that's the way you figure out what you
think you work out your ideas you try
them out other people respond to them
you finally get to the point where you
could act politically so if people can
be isolated no problem
television is a terrific device for
achieving that result
it does keep people completely separated
from one another phone telephone
interaction is another you're alone you
know I mean there's a kind of connection
but it's so remote and so broken up and
so narrow that it doesn't mean a lot
you can't consult your neighbors as the
old labor organizers put it you can
consult your neighbors you can find out
whether what what power tells us is true
if you look at it alone you can't do it
the electronic you know the systems that
Perot was talking about it seems to me
would just be another device in giving
people the faulty impression that
they're participating in the political
system whereas in fact that isolates
them even further as for polls there's a
lot of talk about the press about the
government responding to polls but
that's just a flat lie I mean if you
take a look at public opinion studies
you find that on issue on virtually
across the board the public is strongly
opposed to the policies that are shared
by the to business factions the
Democrats and the Republicans and it's
irrelevant it's been that way right
through the seventies you know through
the 80s I mean simply there's a very
heavily polled society most of the polls
are done for business you know public
relations industry which dedicates you
know billion dollars a year or more to
control the public mind as they put it
they want to know what the public mind
is so a lot of intensive study and this
available you know it's not secret and
if you look at it you find that the
public is diametrically opposed to
almost the entire thrust of policy and
has been consistently and remained so I
take say the major issues that are now
up for discussion takes a health care
you know major issue everybody's talking
about it
if you review the media coverage or the
public coverage which reach the general
public it's almost entirely almost
entirely can't give you a statistic but
haven't
but almost entirely supporting one or
another form of managed health insurance
based healthcare you know one or another
form of that sometimes called managed
competition or sometimes something else
but something that guarantees that it'll
be highly inefficient extremely
bureaucratized very very costly and very
profitable for corporations that's the
but that's the baseline I'm a u.s.
administrative u.s. is just off the
chart internationally in health care not
only in costs but in administrative
costs which are probably you know
somewhere between five and ten times as
high as Canada and England and remember
those are extreme under estimates
because those are estimates of the cost
to the health provider they don't count
in the cost to the health to the person
who has to fill out the forms you know
you start know know how many of you have
done this sort of thing but if you
consider the amount of time and effort
that's that's involved in just trying to
fill out the forms that's never
calculated that's just personal cost if
you throw that in the costs are just
enormous and it's very inefficient it's
in fact so difficult and hard that the
mites by estimated about a hundred
million dollars a year of valid
insurance claims are never even made
because there's too much trouble to do
it or figure out how to do it or
anything like that well the public is
not even though almost the entire
propaganda system indoctrination system
is committed to this kind of solution
the public is overwhelmingly opposed to
it without ever having heard it you know
about 70 percent of the public wants
what's called here a canadian-style
system the only reason it's called that
is because Canada is close by you can
see it in other words what is one it is
the kind of system that exists in every
other society except this one and that's
approximately 70 percent in fact roughly
the same percentage would be willing to
pay higher taxes to get it although in
fact it would require lower costs
because it's much more efficient doesn't
have the built-in inefficiencies of
capitalist based systems which are
extremely
efficient and costly and so on the but
and but it makes no difference
I mean 70% of the population without
even hearing the issue discuss is
opposed it has a certain preference but
the insurance companies have a different
preference so that's the choice that's
available there with you may have seen a
couple of days ago there's big
front-page story in the New York Times
by who
Robert Reinhold I think I was three or
four days ago a front-page story running
over on a full inside page on the
magnificent managed health care system
that's now being that they're not
experimenting with in California I don't
know if you read it it's really
intriguing I mean it mean it gives
people the choice between nineteen
different health plans you know and the
state will make the information
available so you can make a reasonable
choice if you want to devote a research
you know your life to a research inquiry
into the issue and of course to provide
all this information and to supervise
these various insurance based or HMO
based plans requires an enormous
bureaucracy remember these are sort of
capitalist based systems you have to
have control or they're going to run
away with the store you know they're
gonna pursue what Adam Smith called the
vile Maxim of the Masters all for
ourselves and nothing for anyone else
and while that's ok for most things
there is at least some sort of a sense
around that people ought to get a
limited amount of health care which
means hand it over at a private vise and
you're going to have to have a big
bureaucracy to ensure that they don't
run away with everything you know in
which of course they will that's the way
systems supposed to work in fact so you
read through that if you read through
that story the level of complexity
that's introduced is mind-boggling well
in that whole long story you know a full
inside page front-page story there is
one line one line given to a professor
from the Harvard Medical School have
forgotten is there her name saying this
whole thing is crazy we got to have a
single-payer plan you know okay sentence
is in there there's another
there's another line somewhere else
quoting a representative of one of the
big HMOs in Kaiser or somebody in
California saying well people talk about
a canadian-style plan but that's not
possible it offers nothing to the
insurance companies okay that takes care
of the alternative that's wanted by 70
percent of the population now that's
pretty typical if you take just you know
you look through the major issues and
you'll find that it's generally like
this let me mention one other major
current issue major current issue NAFTA
the North American Free Trade Agreement
people can debate the technical
consequences just what's it going to do
but everybody knows it's going to have a
big effect that's not even a in question
again the press is absolutely
overwhelmingly in support of it in news
columns and editorials and so on has
just taken for granted you know you just
have to be in favor of this thing well
it's a little difficult to have an
opinion about it because a secret treaty
the treaty was initialed on August 12th
by the three presidents and it was
completely secret executive secret
technically it's now available again if
you want to do a research inquiry you
could probably find out what the text is
but enough people have found that have
got a little enough of a sense of what
the text is like so at a good part of
the population has a picture of it and
by about two-to-one they're opposed to
it does it make any even even alone you
know they're opposed to it if they're oh
when they're isolated if they were
together and they could think through
the consequences they probably very very
much opposed to it
I spend when you begin to look at what
it's supposed to do you can understand
why but it doesn't matter it's in the
interests of one thing about the treaty
that almost everyone agrees on is it's
going to be a bonanza to investors in
Canada the United States and Mexico
meaning primarily the United States and
that's all that counts it's like the
comment of the Kaiser HMO there's got to
be something in it for the rich that's
the way social social policy is designed
as long as that's and it doesn't make
any difference what the population wants
this was true right
the Reagan years take a look right
through the Reagan years the public was
overwhelmingly opposed to virtually
every measure that was pushed through
and in fact rammed through by the
Democrats in Congress public was in
favor of social spending over military
spending by very large margins you know
like four to one or seven to one and so
on
public was even the favor of higher
taxes for social spending education
welfare and so on just doesn't make any
difference you know the public is not
supposed to take part in politics it's
not their job
public is supposed to be spectators so
the idea that the political system is
responding to polls that's just a fraud
yeah I'll try to see people back for
their clue if you're back farther a wave
stronger this is hard to see yeah but go
ahead
then I'll go ahead
yeah well I can't comment on the
particular issue that you raised cuz
there's not anything about it but on the
general issue how do you get by well I
think what happened in the Timur case is
a good example you get by by conspire
overcoming the principle that people
have to be isolated from one another so
say take and that's that's happened I
mean it's a very different country from
what it was say 30 years ago there are
the constraints for exercise of violence
on the part of the state are much less
than they've ever been in a past and we
have a tradition of executive wars in
the United States that goes back it goes
back to 1818 when Andrew Jackson
conquered Florida and John Quincy Adams
had to construct the rationalization for
it arguing that what he can--he he
conquered Florida partly because the
United States wanted Florida but partly
because they didn't like what was going
on in Florida there were runaway slaves
going to Florida and there were free
Indians going off there
I had to be stopped so John Quincy Adams
had to construct the races diatribe
about how Jackson was defending us from
you know lawless Negroes and red man red
Indians and so on and so forth that's
considered one of the great state papers
in American history and it since the
United States was powerful in Spain who
we stole it from was weak we also forced
Spain to pay reparations for our robbery
of Florida from them this was that
initiated the tradition of executive war
which is just going on ever since in
violation of the Constitution and so on
and it went on right into this into the
60s increasing in fact terror state
terrorist activities increased state
violence increased it reached its peak
under the kennedy administration not
only with the huge terrorist campaign
against cuba which still continues
though not at the level of kennedy but
also with the attack against south
vietnam which after all was a major act
of aggression just like the russian
invasion of afghanistan and under
kennedy just 31 years ago in fact nobody
batted an eyelash you know in fact it
was so deeply suppressed that to this
day you can't refer to it you cannot
refer to the american attack against
south vietnam actually a friend of mine
who writes literary pieces for the
boston globe a novelist i wrote for a
lot of journals in new york times know
there's been including the boston globe
once just on their I just didn't see
what would happen
put into an article of his for the
Boston Globe magazine the phrase us
attack against South Vietnam and it came
back from the copy editor it's corrected
saying you've made a mistake you meant
us defense of South Vietnam well of
course he meant us attack against South
Vietnam but those are unspeakable words
you know unlike the Russians we can't
concede that we invaded South Vietnam
and destroyed it they can concede that
they invaded Afghanistan all right and
that
right in the right through the 60s but
not anymore classic intervention is not
an option and it's recognized not to be
an option one of the important leaks
from the Bush administration the day of
the ground attack in the Gulf there was
a leak of a document an early Bush
administration planning document quite
an important one having to do with
third-world confrontations which means
any possible use of military force it
said that in the case of much weaker
enemies
the only kind you fight in the case of
much weaker enemies we must not only
defeat them but we must defeat them
rapidly and decisively because any delay
will undercut political support
recognized to be thin well you know
that's the way you get around censorship
by creating popular structures and
popular organizations that change
attitudes and you know get people act
together and put enough pressures on the
system of power so that it simply has to
adjust I mean even a totalitarian system
has to adjust to the popular mood and a
freer Society certainly does when Ronald
Reagan tried to duplicate the Kennedys
attack on South Vietnam can I write to
Reagan came in with very similar
policies to Kennedy's very similar if
you look and tried right off to
duplicate what Kennedy had done thirty
years ago I've modeled himself on it
they came right out with a white paper
about Central America this time which
was modeled on the Kennedy white paper
of 1961
you know Russians taking over the world
and isn't that and the other thing and
it was a it was intended to set the lay
the basis for a direct US military
attack on Central America on Nicaragua
and El Salvador Guatemala and so on
well they there and the press bought it
you know you take a look back at the
time February 1981 the press cheered the
white paper say oh yeah marvellous
Russians taken over the world we got to
do something and so on and so forth just
as 30 years ago the educated sectors of
the population haven't changed in this
time but the population didn't
except there was a big unexpected
ferment all over the country a lot of it
based in the churches you know a lots a
lot of it based in the in in these
developing popular structures that had
grown since the 60s as they did they
spread throughout much of the population
in the 70s and got much deeper roots and
there was so much fermat around the
country and so much protest that the
Reagan administration backed off they
were afraid that more central parts of
their policy would be harmed like the
big giveaway they were planning through
the wealthy you know the sort of core
element of the policy so they kind of
backed off
they basically informed the press to
cool it you know that they not to make a
big fuss about this and about three
months later in fact in June Press
critique began first in The Wall Street
Journal then in the Washington Post
never reached the New York Times which
stayed loyal but by that time the option
for a direct attack was over and the
u.s. shifted gears and moved towards
clandestine terror carried out the
biggest clandestine terrorist operations
in history but had to be clandestine
because the public wouldn't accept
anything else then developed in the
United States through the 80s the most
in my opinion the most remarkable
grassroots solidarity or gonna work of
organizations that has ever existed
namely the Central America solidarity
groups throughout the whole country now
these were something quite different
from the 60s the sixties protests were
mostly based in you know elite
universities among groups of young
people which is essentially a margin
very courageous people the very marginal
parts of the population the 80s was
completely different it was right in
mainstream America you know Midwest
Southwest the church you know small
towns church circles and stuff like that
furthermore it reached levels that the
Vietnam protest never came close to nor
has any other protest in any other major
imperial power or even minor one
my knowledge during the Vietnam War for
example or say you know during the
French war in Algeria or whatever you
know you never had people going to live
in villages of the victims in the hope
that having a white face around might
protect people from from the atrocities
of the security forces I mean I was
inconceivable in the Vietnam War but it
happened during the Central America Wars
with witnesses for peace for example
probably 80,000 or 90,000 Americans were
just involved themselves and the lives
of the victims that's never happened
before well these are all things that
happened around the censorship system
the indoctrination system educated
sectors had almost nothing to do with it
you know I mean I don't mean to say the
people weren't educated but you know
elite intellectuals I had almost nothing
to do with it the media had almost
nothing to do with it in fact they're
completely on the opposite side but it
happened and it had a big effect it
still was possible to kill a couple
hundred thousand people and destroy
three countries so they may not survive
but it would have been a lot worse if
the US had been able to do what Kennedy
was able to do well that's the way you
get around these these systems of power
and authority and if it reaches far
enough significant social change can
take place for example the media and
there's a lot of criticism of media
including by me but they're a lot better
than they used to be they're way better
than they were in the 60s incomparable
better on the loyalty and the servility
to state power in the 1960s when you
look back is pretty remarkable compared
with today's minuscule level of
Independence still miniscule but it's
much more than it was the most not the
New York Times maybe but outside the New
York Times which has a special role most
newspapers have at least somebody around
maybe a few people around who can who
sort of are willing able and willing
first of all can see through the whole
business and can use
opportunities to work within it and to
open things up that would have been
unthinkable in the 1960s well that's the
effect of changes in the general society
and that's the way social change always
takes place let's go way back yeah yeah
well well no actually let's be clear
what you're talking about do you mean
the 1965 massacre in Indonesia yeah
there was a big massacre in Indonesia in
1965 it was more like about 700,000
probably nobody really knows but you
know on the neighborhood have fought
500,000 to a million something like that
and they were not Chinese I mean there
were some Chinese who were killed but
they were mostly landless peasants they
were landless Indonesian peasants what
happened the that slaughter was greeted
not only with applause by the West but
with euphoria actually I have a chapter
in a recent book that goes through a lot
of the details if you're interested in
checking back to the press at that time
the but Time magazine called a boiling
bloodbath and Indonesia which it
described you know you know 11 pages of
glorious living photos you know people
being torn to shreds and massacred and
so on and the hundreds of thousands they
were applauding it the leading columnist
of the New York Times James Reston
described that as a gleam of light in
Asia you know and said we shouldn't he
said the US government is pretending
they really didn't have a lot to do with
this because it wants to make sure that
it doesn't undermine the Indonesian
generals but really the US government
had a lot more to do with it than it
claims so we should be proud of this
huge Massacre hope where there once was
none was a big headline in another
newspaper and so on
in fact uniformly in the United States
try to find some critique I went through
the whole a good bit of the record there
was uniform joy and euphoria over this
slaughter of you know
men are more mostly landless peasants
the reason was because it destroyed the
only major popular movement the
Communist Party of Indonesia which is
the only political party if therefore
eliminated the threat that there might
be democracy in Indonesia it placed in
power a gang of murderous generals
General Suharto who's still there was at
the head of it who were willing to sell
the country out completely to Western
corporations and now Indonesia is very
rich a lot of rich resources you can
make a lot of money by robbing
Indonesian and this up until then it had
been difficult Indonesia was controlled
by a nationalist leader Skaar know who
won independence from the Dutch and in
Sakura I was kind of balancing himself
between two forces in Indonesia one was
the one big pocket the only popular
movement namely the PKI the Communist
Party which was a mainly mainly based on
poor and landless peasant and the other
force was the army supported by the
United States and he was kind of run a
balancing act between these two and the
slaughter put the army in power and
destroyed the political movement so
therefore naturally it was greeted with
extraordinary enthusiasm not only in
United States but in England and
Australia and so on I didn't check the
content assumed I was the same ever
since then Indonesia has been an
absolute darling of the West
the Christian month Science Monitor
recently described Suharto as a moderate
which is exactly the way he was
described by the New York Times
editorial is at the time he was a
moderate that was proven by the fact
that he took over and was able to
organize in four months of boiling blood
bath with slaughtered six or seven
hundred thousand people what better sign
of moderation could there be the one
that economists again about a year ago
described him as at heart benign you
know really a nice guy beneath all the
atrocities and they're right from their
point of view he's at heart very benign
to Western corporations who have
enriched themselves on after his
takeover so he's a great guy you know he
makes
Saddam Hussein looked pretty mild I
should say in comparison but remember we
had nothing against Saddam Hussein
either as long as he was just
slaughtering Kurds and torturing
dissidents and so on it was when he
disobeyed orders that he became a bad
guy the atrocities don't make any
difference at all I should say that this
concept of moderate has a long history
the current moderate the carrot moderate
for example in Haiti is marked beza
who's presiding over atrocities that the
population regards is comparable to the
worst of the deviate euro but that's
only because they're stupid and don't
understand he's a moderate because he
was the US candidate for the elections
and after we couldn't get him in because
nobody would vote for him he was gotten
in through a military coup and
atrocities and now he's there so he's a
moderate the leading moderate in
Guatemala at the moment is a general
gramacho who was in charge of the
slaughters in the early eighties in the
highlands knows how many tens of
thousands of people he was responsible
for killing so he's now described as a
moderate and in fact he's the state
department favorite for the next
elections and the history of moderation
goes way back Hitler was a moderate I
that's true until 1937 at least I've
been able to check it beyond that Hitler
was described an internal state
department that documents as a moderate
standing between the extremists of right
and left and we better support him or
else you know the the working classes
under the fever of Bolshevism will do
this mountain the other horrible thing
Mussolini was not only a moderate he was
absolutely marvelous he was with
Roosevelt called that admirable Italian
gentleman he had succeeded in crushing
the parliamentary system and destroying
the union's and opening up business
activity he was just a terrific guy
until he disobeyed orders finally and
the business community responded in kind
after the fascist takeover in in Italy
in 1922 US investment in Italy shot up
after Hitler's takeover u.s. investment
Germany's shut up what in fact was level
through most of Europe or even declining
but it shot up in Germany because people
can recognize a moderate when they see
if he destroyed the unions you know he
destroyed the parliamentary system he
had everything in order the
opportunities to exploit and for the
vile Maxim were functioning so he's just
like sukarno Suharto in Indonesia or
gramacho in Guatemala and so on or
Saddam Hussein before he made his one
mistake that's what happened in Asia and
that's instantly the background for the
team were take over and you might ask
yourself why and why is the West in the
United States so you know so deeply
committed overwhelmingly committed to
the Indonesian invasion and annexation
of Timor and the destruction of its
population what do we care a little
island off somewhere well you know
that's our guy who's doing it this man
who's at heart benign and who opened up
Indonesia to free Western robbery this
has a lot to do with the Vietnam War
incidentally I mean if we had anything
remotely like say newspapers or whatever
it would be
everybody would understand that this was
at the core of the Vietnam War the main
concern in Vietnam in South Vietnam and
there's a lot of wild talk about you
know rubber and rice and so on by
Eisenhower but that was just a cover the
main concern was that an independent
Vietnam might have economic success and
be a model that would be followed by
others in Thailand and primarily
Indonesia as they put it the rot might
spread the rot of successful independent
development might spread throughout the
region the virus might spread and infect
others and the one that they were really
worried about was Indonesia and when
Indonesia finally put a lid on the
threat of the spread of the rot in 1965
you take a look back and you find you
know statements published by Freedom
House assigned by these people who
called themselves the most distinguished
American intellectuals explaining how
the Indonesian generals had been able to
carry out this more
was feet beyond behind the shield placed
by us power in Vietnam which had
encouraged them to carry out the
massacre in the slaughter in retrospect
McGeorge Bundy who was national security
advisor at the time a couple of years
ago was quoted as saying that in
retrospect he thinks the biggest mistake
we the United States made in Vietnam was
not canceling the attack on Vietnam in
1965 it had already achieved most of its
goals about a maybe couple hundred
thousand people had been killed
the chances of in develop of independent
development or it already been
terminated I wasn't going to get
anywhere and after the Indonesian
slaughter the chance that the ROK might
spread was essentially over the way you
contain a virus after all as you destroy
the virus and you inoculate the
surroundings by then the virus if not
totally destroyed had been pretty well
smashed and with Indonesia under brutal
military control and Thailand under
Ganga generals and Philippines to come
shortly after the region was pretty safe
and I was just stupid to continue the
war after that at too much cost to us so
in retrospect there was a mistake to
continue after that point well that's
the actual framework for the u.s. attack
on South Vietnam and the rest of
Indochina
but you'll wait a long time before
anybody I'll talk about this even in
scholarship I should say again let's
stay way back for a while yeah
this is a free society yeah well I don't
recall the second comment but I would
agree with the first one I think it is a
free society but of course by free I
mean it's I think what I probably went
on to say or at least should have is
that it's free in the sense that the
government the state state power is
extremely limited by comparative
standards in its capacity to coerce
individuals at least relatively
privileged individuals you know it's not
far from perfect but if you look by
comparative standards relatively people
who are of the right color and
relatively privileged which in a rich
country like this is a lot of people are
pretty well protected from state power
state violence okay so like I've got a
FBI file this high you know the FBI has
intervened to try to disrupt my courses
at MIT you know I've been up for long
jail sentences and so on basically they
can't do anything I'm the right color
and relatively privileged so you're kind
of immune to state violence that's not
true everywhere you know if you somebody
some somebody who tried to stand up
against state power and say
Brezhnev's Russia could end up in exile
somebody who tried to stand up against
state power in any typical US dependency
like say El Salvador I'll end up with
his brains blown out or cut the pieces
and West in a ditch you know well these
are things that happen in much of the
world even by comparison with Europe
we're quite free this is the only
country in the world that I know of that
has formal that that legally defends
freedom of speech and in fact does it in
practice too that's very rare I don't
know any other country that doesn't have
some residue of a law of seditious libel
which makes it a crime to
attacked the state inwards you know the
United States has such a law - up until
1964 it was overcome through civil
rights struggle we were the first ones
to break it but in most of the you know
in England or in Canada or whatever
state wants to suppress to you know send
the cops in and pull out the files from
BBC or close down a newspaper or
whatever they do it you know it was
after the salman rushdie case the muslim
community in in england brought to the
british courts a charge that rusty
should be sentenced for the crime of
seditious libel that is assaulting a an
established religion with words and that
went all the way through the british
courts and he the muslim community
finally lost but lost on the interesting
grounds they said that if Rushdie had
written that book about the Church of
England then yes he would have been
guilty of seditious right okay but he
just assaulted the wrong people so
therefore it doesn't work well that's
the way other societies work and in that
respect we're very free there are other
respects of which were not for one thing
if you're not of the right color or
you're not privileged these legal
protections don't amount to a rub hint
you know if you're Fred Hampton an
organizer in the Chicago ghetto black
panther organizer in the Chicago ghetto
and the FBI are trying to kill you they
kill you which is what happened the Fred
Hampton Gestapo style assassination
which nobody cares about because it's
just a black organizer and there's
plenty of that stuff people live under
state terror substantial state terror
and the history of the American labor
movement is unusually violent through
the early part of this century up until
the 1930s hundreds of American workers
at least 700 are known and it hasn't
even really been studied were murdered
by the security forces during strikes at
a time when nobody was killed in Europe
in fact all four of the far-right
European
pres was appalled at the treatment of
American workers right through the 1930s
when they finally won sort of formal
rights they've been losing ever since
and now I don't have any longer
incidentally but you know those are
forms of state violence that exist and
are real but despite all that and and
there's you know we're a very isolated
society we don't have I mean why is it
that the United States is off the
spectrum and things like say health care
well you know we don't have popular
organizations and popular structures we
don't have unions we don't have
political parties we are very isolated
and alone in that sense it is like a
classic totalitarian society but without
much state violence in fact with very
limited amounts of it I mean these are
all the different you know there are
many different facets of the of the
system so you can call it free I think
it's fair to call it free
maybe incomparably free along major
dimensions but highly controlled and
indoctrinated along others and
incidentally I think that those things
are correlated in a society that where
the state has the power to to control
people by force in the interests of
dominant domestic groups really doesn't
care a lot about other kinds of freedom
it's interesting to compare Society I
think you can learn a lot about this by
comparing societies that are at opposite
ends of the spectrum of form of freedom
so take say the United States and pre
Gorbachev Russia you know about at
opposite ends and among major societies
in terms of capacity of the state to
coerce okay and if you look at things
like say access to independent thinking
they're also at opposite ends with the
United States least and the Russians
most for example probably about
nighttime in some studies that were done
in the late 70s now you can't do very
close studies in Russia but studies that
were done by US government funded
studies academic studies here estimated
that about I think 95 percent of the
popular
was listening to foreign broadcasts well
nobody in the United States listens to
foreign broadcasts all you hear is you
know the domestic propaganda line there
were studies of the distribution of some
Ystad you know a foothold underground
dissident literature the estimates were
that it was reaching about half of the
more or less educated population
professionals say and about 15% of
blue-collar workers well you know if a
dissident publication in the United
States could reach 0.0001 percent of the
population you know you can sort of fall
over and joy but the diversity of the
and there's no doubt that the Russian
state could have suppressed all of this
just wasn't important enough to them now
you got a bludgeon over people's head
you don't care all that much what they
think you can control what they do you
know in a country like the United States
you really can't easily control what
people do so you better control what
they think I think that's why we have
probably the most sophisticated and
documentation system in the world very
conscious to mainly place where it's
most conscious is in the business
community and in the among educated
intellectuals where there's a very
elaborate theory of it in the business
community it's right at the core of the
public relations industry which is you
know like I said it spends nobody knows
how much but at least a billion dollars
a year probably a lot more in
controlling the public mind and
directing people's thinking and
attitudes because people are just too
free you got to watch it they're aware
of it when the when Labour won its first
legislative victory and also its last
legislative victory in 1935 getting the
right to organize that workers had had
in Europe for a decade when that was won
the Wagner Act there was a real chill in
the business community you look at the
business literature at the time and they
were terrified they're a National
Association of Manufacturers literature
writes about the the newly rising
political power of the mass
which is posing a hazard to
industrialists and unless their thinking
is directed we're going to be facing a
adversity assembly this kind of you know
vulgar Marxist rhetoric about the rising
power of the masses and so on is very
typical of the business literature and
also of because they see themselves as
fighting a bitter class war and you know
it's it does read like you know a little
red book stuff very often except that
the value is reversed and in fact they
set in motion major efforts to direct
the thinking of the masses and make sure
that this rising political power didn't
achieve anything well you know that's
what you have to do in countries which
are free where you really can't send out
the the troops to control them very much
you can some extent but not much way
back in the middle yeah
well remember that these these are
attitude studies not information studies
the general public has very little
information but they do have attitudes
and the attitudes come from personal
experience in personal life you know you
don't have to study the New England
Journal of Medicine to see that there's
something wrong with the healthcare
system all you have to do is try to fill
out a Medicare form you know and the
experience is that people go through nor
do you you don't have to read you know
arcane economists to understand that the
economic system is unfair 83 83 % of the
population which an unheard-of number in
polls 83 % of the population regards the
economic system as inherently unfair not
because they read it anywhere you know
or studied economics but because they
can look they can open their eyes and
look around them you know and say super
wealth on one side and homeless people
starving in the streets and the other
you can see it you see you work harder
and harder and you get less and less you
don't have to read the statistics to
discover that real wages have been
stagnating for 20 years and declining
for the last 10 you know you know it you
don't have to study it so there isn't a
lot of information but there's plenty of
attitude all right and actually the
polls are you know the the akka the
studies of public opinion are quite
interesting on this for example it was I
don't know how many of you saw but there
was an academic study done by the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst
they have a communications department
which has been doing a lot of
interesting work on public opinions you
know public opinion on major issues and
they did a study during the election in
which they tried they investigated
people's knowledge of the stand of the
candidates on major issues you know so
did you know what Clinton stand was on X
that kind of thing well it turned out
that under 1/3 of the population could
answer correctly on questions such as
what are the you know what are the
stands of the candidates on major
issues although 86% of the population
could answer correctly when asked what's
the name of George Bush's dog you know
so the I mean the main media message is
getting through but the but what was
particularly interesting about this was
they tried to break the they tried to
split it up into more educated and less
educated and it turned out that the more
educated sectors were worse on the facts
than the less educated sectors because
the mortgage and that I think is
directed right to your point the more
educated sectors are them are they the
ones at whom the indoctrination system
is primarily aimed the less educated
sectors are not really so close directly
subjected indoctrination and propaganda
in fact if you take a look at the mass
media this stuff that say Edward
Herrmann and I have done on the mass
media like manufacturing consent is a
little misleading in this respect
because we're talking about the elite
media you know the New York Times and
The Washington Post and that sort of
thing those are the media that are
directed to the educated sectors they're
like the journals of opinion you know
and they're directed to the educated
sectors of the population to the people
who are expected to be the rulers now
they have to be deeply indoctrinated
because their decisions are going to
make a difference but there's both but
the real mass media we didn't discuss
and one should you know the media that
reach huge masses of the population like
say television sitcoms and that kind of
stuff the real mass media do not try to
indoctrinate in quite the same sense you
know like they're not trying to
inculcate falsehoods about how the u.s.
is defending you know peace and justice
throughout the world or whatever their
main concern is to inculcate attitudes
of passivity and isolation and
consumerism and so on to create you know
images of life as it should be lived
which are going to be compelling enough
so that you won't try to find out what's
going on
world you'll just be you'll turn into a
blob of junk you know and that's a
different kind of indoctrination
entirely and it you know it it leaves
people in a way free to open their eyes
and see what's going on in the world so
often their attitude so that's why you
get such sharp differences in attitude
from people who you know probably don't
even read the new sections of the
newspaper and look at them why should
they bother you know just a bunch of
lies anyway
oh yeah that's a different question they
over the overseas Chinese the overseas
Chinese yeah oh yeah it's true I didn't
answer then it's perfectly true yeah
that's quite important a lot of things
are important I talked about Indonesia
which is the part of it that I tuned
into the but you're right yeah the
overseas Chinese I don't exact
proportion but they certainly control an
enormous amount of the wealth in much of
Southeast Asia and in fact if you look
at Japan's investment targets it
generally follows the overseas Chinese
this is one thing that the Australians
are very worried about and they notice
that Japanese investment is going into
places where the overseas Chinese
capitalist community is functioning
because Japan figures they can do
business with them and it's not going
into places like Australia which the
Australians figure probably correctly is
being targeted by Japan as a potential
third word third world resource area for
the emerging Japan based you know state
capitalist system in Asia which will in
which the overseas Chinese will have a
major role that's absolutely correct I
don't know what point you're driving at
though
yeah I agree it's important but nor from
the army yeah nor from the army the
there were some there were some Chinese
who were killed because in fact there
was popular resentment of yes the New
York Times tells a lot of different
stories but the there were some Chinese
who were killed that's true but the
majority of those slaughtered there good
studies of this academic and other
studies and it was known at the time the
majority the people who were killed were
landless Indonesian peasants there was
some target if you set forth you know
popular if you get the population fired
up and in a mood of massacre and
slaughter they'll also go after people
who they know exploit them
so the ethnic Chinese who were the
business men business classism Indonesia
they some of them got it in the neck
kind of the way Jews did in Eastern
Europe you know it was it's kind of a
similar situation they were the you know
the middlemen between the general
population and the real rulers so you
get pogroms against the guy who comes
and collects taxes from you and so on
but the main attack in Indonesia the
main slaughter in Indonesia was against
the the the popular base of the PKI the
the Indonesian Communist Party who are
mostly landless peasants if they had
gone after the Chinese business class as
the West wouldn't have been euphoric
about it
sir questions a little closer to home
No
twelve years ago
legal aid
secondly
there will be a lot more
why
III didn't understand what it what is
the connection
you talk first a few minutes ago
yeah how's that today today like the
fact that I'm in a privileged position
yeah as they've always been
I still don't understand the question in
the military structure yeah I mean right
around nine yea round I forget the exact
year but around 1970 or so the United
States switched from theoretically a
conscript army but it was mostly
theoretically because it's always got a
big class bias in it so a conscript army
with a class bias it shifted from that
to what in effect is a mercenary army of
the poor a professional army which we
call volunteers but that's a joke you
know they're volunteers in the same way
that people volunteer to be professional
boxers they don't volunteer from
Lexington where I live they
[Applause]
couple hundred years ago yeah so so
there is this thing that we call
volunteer which means you coerce people
into things by poverty and so on and we
switched over open much more openly to a
kind of class-based army professional
army that happened but I don't get
should it change I think it should
change dramatically I don't even think
we need an army I think we probably need
a militia the United States is an
unusual country we have absolutely no
enemies we haven't had a foreign enemy
since the war of 1812 when we when we
invaded Canada incidentally you know but
there's just no country and probably in
history that has had anything like the
security position of the United States I
mean has no enemies close by it controls
both oceans that is only allies on the
other side of both oceans it hasn't had
an enemy in you know since around the
Revolutionary War in fact we need an
army only you attack other people and
that's not a good reason in my opinion
yeah fellow standing up there
question about the United States
terrorism around the world of cases
where people here in this country have
prosecuted
yeah well you're the one who asked about
Air India and yeah right yeah okay
well the United States is by any measure
I can think of is the leading terror
state in the world I don't think anybody
comes close you know I've written a lot
about this if you like you can look at
details but it's not a possible option
to discuss in polite society
the phrase United States is a terrorist
state has no cognitive meaning and
what's called you know the you know the
words sort of sound like English but
they aren't really English so that can't
be discussed when we launch a terrorist
war against Cuba that's not terrorism I
don't even talk about the media here
because the corruption on this issue is
so deep that it goes totally through
scholarship I mean there's a whole
scholarly literature about terrorism
people like Paul Wilkinson and Walter
lecoeur and others you know terror
ologists they're sometimes called not by
people who like them but it's a big
academic discipline and if you look
through the scholarly studies that will
get praised in the journals and so on
they are astonishing so for example Cuba
takes a Walter lookers studying to
figure what it's called you know history
of terrorism or something he mentions
Cuba see and he has all kind of
innuendos that thanks I was hoping to
break in just for a second yeah
something has come up in the Donald
Bergy is we gather at Donald Bergy is
here
dorium for a moment did you want the you
want that microphone for that Donald
Bergy well whoever cute so take Cuba
there mentioned you know but and at Cuba
is mentioned while that you take a look
at the index find many references to
Cuba all kind of innuendos about well
maybe Cuba was involved in terrorism
here and maybe they supported this and
so on actually Cuba has definitely
involved in terrorism it's been the
target of more terrorism than the rest
of the world combined
namely and it's coming straight out of
Florida and it's not a big secret
Operation Mongoose which was started by
the Kennedy administration was a
murderous terrorist operation there's
nothing even remotely comparable to it
except maybe the u.s. war against
Nicaragua it's not clear whether to call
that terrorism or aggression but
whatever you if that's a great if that's
if we sort of give the United States the
benefit of the doubt and call it
terrorism not aggression then that
exceeded the us terrorists war against
Cuba but these things just aren't in the
Canon in fact it takes a this morning's
paper this morning's New York Times they
get with slightly more subtly these are
not subtle example but let's take a
slightly more subtle and therefore more
interesting example there's that I think
a front-page story by Judith Miller
about the Israel's holding three
Americans captive what's called in
prison meaning without access to lawyers
and oddly coming out with confessions
you know and they're being charged with
I guess it's not two are being charged
with raising money for terrorist
activities of Hamas well what are the
terrorist activities Hamas she's pretty
straight about it they kill Israeli
soldiers they try to kill Israeli
soldiers in the occupying army those are
the terrorist activities have become us
okay and there's a big and then there
comes a debate about whether they should
be allowed to raise money in the United
States to support these terrorist
activities okay that's one story you
over to another page and there's an
other story about Lebanon and it says
that on the anniversary of the of
Israel's assassination of chef Mousawi
and also incidentally his infant son and
the Hezbollah launched attacks against
Israeli occupying forces in southern
Lebanon unmentioned who are there in
violation of Security Council resolution
425 of March 1978 which called for their
immediate and unconditional withdrawal
and who have been carrying out a reign
of violent terror and atrocities in that
region ever since
all right then it describes those
activities and it says in the course of
any bother looking Israeli planes bombed
a bunch of Lebanese towns and killed you
know for many civilians okay now you
know the quite no question arises about
whether we should support Israeli
terrorism question arises should you
support Hamas terrorism not should you
support Israeli terrorism in other words
should we have tax free grants to people
who support Israeli terrorism or should
the United States government provide
Israel with aid that's just off the
spectrum you know it's like a third of
total American aid at this point it has
been much of it as a half so it can do
things like carry out terrorist
activities in in Lebanon which if
exactly what it's doing the Hezbollah
attacked on the on the Israeli occupying
forces in southern Lebanon is not
terrorism by anybody's definition in the
world except ours that's terrorism like
the Afghan rebels against the Russian
army what about the more subtle case but
you can't say that in the United States
you know it's like another thing without
cognitive meaning what about the let's
take the more subtle case the Hamas
terrorism against Israel what's called
here Hamas terrorism against Israel
meaning the attacks by Hamas this
fundamentalist Islamic group in the Gaza
Strip mostly against Israeli soldiers in
which several have been killed all right
no it's not those are not Hamas action
those are Arab actions but not FAMAS
actions as far as anybody says including
the government of Israel what the
government of Israel is the attacks on
civilians are definitely terrorism but
what is being discussed here is Hamas
military operations against Israeli
soldiers in the occupied territories
well as that terrorism actually here
there's a difference of opinion but it's
not a difference of opinion that's that
you can discuss in the United States the
difference of opinion has reached the
highest international forums to reach
the United Stated nations a couple of
years ago the United Nations forget what
in 1986-87 I think the United Nations
passed a General Assembly passed a
resolution condemning terrorism in all
its forms
big resolution you know denouncing every
form of terrorism and so on and so forth
it was passed 153 to two the two were
the United States and Israel it was
never reported here to my knowledge the
WYD of the United States and Israel vote
against this terrorism resolution well
the reason is because of a paragraph
that it contained which we were honest
we would call the South African
exception because that's what originally
motivated it and the paragraph says
nothing in something like this nothing
in this resolution shall infringe upon
the right of people to struggle against
military occupation and racist the
regimes some words like that meaning
specifically resistance against the
South African government is not
terrorism but of course it also applies
to resistance against the Israeli
military occupation
and since the US and Israel with South
Africa do regard this as terrorism they
voted against the resolution well for
the u.s. press that vetoes the
resolution terrorism means what the
United States government says it means
not what the rest of the world says it
means that hundred and fifty three
incidentally included all the u.s. NATO
allies and you know every
so here's two views on terrorism one of
which says that Hamas activities
operations against military for
occupying forces are not terrorism then
there's the US government position which
says they are terrorism the u.s. is off
the spectrum on this issue as on most
such issues can't get the Security
Council because we veto it but the
General Assembly you can't officially
veto so that's it as far as American
intellectuals are concerned and this is
like a hundred percent of them the u.s.
position defines terrorism right after
this resolution passed there were there
was a flood of articles in the paper
denouncing Yasser Arafat editorials in
New York Times and The Boston Globe and
Anthony Lewis and so on and so forth
then ancing yeah denouncing Yasser
Arafat for failing to produce what were
called then the magic words you know if
you remember back then for failing to to
renounce terrorism explicitly enough
he kept carrying out what Lewis Anthony
Lewis at the dissident extreme I should
say called the old are afoot fudge
namely never saying the words exactly
right and if you remember this this
charade that was going on right through
1988 well what was our effort actually
saying well if you bother to look what
he was saying is he endorses the UN
resolution on terrorism that is he
agrees with 153 of the countries of the
world and he disagrees with to the
United States and Israel well that's the
old Arafat fudge you know and we as long
as he's gonna do that obviously you
can't take them seriously and we can't
talk about Palestinian rights and so on
now it's not that there's a division of
opinion about this in the United States
this is a hundred percent first of all
the facts can't be reported try to find
if they've been reported
I mean I've written about them but you
know somebody who can reach the
mainstream I don't think the UN
resolution was even reported as far as I
know maybe it was I couldn't find it if
see if you can find anybody coming out
and saying wait a minute there's a
difference of opinion on
terrorism here there's the United States
on the one side then is the rest of the
world on the other maybe that difference
of opinion deserves to be aired
well these questions are impossible now
here's the sign of it to get back to
terrorism this is a more subtle question
about terrorism because you know there
at least is a difference of opinion
should we accept the South African
exception or should we join the rest of
the world and not accept it you know you
know that is insist upon the right of
people to resist racist and oppressive
regimes and military occupation of
course we do agree to it in the case of
people resisting say the Russians in
Afghanistan but not resisting guys we
like I say Israeli forces in Lebanon in
fact this is so extreme that well just
to give you an example the the chief
diplomatic correspondent in the New York
Times Thomas Friedman when he won his
last Pulitzer Prize was interviewed in
the press in Israel where he was it was
1988 April 1988 I remember because I was
there and I read the reports in the
press he was interviewed and he was
asked for his advice as to how Israel
should which Israel should do with the
occupied territories now here's what he
said he said Israel or to run the
occupied territories the way it runs
south Lebanon that is with a terrorist
military force and a mercenary army and
prison torture chambers to which the Red
Cross has never been allowed in but
where it's well-known that hideous
tortures go on to try to coerce the
local population into supporting the
Israeli run mercenary force he said
that's how Israel should run the
occupied territories but he said look on
a kind of ad of I think you should give
the Palestinians something because and
now I'm quoting if you give Achmed a
seat in the bus maybe he'll lessen his
demand okay now just try that out the
other way imagine in New York Times
correspondent and say Syria who wins a
Pulitzer Prize and is asked by the
Syrian press what do you think we ought
to do about Israel
he says well I think you ought to run
Israel the way you run Beirut you know
but I'm a dove so you ought to give the
Jews something because if you give Jaime
a seat in the bus
maybe he'll lessen his demands okay
would the next step be that this guy
becomes the chief diplomatic
correspondent of the New York Times
where nobody bats an eyelash well yeah
if you live in a super racist society
with Nazi values but we're talking about
us and that gets back to the issue of
terrorism and the fact that terrorism is
it's just a matter of logic that the
United States can't be involved in it
so therefore the fact that we have maybe
the biggest probably I don't think
there's any competition biggest
terrorist state in the world that
doesn't it's logically impossible and
therefore it doesn't matter what the
facts are the LA rebellions well you see
the LA rebellions are extreme you know
after all what what are the people in LA
so desperate about well you know I take
a look at LA and you see I mean the
thing that set it off was the Rodney
King beating but remember that's just
like lighting you know it's like
lighting a spark I mean there's
something going on well what's going on
is quite significant in fact has a lot
to do with NAFTA there used to be
employment in those areas there used to
be the United States we pretend we don't
have in state industrial policy but of
course we do it's called the military
system and that's a region where there
were a lot of military plants or you
know like aircraft industry which is
called a private industry that's just
completely state subsidized the there
was a big Pentagon base you know
production system around there which did
offer a degree of employment to poor
people you know they could get skilled
jobs and this and that the other thing
well that stuff is all declining part of
the reason it's declining is because
some American corporations can get
cheaper labor in high repression areas
like Mexico so the jobs are fleeing part
of the useful consequences of having
mass murderers like so hard to take over
in Indonesia is you can then get
extremely cheap labor there from you
know Indonesian women have come off the
farms and work for 14 cents an hour
until they drop dead Mexico has what's
called an economic miracle the way it's
described one aspect of the economic
miracle is that wages have dropped 60
percent in the last ten years
not that they were very high before so
there's a big flow of jobs too you know
the places like Mexico and other high
repression areas Caribbean Basin
initiative was an effort to use the very
successful degree of repression
throughout the whole Caribbean area to
lower jobs lower wages and hence
undermine American workers if you take a
look at an LA is suffering from that as
as much of the rest of the country if
you take a look at it's one of the major
things that's going on in the country
now in the world in fact one of the
major things that's going on in the
world is that there's much freer
movement of capital possible than there
was say 2530 years ago as a result
production is getting internationalized
and a consequence of that a corollary of
that is that the third world is getting
internationalized I mean as production
moves to high repression low wage areas
the wealthy countries at home lose
skilled work and the productive labor
that's done by the poorer segment of the
population because they can't compete
and we could compete of course we could
drive wages here down to the level of
Mexico and Indonesia in fact you know
doubtless a lot of people would like to
do it but that doesn't work so you just
move the jobs of overseas and keep the
profits at home well the end result is
you get what the business pages have
been calling the paradox of 92 weak
economy strong profits yeah of course as
long as the four as far as us-based
corporations are concerned this is all
great you know but as far as working
people are concerned it's a disaster
that's in fact what NAFTA is all about
to try to accelerate that so it takes a
biggest Corporation General Motors
everyone knows that GM is closing down
or
to close down about two dozen plants in
North America United States and Canada
GM has become the largest employer in
Mexico taking advantage of this 60
percent drop and wages under a brutally
repressive state incidentally but less
well known is the fact that about a year
ago German General Motors opened the big
high-tech 700 million dollar plant in
East Germany and there's big write-up
about it in the Financial Times in
London which is the best international
business press very upbeat write-up
about it saying that GM was now going to
be able to make use of the fact that the
Cold War was over and we now had this
big third world opening up again you
know after we won the Cold War and they
could move they could build a high-tech
plant in an area with skilled workers
you know healthy standards educated and
so on but workers who would be offered
none of the benefits of what they called
hampered West European workers and at
forty percent the wages okay that's part
of the problem Europe is having its part
of that's what the Cold War was about
you know the main thing the Cold War was
about was to restore it to the west
this traditional third world which
offers resources and so on but also
offers cheap labor which you can then
use to undercut the standards that have
been achieved and gained by the pampered
Western European workers or the pampered
workers in Los Angeles you know who got
to the point where they had won some
rights finally well they don't have that
anymore
they are superfluous just like the
people living in the favelas around Rio
de Janeiro they play in it they have no
useful role no you know you don't need
them for production because you can get
cheaper labor overseas you don't even
need them all that much for consumption
it's not it's not a national economy the
way it was in the days of Henry Ford's
day you know you go back to say the
1920s and Henry Ford had his big
innovation he was going to pay workers
raise workers wages he was in five
dollars an hour because he understood
the
unless he raised wages nobody was going
to be able to buy those Model T's well
that's true in a national economy but
it's much less true in an international
economy in an international economy you
can have production by highly repressed
easily replaceable labor somewhere and
you can produce for the wealthy sectors
internationally meaning in Europe and
the United States and Japan and even in
the third world where there is a small
but existing wealthy sector well that's
the direction in which an international
economy moves and one of the
consequences is you get the kind of
superfluous population in the rich
societies that you've always had in the
third world well in the third world you
control them with death squads so let's
say in Brazil which ought to be a very
rich country I had already run the
richest countries in the world it's been
cursed by the fact that it's been run by
the United States since 1945 totally the
economy has almost totally been run was
a fact it was called a it was called a
it was an experimental testing area for
capitalism it was described in 1945 with
great euphoria about the economic
miracles and successes that's not one of
the most for about 10% of the population
it's a tremendous success maybe 5% for
the rest it's kind of like Central
Africa because that's the way capitalism
works you know by comparison you know
Eastern Europe looks like a paradise for
most of the population without any of
the advantages they should say but the
effect is you know you move towards that
model now the United States is not going
to be Brazil we're not going to be safe
10% and 80% but because we're too rich a
country with too many achievements and
too many advantages but it's moving in
that direction you know you walk take a
walk in any in any city and you see it
you see the third-world picture
beginning to emerge take say Boston
Boston City Hospital last year globe a
couple good articles on this in fact
Boston City Hospital had to open a
malnutrition clinic
to treat cases of malnutrition at
third-world levels and even to use
triage because they don't enough
resources that the 'litham oh that's
something that hasn't been necessary
before and that's again a consequence of
the internationalization of the economy
everyone is aware that the US share and
say manufacturing production has
declined but fewer people are aware of
the fact that the share of us-based
corporations in manufacturing production
has not declined in fact we're supposed
to have a trade deficit but that's
largely a statistical artifact probably
something like maybe 40% of what moves
across the borders is internal to
particular corporations it's not trade
at all any more than its trade if in a
mom-and-pop grocery store if you move
the cornflakes from one shelf to another
this is just centrally met centrally
managed trade you know no free trade
nothing like that
centrally managed interchanges within
huge corporations which you know bring
back products produced by offshore
assembly plants to be put together here
finally and have more value added to
them or something like that well you
know under those conditions of course
you're going to get things like la
probably more and more
I'd read the New York Times to Israel
and I didn't read the same rocket I
think I read the same article you did
but I get the fact that you've got the
fact I got the back in my head anyway
that
that's what you wear in Israel from
Lebanon no from Lebanon yeah that's true
but this but not from Lebanon
infiltrating Israel have you read that
if it was the implication it was in your
mind because nobody reported it not that
anyone knows not that anyone knows
there's nobody I mean there's
occasionally been some infiltration
across the border from Lebanon very
rarely and the occasions that are known
are cases where they attack the military
base now your let's go back over the
examples you mentioned which are exactly
they are exactly what was reported but
now let's compare them with the facts
point one let me check me and make sure
if I get any wrong point when you say
the people that hung us the the people
the three men who were there South to
who are accused of funding Hamas the
charge against them was that they were
trying to disrupt the peace negotiations
right that hold on
where they kept them up Oh during the
night they didn't allow them to sleep
yeah they weren't because these are
Americans so you and you know they're
gonna get out sooner or later
no I didn't like sorry check back
there's a tape there's a tape I didn't
say they were torturing them I said
they're coming out with confessions and
people if you think it's fun to stand
for three days in a box like this with a
filthy sack over your head and not be
allowed to sleep and then be given given
a piece of paper in a language you don't
understand and say okay sign this and
you can sit down it you may not call
that torture and I don't want to argue
about it but those are the conditions
under which people give confessions
otherwise people don't make confessions
whether whether they're valid or not
just think about it but the the the
chart is you're absolutely right that
the people who are that Hamas is being
charged with under with opposing the
Pitts so-called peace negotiations is
that a crime is that is a crime I mean
if somebody is opposed to negotiations
that the United States is trying to run
which incidentally are based on the
principle that Palestinians have no
right and will be allowed no rights
suppose people are opposed to that is
that criminal
Israeli soldiers a handful have been
killed no I said exactly you didn't hear
me I said Hamas aims at Israeli soldiers
a Hamas aims at Israeli soldiers and
that's exactly what they're being
charged with but the question is is that
terrorism well as I said there are two
views on that topic
there's the view of the United States
and Israel which says yes it is
terrorism if you would aim at the
soldiers of an occupying army and
there's the there's the rest of the
world 153 other countries they say no
that's not there isn't well you can take
a choice on that one and but the point
my point about that is that that issue
is not discussable as far as the case of
Lebanon is concerned there is simply no
doubt that the operations are going on
inside Lebanon Israel invaded Lebanon in
1978 it has maintained forces in
southern Lebanon ever since simply
rejecting the Security Council
resolution as it can because the United
States tells them go ahead so they can
do whatever they like jury counsel
doesn't function when the u.s. blocks it
the and they have been carrying out a
reign of terror there
the terror goes into northern Lebanon so
the bombing yesterday was of cities like
Nava Thea which are outside the zone
that Israel in the SLA controls they're
bombing villages and killing people okay
you outside the United States I think
just about everybody calls that
terrorism as far as the so-called peace
negotiations are concerned two comments
for one thing if Hamas you're absolutely
right that Hamas as opposed to those
negotiations now however notice that
opposition to those negotiations is not
a crime in anybody's book furthermore if
we lived in a free society and to go
back to the guy I mean hero society
actually using its freedom we would
understand why Hamas as opposed to those
negotiations the u.s. press has yet to
publish the official US stand
those negotiations that's kind of a
slight oversight you know the United
States has had a position on those
negotiations an official position was
made official in December 1989 well
before the you know well before I don't
know saying attack equate anything like
that it's called the Baker plan you can
read about it in the State Department
bulletin you can read about it in
articles of mine and Z Magazine and so
on but try to find it somewhere well
here's what it says the u.s. position
stated by James Baker December 1989
still unchanged says that the only topic
under discussion in negotiations among
Israel and the Arabs is the so-called
chubbier plan actually this Shamir Paris
plan coalition plan of the labor and
laocoon that's it any Palestinians
permitted to the negotiations will be
permitted to discuss the modalities of
that plan and nothing else so we now
look back to the show mere Paris plan
which is also not published in the US
press though it is the official u.s.
position notice and here's what it says
as four principles a quota principle one
is there cannot be an additional
Palestinian state okay additional means
there already is a Palestinian state
namely Jordan and there can't be an
additional Palestinian state that's
principle one principle two is the
status of the occupied territories will
be determined in accord with the basic
guidelines of the Israeli government
okay
that's principal to principal three says
no PLO meaning the Palestinians are not
permitted to select their own
representatives for capitulation I have
some other representatives principle
four says there will be what are called
free elections under Israeli military
control with tens of thousands of
Palestinian leaders rotting away in jail
without charge those are the four
principles well you can understand why
the press doesn't report them and in
fact lies about them constantly not
because they don't
they know you know I can tell you
personally about that but you don't
report them well the people of Hamas
know you know they they're not stuck
with us indoctrination and one can
understand why Palestinians would be
less than happy about that negotiation
framework in fact what is called the
peace negotiations or the peace process
that's another idea that one might raise
some questions about what's called the
peace process in the United States is
whatever the US government is up to
that's the peace process if it now in
fact in the for the last 20 years for
the last 20 years 22 years since
February 1971 what the US government has
been up to in arab-israeli relations is
preventing any diplomatic settlement
preventing any diplomatic settlement
that's been true since February 1971
when President Sadat of Egypt offered
Israel a full peace settlement which was
almost exactly in line with official US
policy and the policy accepted
throughout the world and offered nothing
to the Palestinians well the u.s. had a
choice at that time was it going to
accept its own official policy Israel
rejected they refused to accept it
because they want to keep the
territories I was the Labour Party
incidentally the the United States had a
choice shall we go along with their own
policy or shall we pursue what Henry
Kissinger who was then national security
adviser called stalemate meaning reject
the possibility of a diplomatic
settlement there was an internal
bureaucratic battle about at the State
Department was in favor of settlement
Kissinger was opposed Kissinger won out
we followed the policy of stalemate
since that time the United States has
been alone in the world alone in the
world outside of Israel in blocking
every move towards a political
settlement
it's vetoed UN Security Council
resolution several times it's blocked
generals say it's voted down every year
by numbers like you know 144 to 2
150 1 2 3 and so on year after year in
the General Assembly on a political
settlement almost none of this ever gets
reported the u.s. opposition to the
peace process is called the peace
process well you know not everybody in
the world has to be as indoctrinated as
we are I mean okay we may be happy to go
along with this charade but it doesn't
mean everybody else in the world has to
and they can therefore ask questions
about whether the u.s. is pursuing a
peace process at all and the answer to
those questions will be well yes
pursuing a peace process based on the
principle that the u.s. is going to
unilaterally run the show Europe is not
allowed to have a finger in it because
they're going to say things about
Palestinian rights and that the
Palestinians are to have no rights as
stipulated in the Baker plan well okay
you can decide whether that's a peace
process or not one could debate this but
what in my view is not debatable that it
is atrocious for the whole intellectual
community including the media to
suppress all these facts instantly one
last comment I'll let you make your
point about the you mentioned and you
this correct the press has repeatedly
said this that the Israel claims that
these three are now to Palestine
American Arabs were sent to support
Hamas because the Hamas network was
disrupted by the 400 people expelled
that's been said over and over again
here's what has not been said however
which every American reporter in Israel
knows at least he's literate there was a
lead article in Haaretz the main
newspaper you know it's kinda like New
York Times you don't miss it
it was considered important enough so it
was even included in the weekly summary
by a well-known a couple of well-known
Israel and respective Israeli reporters
this is December 31st it's not new
saying that the shinbei secret police
you know that guys who run the occupied
territories a high official of the
govern
had announced that the shin bait had
selected six people to be deported okay
the government came back and said six
isn't enough so they managed to dig up a
seventh and that was it as far as the
security forces were concerned they
found seven people who they regarded as
you know through their networks as
perhaps involved in what they call
terrorist activities the rest of the 415
were added by the Romanian government
because they wanted a bigger number with
no security input now that sounds like
relevant information for people to know
and that information would add some
coloration to the question of whether
these people came in because the
security apparatus was disrupted in fact
the people who were picked up if he was
discussed in some detail and Israeli
press well I don't think that ran them
because they had beards for instance you
know like they got Christian Armenians
because they had beards and then they
had to throw them out they picked up
most of the staff of an Islamic
university I mean they went after the
educated classes in the among they are
funding what we call fundamentalists
it's true that they're from that sector
of the society but if they're if they've
been involved in any kind of military
activities or any other kind of
resistance activities it's a secret to
the Israeli secret police in bit
I'll give you this I'll be happy to send
you the article if you like I didn't say
they shouldn't I said if you can
understand reasons why they shouldn't
maybe they should maybe they should then
why did Jim then why did Jim Baker do it
okay if that is sorry I don't know you
mean if the US government has an
official if the US government if the US
government that's not what you know
let's see what
okay well let me repeat how it okay let
me repeat how I've as you put it cloud
of the issue Israel came to the
negotiations with an explicit plan
it was the coalition plan of the labor
and Likud the sham so-called Shamir it
was the Shamir Paris plan I read you
it's I quoted its four major provisions
the United States then came along and
said we are going to organize
negotiations in which one topic is
permitted to be discussed period the
Shamir Paris plan the Baker plan states
look it up in the State Department
bulletins that the only as five point
says the only issue under discussion in
the forthcoming negotiations the only
issue that the Palestinians will be
permitted to discuss is implement is the
modality of implementation of the Shamir
Paris plan now those are facts and I
think by stating those facts I haven't
clouded the issues I've clarified the
issues namely the framework in which the
US has organized the negotiations
there's more to it than that if you want
to proceed why is it that every year the
United States votes along with Israel at
the General Assembly against any peace
process as it does the most recent case
was December 1990 right in the middle of
a build up to correct war when the vote
was 144 to 2 and that's the way it goes
back every year
up in the Security Council because when
it does ravit to it if you take a look
there's always two issues always the
same two issues come up one the entire
world is calling for a negotiations
framework within an international in an
international framework with
international participation the US won't
allow that
we extended the Monroe Doctrine to the
Middle East back in the 1940s and it's
us turf nobody's allowed in the British
are allowed in because they are
considered loyal clients and I'll do
what we tell them but nobody else is
because they might be too independent
especially as Kissinger put it we have
to ensure that Europe and Japan
stay out of Middle East diplomacy okay
that's the basic US principle so 0.1 we
always vote against any proposal for a
peace process at the UN because it
always involves some international
element we won't allow that it's gotta
be unilateral us-run secondly every
every such statement you know you take a
look they wording changes over the years
a little but they're always the same and
that they they make some statement
however vague about Palestinian national
rights and the u.s. does not accept that
we do not accept that the Palestinians
have any rights therefore we vote
against any such negotiations that's why
there has never been a peace process
because we've blocked it at every turn
vetoing Security Council resolutions
voting alone or virtually alone with
Israel sometimes we pick up a third
country in the General Assembly blocking
initiatives from elsewhere there's a
long record of this finally after the
Gulf War the US was in a position to run
it to ram through its own principles
what happened is after the Gulf War
Europe backed off accepted for the first
time that this is u.s. turf they're not
going to interfere so the U of A
essentially u.s. was given carte blanche
to run it alone the third world has been
so demoralized that at the non-aligned
countries basically have no
any longer at all so they were out of
the game it now became a unilateral u.s.
position and therefore the US could ram
through its own framework namely the
Baker plan well I don't think it clouds
the issue to state these points I think
it clarifies the issue to state these
points you can draw your own conclusions
about that but it seems to me that the
job of the press if there were a free
press would be to present these facts
not to present consistent lies about it
now given the actual facts the question
still arises how should the various
participants react like should the
Palestinians take part well you're gonna
have very sweet frankly if you ask my
opinion I think they probably should
despite the fact that you know to give
away that you know that they're being
essentially cut off from any possible in
fact what they're being offered as one
of the top Israeli correspondents put it
no big dove incidentally not even
Rubenstein maybe you know um he writes
in English too
he's one of the main correspondents it's
covered the occupied territories for
years not a great though but he knows
the area very well what he pointed out
is that the Palestinians are being
offered they're being offered with
autonomy but he said it's the autonomy
of a POWs camp in which the po2 POWs are
allowed to run their own cultural
affairs and cook their own meals and
that's it and that's about accurate he
also pointed out that no one has ever
called even the far right for a full
annexation because if Israel went to
full annexation it would have to have
some responsibility for the population
which doesn't want to take simply to
fill in the story under the rub in
government there's a new study by peace
now you can get in English in fact a
detailed study of settlement by peace
now which is a sort of a moderate you
know organization pretty close to the
Labour Party looking at Robyn's plans
for settlement and the occupied
territories and they point out they give
a detailed analysis pointing out that
Roe beans plans are basically the same
planned except that more Palestinians
50% more according to them will be
incorporated under the Israeli run
sectors under the Rabine plan than under
the former plans so in other words it's
harsher than before well okay
does it cloud the issues to state these
facts that are coming from mainstream
Israeli sources or it doesn't clarify
the issues well you know that's for you
to judge but I think it clarifies me
[Applause]
Australian finalized that treaty which
is approximately equivalent to say Libya
having made a treaty with Iraq to
exploit and kwaity oil after the Iraqi
invasion of an annexation of Quade be
kind of a close analogue to it the it's
an issue in Australia so the in
Parliament one of the reasons - an issue
in Australia I don't know if this came
up in the film or not is that during the
Second World War
about 40,000 temari's were killed
defending a couple hundred Australian
guerrillas who were they are trying to
keep the Japanese from taking it over
and using it as a springboard for an
expected invasion of Australia and they
did do that at a huge cost the theme
worries and in return and thanks for
this Australia's the only country that
has officially recognized the Indonesian
annexation and has been giving as much
support as it could to the ongoing
atrocities and has now entered into a an
agreement with Indonesia to exploit the
oil well this came up in the Australian
Parliament people were upset the Foreign
Minister Gareth Evans explained that as
he put it the world is an unfair place
littered with examples of acquisition by
force there is no legal obligation not
to recognise a forceful annexation that
was in one voice on the other side of
his mouth
at the same time he and Prime Minister
were again lots of inspiring rhetoric
about how thanks to the courage and
integrity of the anglo-saxon countries
defending quake from Saddam Hussein
small countries now know that big
neighbours can't get away with attacking
them and so on this all goes on at
exactly the same time should say one of
the great pleasures of my life was to
have been denounced by Gareth Evans the
Foreign Minister of Australia the
Foreign Minister of Great Britain and
the Dutch foreign minister within a few
weeks in manova 1991 Indonesia made a
tactical mistake
it's a stupid mistake to conduct a
massacre in front of television cameras
and to especially to practically beat to
death to American reporters when a
country does things like that they
usually pay for it you can conduct all
kinds of massacres off screen and if
you're the right country nothing ever
happens but when you conduct a massacre
on screen especially if there are
American victims you have to go through
a certain well-known charade which is
called an investigating Commission which
constructs the appropriate whitewash and
you tap some lower officials on the
wrists and the media the Western media
applaud you for your magnificence being
willing to face up to the atrocities and
after that the arms keep flowing and so
on and so forth so we went through that
charade immediately afterwards Hill &
Knowlton which is their PR firm probably
wrote the script for the for the
whitewash but something went wrong what
went wrong was that by then amazingly I
would never
yes that this would ever happen myself
but public the public reaction in the
United States had reached the point
where pressure on Congress was
sufficient to cause something quite
remarkable to happen the US the Congress
terminated we put a barrier
it'll be evaded but put a barrier on
military in Indonesia that had never
happened before this if you trace it
back was the result of some extremely
dedicated work over many many years by
literally a handful of people actually
you get four or five people you know or
even fewer Arnold Cohen in Washington
probably deserves about ninety percent
of the credit case of Australia it was
having having been in London and quoted
these remarks simultaneously which in
like for one reason because he's looking
for a Nobel Peace Prize for helping
broker the Cambodia settlement well this
has been when I say Australia made the
agreement on the oil that's a cover that
mean that's cover for all Western oil
companies by now I think right through
the Gulf War Western oil companies moved
in to start exploring and lifting oil
and so on I think by now last I heard
there's about fifteen of them who were
stealing fee Murray's oil while the
atrocities continue and the terror
continues and the torture continues and
silence continues be surprised if many
of you have read anything about this
anywhere although it's all going on it's
still slipping between the cracks is
Carl Meyer put it the couple of a couple
of months ago the head of the team
raised resistance
Shana now was captured near Dilli nobody
heard from for quite a while
obviously tortured his family and lots
of other people were then started being
picked up around team were evidently
they were able to get information out of
him
not because he gave it when people give
information
and signed confessions that's an almost
certain indication that they're being
tortured nobody does it under any other
circumstances they're talking about that
again you know the West has to pretend
they don't understand this and in the
case of the right people it is so
they're the terror has apparently
increased again but the fighting
continues as well the fact that the US
is withholding military aid is not
insignificant for the Indonesian that's
a kind of warning a warning that they
may not be able to get away with it
forever
despite the loyalty of the media despite
the support of the Western societies
it's not just the United States it's
virtually the entire West countries like
Sweden France hollom all in there to try
to enrich themselves as much as they can
through participation and what is
probably the worst this over the last 17
years after the daily massacre a
grassroots organization did develop and
it contributed to what he's been doing
he had been able to reach a number of
for the most part right-wing congressmen
through a Bible study group that was
organized by Tony Hall who had gotten
upset about the atrocities and despite
the media cover-up and despite the
government support and so on enough
protests developed around the fringes so
that Indonesia got more than the
expected rap on the on the knuckles now
it doesn't it won't matter much unless
it continues because as I say it'll of
course be evaded these things always are
and other countries like particularly
Britain had been very cheerful had been
very happy to fill the gap and to enrich
themselves by sending arms immediately
after lots of high-flown rhetoric about
the how we have to stand up against
aggression and the Gulf and so on and so
forth
Britain Britain was even you know lofty
or on this than we were the British
immediately entered into the largest
Terry contract with any a.cian country
British Aerospace entered into a big
contract for fighter planes and other
advanced aircraft Indonesia so that it
can continue to maintain the repression
on the side quietly something quite
important was happening in 18 1989
Australia had signed a treaty with
Indonesia to exploit the oil of the
Timor gap the sea between Timor and
Australia has been expected for a long
time to be a major oil resource in fact
that's one of the main reasons why the
west supported the Indonesian takeover
and Massacre figuring that be an easier
way to exploit the oil than with an
independent country and in 1980 December
1989 I think it was
[Music]
- program here tonight and you wanna
mention that we have a 10 o'clock curfew
and Noam Chomsky has a very busy
schedule he's off tomorrow to Berlin
going Film Festival where and last week
[Music]
[Applause]
well the most interesting way to conduct
this evening would be for you to start
in and raise the questions and issues
that you're interested in and we can
pick up from there I'm always prepared
to speak from 0 to infinite ly many
minutes but that's much less interesting
so I'm sure many of you have things on
your mind if you would like to just open
up we can do that or also I can talk
about some of the general issues not the
film specifically update us on East
Timor well as of when
as if doesn't mean updating from when
well the the main things that have
happened well let's just go back to the
dealy massacre
