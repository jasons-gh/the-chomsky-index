the MIT alternative news collective
sponsors this and other progressive
events on mi t--'s campus and produces
the Thistle a newspaper wearing the
progressive and creative minds of MIT
and the surrounding community can share
their work born in the midst of the
campus protest against apartheid in
South Africa in 1987 the Thistle is
consistently explored unjustified
decision making in many aspects of MIT
affairs over the past seven years as a
collective members are able to
participate all and alternately
coordinate every aspect of newspaper
production we hope and have many reasons
to believe that the actions and presence
of the Thistle on the campus has helped
improve the experience of students staff
and faculty of the Institute and
hopefully has inspired people to
continue to support progressive causes
however to continue these contributions
the collective needs your support the
donation that was asked at the door is
not only going to help provide events
like tonight's talk but will also help
purchase supplies to produce the paper
more importantly we encourage all
interested people to join with us by
attending a collective meeting we meet
every Wednesday evening in the MIT
Student Center if you're interested
please sign up on the sheet that was at
the front door and will be passed around
during the talk we hope to see you at
next week's meeting tonight the MIT
alternative news collective is proud to
present professors Israel shock and Noam
Chomsky two of the world's foremost
analyst of Middle Eastern issues there
will be time at the end of the speeches
for members of the audience to ask
questions and make very brief statements
therefore we ask that everyone please
respect each other's desire to hear the
speeches in their entirety at this time
I would like to turn the floor over to
Professor Noam Chomsky who will
introduce professor shock
well my instructions about 15 minutes
ago were to say a few things about
Middle East and then to make a few words
of introduction to Israel shikaka know
an old friend I realized on the way over
that my files are full of fascinating
and highly informative correspondence
with him over many years I guess about
25 years now but I've never heard him
give a talk
I don't think and I'd like to remedy
that tonight and would prefer to listen
rather than to give a talk myself and
urge you to as well but since I'm
obedient and follow instructions I will
spend a few moments commenting however
not about the announced title on which I
have actually nothing to say except what
I've learned from him and you can hear
it from him but on another topic that I
know something about and that also has
special importance for me and I think it
should for most of you and that is the
u.s. role in the Middle East the special
importance is obvious first of all
that's our responsibility and that means
that we can do something about it it's
within our power to change and secondly
the responsibility happens to be huge I
mean it's huge in most of the world but
in this case it's just overwhelming the
US has an overwhelmingly influential
role in the affairs of the region at the
in last few years the United States has
in effect succeeded in all long-standing
objective of pretty much extending the
Monroe Doctrine over the Middle East the
Gulf War in my opinion was basically
intended from the US point of view to
teach the world that lesson get
everybody else to back off and to
recognize as George Bush put it
elegantly in the middle of the war that
what we say goes that's the lesson of
the New World Order he said
and that lesson is particularly to be
applied in the Middle East region which
way back 50 years ago the State
Department described as the a stupendous
source of strategic power and the
greatest material prize in world history
the eastern great one the greatest prize
in the world in the field of foreign
investment and one that the US was
certainly going to take over not because
of the enormous only because of the
enormous wealth and profits from oil
production and so on but because holding
that region as a lever for world control
and that was well understood and it's
fully explicit in the internal record
and it influences of course
determinative lis influences the the
policy record just in passing I should
say that in the older areas of the
Monroe Doctrine the question of other
people getting in our way isn't an issue
and so takes a Cuba the United States is
now in the what they hope what planners
hope is the final stage of crushing cube
of getting them to say uncle to borrow
the words of George Shultz when he was
referring to the Palestinians talking to
his boss a few years ago he complained
that the Palestinians were saying uncle
uncle uncle ole ole ole but they never
really came right out and said uncle and
for a real first rate thug you got to
make sure that your victims you know own
up properly and do what you tell them
you know they've got a grovel properly
or else to you they're you know that the
world doesn't learn the lessons about
what we say goes Cuba's gotta learn
those lessons too and they have to
suffer particularly because they've been
standing up and trying to follow a
course of Independence for 30 years just
a few weeks ago there was a vote in the
United Nations 101 to to condemning the
latest phases of the US embargo and Cuba
specifically designed by the Clinton
administration to block food and
medicines about 90 percent of what's
block is indeed food and medicines to
make sure that plenty of children star
to death and so on the vote was as I
said 101 to two the two were the United
States and Israel that's change from the
year before when the United States also
managed to pick up Romania and now only
Israel's left and that has to do with
the Middle East in fact one of the minor
services that Israel is supposed to
provide this is only one of the minor
ones is to sort of make sure that they
vote with the boss when it's necessary
and to support any outrage that the boss
commits and for that they get a huge
subsidy I mean it's no comparison in
world affairs and that maintains a
wealthy but largely artificial society
very rich but on a foreign dole which
you and I pay for and that dole is in
fact as well Human Rights Watch the
leading international human rights walk
monitor a couple of months couple of
months ago published a book another book
in which they pointed out once again
that US aid to Israel is flatly illegal
it's in flattened violation of US law
because US law quite explicitly forbids
any aid military or other aid to
countries which systematically torture
and abuse their citizens and this book
of Human Rights Watch was just yet
another extensive documentation of the
fact that that's exactly what we pay for
however we should point out that this is
no big problem by the standards of
international lawlessness in which the
u.s. is certainly a major player and in
fact well in the lead I think this is
pretty small potatoes well a few remarks
about the US and Middle East I won't
talk about what's actually going on now
I think if you think about the
background that all sort of follows if
you can almost deduce what's happening
the United States has a general
strategic conception as to how to run
the strategically most important area in
the world and the greatest material
prize in world history it's one that the
u.s. pretty much picked up from the
British
who used to run the place before we
kicked them out the the idea is that
there's to be several layers of control
first of all there have to be what the
big thing is oil of course so there has
to be what the British in the old days
called an Arab facade meaning local
managers who do our work for them and
who we pretend are independent because
that's a way to sort of keep down you
know nationalist feelings and so on and
so forth but they're just an Arab facade
and as the British put it in secret
records now declassified was back in the
First World War the British will
continue to run the place behind various
sort of constitutional fictions they
said like buh first aid and other things
but that's the Arab facade they have to
be weak because we have to make sure
that they'll do exactly what we say or
else we toss them out so there has to be
an array of local managers that's
essentially what the Gulf dictatorships
are there are local managers who JA
whose job is to make sure that the huge
profits from oil flow to the West not to
the people of the region that's
crucially the case and British
understood it it's even more important
in the last 30 or 40 years now the
people of the region happen to be
backwards and unenlightened you've all
know known about that and they somehow
don't understand why the wealth of their
region has to flow to Westerners not to
them and since they can't seem to get
this through their heads no matter how
much we try to explain it to them they
have to the Arab facade has to be
protected against the local from the
local population and for that you need
what the Nixon administration called
local cops on the beat local military
forces will kick them in the face if
they get the wrong ideas and if they're
if the local security forces can't
handle it so the second layer of control
has been an array of jean d'armes
Turkey Iran under the Shah Pakistan has
played that role for a time and Israel's
Retton Center especially since 1960s is
one of the core elements of the Zhang's
armory and certainly that was recognized
by the Joint Chiefs of Staff as far back
as 1948 us they were very impressed by
Israel's military victories in that war
and concluded again in secret documents
now Declassified that Israel's could
serve they said the second it was second
only to Turkey they felt at the time as
a military base which could be used to
project military power particularly
important now the British were
withdrawing from the region and the US
was moving in and needed its own local
cops on the beat
well that's Israel's rule now the then
in the background of course is the
United States and its British client who
that's the muscle that you bring in in
case things really go wrong so that's
the strategic conception the people the
rights that various participants have
depends on their role within this
framework so the local Arab facade the
these brutal dictatorships that run the
most of the oil States they have rights
as long as they do their job I mean if
they ever try to get out of line they'll
be gone very quickly it won't take long
but as long as they perform there you
know certain would do their job they're
supposed to then they have rights as for
the local cops on the beat same story
they have rights as long as they
continue to do their jobs they get a
line at the end of their rights in the
United States of course has rights by
definition so we don't have to ask about
that the end Britain too as long as it's
you know it's our lieutenant in the
region
well you consider Israel and Palestine
two contestants in the former Palestine
Israel and Palestinian Israel definitely
has rights first of all because of its
local services and also because it
performs many other services of which
that vote the UN is just the symbolic
illustration symbolic of much more
significant things like for example when
the Carter Administration the human
rights administration was prevented by
congressional legislation from sending
military aid
it's favorite mass murderers in
Guatemala and in fact it didn't send the
eight anyway as later turned out but
couldn't send enough and participate
actively enough and the mass murders
that were going on there it was possible
call on Israel to do the job for us and
that's happened all over the world and
that's a major service quite apart from
the regional ones incidentally all of
these will continue they have absolutely
nothing to do with the Cold War and they
will continue irrespective of the Cold
War that's propaganda
so that's Israel's right it's a lot of
Rights because they do a lot of things
and that's essentially what the huge
subsidies about well what about the
Palestinians you have to ask what
service do they perform the US power and
the answer is none therefore they have
no right that follows just logically
anybody who doesn't who understands the
least thing about world affairs
recognizes that if you don't perform any
services to the powerful your human
rights are zero in fact in the case of
the Palestinians is worse their rights
are actually negative because they
perform a disservice their displacement
and their problems and so on caused
disruption in the region and and other
people get upset not the leadership like
the Saudi Arabian elite couldn't care
less but the local populations do and
makes them harder to control and so on
so the Palestinians in fact have
negative rights and again that follows
just by the normal calculus of world
affairs when you penetrate beyond the
stuff you taught in school and so on and
you look what actually happens in the
world this is all sort of elementary
well from these facts you can pretty
much be deus close to deduce policy and
the course of events given you know who
has the determinative role and even in
particular deduce pretty closely the
diplomatic record which is quite
straightforward for the last twenty
years at least actually more the
diplomatic record has been pretty much
like the line up at the UN on a Cuba
vote US and Israel versus the world and
there are good reasons for that there
are two issues that have been crucial
both of them related the UN to four
to the main you know the main security
council resolution having to do with the
region which is ambiguous in various
respects and two issues have arisen one
is the issue of withdrawal to the
international borders on that issue the
United States and Israel stand alone in
opposing withdrawal of I mean there are
a few marginal exceptions but you know
in any buddy mounts to anything in
policy formation it's the US and Israel
versus the world on that one and has
been for since 1971 in fact before that
it was Israel alone and the second issue
is rejection ISM the u.s. leads the
rejectionist camp and now here I'm using
the term rejection isn't an
unconventional non racist sense the
standard the West is so racist that the
standard usage is fully racist and
nobody even notices it rejection ISM in
the non racist sense means rejection of
the claim the national rights of either
of the two contenders for national
rights in the former Palestine Israeli
Jews and the indigenous population but
in the West rejection ISM simply means
rejection of the rights of Israeli Jews
rejection of the rights of Palestinians
is not called rejection ISM it may be
wrong to call that just straight rate
furthermore nobody notices that I should
say it's the fact that no one notices
that it's a racism the policy itself is
understandable if we were to use race
rejection ISM and the non racist sense
we would have to conclude that the US is
the leader of the rejectionist camp and
that doesn't look nice in New York Times
headlines so therefore but that's the
issue the issue is rejection ISM and on
that again it's essentially the US and
Israel against the world well because of
this the US has had to block every
diplomatic initiative over the last
several decades fundamentally for these
reasons I feel like the US has had the
veto Security Council resolutions its
voted with votes like one hundred and
fifty to two and so on usual to on in
the General Assembly it's blocked other
independent initiatives and essentially
there's been no diplomacy well that
instantly all of this has to be
suppressed and it is
efficiently suppressed in the United
States you just even try to find the
basic facts you know you're gonna have
to go way out of the mainstream
suppression of crucial elementary facts
is easy in a highly conformist
intellectual culture and that's what
Aires is really deep totalitarian strain
so you can throw history you can murder
history as much as you like and nothing
happens this is one of the extreme cases
but the record is very clear the current
peace process what's now called the
peace process if you look at it the
timing is quite significant it began in
Madrid in the fall of 1991 right after
the Gulf War that is right after we had
made it extremely clear to Europe and
the third world and everybody else that
what we say goes so get out of here and
we're gonna run it ourselves
and they understood and that led to what
is called with to a genuine peace
process that is one that the press some
respectable commentators and so on can
call the peace process as they do
because it's unilaterally run by the
United States with no one else
interfering and therefore the United
States is able unilaterally to ram
through its two crucial objectives one
no withdrawal to the international
borders and two no rights whatsoever for
the Palestinians and that's what we're
watching unfold just follow the story
day by day and you see it happening of
course you have to decode but you know
you had to decode if you were living in
Russia under Stalin - you couldn't just
take what appeared in Pravda and assumed
it was literal you had to know how to
read it and the same is true here just a
couple of months ago there was a
interesting article in Haaretz the
leading sort of major US journal by
somebody who a lot of you know Tania
Reinhardt what I say well Israeli
journal it's sort of I sometimes call it
the Israeli New York Times but that's
too insulting to her I don't
call it that yeah actually this was one
of many articles that Israel translated
and distributed one of his many services
to all of us this honey is a actually no
personal friend but also a lot of you
know her she taught here she was just
got her PhD here actually some of her
students are here
she had an article in Haaretz in which
she described quite accurately what's
happening she said it's a mistake to
compare there's a lot of talking about
how what's going on in in Israel in
occupied territories is like the end of
apartheid
you know Mandela all that kind of stuff
and she says that's completely wrong
it's like the onset of apartheid it's
like what was going on in South Africa
in the 1950s when the vicious apartheid
system was established in fact which he
said is what is being created as things
kind of like bantu stands which will of
course be recognized
just as South African racists and some
of their friends abroad recognized the
ban occluding Yisrael I should say
recognized the bantha stands there but
in fact what is being established is
very reminiscent respects to South
African apartheid with the Bantu stands
and I think she's quite accurate about
that just in the last year ever since
the Oslo agreements Declaration of
Principles there has been about a 10%
increase in Israeli control of land and
the occupied territories it's up to
about three quarters now and the
increase in settlement is approximately
the same you're paying for it and I'm
paying for it all of this is funded by
the US taxpayer couldn't happen
otherwise which means they have to be
kept in ignorance of what they're doing
because very few people would like it if
they knew what they were doing and
indeed they are kept in ignorance that's
what people go to colleges like MIT for
to learn to internalize the kind of
values that'll make them play the role
that's required in suppressing the
crucial facts about the world from the
you know mass of the population we have
to remain an ignorance so if we do our
job
you know we faculty members you'll be
able to do this kind of stuff the
there's a more general point and that is
that the United States and Israel too
would like very much to formalize there
have always been kind of tacit
relationships between the various
sectors of control like the you know
Saudi Arabian dictatorship and the John
d'Armes Israel and so on and these
relationships existed even when they
were formally at war for each other with
each other so there was a period when
Saudi Arabia was formally at war with
Iran and Israel but it was actually very
close to both of them and because they
had the same interest you know
controlling the population and the
leadership would like to raise those
relations to a more formal over level so
they can function more effectively
that's what the conference was about in
Morocco the last couple of days which
has been all over the newspapers
the long term goal would be to turn the
region into something that is profitable
much more it's already extremely
profitable for enrichment but there's
always more and you want more enrichment
so you want people just a couple of at
the Morocco conference and in The New
York Times they quoted Adnan Khashoggi
who's one of the major gangsters in
Saudi Arabia very gun-running probably
narco trafficking and every crazy he was
in the iran-contra thing and so on he
was talking about what the great
opportunities they would now have for
investment in the occupied territories
if things would work properly a couple
of months ago The Wall Street Journal
had marvelous article about a joint
venture between Adnan Khashoggi in Saudi
Arabia and Yaakov named rody who I guess
is about is maybe his closest equivalent
in Israel I don't know another you know
runner gangster etc and they were they
were setting up a joint and venture I
think getting gas there's nothing to try
to see if they could make some money
ripping off the World Bank and other
people who are poor it is supposedly
gonna be pouring development funds into
there well you know there are a lot of
possibilities there the long term what
the law if you're for the rational
imperialists the idea would surely be to
try to turn the occupied territories
into something like the Caribbean Basin
and then the Palestinians will in fact
have a role they'll have the same role
as Haitians or Salvadorans or say these
Chinese women who burned to death and
locked into factories making toys that
rich Westerners will end
so give buy for their children and
Christmas at least if they get that
blood wash often time and so on that's a
kind of role that most of the third
world is supposed to play and there's
every reason why the Palestinians should
be able to play that kind of role too
there's only really one thing blocking
it and that's what Israel's going to be
talking one of the things we'll be
talking about and that's Israeli racism
if the racism may be so high and so hard
to overcome that they'll simply be
unable to participate in turning the
territories into a kind of Caribbean
Basin kind of Haiti or something which
would be the rational thing to do
that would mean running getting the
population to be run by local by their
own terrorists you know but what we call
security forces the gangsters we train
and control to run their own populations
and we move in if they're out of control
so a kind of a Palestinian Shin bait
secret polices and sometimes even called
already
and then to move as some Israeli
industrialists have said to move openly
to go from what they call colonialism to
neo colonialism that would be the
rational approach on the other hand it's
like I don't know if it'll happen but
it's possible that Israel will choose a
different course which is to implement a
the thinking of the Israeli Foreign
Office back in 1948 of course of the war
when they predicted these I should say
are the kind of doves you know if you
look at
spectrum they predicted that the Palace
of quoting the Palestinians will die or
turn into human dust in the wastes of
society and join the most impoverished
classes in the Arab countries
well that isn't good for investment but
you know has other benefits as far as
the u.s. there is of course a third
possibility that is that the US could
join the rest of the world and abandon
its firm rejectionist stand and its
opposition to withdrawal and then other
options could open up including
longer-term ones which might be rather
beneficial to all the people in the
region if not to foreign investors well
as far as far as these options are
concerned I think for the United States
as a matter more or less of indifference
these are kind of details from the point
of view of u.s. global planning sites
are set much higher and the fate of a
little more human dust is sort of
probably below the threshold I'm
speaking now of planners and investors
and respectable intellectuals and
leading elements generally others will
draw their own conclusions based on
human values which are very remote from
those of the reigning intellectual
culture well human values is what Israel
Shoppach has been defending with great
courage and integrity for many years
he's formerly a professor at the Hebrew
University or well-known organic chemist
and but he's known to us primarily not
first-night epic work but for his
leading role in absolutely leading role
and human and fighting for human rights
in in that region and indeed anywhere
over the years I've had a lot of contact
with human rights activists all over the
world and I have I can't think of many
if any people who I would rank with him
and the kind of work he's done he's he
will be talking I
they're about material related his
recent book which was which actually got
a major review and our it's the leading
Israeli journal by any beta left me
another common friend and narrated a
very favorable and Merritt well-merited
review and I just like to turn it over
to him and now I can satisfy my
curiosity in here a speech not just a
real letter
thank you very much although I will
indeed try to introduce some material
from my book
I will mostly devote my presentation to
questions of human rights and how they
affect the Israeli policies simply
because I always considered that with
all my passion for various kinds of
scholarship the human rights and
alleviating human suffering have to come
first
the general subject of my presentation
will indeed have to do with
fundamentalist but not what a
fundamentalist group in this case Jewish
is doing by itself but how
fundamentalistic thinking and theories
are affecting the practices the tourism
practices of the State of Israel the
territories of course in Israel too but
I will omit that from the consideration
for this time and how actually they
thought this ideology which is strictly
followed by the secular state for
various reasons our is try is making the
peace process the Oslo Cairo peace
process which is actually very
profitable to Israel and which is
everything that no one thought we have
said it is into by now something very
unrealistic meaning that there are if a
state is enslaved more to ideology than
to profit
it cannot self profit you know there is
that great saying you cannot serve God
and Mammon maybe instead of God we
should substitute other things in this
connection but certainly you cannot
serve racist ideology as I will you
better listen so and conduct realistic
policies
well let us say which will bring
investors to the area I will begin with
problem of land first of all it came to
exist after 27 years of occupation and
as it continued after Oslo meaning in
the last 14 months at the time that Oslo
agreements were signed September 1993
about 70 percent of the West Bank at
about 30 percent of the Gaza Strip came
into possession into ownership of the
State of Israel I will not discuss here
for lack of time how they came into
possession of status of Israel just as I
will not discuss how much of the Fed
most of federal land in the United
States became federal land the most
important thing for me is to say that
officially not socially but officially
land which belongs to State of Israel is
used only for benefit of Jews let me get
it very very accurate when you read in
your media about Israeli settlements
this is not correct you are not intended
for all Israeli citizens of whom 17
percent are Palestinians actually let me
add at this point that out that they are
Israeli Palestinians who serve in the
army in fact in increasing numbers there
are Israeli Palestinians who let us say
reached in the army the rank of Colin L
some of them were even governor's or
usually deputy governors of West Bank
and Gaza Strip District but the
important point is yet an Israeli Colin
L who is not Jewish cannot benefit from
70 percent of the area of West Bank
and from the 30% area of the Gaza Strip
but the important fact of course is not
the Israeli Colin L thesis illustration
important fact is that the first thing
in my opinion that you should know about
Palestinians and their feelings in the
territories and also out of the
territories because the land is also
denied to Palestinian diaspora
Genta Palestinian from the West Bank C
70% of the land of his land on which
which is not only confiscated from him
but on which he cannot do anything he
cannot rent it he cannot either
apartment or a physic he cannot do is it
everything while the land is open to
officially and legally to all the Jews
before going to the implication of the
word all the Jews in this respect let me
give you let me give you some additional
figure or additional set of figures you
know being natural scientist I cannot
escape from feeding people with with
numbers I said right now that 30 percent
of the Gaza Strip the subsequent set
which was left under Israeli ownership
all belongs to the State of Israel the
number of the people on that thirty
percent is six thousand the number of
the people of the remaining 70% is eight
hundred thousand this by itself
I called apartheid the situation in Gaza
Strip before and of course in the West
Bank
- before Oslo and after Oslo is a
situation of a partridge
I could add many other details that
majority of Gaussian water is given to
the six thousand settles on the seven
thirty percent of the area there is a
nice pleasure
like in one of those areas well water in
the rest of Gaza Strip is nearly bring
harms to help it is on the border of
bringing hamper but I will go to
something much more significant in the
West Bank
if you thought takes out 70% of land
deny to Palestinians and ask yourself
what is happening to them then the
answer will be that 16% has been given
to the settlers to the Jewish settlers
again IRA I emphasize Jewish circles not
Israeli settlers but 54% of the land
stands empty it was not distributed it
was confiscated it stands empty I can
flatter myself judge for many very many
years I've reformed very many
friendships among Palestinians of the
West Bank as many others and I would say
and my opinion is supported by many
other Israeli Jews not necessarily those
of my opinion that had the Israeli
government after Oslo taking those 54
percent more than half empty lengths of
the West Bank empty I mean emptied of
course they were not empty before or let
us now take plainly half of the area of
the West Bank which was robbed of its
rightful Palestinian owners but it was
not given to anyone else and giving it
back to the fur policy and farmers the
Oslo process could push could be pushed
forever for quite a number of years with
all its consequences I am now not
entering the consequences I fully agree
with no I'm Chomsky about the
consequences but and I know also that
Israeli government considers
the Oslo process is very much for
benefit but ideology of not given giving
back the land which as a point in my
book was already redeemed redeemed
meaning being given to Jews as
possession of the Jewish state giving it
back to non-jews in this case
Palestinians and causing the lender for
to become unredeemed again was most more
important than every political
consideration that I said that every
counting of profit let me say something
about Palestinian side in this business
Palestinians everywhere but specially in
the West bed have a are using an Arabic
were so much so much means attachment by
this they are expressing I think very
justly in a slogans are attachment to
the land because if you look through the
youth what has happened to the
Palestinians in Palestine you see that
they have been driven East and what they
desire in my view of course which can be
disputed or contested but in my view
based on my very many Palestinian
friends is that the process will not
only stopped but to at least to symbolic
or extensive sense reversed meaning that
after a process in which always
Palestinian plans were been taken over
and never returned even in if some of
you know about the Israeli village
government accrete I am managing to the
job yet just in passing that a
modernized village in Israel called
Baram whose actually people of would
impart help Israel invaded Lebanon
because they are more or not still they
have its land not returned
against F all president and all benefit
if therefore those empty lands contrary
to existing settlement in which as let's
say half realist I admit they would have
been called what is called trouble
opposition demonstration and so on there
is always trouble in coming to justice
when when the robber already has
something in his possession but I am
emphasizing you something which would
not have carried trouble except
ideologic trouble and this didn't happen
the certain point meaning that either
apartheid ideology as I am calling it
for more than twenty years is more
important than other considerations and
it is this ideology application of this
ecology of course much more visible to
Palestinian there than to people here
quite in addition of course to the
deceptions of American media which more
and more convinced by now ended by
convincing Palestinian people judge
peace process is not peaceful Jam not
for any farmer not for any poor man
maybe for some rich people but for
nobody else besides let me take another
point water I am a strange Israelis or
in Palestine are not similar in their
climate to Massachusetts they are more
similar to Arizona and New Mexico
meaning that water is the crucial factor
in agriculture in development of
agriculture the very first thing that
Israel did in the territories in
September 67 was to impose a regulation
or two regulations really one
prohibiting Palestinians to drill or dig
wells on their own private property let
me get it clear on the 70% of West Bank
which still belongs to Palestinians they
are forbidden
totally and
completely to dick well from September
67 and in the existing wells with
capacity was measured at the time they
are prohibited to install new pumps with
greater capacity of course the settlers
are not prohibited to do this with the
result that according to my last data
which are admittedly about four years
old
the 130,000 settlers on the West Bank
are used more water for agriculture than
one and half million of Palestinians
first of all I call it apart right again
certainly I will tell you that if after
Oslo Israeli government would give
thousands let us say chosen Palestinian
farmers permit to dig thousand wells
let us say chosen chosen by let us say
by the willingness to support peace
process but thousand Palestinian farmers
this would have enormous have be of
enormous effect not only of those
thousand farmers but at let us say on
their cousins and second cousins
practically on all the farmers because
just in the case of land and specially
empty land this would have shown that
the process of not allowing development
on for one side and allowing it on other
would be reversed now a part you can
imagine the earlier very many other
discrimination source is a manifestation
of partridges in territories but before
I would therefore I will limit myself
and speak about one more before going
more deeply to analyzing the situation
in general terms of apartheid in
and its roots in ideological roots
meaning from wedges ideologically
aroused in at least in my view the
additional factors that I want to
discuss is so-called rule of law first
of all contrary to most of the states of
the world
whatever they are otherwise and contrary
to the State of Israel itself the system
of law in West Bank and Gaza Strip is
not territorial what it means it is not
territorial let us let us take state of
the so called state of Panama I am NOT
now discussing how itself United States
interest I think I am agreed with it
with norm Tomsky but I would want to
point to use effect which is different
in Panama and in the territories let us
say an American tourist goes to Panama
City and commits a traffic offense let
us say he is driving widely or drunk
Utley of course the Panama police will
arrest him of course he will be put
before padam on court and I think that
United States in such cases will not
protest at least in protests now but in
territories there is no territorial laws
are for like in Panama or even like
Grenada Israeli Jews especially settlers
but all Israeli Jews if they will commit
an offense in the territories including
traffic offense will be brought to
Israel and will be judged within Israel
by Israeli civilian court calls not
wengie way but is by the Israeli
military calls which are judging
Palestinians for any event meaning that
even though the court in territories are
is
early and military in order to enhance
show the superiority of one group over
another the Israeli military courts in
territories have killed this very day
not judged a single Israel is injured
soldiers of course but not single
Israeli civilian let us go a little more
Israel had until beginning of Intifada
until let us a spring 88 a Palestinian
force acting under its orders and
composed of Palestinian policemen in the
beginning of Intifada those policemen
were compelled by pressure to resign the
further four existed let's say more than
twenty years during all that time it was
prohibited to detain Israel a Jew and
specially settler it could let us say
seeing a car speeding or something stop
it because nobody can be sure who is the
driver who is in the car it could ask
for identification current on seeing the
world Israeli and genjou the only thing
that Palestinian policeman could say was
yet please wait until I call Israeli
army or Jewish police or if not he could
only write the number the same thing was
written in to Cairo to agreement which
means that if Israeli Jew visits as he
can visit all the time god as autonomous
Gaza Strip let me say in passing that
Palestinians who want to go out from
Gaza to Israel need both Palestinian and
Israeli permission but Israelis who
enter autonomous Gaza Strip need only
Israeli permission once they get it
Palestinians have to admit them so let
us say such an Israeli Jewish admitted
and
commit a traffic offense in the Gaza
Strip by text of Cairo agreement the
same racist thing which doesn't exist in
Panama or other places Palestinian
police that you hear so much about in
York time but of course not about this
we have no power to detain an Israeli
Jew simply because he's in his religion
let us go even more further on this law
enforcement human dish has even appeared
in is in American media object Israel
refuses to free certain categories of
prisoners however the exact rotations
and they are as they appear in the
Hebrew media or even in Jerusalem pause
and of course on Israel TV and right you
have by everyone from rubbing down have
not been given in the United States the
official Israel the official Israeli
policy is that Israel will free
prisoners who have Arab blood on their
hands and will refuse to free prisoners
who have Jewish blood on their hands day
Arab land a Jewish blood our quotation
from all possible Israeli sources Inc as
I say from rubbing down blood B meaning
not only killing in this respect but
also would again
let me first say before discussing this
that this is a reversion to the policy
of Christian State against Jews in the
pre-modern period Christian states used
to employ in their Proclamation a very
what the surgeon correct but what is of
course very offensive term Christian
blood if you will read the proclamations
of Queen Elizabeth or King Philip the
second tour even until eight
essentially they used to justify the war
Center expedition based by including a
clause in the order that they gave to
commander that this conquer this war
should be done with the less with the
lesser possible a fusion of Christian
blood this is this was very common until
18th century and of course this man for
them the Jewish blood of course Muslim
blood red Indian blood whatever blood
you can you can do whatever you can add
after this was of no concern that a war
waged as soon as it was very true
between Christian powers if you look
into his story book had different
characters officially different
character from war waged by a Christian
power against a non-christian power or
non-christian population some of the
suffering of Jews during all those
hundreds of year proceeded from that
example I am saying that we are doing to
Palestinians as my former example in
this example so more or less what
Christians and to lesser this degree
Muslims have done to us we are of course
not the first who have done done this it
is quite common that a persecuted group
becomes persecutor
we have to inquire how it happens we
have not to close up it but certainly
the expression Jews by robbing and
everybody else about freeing of
Palestinian prisoners the XJ open
expression about blood Jewish blood and
Christian and Arab lot resembles the
expression used by anti-semitic regimes
against Jews and all the others but let
us go a little further first of all let
me tell you that because of Jays this
ruling right criterion
what you hear that Israeli government
refuses to free to free prisoners of
Hamas and fresh prisoners of Fatah is
simply not true
Fatah prisoners who happen to own Jews
are not freed because they have Jewish
blood on their hands it as simply as
this Hamas prisoners if they signed a
simple declaration and they only killed
Arabs our treat sure and it is much and
it is more important than even those
considerations the whole matter of
freeing or not freeing prisoners is
realistic terms nonsense because after
Oslo had they all been freed at once as
Palestinians expected they could be
easily arrested again in realistic terms
as many realistic commentators very far
from my opinions otherwise pointed up
the very best thing that could be done
to push the Oslo process at once is to
free all the prisoners or at least 99%
of them 98% of them and then use them
why free as a bird gaining power which
was of course never done it but there is
something in Israeli policy in cases of
taking life in the territories which
continues now for 20 years and more
which is in principle even more shocking
and also exhibiting the true character
of Israeli regime more than the cases
that I told you so far it has been
recorded very many times I will say
specially by a journalist Daniel
Rubinstein who is in Israeli terms quite
a moderate who although I am friendly
with him let us say he is not of my
opinion and I am NOT of his opinion but
who is very factually accurate he
repeated it again in
article written in Haaretz of
uncertified Ober yet according to open
declarations of Israeli authorities yet
for more than 20 years by now in case of
what is called murder not connected with
security
meaning the usual murder let's say
because neighbors are quarreling because
there's family reason because of any any
of during a robbery during anything not
connected with security of the State of
Israel when the murders are caught and
by the way they are easily caught
because both in Palestinians in Jewish
society such murderers usually give
themselves up they are duly sentenced to
life imprisonment but in case of Arabs
in the territories they are immediately
freed and sent home the reason reason
invented commas being that there is no
place for them in prisons and prisons
are so full of security offenders that
there is no pleasure for a murderer who
simply murders his neighbor
now this me this official policy means
for me not only something which is very
deeply shocking but something that I am
arguing for more than twenty years the
Israeli rule in territories is not to be
compared with the usual imperialistic
rules it is not a colonial rule of
course it is much worse but the
important thing is that it is different
in kind I don't think that you at least
I didn't find offense but I don't think
that you will find any colony in the 20
century or any state which has let's say
no colonial status in which murderers
were already caught and sentenced are
then sent home as a matter of policy
which is I think and let me tell you
that in my opinion after all that I told
you about
apartheid in the territories this to me
is the most important mark of that
apartheid that even when a murderer is
being caught it is he is not being
officially as a matter of policy passed
let me know before returning again to
the subject of territories say few words
about my views from this point I will
tell you
not so much facts of course I will quote
facts but I will it will be mostly my
interpretation from where this policy
arose we have here a Jewish state
carrying a policy which would if would
if it would have been applied to Jews of
course it would justifiably bring a very
great process and how it come yet at the
beginning in the late sixties great
majority of Israel Jews are supported by
now there is some opposition at least to
some aspect but still government which
carries it has a majority and most of
the opposition to this government is
from the right which means that they
want more of the same in my opinion you
cannot understand the word Jews and
Jewish if you look only on modern Jews
or if we're what is in many
for many points of view worse if you
read your Bible or rather your Old
Testament and you mentioned what I call
a quantum jump from the edge of the
Bible which ended mostly in the 5th
century BC to the twenties or even the
19th century my book is the servant to
saw to say to fill this hole to point
out that during that time just existed
they had a culture they had a religion
very different from the biblical Judaism
very different from the me from the
religion of majority of the Jews in this
country because reform and conservative
Jew movement arose only in early 19th
century they are only are very recent in
jewy terms of 3,000 years of Jewish
history and I would like to point you
some social facts of this period which I
call classical Judah in my book as
explaining the oppression and the type
of oppression we are inflicting now and
Palestinians which is something very
similar as you will hear presently to
what was inflicted on us during let's
say 2000 and several hundred years let
me begin by something that may seem
strange to you in modern period but that
until the rise of modern states let us
say friends after revolution United
States you can edge also to some extent
some small extent in a republic of the
Netherlands and Great Britain from late
17th century no Jew paid his taxes as
individual what has been done by less
any Kingdom Republic holy fate in
Islamic countries I am speaking about
Islamic and Christian countries equally
was the
ruler has imposed on the Jews in his
country alarmed some every in taxation
every year and then that he went that he
conferred a rather ordered the Jewish
communities usually unified Jewish
community in his country to pay him this
lump sum and they had the power of
course to assess every member of their
community as they saw fit and of course
you know there is no taxation without
punishing a taxpayer who doesn't pay his
taxes taxation without punishment is
contradiction in terms
so they of course could do this
otherwise they would not have received
the money but on the way or together
with this the with this power of the
cursive power to punish the members if
they didn't pay taxes they also had
power to punish Jewish members of their
communities for all kinds of religious
offenses for example I am born in Poland
in Poland in enduring eighteenth-century
we have on this very full record Jews
who didn't let the violates about by
riding a horse by smoking by everyone
that you conceived we are punished not
by money fines but they were flogged I
should say here the Jewish punishment
always follows a pattern of punishments
in the neighboring country they were not
biblical punishment they were simply
adopted from the neighboring from
certain which the Jews have lived and in
some cases because in Poland Jews had
really a great autonomy they could be
executed there is a famous case not one
of many cases where of several cases
which in which in the year thousand
seven hundred and sixty three hundred
and sixty something years ago two
hundred and six
two hundred and thirty years ago less
than 10% of the Jewish history span a
Jew who in the town now called Lavrov
informally Lamberg who had the temerity
of write a house and smoked his pipe
admittedly on the street and with the
chief rabbi of the town lived was
sentenced to death and executed with the
approval of royal government therefore
we had a situation for more than 2,000
years in which Jew dies in its Orthodox
form because I again emphasized that
reform and conservative and any other
tendencies didn't exist world falls on
Jews by Jewish authorities and those
Jewish authorities no less than let us
say authority of Panama or of whatever
country you can of Saudi Arabia or of
many as Saudi Arabia is actually a good
example because it's a country which
also inflict punishment for religious
offenses have performed a necessary
service for of course the rulers and the
ruling classes to whom it pay taxes and
because it performed those necessary and
good services it was given power to
punish it inhabit inhabitants mere
members distant Jewish members what has
happened with the advent of modernity
and I am using the word modernity not
democracy because the person who
actually freed the Jews of most of the
European continent from the situation
and Peron apollyon was of course far
from being any Democrat but he actually
when he conquered Poland the country in
which I was born he gave
he took from the Jews the power to
punish other Jews for religious offense
let me add in passing that he also took
from poles at the same time to the power
of deciding that in certain cities just
will not be allowed to live in a city
where I was born
warsaw had a privilege from me Miriam
immemorial times from polish kings of
assist nicely put in Latin non Jew Dyke
Judea scholar and oh not not tolerating
Jews within the city limits and it was
Napoleon who said that privileges of the
past are not important of course because
of in imperial interests of course and
who allow Jews to live in Warsaw for the
first time in many centuries that they
lived in Poland therefore only from that
time let us say the end of 18th century
beginning of 19th century Jews had the
power to behave not according to rules
of Jewish Orthodox they have also to
power to say things which were not
favoured which rabbis didn't approve
because we have also a good record of
punishing people for saying forbidden
things and from the time jewish
tradition both of other religious
denominations like reform and of course
and of rebellion against orthodox jew
James continues but liberal what I call
liberation from outside means that we
were liberated by revolutions carried by
other people's didn't happen in all
countries simultaneously and even when
it happened let's say in Poland in
Poland majority of rabbis during the
time of Napoleon opposed Napoleon and
his liberation for a seeing very jar
that freedom will be bad for orthodoxy
indeed it was so 200 years ago all Jews
were Orthodox now only minority are
Orthodox therefore the remain the Jews
and especially Israeli Jews are divided
that you can say them to two kings and I
will formal now I will forsake history
and I will go to last let's say 10 years
or 12 years in Israel in to those who
say that Jewish tradition is more
important than democracy and of course
also more important yet state interest
as expressed by terms of profit the
Jewish tradition continuation of Jewish
tradition is more important and state
power of course they will say that the
unity of the nation supposedly given by
if everybody will follow tradition will
give us also those things but the
present we are torn so it amounts to
thank the Jewish the tradition is more
important not only than democracy not
only turn profit but also more important
than any abstract idea let us say idea
of equality of citizens before right
before law which means also equality of
citizens before a bad law and the idea
that religious groups should not allow
to punish its members that the
punishment will only be in hands of a
state and again I add also a bad state
in modern state insist on this our
strength to the Jewish tradition because
of those 2,000 years and more in which
the transition serves a completely
different system because of this at
present more than half 30 years ago more
than 90 percent of
Lindros when asked a simple question is
the treatment of Palestinians in the
territories and democratic or will such
a treatment serve the end of State of
Israel as conquering power or even would
be would such conditions serve our
permanent occupation of the territories
or not would say all those questions are
not relevant the relevance is that in
the Jewish land in length of Israel will
continue to be redeemed and one it is
redeemed it should never go back to the
to be invaded
let me tell you this in the past and I
believe in such case in the present it
has happened in many are in in many
states and for showing you the clock
similarity between this thinking and
thinking which was prevalent under
apartheid
I will return today to the example of of
Palestinian : l not only : L soldier
jailer there are no Palestinian villages
in Israel in which 90 percent of males
have their life hood from being soldiers
border guards policemen and jailers
literally if you want in one name I will
give you one name I could give you more
a village of yurka in Western Galilee
such a village so it that we in spite of
this we go and discriminate in such
obvious manner such people who serve us
I mean State of Israel oiling is it in
the benefit of the state I will answer
you by giving you power a parallel
during most of the years of apartheid in
South Africa
south african regime youth black polish
men I believe all of those who all those
who have interested in South Africa both
in reading about the country and both in
seeing the pictures have seen and there
are a certain year in which there was a
rebellion was intensified black Polish
man flogging and beating and enforcing
other rules other blacks nevertheless I
point to you that black policemen who
beat other who used to beat other blacks
we are not allowed to live in
Johannesburg they had to be under the
rules of apartheid exactly like every
other black they will not be given this
age we are not given the same privileges
which let us say the French imperialist
system gave to people who learned in
Sorbonne and who were good francophones
and we other good friends we serve
different interests and in the same way
I point to you generally so the same
thing in Israel you can say that there
is one difference between South African
system and Israeli system which is that
the South African apartheid was based on
color while Israeli system is based on
religion and you can convert to Judaism
I will answer to you that in my opinion
as a Jew who in his own way very
critical way but his own way is very
devoted to Jewish culture and Jewish
tradition of 3,000 years we ended things
that he is more devoted to those
traditions things are bad in the better
sense of the world and all the Orthodox
rabbis take together if you excuse me a
little boss that this makes the matter
worse why it makes the matter
let us return to the case of war so for
so many hundred is denied or in
residence to all Jews
let us add even the city of Paris you
may not know it but Paris was close to
the Jews until the French Revolution
only royal agents had could obtain
permission to stay in Paris and only for
limited amount of time Paris until
thousand 789 was up from some time in
Middle Ages of course after the
expulsion after expulsion in the 14th
century was completely closed to Jews
even when Jews were allowed to live in
other areas and in France and to move
around around it let us say that there
was a Jew not very faithful to his
tradition maybe more dedicated to making
good profits and he wanted to live in
Paris or in war so there was a way open
to him conversion if he went to a priest
and of course in this case two catalytic
priests in other cases two Protestant
minister and if he converted at the
moment of his conversion he could live
in Paris and Warsaw in Poland actually
through the old or through all the time
of Polish Commonwealth meaning to the
year 2000 795 Jewish convert
automatically became a noble so he had
more privileges of course then even
a burger of the city and of course more
privileges than a peasant simply because
of conversion what I am telling you that
the situation in the territories exec is
exactly the same
let us me not speak of Palestine as let
us speak now about American citizen let
us suppose that a palace that American
citizen XY wants travels in the West
Bank and fancies that he will like to
settle in a spot let us say for a
sabbatical and let us fancy at the same
time that I want for a year to cease to
do what I am doing and I want to take a
rest among the snows of Alaska Alaska
happens to be 799 percent owned by the
federal government of United States if
federal official in Alaska will tell me
you Israel shahe cannot run this piece
of land after of course obtaining visa
and everything legal immigrant I mean or
legal temporary resident I mean of
course will discrimination this will be
anti-semitism I don't have to tell you
that many organizations in this country
even if it would be possible we defend
me but if American will say the same
thing about those not seventy fifty four
percent of area of West Bank which stand
empty but devoted to Jews then the
official policy of the State of Israel
is not to allow him unless he will
convert unless he will do the same thing
as Jews who for whatever reason because
they were also sincere converse indeed
before the modern period and then they
were allowed benefit denied reduce
themself so here you have in mind
because of the case of conversion
because of this exception to the rule
you have it really shows how we do send
tea I mean first of all Israel
just because we bear on this point I
want on this single point I want a
little to disagree with Noam Chomsky
that whatever the American
responsibility which I of course don't
deny the full defense and further
possibility of what is done in
territories falls on us Israeli Jews
because we accepted the American funding
in the first place so it makes us the
the fully responsible agent in this case
and we are by imbibing by internalizing
the values of our oppressors this is my
view I'm now doing to others what was
done to us I am course perusing the text
but this is exactly my intention of
doing there is in my opinion only one
way out of this impasse and I have shown
you that the peace process which is
based on apartheid will never therefore
succeed because even because Israel will
not even push it in the ways which are
opposing the ideology which is followed
by its rulers and by majority of
citizens of course there is where if
there are well situation will change if
you will change the policy of the United
States we will follow automatically but
I am pleased to say that in many
respects a change was initiated in
Israel
maybe not regards with Palestinians and
we on this I don't want to you to have
any delusions 85% of Israeli Jews
opposed formation of Palestinian state
under any conditions even if it will be
a stage if I like of course
I like sometimes to teach my opponent so
I sometimes ask them if you would you
agree to Palestinian state only in the
truncated Gaza Strip and to negotiate
about the rest the answer is always no
or silence we sovereignties there is
denied in all areas or in any single
area but the opinions are changed in
about democracy and modernity or about
democracy and tradition in other areas
you see Palestine one of the part of the
tragedy of Palestinians is that for us
Israeli Jews er Foreign Affairs and for
in every society is not very much
interested in Foreign Affairs is
interested in domestic affairs three
months three and half months ago the
Israeli Knesset passed a law in which
the import to Israel of non kosher meat
was totally prohibited this affair case
cost much more interest and much more
discussing that many crucial things
concerning Palestinian because it
counted as a domestic affair but this
affair and many other Affairs have shown
that the forces of tradition are not a
strong now as they were strong 30 or 40
and for sure fifty years ago and
therefore there is a possibility maybe
not a strong one that by establishing or
not establishing strength enforcing the
first principles of democracy at home in
the State of Israel we can also change
to some extent to some but a significant
extent our foreign policies in this case
our policies towards the Palestinians
which I try to show you are ideal
based in the situation I think that
Americans have a part of changing their
policy of their countries of the country
to roles to play the first role is to
see what we are doing and what we are in
other words to obtain accurate
information about Israel and Israeli
Jews in this respect one thing is very
crucial to distinguish between Israeli
Jew whatever are his opinion and above
and the opinion of the so-called
supporters of Israel in the United
States there is a crucial indifference
which I will try to explain let us say
that I am arguing now we support roughly
cook or peel or with supporter of
parties who are wearing liquid liquid is
actually not the worst as I do very
often and all the time and quite openly
and I will of course say to him in the
course of argument your policies are
leading to war and in this war many
people including many Israeli Jews will
be killed he will say yes but I am
taking the risk of my policy but if he
will tell me even when my standing was
much more difficult than now your
policies are leading to my first answer
will be yes and I am taking the risk of
my opinion I am here with you and if the
war will come I can be hurt or at the
time after or until few years ago I
could even say that I will serve in the
army that I will take the risk of my
opinion the supporter of Israel and
especially the Jewish supporters of
Israel who are here are not taking the
risk of their opinion if there will be a
war because of the policy there
and work it they will at most we before
the TV sets what is more if they are
really supporters let us say of
right-wing Jainism they should by their
own principles settle now the so called
Judea and Samaria the fact that they are
here causes them guilt feelings and they
are compensating for the guilt feeling
by very much greater fanaticism Jan is
present among the great majority of
Israeli Jews therefore it is your duty I
think of whatever are your opinion of
Israel not to be fooled by the
supporters of Israel in this country but
go to the source even when you support
Israel
ask what Israeli Jews of various
opinions are thinking and only after
this form your opinion the supporters of
Israel in this country are for this very
good reasons not telling the truth even
on the matter even on the most basic
matter the second thing I think that you
will help them across you will have the
right of Palestinians you will help also
the right of justice all over the world
you see we would not have been helping
butchering the Guatemalans as known
Chomsky mentioned if you were not
thinking about Guatemalans blance what I
quoted to you about Arab luck the
Uniting factors of the factor uniting
what a balance and arabs is that for
jews who are following the jewish
tradition of what i call classical
classical duty means that they are both
non jews and israel policy in
territories and Guatemala and
countries are therefore essentially the
same if we will become which I hope we
will a country in which democracy or if
not Democrats is some prey democratique
modern principles will win we will be in
a position to change also our foreign
policies therefore I hope that after
informing yourself about situation
meaning what sees in the suspect work
first of all what Palestinians are
suffering I must recall at the end that
by the end that the main main purpose
the main purpose of the speech was to
alert you that Palestinians are in
territories are suffering and their
suffering is increasing but after this I
am also requesting you that after
learning about situation you will
support also those forces within Israeli
Jewish community who are in favor of
democracy who are putting democracy
above traduced tradition thank you very
much and it's British client who that's
the muscle that you bring in in case
things really go wrong so that's the
strategic conception the people the
rights that various participants have
depends on their role within this
framework so the local Arab facade the
these brutal dictatorships that run the
most of the oil States they have rights
as long as they do their job I mean if
they ever try to get out of line they'll
be gone very quickly it won't take long
but as long as they perform there you
know certainly what do their job they
were they supposed to then they have
rights as for the local cops on the beat
same story they have rights as long as
they continue to do their jobs they get
a line at the end of their rights in the
United States of course has rights by
definitions
to ask about that in the end Britain -
as long as you know it's our lieutenant
in the region
well you consider Israel and Palestine -
contestants in the former Palestine
Israel and Palestinian Israel definitely
has rights first of all because of its
local services and also because it
performs many other services of which
that vote the UN is just the symbolic
illustration symbolic of much more
significant things like for example when
the Carter Administration the human
rights administration was prevented by
congressional legislation from sending
military aid to its favorite mass
murderers in Guatemala and in fact it
didn't send the aid anyway as later
turned out but couldn't send enough and
participate actively enough and the mass
murders that were going on there it was
possible call on Israel to do the job
for us and that's happened all over the
world and that's a major service quite
apart from the regional ones instantly
all of these will continue they have
absolutely nothing to do with the cold
war and they will continue irrespective
of the cold war that's propaganda
so that's Israel's right it's a lot of
Rights because they do a lot of things
and that's essentially what the huge
subsidies about well what about the
Palestinians you have to ask what
service do they perform to u.s. power
and the answer is none therefore they
have no right that follows just
logically anybody who doesn't who
understands the least thing about world
affairs recognizes that if you don't
perform any services to the powerful
your human rights are as Europe in fact
in the case of the Palestinians is worse
their rights are actually negative
because they perform a disservice their
displacement and their problems and so
on caused disruption in the region and
and other people get upset not the
leadership like the Saudi Arabian elite
in which I have actually nothing to say
except what I've learned from him and
you can hear it from him i but on
another topic that I know something
about and that also has special
importance for me and I had for most of
you and that is the u.s. role in the
Middle East the special important
is obvious first of all that's our
responsibility and that means that we
can do something about it it's within
our power to change and secondly the
responsibility happens to be huge and
it's huge in most of the world but in
this case it's just overwhelming the US
has an overwhelmingly influential role
in the affairs of the region at the last
few years the United States has in
effect succeeded in all long-standing
objective of pretty much extending the
Monroe Doctrine over the Middle East the
Gulf War in my opinion was basically
intended from the US point of view to
teach the world that lesson get
everybody else to back off and to
recognize as George Bush put it
elegantly in the middle of the war that
what we say goes that's the lesson of
the New World Order he said and that
lesson is particularly to be applied in
the Middle East region which way back 50
years ago the State Department described
as the stupendous source of strategic
power and the greatest material prize in
world history the eastern great want the
greatest prize in the world in the field
of foreign investment and one that the
US was certainly going to take over not
because of the enormous only because of
the enormous wealth and profits from oil
production and so on but because holding
that region as a lever for world control
and that was well understood and it's
fully explicit in the internal record
and it influences of course determinate
of Lee influences the the policy record
just in passing I should say that in the
older areas of the Monroe Doctrine the
question of other people getting in our
way isn't an issue and so takes a Cuba
the United States is now in the what
they hope what planners hope is the
final stage of crushing cube of getting
them to say uncle to borrow the words of
George Shultz when he was referring to
the Palestinians talking to his boss a
few years ago he complained that the
Palestinians were saying uncle
uncle old but they never really came
right out and said uncle and for a real
first-rate thug you got to make sure
that your victims you know own up
properly and do what you tell them you
know they've got a grovel properly or
else they're you know that the world
doesn't learn the lessons about what we
say goes
Cuba's gotta learn those lessons too and
they have to suffer particularly because
they've been standing up and trying to
follow a course of Independence for
thirty years just a few weeks ago there
was a vote in the United Nations 101 - -
condemning the latest phases of the US
embargo and Cuba specifically designed
by the Clinton administration to block
food and medicines about 90% of what's
block is indeed food and medicines to
make sure that plenty of children starve
to death and so on
the vote was as I said 101 - to the -
were the United States and Israel that's
change from the year before when the
United States also managed to pick up
Romania and now only Israel's left and
that has to do with the Middle East in
fact one of the minor services that
Israel is supposed to provide this is
only one of the minor ones is to sort of
make sure that they vote with the boss
when it's necessary and to support any
outrage that the boss commits and for
that they get a huge subsidy I mean it's
no comparison in world affairs
and that maintains a law a wealthy but
largely artificial society very rich but
on a foreign dole which you and I pay
for and that dole is in fact as well
Human Rights Watch the leading
international human rights walk monitor
a couple of months a couple of months
ago published a book another book in
which they pointed out once again that
US aid to Israel is flatly illegal it's
in flat violation of US law because US
law quite explicitly forbids any aid
north
or other aid to countries which
systematically torture and abuse their
citizens and this book of human rights
watch was just yet another extensive
documentation of the fact that that's
exactly what we pay for
however we should point out that this is
no big problem by the standards of
international lawlessness in which the
u.s. is certainly a major player and in
fact well in the lead I think this is
pretty small potatoes well a few remarks
about the US and Middle East I won't
talk about what's actually going on now
I think if you think about the
background that all sort of follows that
you can almost deduce what's happening
the United States has a general
strategic conception as to how to run
the strategically most important area in
the world and the greatest material
prize in world history it's one that the
u.s. pretty much picked up from the
British who used to run the place before
we kicked them out the the idea is that
the MIT alternative news collective
sponsors this and other progressive
events on mi t--'s campus and produces
the Thistle a newspaper wearing the
progressive and creative minds of MIT
and the surrounding community can share
their work born in the midst of the
campus protests against apartheid in
South Africa in 1987 the Thistle is
consistently explored unjustified
decision making in many aspects of MIT
affairs over the past seven years as a
collective members are able to
participate all and alternately
coordinate every aspect of newspaper
production we hope and have many reasons
to believe that the actions and presence
of the Thistle on the campus has helped
improve the experience of students staff
and faculty of the Institute and
hopefully has inspired people to
continue to support progressive causes
however to continue these contributions
the collective needs your support the
donation that was asked at the door is
not only going to help provide events
like tonight's talk but will also help
purchase supplies to produce the paper
more importantly we encourage all
interested people to join with us by
attending a collective meeting we meet
every Wednesday evening in the MIT
Student Center if you're interested
please sign up on the sheet that was at
the front door and will be passed around
during the talk we hope to see you at
next week's meeting
tonight the MIT alternative news
collective is proud to present
professors Israel Shia and Noam Chomsky
two of the world's foremost analyst of
Middle Eastern issues there will be time
at the end of the speeches for members
of the audience to ask questions and
make very brief statements therefore we
ask that everyone please respect each
other's desire to hear the speeches in
their entirety at this time I would like
to turn the floor over to Professor Noam
Chomsky who will introduce professor
Jacques
well my instructions about 15 minutes
ago were to say a few things about
Middle East and then to make a few words
of introduction to Israel shikaka know
an old friend I realized on the way over
that my files are full of fascinating
and highly informative correspondence
with him over many years I guess about
25 years now but I've never heard him
give a talk
I don't think and I'd like to remedy
that tonight and would prefer to listen
rather than give a talk myself and urge
you to as well but since I'm obedient
and follow instructions I will spend a
few moments commenting however not about
the announced title on there's to be
several layers of control first of all
there have to be what the big thing is
oil of course so there has to be what
the British in the old days called an
Arab facade meaning local managers who
do our work for them and who we pretend
are independent because that's a way to
sort of keep down
you know nationalist feelings and so on
and so forth but they're just an Arab
facade and as the British put it in
secret records now declassified is back
in the First World War the British will
continue to run the place behind various
sort of constitutional fictions they
said like uh first aid and other things
but that's the Arab facade they have to
be weak because we have to make sure
that they'll do exactly what we say or
else we toss them out so there has to be
an array of local managers that's
essentially what the Gulf dictatorships
are there are local managers who JA
whose job is to make sure that the huge
profits from oil flow to the West not to
the people of the region that's
crucially the case British understood it
it's even more important in the last 30
or 40 years now the people of the region
happen to be back
enlightened you've all know known about
that and they somehow don't understand
why the wealth of their region has to
flow to Westerners not to them and since
they can't seem to get this through
their heads no matter how much we try to
explain it to them they have to the Arab
facade has to be protected against the
local from the local population and for
that you need what the Nixon
administration called local cops on the
beat local military forces will kick
them in the face if they get the wrong
ideas and if they're if the local
security forces can't handle it
so the second layer of control has been
an array of jean d'Armes turkey iran
under the Shah
Pakistan's played that role for a time
and Israel's retina Center especially
since nineteen sixties Israel's been one
of the core elements of the Zhang's
Armory in certainly that was recognized
by the Joint Chiefs of Staff as far back
as 1948 u.s. they were very impressed by
Israel's military victories in that war
and concluded again in secret documents
now Declassified that Israel's could
serve they said the second it was second
only to Turkey they felt at the time as
a military base which could be used to
project military power particularly
important now the British were
withdrawing from the region and the US
was moving in and needed its own local
cops on the beat
well that's Israel's rule now the then
in the background of course is the
United States
