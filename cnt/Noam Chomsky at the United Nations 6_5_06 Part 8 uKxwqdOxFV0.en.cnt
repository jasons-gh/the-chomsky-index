given the situation that it has created
in the rock you think it Iran yeah
Laurie tractor on but given this dream
that it has creating Iraq do you think
in your estimation is ale at any point
in time attack Iran if the United States
does not and also the fact that can you
also think about a scenario which will
ensue if that happens if in the Middle
East us it is Israel attack Syria well I
frankly don't think that I think Israel
is much too constrained by its
relationship to the united states that
it will not carry out military force
unless authorized by the United States
I'm there was a case when Israel did
attack a nuclear power nuclear
development installation the Osaka
bombing in 1981 which was against the
will of the United States and we know
what happened that time the bombing of
the osirak reactor in issue apparently
as far as we know initiated Saddam
Hussein's nuclear weapons program the
reactor was investigated shortly after
by the chair of the Harvard University
Physics Department who's a specialist in
nuclear power and nuclear engineering he
wrote a article in nature about at the
leading international scientific journal
in which he concluded that this reactor
was incapable of producing weapons-grade
material or nuclear weapons and was in
fact an experimental reactor a design
for nuclear power well we also know now
from defectors Iranian Iraqi nuclear
scientists who have reported and it's
pretty plausible that after the Israeli
bombing of the reactor Saddam Hussein
ordered the development of nuclear
weapons that's about what you'd expect
it's a typical thing in international
affairs violence tends to
in gender violence in response if the
u.s. threats against Iran have almost
certainly been a factor in there
whatever efforts there are taking to do
research and development that might lead
to nuclear weapons yes if threats have
that effect an actual bombing would
probably accelerate such actions as to
the effects in the region they're just I
mean suppose the US authorized Israel to
do it I mean the effects in the region
would be I mean I'm almost indescribable
and then nobody can guess I might blow
up what's left of Iraq it might lead to
you know violence all over the region as
I said before I think the Rumsfeld
Cheney cabal would initiate such efforts
either themselves or through Israel only
if they're really desperate and they
think there's no way out other than just
to create chaos and see what happens no
the question was was the 1981 attack
authorized by the United States no in
that case not was pretty good evidence
the United States opposed it at that
time that's one of the rare cases when
Israel did something in violation of
what the US wanted and they were slapped
down for it right away I mean not
harshly but you know condemned the
Security Council condemnation and so on
what I said was that the as far as we
know the bombing of the osirak reactor
probably initiated Saddam Hussein's
nuclear weapons program
