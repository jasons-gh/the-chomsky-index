Noam Chomsky has global fame in two unrelated fields: Or so it seems 
The most famous is being one of the leaders in the opposition to the American war on Vietnam. 
The fame of the deeper dimension is as a professor of linguistics, and he managed - before the age of forty - to happen 
A fundamental change in his discipline, which is a milestone in the history of philosophy. 
Many philosophy professors insist it 
He is never a philosopher, because linguistics is simply a field of knowledge different from philosophy although close to it 
Well, I'm not going to argue regarding this, it is more than just questioning the definition of the term anyway 
In fact, he learned philosophy, and his research work includes many philosophical issues 
In contemporary philosophical writings, I can say that his name is as common as it is 
The name of any contemporary philosopher is mentioned in it, but the important point in fact is that if there is a philosophical issue 
Has dominated the philosophy of the twentieth century more than others, it is the issue of the relationship between 
Language and the World, Wangstein - just as an example- 
He was captured by this affair. And now comes the linguist Chomsky 
He makes the argument that the way we acquire language is in fact - and thus its relationship 
With the human experience, and hence its relationship with the world - it is completely different from 
What was known in the Anglo-Saxon philosophy. His thoughts appeared first 
At the end of the fifties of the last century and was a criticism of the behavioral psychological approach, not far from health 
To say that behavioral psychologists have tended to say that the individual 
It comes into the world a moldable dough, and thus it is formulated 
It is shaped by the environment, through a process of stimulation and reaction, as they say, punishment and 
Reward, reinforcement of reward responses, and establishment of ideas about it 
In doing so, individuals develop and learn, and that includes language learning. But Chomsky says that 
That cannot explain how all humans are regardless of their intelligence 
They manage to do something surprisingly difficult, like even being able to use language 
When you don't knowingly teach them, as it is for most humans, and they do it 
At a very young age, and in a short time, he protested 
For this to happen, we must be genetically programmed to do so, and then 
It is imperative that all human languages   have a common basic structure to interact with 
This pre-programming also entails important downsides. The most important ones 
Anything that cannot be subject to this structure ... anything 
It cannot be captured in this particular network that is linguistically impossible to analyze 
And ambiguous can not be understood, then the general linguistic rules common to languages   set very important boundaries 
Because of our ability to understand the world and to communicate with one another 
This appears to be a translation in linguistic terms of some of Kant's main ideas 
And I have to say it's always like this to me, but even if it is true, Chomsky 
He did it, not anyone else, and it proved worthwhile and had important results 
Professor Chomsky, one of the difficulties in discussing your thoughts is her 
It is clearly hybrid, on the one hand it is linguistic and on the other hand it is philosophical 
On the other hand, it is biological, and you yourself put it first 
To argue with behavioral biologists and psychologists, how did you get to that starting point? 
Well, the reason was that picture of the nature of language 
And the method of language acquisition, the image that was controlling 
A broad spectrum of ideas not only psychology but also philosophy and linguistics 
An idea that was dominant when I was a student, about 25-30 years ago 
The common image of language is that it is a system of habits, skills, or behavior 
And that consists through intense training, through repetition 
Perhaps through stimulation, generalization and association 
A person's knowledge or habits system grows simply through a gradual increase 
The more one's experience is subjected to generalization and simulation, and in fact, this image 
Which was just an assumption was put forward as a postulate 
And it really isn't, I mean, language isn't necessarily 
System of that kind, or it is acquired in this way 
One thing I pointed out, which is actually something very clear when you notice it, is that most people 
They were not taught the language, that is, most of the parents 
They give no systematic instructions of any kind to their children, yet the child acquires the language. 
Well I want to go further, I really think 
Language does not teach - except marginally, and the role of education is not essential 
In language acquisition, it can even be said in the present moment 
That a language is never learned, at least if by teaching we mean any process it has 
Characteristics present in any learning process, such as properties 
I have already mentioned, for me, if we want to talk about an appropriate phrase, we must talk about (growth) 
Languages   seem to grow in the mind to me, somewhat similarly 
For the growth of other vital body systems, we begin our interaction with the world in our minds 
Based on a pre-existing genetic stage, and through interaction with experience and the environment 
This stage changes until you reach the stage of maturity, which we call the stage of knowledge of the language 
This series of changes starts from the first genetic stage 
To the final stage where we have a complex system of mental processes 
The chain of changes seems to me like organ growth, in fact 
I think it is acceptable to think of the mind as a device of mental capabilities - one of which is the linguistic ability - 
The structures of each are biologically determined, with interactions 
Also generally defined by our biological nature, and it grows 
It is through experience that shapes and shapes these capabilities as they grow 
In an individual during his life. So I say it looks like it to me 
Not only is it wrong to think that language teaches, it is wrong 
Thinking that language is acquired if it is intended 
The processes by which learning is done - in other words we are programmed to acquire 
Language is the same way that our hands and feet are programmed to grow into adulthood 
In early adolescence, some growth processes are somewhat delayed. - Yes and 
Puberty is a good example when we are talking about biological development 
It is preprogrammed from creation, but it starts to work after birth 
In fact, it can be said that even death is genetically determined 
This is because we are a biological construct, and therefore, at a specific time, life processes cease. 
In fact, evolution that begins after the beginning of the life of an organism 
It does not provide evidence in itself that it is an evolution 
Genetically determined or not. It follows from your point of view that if someone had done as you did 
During a period of your academic life, he began to research the human language ability 
What I researched is a living biological system, I mean 
It is something that is tangible in matter, as if present in human tissue 
You're looking for human eyesight, human digestion, or blood circulation 
I think this is absolutely correct at least we think it is correct in principle. 
We are not yet in the neurological stage of studying higher cognitive processes 
Where it is possible to identify those systems that are inside the body and include these processes 
In contrast, studies conducted on this device are still at the abstract, theoretical level 
We can test principles by what they do, but there is very little that can be said 
Now we are looking at the ways in which these principles are perceived in the brain 
While on the other hand one can study the visual system for example - it is done 
That's a very long time ago - while none of the rules we came up with 
It can be related to that (nervous) system, or to analyze the mechanism of that in the nervous system, we deduced 
It's connected to that system, but we know nothing about how this is perceived in our nervous system 
And I think the study of language can be likened here 
By studying eyesight in a period when it was technically impossible 
Or because of limited understanding, technology, etc., it was impossible 
Determine which vital elements are contained in that device 
To study only abstractly. Here there seems to be a special difficulty, I mean 
We accept the fact that, through careful thinking, I cannot control work 
On my liver, I can't watch it excrete bile, or anything else it does 
It is also possible that I cannot monitor my neurolinguistic functions in action 
But there is an important difference, because if we want to research the work of the liver 
We can observe other people, I mean part of a liver of a living person 
Or the whole liver of a dead person or an animal, you can try 
Different variables and see what results it brings ... and so on 
But we cannot experiment on animals with respect to language because their linguistic ability ... 
She has no use of language ability. Now does this not close in our faces 
The main scientific method by which we search for the rest of the vital functions of humans. 
Yes, of course, it shuts off the natural scientific method of research and this 
For ethical reasons, we do not conduct practical experiments on humans 
So, for example, there are scientific experiments that present themselves 
Assuming, for example, I assumed that the language had a general property 
And every human language must have this characteristic as a biological necessity, if we were 
If we were dealing with another living being we would be allowed to study, the way we study 
For example cats or monkeys, what we're going to do is apply the common differences approach 
And that would be by designing a built environment from which a factor is removed 
To see whether the linguistic system develops naturally under these circumstances, we study one case, for example 
We cannot do that, we cannot create artificial designed environments 
And we see what happens to children in it, because we cannot conduct experiments in which humans are completely isolated from their societies 
But it is important to know that these limitations are not a philosophical obstacle 
Which means we have to be smarter about it 
A number of scientific research methods cannot be applied here, within the limits of our knowledge there is nothing similar 
Of the human linguistic ability of other living things, but this does not mean that we cannot 
To study a problem, we must study it indirectly. We cannot often use experiments directly 
That can give us clear and accurate answers to the questions we ask, but if you think 
In a picture like the one I presented, an image of an ability that begins at the genetic level 
In the first stage and then grow until you reach the stage of maturity of linguistic knowledge, then it is clear 
That this stage of knowledge will be determined by two factors: the initial innate genetic predisposition 
And secondly: the experience that one is exposed to. So as long as the last stage of this knowledge 
It is what is known as (towards language); Any system of rules and principles 
Which defines a sentence and defines its meaning, how it is pronounced ... and so on, and as long 
This system is being researched. We can, in fact, have an enormous amount of evidence. In fact, every utterance is significant 
The result can be considered a scientific experiment if you like. Every person's reaction to a meaningful expression 
It is a scientific experiment. Thus there is no dearth of information regarding the maturity stage 
The knowledge of a language, if we can understand and distinguish the stage of cognitive maturity in a language, its rules 
And its peculiarities, which we do not allow us to see in a scientific experiment 
It makes sense to think of them as properties that have to do with the initial stage 
The main thing that I want to discuss in this interview, Professor Chomsky, is your thoughts 
In the philosophical field. I don't want to discuss the details of your business itself 
Because that's a high standard for a TV interview 
Of this sort, so let's first assume that your theories are correct 
And looking at what it entails at the larger level, I'm sure that's what matters 
Most of the viewers. One of the results of your theories is that we, as humans, 
It is very precisely preprogrammed. There are specific things we can understand, only specific things 
We can communicate with it, but anything else outside of that programming that we simply cannot understand or communicate about 
- This is really true. I mean, this belief may be disconcerting 
I mean, it violates the way we want to see ourselves. Well, maybe 
This is the direct reaction, but I think it's not the right response, actually 
While we are strictly governed by our genetic programming, I think the most important thing is 
It is the presence of these strict restrictions that provides the foundations for our freedom and capacity for creativity 
And the reason - what you mean is that it's only because we're preprogrammed 
We can do what we can do now. Exactly, the idea is that if we were really resilient organisms 
And it doesn't have this intense preprogramming, so it will be the state our mind will reach 
In fact, it is a reflection of the environment, which means it will be much poorer 
Fortunately for us, we are preprogrammed with very rich systems 
Part of our biological creation. In contrast, a small amount of little experimentation 
A quantum leap takes place into a rich knowledge system that primarily affects society 
It leaves an imprint on all of its members - and it developed within 
Countless ages of evolution through the process of biological evolution. 
The basic system itself evolved through long periods of evolutionary growth 
We don't know how, really, but on the individual level it is, the individual 
Capable - with a small amount of evidence - of creating a very rich system 
It enables him to behave in a free and creative way, and in fact it is normal for humans 
We can say anything we want in a time limitless to other people 
They understand us even though they have never heard it before, we are specifically able to 
Because of that precise programming, without that programming we would never have been able to 
How big is that creativity if we, as you say, are already programmers 
And how could creativity be possible for us? Well, I guess one has to be careful here. 
I think we can say a lot about the nature of the existing system and the state of knowledge 
Acquired. We can say a lot about the biological basis 
On the foundations of the initial mental stage of language acquisition. 
But when we get to the third question: How is this system used? How can we behave creatively? 
How can we decide to say things that are new but not random, and appropriate to the context in which they were said 
And without being indoctrinated? When we ask these questions we really get into 
To a world of mystery, where human science - at least not yet, and perhaps fundamentally, 
He could not reach. We can say a lot about the principles that make it possible for us 
To act in our usual creative way, but if the questions are about will or decision 
Or cause or action choice - when these questions are asked human science is unable to answer 
He has nothing to say to answer it as far as I know these questions remain mysterious 
As it was in ancient times. I don't know if you accept it or not 
Our arrival to our present state through millions of years of evolution must have passed 
A continuous process of creativity, adaptation and development of new capabilities 
And changes, members ... etc, maybe we are no longer as flexible as we were 
Maybe we are no longer changing the way we used to be, and may we no longer evolve, perhaps only marginally? 
Well, here too I think one should be very careful, because while this is true 
Foggy if you like, but it is correct to say that the systems we have now 
Having evolved through natural selection, it is important to perceive volume 
The little we know about it, for example, is undoubtedly not necessary 
That every trait that we humans possess is the result of a special selection 
We were chosen to have this trait, in fact there are amazing examples 
To the opposite, or appear as examples of the opposite, take for example our ability 
To deal with the abstract properties of the number system, and such 
A distinct human ability, such as distinguishing the linguistic ability, any natural person - in fact 
Even at some pathological level - he can understand the properties of the digital system, and he can go 
Far to understand its profound properties. But it is very difficult to believe that 
This ability is the result of a certain selection. People hard to believe 
Those who were better at proving mathematical theories had more children, for example. 
This did not happen. In fact, during most of human evolution, but fundamentally in fact 
All Human Evolution It is impossible to know which capacity was present 
The coincidences that allowed her to operate never happened. 
Rather, the trait is present, the ability is present, and the mental organ if you wish is what has developed 
It likely developed in conjunction with other features of the brain 
Perhaps she was elected. For example, we can guess that the size of the brain increases 
Was a factor in distinct production, and hence in evolution, perhaps because of 
Physical laws that we do not currently know make the brain increase in size 
Under certain conditions of human evolution it simply leads by necessity into order 
Has the ability to deal with the characteristics of a digital system. Well this is something related 
With physics in the end, and then the mind that developed, the brain that developed will have it 
That ability, but not because it was obtained through election. Now I guess it at least 
Something similar to this is true for human language. I mean sure if it was 
Useless as it lasted, obviously functional, but it's a big leap 
To claim that linguistic constructs themselves are a consequence 
To a specific election, which is a leap I don't think is reasonable - what you are saying 
About our limitations, I have the following idea 
We all - I think - have experienced the idea that in social life each one of us is individual 
He tends to create an image of the world related to his own experience, and really 
It's hard to see how we could do anything else. We do not have 
alternative. But that means that each of us creates a distorted image 
Of the world because each of them is built on what has become 
A special as well as narrow experience for the person who fought it 
Do you think that any of that happened to humans in general? 
Because of the reasons you included in your theory. In the sense that the whole picture that 
Mankind made it for the universe, for the world, it must be distorted 
More seriously, it is limited by the nature of the comprehension tools 
That had been made available to him - I certainly think it is as I mentioned. But one more time 
I will question the use of the word (limited) which has unwanted connotations. 
Suppose it is one of our capabilities, a part of our mind - if you will - let's call it 
(Scientific ability) The ability to produce clear explanatory theories 
In some areas, when looking at the history of science, we discover that it is time after time 
When a certain question is asked at a certain level of understanding, it was possible 
That the imagination takes an innovative leap to reach theories rich in explanation and explanation were presented 
Image of part of the universe - usually false theories 
As we discovered later, but after another jump it followed. And that might be the case 
We are only because of what we have and what we share without the rest of the creatures, which is the ability to build science 
Which restricts us - as you say - but at the same time provides us with possibility 
Finding explanatory theories that go much further than any available proof. 
Realizing this is important, it is obvious, but it deserves a mention 
When a new theory is created - and I don't necessarily mean something like Newton's theory, what I mean is something that might even be 
Small theory, what scientists usually do - first has very limited proof 
The theory goes far, far beyond that proof. Second, most evidence available 
Really ignored, she leaves aside in hopes that someone else will 
He takes care of her later, so we can forget her for now. So at every stage in the history of science 
Even in ordinary science, not in scientific revolutions, there is a high degree of 
Tendency to idealism, so there is a choice between evidence, distortion of some evidence, creation 
For a new theory, confirmation, refutation, or modification of that theory, promoting it further and making it more perfect. 
These are all steps of cognitive curiosity, and we usually have the power to make them 
On making it somehow understandable to others. It just doesn't look like 
Random result of imagination. As long as it is possible to develop understandable theories, we can 
Some understanding of the nature of that aspect of science. Now this is possible 
Just because we are strictly programmed, because somehow we have developed 
Through evolution or through a certain ability to produce specific theories 
Of course, it follows, or at least it is logical to assume that this ability 
Which enables us to create very rich and successful theories in a field 
It might be very misleading in another realm, for example if there was a Martian scientist looking 
To us and watching our successes and mistakes from a higher level of intelligence, perhaps 
They would be amazed to find out, while in some areas we seem to be able to 
With important progress, in other areas we are running towards a dead end because 
Our brains are too constructed for the cognitive leap 
Required, we cannot mold these issues, we do not have the classifications and nomenclature required 
Knowledge of that field. Do you think our study of our ability to produce language? 
Hence our cognitive abilities - as you call it - our ability to know and understand 
And we learn - if these studies you're a pioneer produced a massive, growing amount of 
Knowledge of all those human functions and capabilities, do you think that each 
This growing knowledge will enable us to change, and thus will actually expand our capabilities and jobs? 
I think that's way too far because jobs are biologically given. Can 
We study the structure of the heart, but we don't do that because we think we can substitute 
Heart with a different kind of pump might be more efficient, for example, that's the case here 
As I think, if we achieve a true understanding of the parts of the mind, it might 
It helps us marginally with some of the illnesses, but I can't see how 
This could provide us - at least through current science or reliable science - with any method of modification 
These capabilities, what we can do - I mean at the theoretical level 
What is conceivable is that we can discover something about the limits of our ability to formulate the sciences 
We can discover, for example, that some types of questions fall further from 
The area that we are able to build clear theories about, I think 
That we may now have a glimmer of insight about those boundaries that might be between 
Theories that are within our ability to understand, and areas about which it is impossible to theorize 
And the case that we discussed before perhaps one of them, take, for example, the question about .... 
Well .. if you go back to the early history of science, the beginnings of science, reflection 
People ask questions about celestial bodies and the sources of human action 
We are now asking the same questions about the sources of human action 
No progress has been made, we have no idea how to answer this question in a scientific framework 
We can write novels about this, but we cannot create even 
False scientific theories about him. We simply have nothing to say when we ask the next question: How is it made 
A person has made a specific decision and not another when the decision-making is free? 
We have no way to deal with this issue. On the other hand a history of physics 
For example he has made substantial progress, and it looks as big as I think so 
The huge difference between progress in one area and not achieving anything in another field reflects 
Special qualities of our ability to craft science. And we may be able to explain that 
Someday, if it were true. So far we have talked about this discussion 
It suggests that all organized thinking is done through language, but of course it is not the case, is it? 
I mean - looking at so many examples, and music is the most remarkable for me 
If you take a musician like Stravinsky, who wrote amazing, complex and original music 
And it was a revolution in its field, like the enormous orchestra (Spring Weather) 
So it is a thought on an inherent and complex level 
Perhaps he was thinking in a very detailed and clear way 
What's more, he created a structure that could be clearly expressed to others, and so on 
Nevertheless, words did not enter this process at any stage, as far as I know, 
Are this fact and other similar facts a threat to your theories? Well, not quite 
In fact, almost the opposite is true. My hypothesis is that the mind is not an identical system 
It is a very disparate system. In fact, it is basically like the body 
A system made up of functions and organs, and language is simply one, not on us 
To go to a level like Stravinsky's level to find examples of thinking without language, I'm sure 
Everyone who introspects his thoughts, and thinks about what he is doing, will know immediately 
That much of his thinking does not contain language, or, say, a cat's thinking 
For example, it is clear that there is no language in it, there are other ways of thinking 
There are other jobs and queens, and I think the musical faculty is one of them, and she is especially a queen 
Interesting, I think, because it's very ... it's a field somehow 
Like physics it has a rapid and rich evolution but across 
A long period of Western history in a way that is understandable to others 
I mean not immediately, but after a short while, 
And the twentieth century in which this feature is strikingly shown by musical creativity in the twentieth century 
I also think it differs qualitatively from eighteenth century music, for example, which is missing 
Direct receive, or near-term reception, that was true in the past, and needed 
Needed to experiment to prove it, but I have no doubt if we had two children today 
Or two groups of children, and one of the two groups taught us music, for example Mozart, Hayden and Beethoven, and we learned 
And we taught the other music of Schoneberg and post-Schonberg music, there will be a very fundamental difference 
In their ability to understand it and deal with it, and that may actually be reflected - if only 
That was true - it would provide some illustration of our innate musical abilities, some points about 
This ability has been discussed before, I remember Paul Hindmith 25 years ago 
I think in lectures he brought up the idea that breaking a musical law is a thing 
Similar to the effort required to break the law of gravity. He meant 
Thus it is an innate property. - I don't want us to keep talking about 
Compare to music a lot because I just used it as an example 
It actually shows that you think we are preprogrammed 
In many aspects, is not it? I mean using gestures, recognizing faces, and having 
A shared picture of the world and so on. Well, every area of   human existence 
It deserves to be studied, because it has a rich, complex and progressive structure 
It has a unified system, otherwise it would not deserve to be studied, and these are exactly the cases 
In which we expect to find pre-programming, making these great achievements possible 
So in other words, you think everything we do proves our preprogramming 
Games, habits, dress code, way of eating ... everything. - Well here I think again 
Some caution is required. For example, games 
It seems reasonable to say that the games were designed 
At the outer limits of our cognitive abilities, we don't invent games that we're in 
As good as we are at using words, for example, because then it will not be a fun game 
Because everyone will know it, what we do is we invent games like chess, for example, and it is a very simple game 
The gameplay is pretty trivial, but we are nonetheless 
We are not very good at it. In the case of using the language we are all very excellent and there is no 
We have a difference and differentiation from one another. But when you look at something like chess, it is - I suppose 
On the limits of our cognitive ability, in this case individuals of a similar level of intelligence 
They will differ greatly, however, in their ability to deal with these artificial issues 
This is what makes it a fun game, and in fact I also think there is 
Tasks that can exist and are really outside the limits of our perceptual capacities. 
In fact, I even think that there is a science of interest in the development of this type of job 
It is psychology. Most recent psychology studies are interested in discovering the functions that 
Which are not subject to the general laws of the human race. Basically any laws exist among a number 
Of human beings. Or to create good science experiments. Any experiences have the characteristic of slow learning 
By adding regular additions to them and so on. There are tasks like 
(Running in a maze) The level of mice in it is close to that of humans. They are all bad at it 
And these - I think - are the tasks that actually happen outside of our perceptual ability 
So we advance in it by trial and error, by the catalyst ... and so on - but essentially your approach is complete 
He made a rejection of the experimental tradition in philosophy, did he? Because it is clear 
You think the empiricists were wrong about how we learned, and that must mean they are 
Are wrong with regard to knowledge and the nature of knowledge. And the nature of knowledge is 
The central question in all the empirical heritage of philosophy. Well, the classic experimental heritage 
Which I think may have been submitted 
In his portrait at the hands of Hume, it appears to me to be an extremely important heritage. 
A specific theory on the sources of knowledge, and a science of human nature 
According to Hume's phrase. Empirical theory - I think Hume, for example, was 
He considers it an experimental theory. He takes it, when we study it I think we find out 
It is completely wrong, because the mechanisms discussed by him 
They are not the mechanisms by which the mind accesses states of knowledge. Because cases of knowledge 
Acquired is quite different from the species discussed, for example, in relation to Hume 
The mind, in its conception, was like a theater on which ideas appear 
And it necessarily follows that we can reflect and introspect 
What our mind completely contains, if the idea is not on that stage, then it is not in my mind 
And the idea may be related to others, then after that the matter went until he said that there is no theater 
There are only ideas, hence the idea he presents is misleading. Well, it's a theory 
It is a theory that actually had a great control over thought across 
Most of the history of Western thought - to the best of my knowledge. For example the image itself 
It also dominated the rational heritage that was assumed to be possible 
Processing and studying what the mind contains by paying careful attention to it. Pay attention to evolution 
Those clear and distinct ideas and the resulting ideas and so on, and in fact 
That even if we go for an example to someone like Freud and use the concept of the unconscious, 
I think a careful reading will make it clear that he considers the subconscious to be accessible 
That is, we can clearly perceive that theater and the things that are on it 
Only if it is possible to overcome the obstacle of suppression and the like. Well if it is 
What I suggested is correct, all of this is fundamentally wrong. I mean since the point where 
Go from it. I never see that there is reason to believe that principles 
The metallic account, for example, has an overlap with our actions, our interaction, or our speaking 
Or a belief that all of this can be deduced and contemplated, a belief that is no different from 
The belief that the analysis of the mechanism of action of the visual system or, for example, the nature of the liver 
Can be deduced. It seems to me that you are returning 
The same point again and again. That is because many issues have been discussed, and many theories 
Compiled by philosophers in the aggregate. But also psychologists, and I just mentioned 
Freud, and in your writings you mention many others - who have theorized physiological processes 
It is therefore available for verification through scientific research. And when achieved by research 
You find all of these theories are wrong, and so on you 
They fundamentally destroy many of the well-established theories in our heritage. It seems to me 
What I have raised here over and over is a parallel 
To the legacy of the rationalists. I said in my introduction to this episode 
That your deeds always remind me of (she's) theories. It seems to me 
You almost re-put forward what (was) but in linguistic terms, do you agree with that? 
Is there any truth in that? I don't just accept that it's true, I tried to 
Show it off somehow. I never specifically referred to (Kant), but I referred instead 
To the writings of European Cartesians in the seventeenth century and to 
English Neoplatonists who introduced a number of ideas that are now much more famous 
Attribute it to (Kant), for example the idea of   matching experience to our way of perception 
And specifically the idea of   the English Platonic Caddeworth 
I think it's a rich mine of insights into the organizing principles of the mind 
Where the experience is well built. I think one of the rich sources for ideas 
Psychology that I know, which is a legacy that I believe can be embodied 
This is further clarified by the empirical research currently available. Of course I think 
We should disagree with that heritage in a number of aspects, and I mentioned one of them 
Specifically, the belief that the contents of the mind are open to introspection. As well 
There is, of course, no reason to accept the metaphysics of this heritage. 
The belief that there is a duality between mind and body. I mean, you can understand the reason that led the Cartesians 
till then. It was rational behavior on their part, but we don't have to follow them 
We have other ways to approach this issue. Another thing I mentioned in the introduction 
In fact, you have a global reputation in two fields, the other side besides linguistics 
Being a political activist. And it seems to me that there is a relationship between 
These two aspects you have, and I want to ask you the following question: 
Liberalism grew in the history of European thought, and was closely related to experimental philosophy 
And scientific research has been clear in the call for non-delivery 
Absolute power, she advocated looking at facts and independent judgment 
And this was a revolution in politics, science and philosophy, and because of that 
Liberalism has always been considered in Western thought the primary opposition to authority 
But you, as you opposed empiricism, you also opposed liberalism, and you now say in your writings 
Regardless of the liberal past now I have become 
An ally of the authority, do you agree with me that there is a relationship between 
Your work in linguistics and what you know about opposing the war in Vietnam? 
Well that raises a number of overlapping questions. Let me first talk about liberalism 
It is a very complex concept. And I think of course it is true because liberalism arose 
In an educated environment that believes in empiricism and the rejection of authority, and trust 
Evidence provided by the senses and so on, but liberalism has succumbed over the years 
A very complex evolution process as a social philosophy. If we return to the classics 
Or at least what I consider to be a classic of liberalism, such as Humboldt's limits to state action 
And that inspired (Mel) this true liberal classicism. The world that was 
Humboldt thinks of him - which, by the way, is a partly fictional world, but the world 
For which he developed this political philosophy, a world that arose after conflicts but before the world of capitalism 
A world in which there is no great disparity between individuals 
In the kind of power they possess and in what they have power over it, but it was there 
An enormous difference between individuals on the one hand and the state on the other hand, and thus 
The task of liberalism was to concern itself with human rights and equality between individuals ... 
And so on, the task of liberalism was to dissolve the huge power of the state 
Which was threatening the freedom of individuals. Hence the classical liberal theory 
For example, Humboldt and Mill understand it. But that was, of course, before capitalism 
He did not imagine that there would come a time when there would be gatherings of individuals 
Or a period in which there is enormous disparity in controlling resources and production 
It will differentiate between individuals on a large scale. Now in a society of this kind 
Liberalism is superficial liberalism, if we look at it through the understanding of Humboldt, because while opposing state power 
In that period they coincide with Humboldt's findings. That opposition did not reach that 
Because it did not start from the principles laid down by Humboldt, because the principles he set lead to very different results 
I specifically believe that Humboldt's assumptions lead to the conclusion that we must dissolve the rule of power 
The sources of production that lead to disparities between individuals. In fact 
I believe that a direct line can be drawn between classical liberalism and libertarian socialism 
Which can be viewed as a kind of adaptation to the main principles and impulses 
Classical liberalism in a different social era. Now if we come to the modern period 
Liberalism has acquired a very strange meaning for its history. Now liberal 
It is basically a theory of state capitalism and state intervention in the capitalist economy 
This has a very weak relationship with classical liberalism. In classic liberal truth 
It is what I think is known now as conservatism or conservative approach. But the current liberalism is a new view. I think 
- in my view at least - she is hugely authoritarian because she accepts 
The centralization of authority and leadership in the state on the one hand, and for the gathering of special forces 
On the other hand, they all deal with individuals as malleable gears in a machine that has no will 
It may be called democracy, but a fair distribution of power 
It is far from being democratic, nor can it be done through it. And so my feeling always 
To reach the liberal model of the premises that originally created it 
In a very different society, we have to go in a very different direction 
Superficial and wrong to accept the results obtained in a different society 
Without considering the reasons and motives that led to those results. The reasoning I think 
very important. I am a classic liberal in this sense. But I guess that leads me to 
To be a socialist, not authoritarian. - Well, I would have liked to follow up with you on this matter 
Professor Chomsky. But this needs a new discussion and a new episode. So I think 
Sorry that we have to settle for this much. thank you very much
