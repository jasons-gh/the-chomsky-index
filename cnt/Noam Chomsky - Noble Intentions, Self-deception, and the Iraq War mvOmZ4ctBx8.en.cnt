when you think about the leaders like
let us say the present set of organisms
that launched this dreadful Iraq
misadventure do when you're thinking
about things like that how important to
you is it their level of self-deception
we know they launched the whole thing in
a swarm of lies the evidence for that's
too overwhelming to even need to be
referred to now my view is it is that
the deception and train self-deception
very easily I agree
I'm not sure they launched it with lies
but and it's perfectly possible they
believed it yeah that's I mean in fact
if you look we don't have a detailed
record but from the record we have it
looks as if they were kind of
cherry-picking they had a goal yeah and
then they sort of cherry-picked
intelligence and coerced intelligence
yes to yield evidence that would
contribute to that goal yes and anything
that under conflicted with it just was
tossed out or in fact the people were
closed up like the joint editor Jesus -
right - but but that doesn't necessarily
mean it's self-deception I mean it's
very easy to I think we all know it from
personal life easier with young children
you see two kids fighting about a toy
let's say and the older one takes the
toy from the younger one and his mother
comes in and starts berating him they
give you an answer saying look it was
really mine and yeah you know he took it
for me and he didn't want it anyway yeah
you build up the whole story which kid
probably believes no they're not and
it's I suspect it's pretty similar when
the Cheney and Rumsfeld pick the
evidence they want to invade another
country yep suspect more or less the
same mechanisms so be sure it is
self-deception but it just dump it's
it's it's so automatic its effort and
you know energy to try to see yourself
from a distance yes it's hard to do no
it is I think in everyday life we're
aware of
fact that when we're watching something
on stage so to speak we have a better
view overall view than the actors on the
stage AB you know if you can see events
lateral and sideways you can say my god
they're doing this and they're doing
that but if you're embedded in that
Network at the time very much harder I
think you can you can see it very
clearly but just comparing historical
events which are similar you know
they're never identical but similar so
if they take the Russian invasion of
Afghanistan the Saddam's invasion of
Kuwait the US invasion of Iraq just take
those three well you know from the point
of view of the of the people who
perpetrated it it was a noble effort and
done for the benefit of everyone no
reason to think they were lying now they
had arguments in fact the self
justifications are kind of similar acts
I was an interview with a Polish
reporter a couple of weeks ago and we're
talking about this and I asked him
whether he'd been reading Pravda during
the you know during the Afghan war we
didn't have to go on with the
conversation he just laughed because he
saw the point right away I mean yeah it
was about the same as the u.s. British
press world regard to the Iraq war the
there was criticism of the war and in
the Soviet press same kind that there is
here well it's costing too many lives
you know poor brave soldiers dying in
vain we can't bring the gifts we want to
bring to the Afghan people we can't
bring because of terrorists who were
stopped jihadi Islamic crazed terrorists
who were trying to disrupt people's
lives and we're improving things in
Kabul you know women go to the
university but how can we do this with
the terrorists around and you know
that's it almost translates but we can't
see it for ourselves we can see it for
them you know like nobody doubts that
the Russian
committed aggression that thun saying
committed aggression we attribute to
them rational goals you know maybe they
wanted to control the energy in the
Middle East or something with regard to
ourselves it's impossible which I've
reviewed a lot of the scholarly
literature and journalistic literature
on this and it's close to universal we
just cannot adopt towards ourselves the
same sane attitudes that we adopt easily
in fact reflexively when others commit
crimes that's like your terrorism
example just can't can't do it and if
anyone says it you know educated liberal
intellectuals are infuriated because it
suggests that we could do something
that's not Noble we can make mistakes
that's easy
so you criticize mistakes you can
criticize low-level crimes like a great
you can criticize that and criticize me
lie but not the educated civilised
people the kind of people we have dinner
with you know see it concerts sitting in
air-conditioned offices planning mass
murder
so that's beyond criticism on the other
hand if it's half crazed the GI is in
the field uneducated learner who's going
to shoot at him next you know even blame
them and say look how awful they are and
it's the Abu Ghraib is his name universe
Isley England you know disadvantaged
young women very different from us I
better have that the guys organized and
planned it you might be interested in a
book that's coming out by very smart guy
James Peck I was a sign ologist
got a book coming out called
Washington's China in which he does a
very in-depth analysis of the national
security culture he went through the
National Security Council literature you
know the background literature and so on
he does it kind of a both unannounced
the content but also psychological
analysis that was reminding me of a tall
timer talking there when he shows their
elaborate techniques of self-deception
to try to build up a framework in which
we can justify things like say invading
overthrowing the government of Guatemala
yeah on the visit of some noble
objective right and it's done by sharp
making everything as dean acheson once
said you have to make it clearer than
truth and as this picture gets
internally created and built up on by
each group of national security staffers
it becomes like a real fundamentalist
religion is showing extraordinary
self-deceit yeah and then you end up
with the changes in the room soon
