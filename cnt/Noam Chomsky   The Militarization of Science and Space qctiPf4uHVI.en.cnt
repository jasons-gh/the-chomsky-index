huh um so i'm sarah and i'm from the
social justice cooperative and this is
luke and we've been organizing this talk
and we just we've been organizing it
with the technology and culture forum
and we're actually passing around a
sign-up sheet for SJC and so if you guys
want to sign up and learn out more about
our club and then also our web address
is um web MIT edu slash justice and so
you can find it more about organization
that way and now introducing Amy
mccreath who's going to introduce
professor Chomsky great thank you Sarah
my name is Amy mccreath I'm the
coordinator of the technology and
culture forum at MIT and it's been a
great pleasure working with the social
justice cooperative to bring you this
program this afternoon we're all looking
forward of course to hearing what
professor Chomsky has to say about the
militarization of space and science
before we begin I want to draw your
attention to a few upcoming programs
that if you're here today my guess is
you'd be interested in these programs as
well the first is a program that we're
doing again with the social justice
cooperative and it's on depleted uranium
it's an all-day symposium on March the
sixth here at MIT and there's
information about this program in the
lobby on a sheet that looks like this
also on march to the 31st the technology
and culture forum will be putting on a
panel discussion on the topic of evil
and this topic has come up obviously
because you hear the word evil an awful
lot and political rhetoric these days
and we're going to take a look at
whether that term has a place in
political rhetoric and if it has any
meaning in our day and age so of
scientific and theological views on the
topic of evil and that panel features
James Carroll who you may know if you
read the boston globe to find out more
about the technology and culture forum
and the social justice cooperative do
pick up information in the lobby or go
to the MIT home page and you can find us
through that homepage
I do need to cover a few logistical
things before we get started today
professor Chomsky is going to be
speaking for about 45 minutes and after
that we'll have over an hour for
questions from you we do need to be out
of the auditorium at about three o'clock
so we'll call things to a halt just
before three o'clock when we get to the
questions there are microphones set up
in the aisle and two aisles and the
lights will come up so you can find your
way to them and we'll just go back and
forth from one microphone to the other
and we do ask that you ask a question if
you come to the microphone rather than
making a statement we appreciate your
cooperation with that we do have some
people here this afternoon who have some
clearance from us because they're with
the press to take some flash photographs
during the talk but we'd ask that the
rest of you respect the fact that lots
of flash lights going off in professor
Chomsky space is really fairly
distracting and so please do refrain
from flash photography during the talk
this afternoon after our event is over
today if you want to review anything
that you heard or if you have a friend
who couldn't come today who'd like to
hear what professor Chomsky had to say
you can refer them to the technology and
culture forum home page where they can
click through and get to an audio
archived version of this event and be
the top would be audio archived at our
at our page on the web and you can
listen to it in the future and refer
others to it finally we have a special
award to give out today to the people
who've traveled the farthest to be with
us big fans professor Chomsky who came
all the way from Dublin so please give a
round of applause to Allison and lead
who are here from Dublin for today's
event
they get the first question he says
professor Chomsky spoken in this
auditorium hundreds of times although he
claims that at one of his talks back in
the late 60s only six people showed up
so it feels kind of funny introducing
him because most of you know an awful
lot about him but let me say a few words
just in case you missed something
professor Chomsky is an institute
professor of linguistics at MIT he's
been here since nineteen fifty-five sort
of in addition to being at MIT he's also
been all over the world several times
participating in all sorts of social
actions and doing a lot of work on
behalf of those who who need to have
someone help them find their voice and
working for social change in so many
wonderful ways he's an honorary has an
honorary degree for more than 20
universities worldwide and in addition
to transforming his field of linguistics
he's written over 30 books on social
issues political issues political
economy corporate media globalization
and all sorts of topics that we all care
about very much and too for that were
extremely indebted to him if you go to
Google and do a search on his name
you'll find that you get about 300,000
hits compared to three million hits for
Janet Jackson
but despite this fact we know that
inquiring minds understand that Noam
Chomsky is America's greatest attraction
and we're very glad to have him here
today
actually that reference to the talk
where maybe a dozen people showed up I
might have been exaggerating it is
rather relevant to the topic this was
actually and I think would have been
about nine about 1969 1970 at that time
MIT was close to a hundred percent
Pentagon funded a very tightly linked to
the military in many ways a very pretty
conservative institution but I was
changing but it's pretty quiet the topic
that they was something that was about
government repression programs of
government repression we were far more
serious than anything that's happening
today farmer series but nobody cared
much about them that's why there were
only a few people here today much
significant but much less severe
repressive programs have elicited quite
a lot of practice the immediate reason
for that talk was the murder of a black
panther organizer black organizer by a
Gestapo style assassination set up by
the FBI I had just come back from
Chicago that it's funeral and we wanted
to try to arouse some interest in the
cointelpro operations of the government
which were massive the state repression
program that ran through four
administration's carried out by the
national political police leading all
the way to political assassination as in
this case but very broad anyway nobody
much was interested if you go back a few
years that would
be true today I'm sure also if you had
if you go back a few years earlier and
you looked say you walk down the halls
at MIT of MIT it wouldn't look at all
like this audience today it would have
been polite well-dressed white males
period few scattered exceptions well
that it's different now it's much more
civilized place in many respects and
these are things that have happened all
over the country and they do indicate
that things can change fact right at
about that time was the first time that
issues of militarization of science an
authorization space was not such a big
issue than with militarization of
science were just becoming a significant
issue on campus significant enough so
that the campus was virtually closed
down for about two weeks in during
student activities which began with a
takeover with student center and went on
for a couple of weeks and finally led to
a day in which the incident was
officially closed in order to discuss
the question of social responsibility of
science and technology which by then was
a huge campus issue and a few years
earlier had been non-existent and it's
led to change it and the issues I think
a very serious today and it doesn't hurt
to look back a few years and see how
much has been changed thanks to
primarily student activism which here
other places and there's no reason to
think that that process has come to an
end the student activism and the act
general activism mostly young people had
a democratizing and civilizing effect on
the society it also led to an extremely
severe reaction and we're not we're
still in the midst of that reaction
which took many forms people with power
and privilege don't give them up easily
and that struggle continues and will
continue to go on and it's at the moment
in my opinion at least with a pretty arm
in a state since it I don't think it's
an exaggeration to say that by now the
stakes have gotten so high that issues
of survival actually arise for the
species even well let's he's going to
the topic militarization of science and
space this in part has to do with issues
of world combination to Germany and part
it has to do with issues of the domestic
economy and society a militarization of
science and space is extensively
involved in both so let me start with
the economy and going a little bit to
broader issues of global dominance I
just want to talk about the economy a
good place to start is with the most
respected expert sometimes called st.
Alan Alan Greenspan who presided over
the economy of the glowing economy of
the 1990s with great pride and just gave
his congressional review a couple of
days ago closely watched by financial
markets other businesses economists and
so on the detailed analysis of his
picture of the state of the economy and
what to do about it and you can this
buddy described i think is pretty
accurate as far as i know you can
explain it in palo syllabic words or you
can put it simply and since x pretty
short put it simply the basic principle
that he enunciated and
he understands is that the the basic
principle in which the economy is based
is that you have to make rich people
happy and you have to make everybody
else frightened that's a crucial
condition for what's called health of
the economy and if you take courses in
advanced economics they put it in
different ways but it's about what it
comes down to in Greenspan understands
it very well the logic is very simple if
you make rich people very happy then
maybe they'll invest some of their money
at home and maybe that'll trickle down
to the rest of you and maybe it'll have
a job and something to eat and so on now
the other end of rich people are unhappy
none of that happens because the society
is very remote from a Democratic Society
decision-making is highly centralized in
the hands of concentrated wealth and
privilege and those are the decisions
that matter you can read it on the op-ed
pages of the New York Times today in
bigger words but that's the essential
principle so if you're a homeless person
in the street your main goal has to be
to ensure that the guy writing by and
the limousine is satisfied because if he
is maybe something will trickle down to
you what about the rest of the
population outside of the and the way
you do this is st. Allen explained is by
ensuring that the rich have no
responsibilities are very limited
responsibilities to pay for what this
happens in the society so you know sharp
tax cuts directly to the rich other
techniques of corporate tax evasion and
so on a whole network of things like
that that makes rich people happy so we
have hope for a healthy economy everyone
else has to be frightened and saint
ellen has been quite explicit about this
in describing is the health of the
economy that he supervised
past 10 years regularly in his
congressional testimony he's been saying
that the economy which is very proud of
was working so well because for one
reason because of what he called a
growing worker in security in more
technical terms that means a flexible
labor market which is supposed to be a
good thing growing worker and security
flexible labor market means that you go
to sleep at night you don't know if you
have a job tomorrow and that's a very
healthy for the economy because if
workers are insecure that they're not
going to ask for decent wages they're
not going to try to organize they're not
going to try to get benefits they won't
care if corporations carry out the
illegal actions to undermine health and
safety regulations or to prevent union
organizing as they were essentially
authorized to do almost officially by
the current incumbents in Washington
during the Reagan faith the they care
about it but they won't do anything
about it because they're too insecure
and too frightened and that's very
healthy for the economy and it
translates into economic consequences so
during the period of this is what's
called outside the United States a
period of what are called outside the
United States and neoliberal measures we
don't have a word for it in the United
States because it's better not to have a
word for something that you don't want
people to think about and discuss so in
a way of referring to the economic
policies that have been implemented in
the United States and around the world
in the past 20 25 years that's in part
of reaction to the democratizing
activism of the 60s it's a part of way
of trying to restrain it around the
world but what's called sometimes
globalization or Washington Consensus
neoliberalism elsewhere those policies
do have economic consequences one
consequence is
that and growing worker in security is
one of the ways to implement them there
are other ways the student debt is
another way for example students could
be much more free to be take time out
for activism back in the 60s but they're
much less free today because of the
Disciplinary effect of huge student debt
that explained poses a burden limits on
what you can do this is the main purpose
of it beats white Tony Blair in England
is now the Labour Party is demanding
private to compare rise in tuition to go
to colleges one reason is it keeps out
the wrong kind of people but a more
important one is that it imposes a
dissipated poses discipline on those who
do good they're going to end up in debt
it control free none of those dangerous
things and there are many other
mechanisms eliminating constraints on
financial on capital movement across
borders is a major factor also a
disciplinary well the neoliberal
policies do have effect they have been
associated with slowdown of economic
growth productivity growth productivity
in fact most macroeconomic measures have
declined for the countries that kept to
those rules the more they kept to them
the worst the effects the few countries
that escaped that just ignored the rules
like the East Asian countries for a long
time so that's one major conscious this
effect probably at least associated with
the domestically the effects have been
striking for about the ninety percent of
the population the lowest ninety percent
of taxpayers real income has in fact the
decline but about seven percent from
the mid-1970s when these policies were
instituted until the year 2000 last good
statistics that's pretty unusual in
economic history for a long period of
stagnation and decline for most of the
population the and people and in
addition to that work hours of increased
sub us has by now highest we're loaded
in the industrial world and benefits
which were never very great at decline
and a lot of other harmful effects that
people are like well if they don't like
the effects they might do something
about it I mean it is pretty great free
countries in many ways is not a very
repressive state can't be sometimes it
can but only if people allow it to be
the and they might do something about it
and that's dangerous so you have to keep
them quiet and the best way to keep
people quiet it pass it if one of the
best ways is just frightened so there's
a constant effort it's been going on
since for the last 25 years roughly this
period to conjure up demons that are
about to destroy us so you have to agree
to accept heavier workloads lower
salaries and lower prospects and so on
because if you don't we're going to be
destroyed by the demons the latest ones
are Saddam Hussein al Qaeda and before
that it's a whole host of others grenada
garage libya you know the 1988 election
you may recall one by the father of the
current incumbent george bush was one on
a strict race card he was way behind in
the polls until the republican
PR people pulled out the Willie Horton
and then the election was run on the
platform if you don't vote for me black
criminals are going to rape your sister
some of your old enough to remember that
linen will have something like that next
time the but if you keep the population
sufficiently frightened and passive then
maybe they won't look and pay too much
attention to what's happening to them
like the decline in real income for
ninety percent well 4.0 0.01 percent
100th of a percent income went 06 six
hundred percent that has been a
staggering concentration of wealth also
a sharp decline and mobility during this
period and those are the kinds of things
you just don't want people to pay too
much attention to we might ask on the
side just how successful the economy
actually was during this period of the
of which alan greenspan is so proud of
the last ten years it turns out not very
great growth rates other indices were
considerably lower than in the period
from roughly the end of the Second World
War up to the neoliberal programs which
was much higher growth rate around most
of the world also egalitarian growth
initiation of Social Democratic policies
and so on that's been reversed over much
of the world here too in the 1990s the
per capita growth rate in the United
States is approximately like your
productivity growth which is greatly
hailed if you measure it properly is
properly about the same as Europe and in
generally there's nothing much to write
home about unless you happen to be up in
the top if you present which cases very
really is
glorious Puri great cold mage but not
for the population and not for not even
by standard economic measures which
themselves are highly ideological well
that's the circle in globalization
period the neoliberal period st. Alan
has also given more detailed analyses of
the economy and they take us right to
the topic for today elsewhere he's
pointed out that the marvels of the
economy over which he's presided it's
called the new economy derived from
entrepreneurial initiative and consumer
choice in a free market that's why we
had such an innovative society as you
can read on the op-ed page of the
Americans today st. Alan expressed it
more generally and even gave examples of
entrepreneurial initiative and consumer
choice in the free market that we were
blessed with here are his examples
computers the internet satellites lasers
transistors and a couple others those
are the main examples of innovation
through consumer choice and
entrepreneurial initiative well as most
of you probably know their textbook
examples not exotic examples but
textbook examples of innovation and
creativity in the public sector in the
dynamic state sector of the economy
places like the MIT electronics lab
Lincoln labs and so on that's where the
innovation took place and the creativity
and we could
a lot of other examples of and this is a
the general way in which the economy
works it makes sense if you want to keep
the rich happy it makes sense to
socialize risk and cost so make the
public pay the cost and make the public
take the risk and then if anything ever
comes out of it you hand it over to
private carronades vertical corporations
and they make the profit that's a
terrific way to keep the rich happy and
then maybe everybody can make out
somehow and that's the fundamental way
in which the economy works and the
examples that Greenspan picked as I say
or textbook examples from through the
details and you get add a lot more I
won't run through them because he ought
to know about them just from your own
experience and background if nothing
else if not you can find out it's good
literature on it the in fact some of the
normal most ridiculous like the internet
was in the public domain it was publicly
subsidized for almost 30 years before it
was handed over to private corporations
and computers are quite the same and so
this runs through the rest and we can
add a lot more like they take aerospace
including the airline industry which
relies very heavily on public subsidies
a lot of this is under the cover of
defense so we're defending ourselves
from some monster and therefore we have
to put public funds in these things the
aircraft industry the aeronautical
industry again no reason to give the
details because they're familiar but it
also provides the basis for tourism
tourism is largely based on air traffic
and tourism is the main what's called
service industry in the country so we
had that one in
computer-controlled machines numerical
program and press that programming is
also actually largely developed here the
extends to the containerization which is
the centerpiece of current triplets
called trade rather misleadingly button
what's called trade is based heavily on
containerisation which was developed in
the US Navy at public expense and public
risk and handed over to the private
industry seems through the growing
biotech industries today very heavily
relying on publicly funded rd in fact
the crucial part of it seems to of the
pharmaceutical industry and in fact it's
pretty hard to find an exception it goes
well beyond that so in the 1970s in the
early 80s and you'll be able to remember
there was a lot of concern in the United
States about the decline of American
industry relative to particularly Japan
but also Europe but our corporate
managers were simply not picking up they
were making gross errors of management
which is not unusual and we're picking
up we're not picking up the new flexpa
flexible production techniques that were
being developed in Japan and also
applied in Europe and US industry was
falling behind so there was a need to
carry out a program called re
industrializing America started in the
late Carter carrying through in the
Reagan administration well had you read
it how do you rien dust realized America
the usual way the Pentagon developed
programs to design what they call the
factored factory of the future with high
level of automation taking over
borrowing if the poor do it we call
stealing if we do we call borrowing the
technology and
management techniques that had been
developed elsewhere and there was a
program called man tech manufacturing
technology and other called cam
computer-aided manufacturing big
programs publicly funded which taught
corporate executives here how to carry
out the kinds of programs that had been
initiated and developed in Japan Europe
and elsewhere and America was reinvest
realized by that standard method if you
take a look at these programs of
designing the factory of the future that
same with miracle processing and most of
the rest they also involve a form of
class warfare they are designed in such
a way as to increase the managerial
control over the production process and
be skilled workers and machinists and
others and to reduce their control of
the process this was done even when it
was countered to profit it's well
discussed in a book by Dave noble who
was on the faculty here at the time
forces of production do it in detail and
it also increased the technological
component the capital component of
manufacturing decreasing and
impoverishing the labor component so
it's a form of what you might call class
war conducted under the auspices of the
military and in this case without even
much of a pretext of defense against
Amon sometimes there's a pretext like
computers computers were developed both
mostly here around here in the 1950s
under the pretext largely of air defense
we were going to defend ourselves from
airplanes I can cause here at the time
and remember those days and the people
working on the program for that could
see thought that maybe the systems they
were coming up again we're coming up
with good
the United States from World War one
bomber piloted by Snoopy with luck but
had nothing to do with a year of jet
planes and the intercontinental
ballistic missiles and so on but under
that cover this age system and others
computers were developed they were
reduced to the scale where he could
actually sell them the first mainframe
company that came out of that program
IBN was meanwhile learning how to shift
from typewriters and data processing
machines to computers and so it
continues that that was under a military
cover largely sometimes in the early 60s
it shifted to a space covenant actually
late 50s early 60s to the space cover so
extremely important to put a man on the
moon for no known reason other than to
provide massive funding for a high
technology industry there was no other
purpose I'm putting a man on the moon
you get people excited about much
television that's the Apollo project
when people got bored with watching some
clowns stumbling around on the moon for
no purpose the program was dropped
because it had lost its purpose if you
want to explore the moon about the worst
possible way to do it is put a human
being up there for obvious reasons but
it's a great way to pour money into high
technology industry this required you
know massive increase in computer
ability and so on so the right people
got happy from it well the poor people
this time we're as long as they were
willing to watch it on television they
were willing to pay for it and there was
also a story about competing with the
Russians and so on and so forth but
that's pretty much that's the way the
system usually works actually if you
look at
alan greenspan's list of examples of the
entrepreneurial initiative and consumer
choice there's there is one case that he
listed that isn't a textbook example to
prove the opposite namely a textbook
example of the role of the state the
directed economy and socializing risk
and cost that one exception is
transistors and it's an interesting
exception if you look at it it gives you
more insight into how the so-called free
enterprise system works so transistors
were in fact developed in a private
corporation at AT&T Bell Labs and they
were developed at first for scientific
reasons interest technological and
scientific reasons however how was
eighteen t able to do this well AT&T was
a government Rick a control it was was a
monopoly granted monopoly power by the
state of being a monopoly estate with
power granted by the state it was able
to charge monopoly prices and therefore
it had a exits I could use them to build
a great laboratory Bell Labs when the
system was broken up the lab also
shifted sharply towards more short term
applied project but back in the glory
days when it had state guaranteed
monopoly prices they was able to do
things like developing transistors and
radio astronomy developing information
theory and all sorts of things the this
pretty regular flow from here to build
labs in the 50s 60s I also went down a
number of times the so furthermore Bell
Labs in developing the transistor was
using wartime technology during the war
the Second World War the United States
had something pretty close to a command
economy which can be pretty
fishing and in fact that's the fastest
growth rate by far of us in the history
of the US economy industrial production
more than tripled close to quadruple
under state directed controls it was a
very huge growth period the end it same
was true in other countries Germany
England and so on the furthermore once
his transistors were developed ed selim
somehow and there were no very limited
commercial applications with so they
were then at this point another element
of the state directed economy enters
namely procurement so procurement was by
the military by in fact as late as 1958
about ten years after transistors were
invented a hundred percent of the
high-performance transistors being
produced by Western Electric that 18t
production outlet a hundred percent were
being used by the military and that gave
the basis for figuring out how to design
high-performance transistors you know
shot in the arm for micro electronics
and so on through military procurement
almost entire and I finally as usual
they sort of had their way into the
consumer economy but fact is that it
even this one case which is not a
textbook example of the state sector in
innovation and production even in this
case the consumer choice was virtually
zero and market entrepreneurial
initiative was extremely low in fact
throughout we find that that's true and
it is understood it's if you look at the
technical literature it's well
understood that even after these
innovations at public cost and risk
later the market it's a very restrictive
market so just quote sorry for the big
words but I want to close an actual
description in a one of the standard
technological text studies of what's
called competing in electronics today
points out that alegado oligopolistic
competition and strategic integration
among firms and governments rather than
the invisible hand of market forces
conditions today's competitive advantage
and internal division of labor in
high-tech industries it's another way of
saying there isn't much of a competitive
market there are big mega corporations
which are linked to one another and
cooperate interact and are supported by
powerful states and it gives a minimal
degree of competition in high-tech
industries and that is the market and in
fact it's pretty much the market and
other things too so the reason why say
television ads for automobiles feature
people like what's-her-name one who gets
three million hits and you know and the
car is riding on the moment and so on
and so forth the reason for all of that
is because they're not really there's no
real competition for car in the in the
automobile market if it was a
competitive market advertising would say
here's what we have available you know
you like it buy it if I the back of
century that's pretty much advertising
was but once you've cut that competition
to the point where everybody is doing
approximately the same thing and you try
and the corporations don't want too much
competition because it's going to lower
profits so they integrate with one
another and so on then you have to sell
things by some other means you know
people excited about something that the
men want you to do with the thing you're
selling and an enormous you know
look at advertising on anywhere
television anywhere else to see that
that's a poor part of the advertising
business and it's a reflection of the
fact that competition is quite
restricted in most areas and some areas
where you really find it but certainly
not at the core of the economy so st.
Alan well he understands the basic
principle namely keep the rich happy and
keep everybody else frightened he's way
off base on how the economy really works
the way the economy really works is
quite different and militarization of
science is a core part of it well there
is a I should say that the trade
agreements and so on contribute to this
so it takes a NAFTA there was amongst
people who were serious there were
plenty of critics of NAFTA like the
majority of the population but among
serious critics of NAFTA 10 years ago
there was very little talk about job
flight from the United States and Mexico
I me was expected to take place but at a
low level there was a much more serious
attack on working people through an
after a far more serious one namely
NAFTA provided employers with a method
of increasing worker insecurity the core
of a healthy economy as st. Alan
explains flexible labor market how does
it do that by offering by offering
employers to allowing them to use the
threat of job transfer doesn't mean that
they're ever going to do it you know but
if you want to break union organizing
efforts illegally of course it's all
illegal if you want to break union
organizing effort tents keep down wages
reduce benefits and so on one way to do
it is to put up a big sign saying you
know transfer your job or something
propagandizing the workforce to feel
that if they do join the union I don't
lose your job because we're going to go
to you know we're going to go to Mexico
this has been well studied by people
mainly Kate bronfenbrenner the Cornell
industrial relations department under as
studies are published under NAFTA rules
because Clinton was compelled to allow
into the NAFTA rule some meaningless
side conditions having to do with
workers rights and so on and one of them
is carrying out studies to find out
what's going on of course nobody ever
hears about them because it's the wrong
message but the message is that illegal
effort by corporations to undermine
union organizing shot up after NAFTA and
largely worked they did frighten people
they helped increase worker and security
in particular industries and it didn't
happen in the construction industry
because you can't make a credible threat
there but it did happen in industries we
could make a credible threat of transfer
in fact it turned out that most of those
threats weren't intended seriously so if
the union organizing nevertheless took
place has happened than scattering of
cases most of the time they didn't
transfer it because it for other reasons
but it was a good threat and it was a
way to increase worker and security and
therefore is Alan Greenspan and economic
theory explained increases the health of
the economy the flexible labor markets
they don't have irrational efforts to
improve working conditions and health
safety regulations and get decent wages
and so on or harmful to the economy
under the guiding principles well let's
turn to militarization of space that's
an important new frontier gandam Lee 50s
picked up with the Apollo project gave a
big impetus to the computer industry as
incidentally do other state initiatives
so during 60s in fact since tremendous
benefit to the practical private
computer industry are things
National Security Administration the IRS
Medicare which needed tons of computing
capacity and awful lot during the
development phase that's where the
profits were coming from after the
public had paid the almost the entire
cost of research and development and
taking a risk in a hard fury well by the
1960s space was coming along NASA I
became a big part of the militarization
that as you militarization of science
doesn't only include the Pentagon
includes NASA the department of energy
which produces controls nuclear weapons
and if I various other parts of the
federal system the but roughly roughly
call it the Pentagon system loosely I
instantly just another point about this
I mentioned before at the beginning that
go back say 35 years MIT was almost
entirely pentagon fund either big lads
run by might be involved in military
work or else even the academic program
their figures on this if you're
interested came out of a commission that
was set up the pound formation around
nineteen seventy under student pressure
to look into the way MIT worked a lot of
interesting information there I was on
the Commission so they remembered the
but it's published the there has been a
shift since then so Pentagon funding but
not only at MIT but across the country
and R&D has been declining and funding
federal funding from the were called the
health-related Institute's like the
National Institute of Health and others
that's been increasing total federal rd
is stays high but it's been shifting and
its distribution and the reason for that
is apparent to anyone in technology or
anyone who pays attention to the economy
it's generally understood in the back of
the 50s and 60s early 70s the cutting
age edge of the economy was electronic
space and in order to get the public to
pay the costs and take the risks for
that the best way to do it is through
the Pentagon or the space program or
something like that that gives you shot
in the arm for the electronics based
industries but it's been shifting and
the economy of the cutting edge of the
future economy is expected to be biology
based so genetic engineering
biotechnology and so on if you look at
the spin-offs from MIT private
businesses in the 50s and 60s they were
small electronics firms which then got
brought up by Raytheon and I tech and so
on and so forth but standoff MIT faculty
now they're a little biotechnology firms
and take a walk around Kendall Square
and it's back soon they'll get caught up
if they get anywhere by the big
pharmaceutical companies and industries
and that's where the future is going to
be so therefore you have to get the
public to pay the costs and take the
risks for the next phase of the economy
and therefore you have you know annual
double-digit growth in the NIH budget
and so on and so forth and the funding
places like this shifts to hear there
are other pre-pasted it's not by now you
can also have a defense against the
enemy prefixed you know for protected
protection from bioterrorism and so on
but the main prefix has been we're going
to cure cancer or something like that no
you know if you talk to the scientists
working on molecular biology they and
the Cancer Institute don't really think
there's not a cure cancer but you can
sell it the Congress and the public that
way and then go and do your work on big
molecules and so on the fufu which will
ultimately have the some kind of
spin-off effect it's soon then certainly
contributes
science but it's another form of public
control and so the fear of bioterrorism
which is now being stimulated as a way
to get the public to pay for these
things is an interesting case because
just as in the case of the arms race of
the 50s and 60s government policies are
increasing the threat of bioterrorism
pretty consciously in fact come back to
that and the same was true in the 50s
and 60s when they were increasing the
threat of nuclear war and missile
attacks and so on those things go on in
parallel and it's again important to
make sure that people don't think about
them though it's pretty close to the
surface give some examples well so there
has been a shift to some extent to
biology based industries although the
core recent advanced research program of
the Pentagon now DARPA they're still
through the Pentagon pursuing innovative
efforts at the borders in the biology
based reach areas to like neural
engineering or this now program which is
highly touted as what they call the
future of warfare which involves
developing man-machine interfaces
ultimately they hope person-to-person
interfaces and it's I don't know if it's
going to be the future of warfare as is
claimed but it's certainly exploring the
borders of understanding in the
neurosciences and related technologies
and therefore fulfilling the traditional
role of DARPA formally are put to get
the public to pay the cost
so that whatever is going to be the next
phase of the economy a lot of thats
being done right here in today well
let's go to the exciting new frontier
space in the 5th in the 60s it was under
the cover of getting a man to the moon
in the by the 80s people were bored with
that and the plan was SDI Strategic
Defense Initiative Star Wars informally
to protect us from all these guys are
going to be shooting missiles at us this
went on into the Clinton years during
the Clinton period there were quite
important studies produced on their
public so you really ought to read them
they should be front page news so about
six years ago that was an important
study by the Space Command Air Force
Space Command called a vision for
twenty-two for the year twenty twenty
that was about nineteen ninety-seven so
approximately a 25-year vision and it
interesting reading it's like a glossy
pamphlet it's meant you know what they
call it's like a PowerPoint presentation
for so you have big pictures and grass
all the sort of thing and simple words
you know big print but the basic story
is not unreasonable and pretty
straightforward it gives a little bit of
history it says that if you look at
history countries including the United
States had to first develop armies to
defend themselves so the United States
needed an army to defend itself against
the indigenous population who we were
exterminating as we expanded across the
national territory and to defend
ourselves against Mexico when we stole
half of Mexico and so on and so forth
for that you needed Army's also
intervention
so on and then countries also the old
navys like you know British had to
develop a navy to defend themselves
against people in India Africa and so on
and as they described it they are pretty
Frank about that they say they had to
develop navies to protect commercial
interests and investment and same with
us and now there's a new frontier space
and we have to move on to control space
in order to protect commercial interests
and investment terms they use quite
frank pretty accurate the how do we do
this we'll first of all there's a
background analysis which has to do with
it so called globalization which is
shared by the intelligence community
they've also put out long-term
projections about the effects of
globalization and they agree with the
military planners they say that they
think globalization is a wonderful thing
this means the particular corporate
version of economic integration that's
called globalization and the propaganda
system has nothing to do with
globalization but what's called
globalization they say is going to lead
to a widening economic divide economic
stagnation in large parts of the world
unrest violence anger much of it
directed against the United States
increasing terror public proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction and
because of these consequences of
globalization we have to have better
ways to control the world maybe these
armies aren't going to be enough but the
ability to place a highly destructive
offensive weapons and space may be able
to allow us to handle the effects of
globalization and the widening economic
divide and the stagnation and so on and
bitterness and anger that is expected to
bring with it and that's a shared with
the intelligence community other
agencies of the Clinton administration
the Strategic Command were mean while
putting out quite important policy
statements there first classified been
declassified for a couple of years the
most important one was called essentials
of post-war deterrence came out around
1995 big reanalysis of you know what how
we carry out deterrence deterrence means
aggression defense usually means attack
in the public translate words into their
meanings the parents means aggression
and domination so how do we handle post
Cold War deterrence and well they say
again interesting reading they say first
of all it has to be based on nuclear
weapons including first strike to build
the right to use nuclear weapons in a
first strike even against countries that
have that are not only non-nuclear would
have signed the non the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty nuclear weapons
they explain are much better than
chemical and biological weapons although
we have to develop those too because
nuclear weapons have a much more
dramatic effect I mean its immediate
massive destruction and devastation
instead of just the slow killing that
comes with biological weapons and
therefore they have to be the core of
the program of deterrence all right the
they also develop a version of what in
the Nixon administration was called the
madman strategy we have to look like a
lunatic what this is the way they put it
is that this is extremely important for
the US posture to appear to be
irrational
vindictive and to make it seem that
elements in the government are out of
control that frightens the world if
you're irrational and vindictive and
likely to use nuclear weapons because
your leaders are out of control people
get scared the Mafia would understand
this very well and international affairs
are rather like the Mafia when you look
closely there's even a term in the
diplomatic literature called credibility
you're supposed to maintain credibility
and maintain credibility again is
something understood by any mafia don
it's not enough for people to obey they
have to understand what happens to them
if they don't obey so if storekeeper
doesn't pay as protection money on time
it's not enough to go send the goons to
get the money you have to make an
example of it you know beat him to a
pulp or blow his head off or something
like that that establishes credibility
and other people don't get any funny
ideas and maintaining credibility is a
core element of international diplomacy
a lot of examples right up to the
present and it's often put pretty much
that way without the appropriate mafia
analogy but the acting irrational and
vindictive is a way of maintaining
credibility to make sure that people are
properly frightened the Nixon
administration this was designed by
Nixon and Kissinger this madman's
strategy as it was called and even
applied it they applied it and there's
one case that's recently been carefully
studied and turns out in nineteen to the
Kissinger was very proud of Harvard
professor and so I'm very proud of his
ability to fine-tune programs you know
she got him to work exactly the right
way and so on and so forth led to
catastrophe after catastrophe as you'd
expect one of them was in
nineteen-sixty-nine when Kissinger's I
wanted to signal to the Soviet Union
that the u.s. was serious in
refusing to negotiate a political
settlement in Indochina and the way they
decide signal that the Soviet Union was
by declaring a nuclear alert you know
you send the strategic bombers up the
Russians pick it up they see it that's
the point and they're supposed to get
frightened and back away from trying to
pursue the diplomatic settlement that
the US didn't want well they only forgot
one thing which they didn't notice
namely at the time there was a war going
on between China and Russia two nuclear
powers and it was would have been very
possible for that the Russians would
have taken that signal to mean a nuclear
attack is coming that would have been a
reasonable way to interpret the signal
well luckily they didn't or we wouldn't
be around here to talk about it but that
was one of the small footnotes that was
overlooked and the careful strategic
planning under the madman strategy but
knowing all that and many of the cases
we have to use it again because we have
to look at rational and addictive and
frightened people that's the Clinton
administration the does when we move on
to the Bush administration which is the
old Reagan administration remember the
old Reagan Bush one administration
almost entirely mostly recycled more
reactionary elements recycled they've
picked up the reagan-bush one programs
so even before nine eleven there was a
very substantial increase in military
spending actually the greatest increase
since the Reagan administration came in
which isn't surprising same people same
commitment they're not conservatives
they believe in a very powerful
repressive state very violent state so
mainly working for the rich so you have
to have a big increase in military
spending particularly 911 gave it a
further impetus militarization of space
has become a core element of this
and it also is called defense but again
the word defense doesn't tell you
anything carries no information you know
even in the technical sense it's
predictable no matter what's going on
everybody's involved in defense you know
Hitler's invading Belgium's defense so
the word is meaningless carries no
information you have to look at it and
if you look at military at a missile
defense which is core part of
militarization of space none of the
planners and none of the targets
regarded as defense they all regard it
as an offensive weapon for simple
reasons if missile defense were ever to
be credible you know if it ever looked
like it was going to work it would be a
way of carrying out offensive military
actions without or with limited concern
that there could be any retaliation so
it's a weapon of aggression it's
interesting to see that the Chinese
military analysts and the US military
analysts used virtually the same
terminology in describing it they say
it's not just a shield that's also a
sword it's an offensive weapon which
relies on the fact that there may be a
shield against retaliation that's the
way it's understood worldwide and
correctly and it has of course
consequences and the consequence are
known you know intelligence analysts
others have been agencies have been
pointing out for years and you can even
read it in public literature you don't
need classified documents they've
pointed out the obvious that the
potential targets are going to react and
how will they react well the week will
react by increasing terror that's a
technique of deterrence that's available
to the week that can threaten terror so
one effect is the likely effect as
increase in terror which has been
happening but among the major powers the
way they'll react is by increasing their
offensive military capacity so they can
overwhelm any possible missile shield
and
for eliminate the aggressive weapon in
the hands of the US and that's exactly
what's been happening so in Russia had
been reducing its offensive military
forces including nuclear forces
considerably not very efficiently but at
least been reducing them however that's
reversed in 2002 2003 Russian offensive
military spending in spending for
offensive weapons increased
substantially by about a third that
includes nuclear armed missiles on
submarines and also intercontinental
ballistic missiles on submarines which
are in greatly increased the hazard to
the United States been going up sharply
just last December the Russians
announced that they're deploying new
advanced missiles merve missiles
multiple warheads which they claim to be
you know the most destructive and
powerful in the world that was December
and that's exactly what you'd expect
Russia also adopted the Bush
administration's first strike doctrine
so they're like us they now have the
doctrine that they can carry out a first
nuclear strike and they're also putting
their missiles their nuclear of missile
capacity on their auto putting it on an
automated framework launch on warning
it's called computer-controlled missile
launches that is even at best that's
extremely hazardous because these
automated systems are always making
mistakes in fact it came very close any
of you know who are in the field of
Technology you build a complex systems
something's going to go wrong in fact
there's a name for it in the
professional field it's called normal
accident if you make something
complicated enough normally something
will go wrong because there's no way of
controlling every contingency and launch
on warning of systems are automated
systems and if they ain't goes wrong
with them
did you know because missiles go off and
then they return CN goodbye and it's
come very close in 1995 the Russian
automated systems picked up a rocket
launch I think was us maybe us Norwegian
rocket launch and they're computerized
systems determined that it was a first
strike they have a ten-minute gap before
the missiles go off while they get
prepared and at eight minutes into this
ten-minute gap there was human
intervention somebody figured look this
can't be a first strike so they
terminated it and we were two minutes
away from total destruction as the
systems get more destructive and the
more automated that gap reduces so
you're increasing the probability of a
massively destructive normal accident
furthermore since the Russians took over
neoliberal policies in the 90s the usual
effects have taken place their economies
collapsed command and control systems of
deteriorated meaning they don't work
anywhere near as well as the use to
which wasn't so great and that again
increases the risk of course that's
exactly why the RAND Corporation and the
bulletin of the atomic scientists and
well known physicists concerned with
these topics like Steve Weinberg have
been warning that the threat of
accidental nuclear war is probably which
was always high is now greatly
increasing as a result of these
defensive the so-called defensive
measures that's Russia China is of
course doing the same they recognize
that they're the main target of all of
it so they're also increasing offensive
military capacity that means that India
responds they want to keep more or less
equal to China which means that Pakistan
responds to the Indian threat because
you're now reading about that in the
front pages and it has a ripple effect
beyond at the other end of Asia there's
also a serious threat which we don't
talk about in the United States publicly
because it's an offshore US military
base in effect namely Israel but the
Strategic Command does talk about it
they're worried about what happens to
the world and you know so and publicly
they described they're well aware that
Israel has a couple hundred nuclear
weapons and chemical and biological
weapons and they say that this is a
phrase is dangerous in the extreme first
of all in itself because they can be
used but also just because it impels
others to proliferate for balance and
for deterrence and the obvious logic of
deterrent so it increases proliferation
well the front pages are talking about
Pakistan obscuring the fact that it's
highly unlikely that us intelligence
didn't know about this while it was
taking place I mean you know a lot of it
was him published in the Pakistani press
idiot not to know that it was going on
and while the Reagan administration was
certifying Pakistan is not having
nuclear weapons and the colin powell
national security adviser was not
noticing it somehow so you know all
right let's say they somehow missed it
anyway it's been going on all right but
in the case of israel it may also be
going on we don't know it's not reported
much but there was a very ominous lead
story and israel's major newspaper
Haaretz that's only they didn't put in
the english edition so it's only in the
Hebrew tradition which describes a but
you can be sure rannian intelligence and
so on are going to be reading it the
described just a couple days ago it's a
leak from the military somebody in the
military and the leak says that
the United States is providing the
Israeli Air Force that's us planes given
to Israel f-16s another they're
providing the u.s. is providing the u.s.
advanced aircraft based in Israel with
what they call translation of it would
be special weapons well special weapons
probably means nuclear weapons it's a be
no other that's standard terminology and
that's the way it's going to be
interpreted by other intelligence
agencies even if they don't know about
it already which means probably nuclear
warheads for jet bomber missiles which
is a serious threat of proliferation if
it's true even if it isn't true the fact
that it's reported is going and it
probably is will lead this consequence
well in September 2002 as you know the
Bush administration announced its
national security strategy which did
frighten a large part of the world even
the foreign policy a lead here the
conservatives here the when you announce
the strategy was we're going to control
the world by force and destroy any
potential challenge on the grounds that
we're not allowing anyone to have
weapons of mass destruction so if they
have them we have a right to destroy
them the major consequence of not
finding weapons of mass destruction in
Iraq the major consequence is that it
has made this strategy far more dangers
I mean if you read the papers every time
they fail to find something the bars for
aggression go down so today you can read
Colin Powell saying well they had the
intent and ability to produce weapons of
mass destruction and that justifies an
attack okay so now we're down to not
possession or even programs but just
intent and ability well you know
everybody just about has the ability you
could produce them in
mit chemistry and biology labs or
probably high school lives and the
intent is whatever Colin Powell says is
the intent so that means the new
doctrine and this is the most ominous
consequence of the failure to find
weapons of mass destruction the new
doctrine is you can attack anybody
anywhere just because we feel like
because they all have the intent in
abyla intent if we say probably do have
it and certainly the ability anyway
that's serious but that's the doctrine
however if you want it if you announce a
doctor and you want it to be taken
seriously you have to carry out what's
sometimes called an exemplary action
show people you're serious well one in
one case was attacking Iraq that was the
dramatic one exemplar shows we really
mean it yeah I'll stop to talk more in
half an hour I can't believe it but
another consequence and I'll make this
quick was that immediately after the
National Security Council doctrine was
announced the Air Force Space Command
announced its program for the coming
years and that was very important it's
public you can find on their website you
really ought to read it they say we have
to move from control of space which was
the Clinton doctrine to ownership of
space meaning no possible challenge can
be tolerated we own space that follows
from the national security strategy and
they spell it out that it's been spelled
out that means putting up splayed space
platforms with the highly destructive
weapons very intense surveillance of the
whole world with you know hypersonic
drones and all this kind of business
which effectively allows instant attack
without warning anywhere despite a
destructive instant attack without
warning and of course others will
respond well in order to pursue this
it's been necessary to undermine the
whole treaty structure that prevents it
and I won't run through the details but
because there's no time but this is
what's been going on for
years in that's just last December once
again the united states voted virtually
alone picks up micronesia in israel and
so on but essentially alone to at the
general with the generals the united
nations to prevent to prevent the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to prevent
reduction of nuclear weapons to ban the
militarization of space and even voted
against elimination of voted against
elimination of nuclear weapons in the
Middle East again alone virtually and
observing environmental conditions and
arms control agreements that one passed
156 to one and the other votes were more
or less similar it's also blocked
putting preventive measures into the bio
weapons treaties which caused means a
great potential threat to the United
States and so on all of this is just a
prescription for disaster it's known and
it's not surprising in fact from the
point of view of the of our own
intellectual culture it's rational
that's the most frightening part it's
rational within the framework of the
ideology and doctrines that we are
taught from childhood to accept and
there's plenty of history of it of
consciously increasing threats for
because not because you want threats
because they're not important you're
supposed to concentrated on being what's
called a rational wealth Maximizer short
term personal gain is what you're
supposed to do nobody else matters and
that means your children and
grandchildren don't matter you just are
rational wealth maximizing that's
drilled into your head from television
and infancy up to graduate school you
will gotten it in one form or another
and it leads to a general and it's built
into the institutions that's the way
that corporate structure works and has
to
and it's very deeply rooted it's highly
dangerous it if it is if it continues
its pretty certain to lead sooner or
later to a normal accident as some kind
of total disaster the optimistic side of
it is that it means that people like you
people are involved in science and
technology can play a significant role
in reversing it not just the policies
but the whole cultural framework in
which its embedded and that has indeed
happened that what happened at MIT 35
years ago is a good example plenty of
other possibilities okay
you see any light we have the house
lights turned up event I see one okay
why don't we just go up and back yeah
whoever's from the front yes my name is
Bruce gagnon I'm the coordinator of the
global network against weapons and
nuclear power in space we have a table
in the lobby we have on that table the
document that you referred to in much
detail division for 2020 by the United
States Space Command also on the table
we have a brand new video that we
actually have footage of you featured in
as well called arsenal of hypocrisy the
the space program and the
military-industrial complex I just want
to make a quick announcement the global
network was created in 19 please let
this is really important but let's break
the rules for this good I should tell
you that he's modest but he's the person
there's been spearheading the activity
against this for years so she gets a
little leeway the announcement I want to
make is that we're going to have an
international conference on this issue
right here in New England in April the
23rd through 25th in portland maine the
title of it is resisting empire
understanding the role of space and us
global domination and we have
information on the table thank you very
much thanks a lot for saying
I my question has to do with the
category of globalization and worker
fear as you mentioned in your speech
your thoughts on the offshoring of
technology jobs and also the h-1b visas
1.3 million in the last three years that
have displaced technology workers here
in the US including me hmm well actually
there's an interesting op-ed in New York
Times about this this morning by a good
econ a very good economist Jagdish
Bhagwati it's also a not only a fine
economists but every decent person who
really wants to help the poor and the
important things and what he's saying is
that people who are objecting to
outsourcing just don't have their
economic straight if they understood
economics they would know it's a good
thing and why is it a good thing well
because it increases efficiency and
efficiency increases the economic pie
and that's good for all of us and if you
don't allow corporations to outsource
they may die and then there won't be any
jobs for anyone and so on well and then
he says we have a very innovative
society so we should be able to develop
means of overcoming this well everything
he says is true in some abstract model
of the International economy which has
actually no resemblance to reality but
in that model it's true and you can
probably prove a theorem about it in the
actual economy it's very innovative but
not because of private enterprise its
innovative yes because of massive state
intervention exactly what's blocked for
everyone else by the so-called
globalization rules so we're going to do
it because we do anything we like but
others can't do it not furthermore
that's the whole history of the modern
world that's like India India it was a
disaster and
Britain became rich it's because of
those relationships and so it goes so in
the real world yes we're innovative but
not for his reasons furthermore even on
his own terms objecting to suppose it
does but let's take this abstract model
that he's talking about suppose that
corporations die in the United States
well just means they're inefficient so
that means that he and I and you can all
get kicked out of our institutions
because they're just not competitive and
we can apply for jobs as janitors that
you know 80 hours a week no pay or you
know get locked into factories and so on
by factories on din more efficient
places like Thailand and China and so on
maybe that will increase the economic
pie you know so why not advocate that I
mean you know who cares if the
corporation's your diet for them where
the outsourcing has nothing to do with
economic efficiency outsourcing is one
of the operations that take place within
command economies the country the
economy is run by a network of command
economies called corporation I mean what
goes on internal to a corporation or a
mega corporation is not free trade it's
command economy but corporations a
totalitarian institution known as a
board of directors the top of manager
gives orders everyone follows them down
to bottom the very bottom if you're
lucky you can rent yourself to it and
get a job and if you're sufficiently
propagandize you may even buy some of
the junk they produce and so on but it's
certainly not has nothing to do with
what you know any classical economist
would have called a free market
outsourcing is just part of the
technique outsourcing is internal to the
corporation right the corporation picks
some supplier to outsource to and keeps
them under control because then they can
get much cheaper labor
hideous working conditions don't worry
about environmental controls they get
inputs to themselves which are very
cheap that increase for those of you
have studied economics you know that
that increases productivity if you get
artificially chief inputs that increases
productivity because productivity is
measured in terms of you know value
produced divided by the number of
workers so you get a nice measures of
productivity which I have nothing to do
with productivity they just have to do
with the fact that you've got 20 year
old women off the farms and China locked
into factories and working until they
die in a couple of years that very
healthy for the economy but it's all
internal to config command economies
that's one of the reasons why the
concept trade is so ridiculous I mean
what's called trade would certainly not
have been called trade by Adam Smith
like you know that outsourcing happens
to send goods across the border into the
United States but it's under the control
of a command economy in fact the network
of command economies which work the way
it is quoted you know the oligopolistic
competition and strategic interact
integration and the same is true of most
of what's called trade and we don't have
nobody really studies this much so you
don't have really accurate numbers but
we take the numbers that are guests at
by economists to look at it takes a
NAFTA one of the great things about
NAFTA supposed to have been that it
increased trade between the u.s. and
Mexico well it certainly increased
cross-border transfers of material
objects but is that trade well it
depends no it turns out that the
percentage of interaction that's intra
firm internal to a command economy went
from about fifty percent before NAFTA to
about two-thirds after NAFTA
that's not trade anymore than if GM
shift something from Indiana Illinois
you know happens across an international
border so that you can take advantage of
rotten working conditions and low wages
and no environmental constraints but
snow more trade and if the Kremlin moved
something from Poland Hungary or
something like that it's and in fact
it's very possible if anybody ever
bothered the study it that actual trade
is even declined since NAFTA I mean
nobody studies it because it's the wrong
questions to ask you know me for
ideological framework that we're
supposed to accept but if you did ask it
you might very well find that just as it
turns out after NAFTA that and you know
another great thing about NAFTA for
Mexico is the foreign investment shot up
which it did but a little footnote is
the total investment decline because
Mexican investment declined even faster
than foreign investment went up for the
simple reason that Mexican businesses
can compete with highly subsidized US
corporate the system yeah so it may go
back to the outsourcing story it's just
you know in an abstract world what he's
describing is true in the real world it
just does nothing to with what's going
on should we approve of it well you know
that's not the only question there are
other options for example another option
is to work to improve working conditions
Labor Standards environmental conditions
and so on in the places to which they
are obsessing okay that'll tend to
equalize the conditions is that a
utopian measure not at all it's been
used it there look at the European Union
before the European Union integrated
efforts substantial efforts were made
and substantial costs were assumed to
raise the level of the
our country's Portugal Spain and Greece
to raise Labor Standards raise wages
improve conditions enough then get to
the northern standards but enough so
that when they finally integrated there
wasn't a very severe blow against the
wages and living standards of northern
workers well that's because they have a
kind of social market economy in a more
or less functioning democratic system
and the same could have been done with
regard to NAFTA in fact it was proposed
by the US labor movement but never
entered the discussion and the same
because corporate media against it and
the elites are against it but and the
same could be true of the whole
outsourcing story so there are other
options it's not either let the command
economies maximize their own profit and
power or else you know you know the job
there are there other options pardon my
customers respect activities activities
here at MIT what is your own I can't
hear the room what is your opinion on
the Institute of Sergeant nanotechnology
here at MIT and it's on the Institute of
soulja nanotechnology added soldier
design competition which applies to
involve undergraduate students into
military related to research well I
don't know enough about it to say I mean
I would not want to comment on things I
don't know about I mean so what this
institute is doing I don't know I mean I
do know what was being done in the parts
of MIT that I'm familiar with starting
with the electronics lab in the 50s and
up to the your present not that one so
you have to ask what are they doing and
why and that requires knowledge of you
know the details of what's happening so
you probably know so why don't you
answer the question
you really have to know you can't just
you know have a opinion off the top of
your head and it probably is worth
looking into I'm in my guests just by
looking at the history of Technology and
MIT is they're probably working on some
under some pretext or other to develop
what could be the profitable science and
technology of the future which will be
handed over to private corporations at
least that's the tradition if this
breaks the tradition it will be
interesting thank you very much
professor I'm Vegeta Malik I'm MIT
alumni so it was a little awakening for
me that US economy works by keeping the
rich happy and the poor frightened but I
was just wondering that with capitalism
defined as the world order of today is
opposite ever possible like keeping the
poor happy and rich a little bit
frightened first of all you know what we
have today doesn't remotely resemble
what's supposed to be capitalism
capitalism is supposed to be what each
bhagwati was discussing in this abstract
model he had in mind in the op-ed this
morning and what you study in
neoclassical economics with free markets
and entrepreneurial initiative and
consumer choice what Greenspan's talking
about but we don't have anything
resembling that I should say that even
that one quote I gave about Allah gala I
can't say it alagappa lista competition
and strategic integration etc etc it
said that well that's what we have not
the invisible hand of the market well I
don't know how many of you have ever
read wealth of nations you know the
famous which is supposed to worship that
but the phrase invisible hand does
appear in wealth of nations exactly once
and it's an argument against against
what's now called globalization it's an
argument against free movement of
capital its Smith argues bad argument
that although it will be very harmful to
England we cared about it will be
stalked by an invisible hand because
merchants and manufacturers will have a
home buyer so prefer to invest at home
so don't worry about it even though it's
dangerous that's the one use of the term
and wealth of nations and you know so
what we have is nothing like capitalism
but can we have a city a system in which
the poor benefit and the rich don't have
to be made happy and why not I mean it's
not a law of nature that the susceptor
the economy hence most of the society in
the political system are in the hands of
high concentrations of capital which are
granted by the state they're granted by
state power enormous rights you know the
rights that are granted the corporations
are a incredible blow against classical
liberalism and classical economics I
mean you know Adam Smith would turn over
in his grave to see what's been granted
to these basically totalitarian systems
I'm they havin basically granted the
right not only if persons which is
outlandish about of pathological persons
they are required by law to be utterly
pathological and it's a legal
requirement deeply embedded in
anglo-american corporate law that the
managers of corporations must be brutal
they must be the kind of persons who we
would lock up if they were
flesh-and-blood they've got to their
only they are legally required to
maximize profit and market share and not
to do anything decent the only exception
and this is a long history of corporate
law is they're allowed to do something
decent if it's hypocritical so if a
pharmaceutical corporation wants to
improve its image you know by giving
free drugs to people in Africa or
something it's allowed to do it as long
as it's pure hypocrisy that is it's a
way to improve your image to increase
profit otherwise it's legally culpable
no you're much more likely to get thrown
in jail for that and
enron style corruption because that's
really the core of the system well you
know that's just it's not even
legislation these are just decisions by
courts which have become the core load
we have to accept that I Matt's wife
saying people had to accept Bolshevism
or fascism or other kinds of
totalitarianism course not my question
my question is about a recent left hook
article or interview that was just
published online and it seemed to me
like you came out sort of in favor of a
kind of anybody but bush policy strategy
for voting but i feel like and i asked
this question in the most comradely way
because you inspire me and whatever but
and I think we're in this to we're in
this together of course but I mean when
you're when you're talking you you kind
of homogenized the administration's and
you show that the continuity but in US
imperialism and you know in domestic
policy I mean you don't even quote the
hardliners right that's like almost you
you tend not to quote like the
hardliners you tend to public like the
hardline people like the really far
right people you know you vote the doves
and stuff like that who tend to be like
Democrats and and so forth and you've
mentioned that there has been
progressive change but that I mean
generally it's come from below like
movements in the 60s and so forth I
guess I don't feel like the Democrats
could possibly represent an alternative
to you know someone like bush and I
think that change should come from below
and we need like you know a third party
you know I'm saying like I I'm sorry I I
guess I just very even even in the here
and now you know like we need to be
working for an alternative and that
alternative is not the Democrats you
know I it's been completely agree i
think if you read that interview it says
the same thing but i mean the reason i
quote the doves like I quoted Clinton
today not Bush you know or not Wolfowitz
and so on is precisely to show that the
spectrum is quite narrow
in fact a few the spectrum is pretty
narrow but a spectrum is not zero you
know there is there there are
differences within it and even though
those differences are not enormous in a
massive system of power changes in
decisions within a narrow spectrum can
translate into huge effects for people
so in my opinion I'm these guys now in
office the people around Bush who are
basically the more reactionary elements
of the reagan-bush one administration
they are I think extremely dangerous
they've it told us with the programs are
and they're implementing them they want
to roll back the achievements of popular
struggle for the last century they want
to roll them back and try to remove them
irreversibly by institutional change and
they want to dominate the world by force
in a very frightening way well that's a
little that's so different from the
policies of the political opposition and
those differences I think matter does
that mean we shouldn't try and be trying
to work for alternate it's not at all I
mean to say look I'm going to make a
rotten choice in the short term doesn't
mean I shouldn't be working for better
choices and the longer term so crucially
important in the United States in my
opinion is not so much a third-party as
developing a democratic culture that is
a culture in which there really is the
possibility of participation in
decision-making that's important and it
and we ought to be working on creating
that whether it's called a party or
something else all the time irrespective
of what decision you make in you know
when November
whatever it is comes around so I don't
think there's any contradiction between
what you're suggesting what I was saying
and I believe in the interview it least
tried to make that cleaver there is a
choice to be made about which who's
going to have their hand on the massive
political power and I think those
choices some often I haven't thought so
but this time seems to me they do matter
thank you very much no this is a joke
professor John see thanks Adam to one
very quick question that had one more
real question the first one would be on
the incident that you mentioned in 95
the missile where there were two minutes
away if there's a source you know for
further information on that um it's
public information was January 1995 and
it's publicly that can I don't have it
all fan in my head that I can find a
source word not have your policy
institute they have a source yeah
nuclear policy institute I was just told
has it the document okay great thanks
and then the other one is on you know on
the social on the socialization of risk
and cost and cost exactly yeah um I
think a lot of us here who hear you talk
are then have the task of leaving and
trying to gently bring people around to
understand some of these issues so it
with that in mind I was hoping you could
sort of flesh out a little bit for me in
particular comes up with the biotech and
the pharmaceuticals maybe if you could
take the case of the AIDS drugs and how
you know there's this quote unquote
moral impetus to put it to get to lower
the cost for poorer countries maybe if
we could you could explain a little bit
how you know this funding really was
public yeah yeah well I mean there's
very little careful economic analysis of
this the only serious study I know of
the pharmaceutical industry and its
reliance on public funding is by a very
good economist named Dean Baker
it's been three or four years ago who he
did the obvious analysis which everybody
should have done all along and still
should be doing the pharmaceutical
corporations make huge profits and they
claim that they need the profits because
they innovate and you know that's how
you get drugs and so on and make the
rich happy something won't work for you
well he raised the obvious question he
said how much of the R&D for the
pharmaceutical companies is publicly
funded okay and suppose we just increase
that to one hundred percent and then
force him to go on the market with their
drugs okay like let's say we believe in
capitalism just for the fun of it so we
say well he did an analysis and it
turned out at the time he was writing
that roughly forty percent of the R&D
was public which is a very serious under
estimate as he points out because the
corporate part of ind is a lot of it is
just pure waste I'm it's copycat drugs
and other marketing things no and of
course this excludes all together the
basic biology which is all publicly
funded on which everything wrists but
even taking that under estimate let's
say it's forty percent he said okay
let's raise it to a hundred percent so
that eliminates the excuse that we have
to have huge profits and then let's make
them work on the market sell their drugs
at market prices and he estimated what
the likely benefits to consumers would
be that it's just astronomical I mean it
was something like you know 50 times the
total anticipated gains from the World
Trade Organization anticipated games
were mostly fake some huge consumer
benefit that's one of many indications
of how highly inefficient the corporate
system is now let's go on to what they
is much more than that I mean every day
as good economist Jeff Sachs has pointed
out every day every single day in Africa
thousands of children maybe five or six
thousand children die every day
from easily preventable diseases easily
preventable we could stop it with a
couple of cents you know pennies really
well you know that's a couple of 911s
every day just among children okay why
don't we do it well because of what's
called a 9010 rule in the pharmaceutical
and industry to health industries that
ninety percent of the research and
development goes for ten percent of the
so-called diseases you know some of them
aren't even diseases it's like having
too many wrinkles on your face or
something but the this huge amounts of
it some you know it is a quasi market
system which means the decisions of the
corporate executives who are by law
necessarily pathological that's required
it must be to produce things that will
sell on the market which means to rich
people those thousands of children are
dying every day in Africa don't have any
money so therefore you don't produce the
drugs that could save their lives what
you do is produce things that will
reduce wrinkles on for rich people
because that's where you make money and
that's a legal requirement its core of
anglo-american corporate law requires
them to do that well you know this is
just really pathological and in a same
system you would be producing
pharmaceuticals for people who need them
okay just like you'd be giving health
care to people who need it not people
can pay for it and and that could happen
if these were under public and under
public control in a democratic society
because I'm strongly suspect that if
this ever came to a vote
you know if people were told the facts
you'd probably have ninety-five percent
of the population agreeing with what it
just said but it's just not allowed to
enter public discussion so nobody knows
about it unless they really look into it
and do research projects but yeah that's
so that's and this generalizes over the
whole pharmaceutical industry and
similar things can be said about biotech
I'll try to keep the answers game yeah
I'll try to shut up this is what she's
telling up yeah politely to people who
are at the mics right now if you could
both just ask your questions what could
the other and I'll try to give a short
answer like okay oh no professor my
question you mentioned before about the
potential conflict in the future with
China and over the last few days reading
on various different newspaper sources
and other sources I found that the u.s.
is proposing an international
partnership to go into space which
includes every spacefaring nation in the
EU Russia and Japan but leaves China out
number two the US visa requirements have
been altered specifically against China
and for the u.s. is reciprocal nations
to focus against Chinese citizens to
make it much more difficult for them to
obtain visas and number three in weight
was number three okay anyway I can't
remember right now but there was a third
specific issue in which the US was
showing an extreme bias against China or
China's allies in particular and
mentioning with what you were before how
you're looking like this may be the
future way of which international
competition between these countries is
going to go what is your thought on this
do you think that this can be stopped
before we get into another what cold
world Texas what's the source on the
agreement about excluding China from the
International Space Dez I read in the
BBC in the New York Times you're on a
guardian and in the Chinese news you
could do me a favor and email it to me I
have you I'd like to see it because I
missed it but it makes sense i mean the
if you ask for example why is china
trying to carry out a moon shot i mean i
don't know what's in their heads but i
think a possible guess is that they are
challenging the US doctrine of ownership
of space you know they're saying no
we're not going to allow you to own
space a moon shot
you know undoubtedly is going to be part
of the militarization of space program
and they're saying well you know you're
not going to get a free ride the u.s. is
very much worried about Northeast Asia
for very good reasons northeast not just
China also Japan and South Korea and so
on Northeast Asia is the most rapidly
than its most dynamic economic area in
the world it's growing much faster than
anywhere else it's got a GDP will be on
that in the u.s. it has major industrial
economies Japan and South Korea China's
growing has plenty of resources in
eastern Siberia a lot of the jockeying
in the Middle East no but who's you know
which way the pipeline's go and so on
and so forth has to do with this has to
do with the u.s. trying to maintain
control over energy resources so that
the Northeast Asia doesn't have its own
independent resources and they have
plenty right in the region so that's a
major area of potential conflict and
China's right at the heart of it on the
other hand us is ambivalent towards
China because on the one hand it you
know strategically speaking it regards
it as a potential threat I'm going to
the other hand for Walmart and you know
Dale and so on China is just a gift I
mean has super cheap hopelessly
exploited labor under miserable
miserable conditions rotten human rights
laws and so on and so forth that is
perfect for investment or for getting
cheap goods through walmart and so on so
this kind of a split I mean what's
called the Chinese economy is very
largely foreign owned mostly by overseas
Chinese and on Taiwan Hong Kong and so
on but also by US corporations big ones
Microsoft so there's a kind of split and
hard to know which way to go I'm the
u.s. is trying to get China to open up
at a China has not followed the
neoliberal rules and like other
countries that haven't followed them it
has developed but there's a big effort
being
to compel it to do so which would mean
for example to compel it to open up its
financial institutions to us take over
that was the third one yeah us yeah they
want them to fill with the exchange rate
but more fundamental than that is to let
us banks take over the Chinese financial
system once you succeed in doing that
the country has lost its sovereignty
that's why they forced that on Iraq you
know they gotta allow the whole thing to
be taken over by us institutions and
it's not clear that China will agree to
that and that's a major source of
conflict like you're right last question
I'm afraid quick question on the UN Kofi
Annan and others are now urgently are
calling stating the need for urgent
reform of the UN in light of the
Security Council's recent behavior and I
wondered if you could deconstruct that
for us look there's a basic problem
about the UN based on their technical
other a lot of problems about too much
bureaucracy and corruption and asset and
the other thing but there's a
fundamental problem and that is the UN
can only act insofar as the great powers
allow it to and that means primarily the
United States so the UN can act if the
u.s. authorizes it and cannot act if the
u.s. blocks it that's why it is so
important that for the last about 40
years since the UN sort of fell out of
control the u.s. is far in the lead in
vetoes Britain is second and nobody else
is even in shouting distance that's
because the US Senate's British with
whatever you want to call it the partner
is the technical term the just will not
permit international institutions to
interfere with their plans and that's
the core problem at the UN everything
else is significant but peripheral but
that's a problem it has to be solved
here you know they can't
solid at the UN what do I mean what does
Kofi Annan mean by reform yeah I mean
probably right you know the UN is
extremely corrupt there's too much
bureaucracy they weights money you know
they're all kind of things wrong with it
so there's plenty of room for reform
just like there is in the city
administration in Boston I suppose but
all of those reforms are marginal as
compared with the crucial fact that the
UN cannot act except as authorized by
the United States and that's our problem
yours and mine we're the only ones who
can deal with that problem not Kofi Anan
I'm just to give you an illustration at
one simple illustration when the
remember when when the International
Tribunal for youth slavia was set up it
looked for about the 30 seconds as
though it was going to investigate NATO
war crimes in the bombing of Serbia was
very brief moment when they indicated
they might look at that where they they
were quickly called on the carpet by the
State Department and said you know none
of that business but more interestingly
there was a US congressman I forget who
visiting in Canada at the time and he
was interviewed by the right wing
national press the National Post and
asked the chief judge was Canadian time
what would happen if what would how
would you react in Congress if the
tribunal investigated NATO war crimes
they said simple will take the UN
buildings apart brick by brick and throw
them in the Atlantic Ocean well East
River I guess but yeah that's basically
it he had and as long as we permit that
relationship to exist the UN can't
reform
thanks to all of you for being here I
one final sort of tacky but important
announcement this building is going to
be used again at four o'clock and it
would be really helpful if you would
take your trash with you when you leave
thank you to professor Chomsky
you
