okay well I'm Robert realistic program
person University and there's my
pleasure to welcome you to this talk
later we shall see Noam Chomsky began
work on the generative grammar as a
senior at the University Pennsylvania
senior thesis and he 1914 on and has
continued since then with hard to
describe the output which most of us to
shame
well Bob asked me to say a few words
about where I think the field has gone
and roughly 60-plus years as you made
clear it's obviously a personal
perspective other people see it very
differently maybe rightly since he
mentioned 1949 and since I'm supposed to
start from the beginning if you don't
mind a personal anecdote one of the
things got me interested in the field
actually around 1946 was the realization
that the Bible is mistranslated
the Bible begins in the beginning God
created
that's mistranslation that's a
mistranslation based on a grammatical
error by the Masoretic scholars who put
the vowels in around the 8th century any
of you know Hebrew you can oughta be
able to figure out pretty quickly what
the error is
it's been mistranslated for a thousand
years and I figured at the time if the
first couple of words of the Bible can
be wrong in the authoritative text and
wrong in the translation and then we
noted it for a thousand years it's got
to be something interesting to learn in
fact the more you look the more you find
that everything is misunderstood and
when you think about a little more
that's not terribly surprising that's
the way the history of science has
worked so he'd take a look at say the
Galilean revolutions around 1600
afterwards what it was mainly a watch to
a large extent based on was the
discovery that everything everyone
believed was wrong about very simple
things so for millennia
there was an answer to a very simple
question if I this cup of boiling water
let's say and I let go of it
couple full and the steam will rise and
there was a classical answer to that
from Brazilian science they're seeking
their natural place and for thousands of
years that was considered a fine answer
except gallo and a couple of others
decided to be puzzled about it and as
soon as they were they saw at once it's
not an answer and as soon as you looked
a little further you found that all your
intuitions about falling bodies are
totally wrong and they're modern science
starts and my feeling is we've been in a
kind of pre Galilean stage and we've
just got to learn and by now everybody's
work from the field knows they don't
have to learn you just have to be
puzzled by the very simplest phenomena
in fact opener look at a corpus or open
a book and pick out the first sentence
and it's puzzling why should it be that
way not some other way and just about
everything you look at is just as in the
physical world and my own aha or
lameness was when I realized that the
word in the beginning were mistranslated
and a mistranslation that actually was
based on a grammatical error they went
back a thousand years and it's
transparent you know as soon as you look
at it if you know anything about Hebrew
grammar he's impossible
it's grammatically impossible that's
also clear what it was supposed to be
remember they put in vowels consonants
were there and they put the vowels in
wrong but so that's in the beginning
well things kind of began to get
crystallis other things to say about by
the early 50s the things were kind of
beginning to fall into place
there was an orthodoxy strict orthodoxy
I was at Harvard you know kind of main
intellectual center in these areas the
dual orthodoxy one was structural
linguistics and the other was
Oh psychology and the two meshed though
they didn't say so there were about
three people who didn't believe the
orthodoxy this grad student where things
usually come from I was one Mars Hallie
Walton friend and colleague was another
and the third was Eric Lynn over who
went on to found biology of language and
we talked to each other and started
reading things and doing various things
and gradually some ideas began to
crystallize which only became clearer
considerably later so this will be
anachronistic but that's the way things
usually are as you know yeah so I think
you understand something in 20 years
later you see you really did understand
it but you didn't know you understood it
so the some of these assumptions that
began to take shape seem to me as if
they ought to be truisms in fact they
are truisms but they're highly contested
in fact vigorously denied right to the
present so maybe it's worth mentioning
them one thing that should is and should
be regarded as a truism is that language
is spoken by people doesn't sound very
remarkable so it's something that
individuals do and they don't do it
because of something in their feet you
know they do it because it's something
good mostly in their brains so language
capacity must be a biological property
that's mostly in the some part of the
brain we know though some things about
where and how but she's got to be there
which means that the core problem of
language should be viewed from the point
of view what years later came to be
called bio linguistics the study of a
internal individual biological property
which manifests itself in action like
others
it's a motor organization or vision or
anything else it should be just normal
science study of some biological
capacity and I think that's true of all
cognitive capacities but that's another
story which I won't go into also highly
contested a second assumption which is
again should be obvious it gradually
became clear isn't actually an insight
that goes back to Descartes
she keeps the first two formulated with
any clarity and that is the ordinary use
of language and let me stress use is has
a kind of creative capacity normal
ordinary use of language so it's
constantly innovative its unbounded it's
appropriate to circumstances typically
but not caused by circumstances or he's
going to elicit it by them it's a
critical difference which wasn't
understood then and isn't understood now
and as actually the basis for most of
Cartesian science what's called
philosophy well it's kind of interesting
that you don't find this in the long
history of the subject in fact the only
person I've been able to find maybe some
scholars here can fill in details is
Galileo who had a kind of a weak version
of it but he was talking about the
alphabet which is a reflection of this
capacity not the capacity that one was
pointed out to me by Erwin Panov Skee
who you may know Greek scholar but if
there's anything else I haven't founded
I was perfectly obvious from a moment's
thought that that's what language use is
but not there if you get the modern
period virtually nothing in fact if you
which is an interesting question itself
how can these obvious things not only
not be seen but be vigorously and often
passion
Danai you know up to the present well
that's the second the actually about
fifty when I got interested in the
history started looking at it
considerably you know I did find some
later things which brought it up there
was afraid I find home bolts I've quoted
a number of times that has been very
seriously misunderstood maybe I my fault
but by now it's widely used language
involves infinite use of finite means
that's what he said exactly what he
meant if you read it but whatever it was
he was talking about in use okay he was
talking about infinite use of finite
means now we know nothing about the
infinite use I mean essentially just
that there we've learned a lot about the
means in fact most of the work in the
last 60 odd years is about the means
that enter into the infinite use which
leaves us a long distance away from the
classical and very intriguing problems
about what is it about human it may be
complete it may be totally human as
Descartes thought we don't know that
that's wrong but whatever it is it's an
elementary fact about humans manifests
itself in other ways kind of the core of
human nature we don't understand it
don't know how to study it but you can
get a in some areas and languages one of
them one of the very few you can learn a
lot about the means that are put to use
different question but an interesting
one well that's the conclusion from that
I think in retrospect should have been
obvious all thousand years ago certainly
should have been obvious in 1950 is that
you should study language from what's
later been called the bio linguistic
perspective and with a focus on what's
now called I
at least what I call language which is
just grant grammar and one of the
earlier uses of the term grammar
ambiguous terms so this was technical
proposal the ambiguity so some system
that's internal individual and thanks to
English spelling is viewed intentionally
with an S so you're interested in the
actual procedure not the kind of
irrelevant what the output of the
procedure is some ancillary phenomenon
that corpus or something like that it's
dated not what you're looking at so
that's a language earlier years grammar
the same concept nothing you do except a
term and so I like which means some kind
of generous procedure any system of
means that infinite unbounded has got to
have we now understand has to have some
generative procedure that recursive
procedure that characterizes it and
that's what you're interested in the
actual procedure not its output I fee
some years later this was discussed in a
kind of an interesting way but a
somewhat our THOG '''l which is also
another stood by dave maher window
pretty will I was actually using
grammatical models and he as you should
know develop the and approach the
cognitive science generally which
separated the computational level which
is kind like a characterization of the
problem the algorithmic level where you
have a procedure that deals with the
problem and if I can't what he called it
a material level where you look at how
it's all working out in the brain it's
it's the analogy was supposed to be
something like confidence and
performance but it's not quite the same
because he was studying and this is
quite important he was studying input
processes vision and for input processes
yes there's an algorithm so you can
study the problem say three-dimensional
vision you know how the object
recognition you can state with the
problem is computational level you can
look at the algorithm by which it's
carried out which is quite surprising
when you look at it as very odd
properties so nobody ever knew until
recently and you can look at the
mechanisms but for a competent system a
generative system like language there's
no algorithm and nothing is being done
you know it's just a characterization of
an infinite set finite characterization
of an infinite set but there's no
algorithm so you can't carry over the
more model for this actually this is
kind of similar to Jerry Fodor's work on
modularity which you may know he's his
modules are input systems but the kind
of modules that are studied in should be
studied in my view in cognitive science
theories are central systems different
Randy gallo cells work is like this
that's what I always meant by it
so is this and that's what Jerry says
can't exist can't be a modular sensible
central system but it has to there has
to be internal modules that do
particular things and they are not input
or output systems so you have to be
really careful about applying these
notions sounds similar but not quite
well it's I mean the sort of core
question you have to answer once you
adopt this kind of framework
I'm the L most elementary question is
what's a language it's again interesting
to see how this question is ignored in
the literature of a
thousand years it's instructive to take
a look I said take the modern period you
know so sir
Bloomfield Klein philosopher did most of
the work on it
the only proposals about what language
is make absolutely no sense at all as
soon as you look at them in fact coin
gives contradictory answers almost the
same page neither of which makes any
sense one of his answers is essentially
taken from Bloomfield who the finds of
the great it is both language language
is the totality of expressions that are
used in a piece in a speech community
that's completely meaningless I won't
talk about it think about it
one of coins proposals about the same
the other one contradicts it if you look
back at so sir there's essentially
nothing I mean it's a social contract of
some kind well okay but it doesn't say
anything about languages what language
has to be the core question is at least
a generative process at least that
another were denying language which is
just the generative process and then
come questions about what it is well
there plenty of other questions to ask
about language significant ones
acquisition use if you could possibly
study at which you can't in any serious
way neural representation history
diachronic linguistics evolution of
language which are incredibly confused
with historical linguistics and modern
work in a astonishing fashion sometime
of them
but those are all questions you can
investigate but for any of them you can
proceed only as far as you have some
characterization of what languages like
you can't study acquisition of language
unless you know what languages they
don't know everything of course you know
like you can study evolution of the eye
without knowing everything about the eye
but it's certainly not enough just to
know that eyes are used to watch
television I mean no biologist would
study the evolution of the eye on that
basis please take a look at the work on
what's called evolution of language it's
exactly what it is language is used for
communication sometimes and a million
other things
so therefore we'll study that and of
course get zero results as you would if
you studied evolution of the eye knowing
nothing except that's used to watch
television these oughta be elementary
observations that's kind of embarrassing
to talk about them except that they're
rampant in current work in the field and
we should ask why for a lot of you
that's the field you're getting into
well there's another truism or ought to
be and that is that there's some genetic
component in humans that makes it
possible for us to do what we're doing
but makes it impossible for you know
we're called our nearest relatives know
10 million years apart
say chimpanzees they have about the same
auditory system that humans have that's
been recently discovered in fact they
even pick out the same phonetic features
that are used in distinctive features
and language however if you say have a
chimpanzee and you're you know baby
sister or maybe if you're old enough
whose are stuck from birth in front of a
massive noise the infant human infant
immediately picks out of the norm
is something that's language relevant
which is kind of miraculous nobody knows
how that's done but they do it instantly
reflexively some of what we now know is
even prenatally on the other hand for
another animal with the same laudatory
systems there's noise and it's that goes
the other way to other organisms will
pick out relevant material from the
noise general noise environmental noise
and humans won't see anything unless
they kind of study from the outside of
scientists well from that alone that
follows this gotta be a genetic
component and if you go on to the next
step you know a couple months later it
just becomes more obvious they're doing
very specific things that consistently
no very uniform ways of course it's
driven by data but so does everything on
the other hand it's going on a path
which is not determined by data you can
see that from the elementary fact that
no other organism doesn't plus that
there's no way of doing it from just
from data if you look at it and and they
get to the capacity that we're using
very early in fact the better
experimental work gets the younger and
younger the apart the capacity is noted
in fact there's even some work which is
suggestive some of you guys know about
it that by around two years old the
child probably knows the whole language
can't manifest it but that's pretty good
evidence that can be elicited that's the
most interesting cases are the Helen
Keller type case she was 20 months old
when she lost language capacity the use
of lease but she recovered it on the
basis of almost no data you know just
touch in fact she learned her she
invented the technique that's now used
to teach a diff line but it's called the
dome over you sort of put your hand on
someone's face you get in
from the vocal cord from the chief on
the basis of that she got fantastic
linguistic capacity which is almost
impossible unless you knew everything
adding to this is something about which
there aren't enough cases to draw a
confident conclusion but they seem
systematic if the loss was before about
18 months there's never been a case of
recovery so it looks as if there's
something going on right around then
which is basically giving like the
language you know then you've sort of
had details or you can refine it or
something like that well whatever this
is and it seems to be independent of
other cognitive capacities it's quite
good evidence now for radical
dissociations with other capacities well
these are kind of some of these you know
even if this detail isn't right you know
the general picture is and it seems it's
the more and more evidence that it just
has to be an internally directed process
from the most obvious much more complex
arguments than what I've given so
there's got to be a genetic component
there's a technical name for the
generative component it's called ug okay
universal grammar that's taking over a
traditional phrase for a new context the
existence of ug is hotly denied hot lead
to die overwhelmingly huge literature
seems ridiculous so what the literature
is saying everything's a miracle it's
exactly what it's name because there's
no alternative there's no coherent
alternative now there are proposals so
there are proposals about shared and
pension ality you know culture these are
interesting proposals I mean they give
hand-waving a bad name actually if you
look at them there's just nothing there
and there can't possibly be anything
there if only because of dissociated
associations or because of timing like a
two-year-old and knowing about the
culture you know unshared intention
like what distich is don't have it they
speak fine
and it goes I don't know and furthermore
there's nothing that comes out of the
euro you know but it's very widely held
you can read about it from you know
technical articles in the cognitive
science journals to Times Literary
Supplement and all across the board
except that it's totally vacuous and
can't make any sense just we have to
think about it you see it can't make any
sense well there are more specific
proposals which are of some interest
because you can investigate them at
least
so one proposal it's just monstrous
memory like you memorize everything well
again it's infinite so you're not gonna
be able to memorize everything
furthermore even if you take normal
usage which actually was studied by
george miller who was here late george
miller 60 years ago he looked at the
sentences of 8th grade reading level
Reader's Digest and calculated how much
you have to memorize if you could
understand those sins it turns out more
than the number of particles in the
universe no if you reduce it by
replacing the words by categories which
is not a trivial matter it's basically
the same the numbers are so big doesn't
make any difference if you put in
phrases which is often done you've given
the game away because the phrases has to
be recursively generated so you're done
you know well that's the memorization
story there are interesting there's an
industry of statistical models which are
quite interesting to look at there's a
kind of hysteria about the importance of
Statistics and you know sophisticated
Bayesian etc is a couple of phrases you
have to use when you write about this
and it's not zero oh and if you look
back say to the beginning early 50s
there was a an argument yeah I wrote
about it back in the mid fifties that
you should be able to detect words from
phrases from continued not fraser from
continued texts to isolate them just by
looking at transition probabilities
that's mentioned in logical structure of
linguistic theory actually meant as a
footnote because it looked obvious
doesn't see me any other evidence well
if that were true you get to do
something with mystical models whether
this has anything to do with language
acquisition there's a totally different
story I mean kids don't learn words by
picking them out of continuous discourse
you know they know a lot before they're
looking at the discourse anyhow no point
pursuing it turns out to be wrong
Charles showed that years ago you can
get something but only if you add ug
principles and their subsequent work by
Humbert others we chose you got to know
quite a lot even to do this that's one
of the very few examples there's another
interesting one interesting ones in
Charles's work again one thing that he
showed is there's been a lot of study in
recent years of connectionist work and
others I'm trying to account for the
learning of irregular verbs that's kind
of a peripheral problem it was never
studying very much but it recently it
has been none of it works except for
Charles as a proposal which gives a very
interesting answer to the question of
how irregular verbs are learned by
intermingling probabilistic arguments
with UG principles and as far as I know
everything in this field you couldn't
correct me if I'm wrong if it gets
anywhere works that way or else it deals
with different problems like processing
or communication and so on
everyone always agrees your statistical
models are significant there but again
you can read very the planet literature
a lot of it very triumphalist and the
technical journals listing all kind of
great results that have been achieved
everyone you look at when you look at it
and take it apart it achieved up to
nothing except a total irremediable
failure but it just goes on and on this
is a kind of unstoppable and so taking
over a lot of cognitive science
well actually the only again they only
work that I know of
engineers wrong is kind of around the
margins as far as the nature of the
system is concerned it's the only
question we're asking and and it's
acquisition and maybe it's used and
involves an intermingling of ug
principles with probabilistic arguments
Charles's book is about how these
interact so I think the conclusion is
about the same after it should be the
same adopt the bio linguistic
perspective study the core topic is I
language generous procedure and you got
to try to figure out what ug is what is
the genetic basis and so there's a lot
of literature of pointing out sort of
the saint's gosh after 50 years these
guys have been studying the ug and they
still don't know what it is it must be
something wrong try studying the genetic
basis for having blue eyes you know let
alone any complex trait
I mean it's known to what be look at the
favored advanced text and biology
evolutionary biology they point out the
quote it's fiendishly difficult to find
the genetic basis for almost anything
and it's not that anyone denies that it
exists but organisms are complex
creatures you know to try to pull out
the properties that are genetic and
separate them from lots of interacting
fact
is no small trick even when you have a
hundreds of millions of dollars from the
NSF for experimentation and so on and so
forth
and to do it for a trait as complex as
language a cognitive trait that is
beyond fiendishly difficult so if there
are any results at all and I think there
are it's amazing it's an amazing
achievement and the fact that you
haven't answered the question is about
on the par with a common complaint that
after all these years no one's written a
complete grammar of any language I mean
it's not even worth talking about you
don't even know exactly what you're
supposed to describe so what's in it and
what isn't in it and so on and so forth
these are impossible goals and never
approached in the Sun never formulated
in the sciences because they're so crazy
but it's somehow applied to this one
field which is supposed to be different
from anything in the sciences
well the idea that you can have infinite
output from a finite mechanism that does
go back to classical antiquity so
Euclidean geometry says Moore's laws
like that but it's worth remembering
that Euclidean geometry wasn't
formalized until about a century ago it
was largely intuitive and in fact the
general concepts missed by Hilbert the
general concepts of what it means for a
finite object to have an infinite yield
that wasn't really clarified till the
1930s and 40s but now it's understood
and by now everybody knows that you all
go a laptop computer it's a
stored-program computer the storage
program if it's the right program
generates an infinite output of course
it can only go up to a certain point
unless you add memory but and that's
often confused in the literature when
you add map say arithmetic you can have
a program for multiplication and it'll
stop up to some big number
but the point is if you add memory it'll
go on without changing the program
that's the crucial part the fact that
and the brain has got to be the same
than language has got to be the same
this crucial fact going on without
changing the program again is greatly
misunderstood in the even the technical
literature of computational cognitive
science that's why most of the
connectionist molds no make any sense if
you add the next step you've got to
change the whole program you know so
it's doing nothing you know it's just
showing that some finite output can be
handled with what amounts to a list yes
sure but no interest well these are
things that ought to be understood one I
mentioned that I language should be
studied in the context of generative
processes recursive processes it's part
of recursive function theory Turing
machine theory very narrow part of it
the the concept of recursion is
hopelessly misunderstood and the
technical linguistic literature for one
thing there's a debate about even
whether it has to be infinite not but
not the infinite you can ever accurse
the function with no output at all in
fact there's some of the most
interesting ones but it doesn't have to
be infinite so in fact in the case of
human language apparently it's always an
infinite recursion is constantly
confused with embedding or even self
embedding which are special cases but
only special cases and the
okay we can go on if you don't mind
being blind there actually I just came
back from Gaza where this happens every
hour okay the jet the generator okay
[Music]
there is another thing that's if you
look at it actual language output it
seems to her strange caps in it actually
is a classic study of this which is very
important that it isn't rid enough
ritual cane not an article by you when
your callings
can hail about 35 years ago on cultural
gaps it's very much worth reading
particularly because of a lot of
complete nonsense that's flooding the
field now about languages that allegedly
don't have this or that in fact every
case that's mentioned in the recent
literature is discussed by can much more
seriously because serious linguist and
gives good arguments showing how these
apparent gaps are simply restrict this
narrow restrictions on ug principles
that the people all know then use plenty
of evidence from the Australian
languages of the languages so that one's
quite worthy also some very interesting
comments about the universal nature of
relative clauses and then embedded
relative clauses which are quite
interesting worth thinking about anyhow
that's these are things that will be
known - so whatever in I language is
it's something that gives an finite
object give us in the brain gives an
infinite array of hierarchically
structured expressions each of which
gets an interpretation at at least maybe
at least maybe the most to other
cognitive systems that one it can be
somehow so it doesn't have to be in fact
most of our language isn't externalized
but it can be externalized at the
sensorimotor system we now know that
that's modality independent pretty much
usually speech but could be sign or
touch or something else it seems to be
independent of modality it also appears
to vary a lot and probably does it vary
a lot which is an interesting fact one
of the many things that indicates I
think that the externalization to the
sensory motor system is probably some
ancillary secondary fact about language
kind of tacked on to it Knott central
more central appears to be the fact that
it's it interacts with what are roughly
called thought systems technical term is
conceptual intentional systems
intangibility not that the technical
term adds anything particularly fancy so
it's got to be an externalization at
that system whatever it is and they're
very fundamental questions about which
part of that mapping of the internal
computation is part of the external
system and which is part of the internal
system and that goes right to the heart
of a lot of questions like say an afro
where is it yeah and we usually assume
it's internal to eye language but that's
only because we have some ideas that I
deal with and so you can kind of you
know a lot of interesting work on how it
works but you know it's got to be plenty
of computation and that outer system too
so who knows where the boundary is and
get here at the quite interesting
questions about thought in language
which I won't talk about those are
important topics it's often argued that
if the the Akane computational system
that has roughly these properties is
going to have embedded in it somewhere
an operation that takes things that have
already been generated and makes a
bigger thing
it may not be put that way like it may
be a friggin ancestor or it could be as
just of axioms or whatever but somewhere
embedded in it is that operation there's
no way to get around that and notice
that that's operations a lot of people
mean and others call merge so there's
got to be some operation merge that has
that property will merge automatically
gives hierarchic structures
automatically it's putting things
together so you get a structure yeah add
something else get a bigger structure so
it is Purdue it has the right properties
it's producing hierarchic infinite
number of hierarchic structures which
then have to get interpreted by
processes that are there's a lot of
study of them at the towards the
sensorimotor saw and some towards the
conceptual intentional so I've got a lot
of it has the problem that I mentioned
which isn't investigative where is it is
it inside the I language or outside the
I language not easy to answer because we
have no we have independent evidence
about the sensorimotor system like you
can hear it but almost nothing about the
other systems you're kind of wandering
around a confused field there with quite
interesting questions I won't go into
them the it's often argued that there
are simpler things the merge the usual
proposal is concatenation concatenation
is a more complex notion it presupposes
birds and furthermore it presupposes
ordering it looks as if it's not
hierarchical but that's only because has
an extra operation associativity which
knocks out the hierarchy so it's more
complex there is a version or word
Hornstein's which
I've Strax away from ordering but still
has has to have the structure the
operation and strikes out structured a
lot of the study of formal linguistics
about all of it in fact deals with weak
generative capacity now the weak
generous capacities a of first director
grammars that's considered to be simpler
than the study of I language it's much
more complex because weak generous
capacities a derivative notion you have
to derive it from the I language by
knocking out the structure you take a
look at a phrase structure grammar
doesn't give you it doesn't weakly
generate it strongly generates
structures you can wipe out the
structure and look at what's left which
is already problematic because it's more
complex and it's doubly problematic
because you don't know what's supposed
to be isn't every linguist notice that
if you open a technical article and say
linguistic inquiry then I get
expressions with stars and question
marks and star question mark and all
sorts of other things and these are very
interesting a lot of the most important
work has to do with these distinctions
so why is there a distinction between
say sub jason c and e CP violations
that's interesting but it's all at the
level of technically what wouldn't be
generated by it weak generous capacity
and this is not a new observation it's
discussed at length in the nineteen
fifties of chapters logical structure of
linguistic theory devoted to it the
answer the question but talks about some
of the problems so the study of weak
generosity is first of all derivative
more complex
based on arbitrary stipulations it's not
clear that has anything to do with
language I mean you know I worked on it
I thought it was fun but it's a small
branch of formal method of
formal logic or mathematics some vague
relations to language but not much it's
worth thinking through as well the
goings back to what I still haven't
started and what happened for the last
60 years but the early proposals back in
the 50s I'm an assumed is realized that
everything you look at is completely
problematic from the first phrase of the
Bible to the next sentence you look at
the proposals started coming along as to
how to deal with it well the early
proposals actually and the fifties were
extremely complex I won't review them
but if you look at the same my proposals
others they send a lot of complex
mechanisms which seem necessary there is
to be any other way just to describe the
data in different languages and I think
the history of the field at least that
the theoretical level since then has
been an effort to try to simplify it to
remove the stipulations the complexity
the mechanisms and see if you can get
the principles from which a lot of these
things follow there should be nothing
problematic about this that's what's
called science science is the search for
simple mechanisms that account for
complex phenomena anything else is you
know flower collecting so which is fine
and I think along with that but it's not
science so there's nothing problematic
about it I won't run through the steps
which you're all familiar mostly or at
least they're familiar with that's been
a kind of steady progress in that in
recent years work in this direction has
been given another name which was a
mistake I think my mistake it's been
called the minimalist program and that
lid anything you say about language
there's one thing you can be certain of
it's not realistic and norm
confusion and misunderstanding that's a
kind of a theorem you don't know what
for Lots room but it's a fact you know
and the minimalist Bergeron totally
misunderstood it's constantly described
as a theory and then there's arguments
that the theory is falsified by this
it's not a theory it's just science it's
trying to find the best explanation for
complex phenomena
eliminating stipulations where you can
eliminate in complex mechanisms showing
how they can be derived by deeper
principles and in fact just deepening
explanation
that's what enquiries about you know the
minimalist program is that just a
seamless continuation of efforts that
went on from the first notice that we
don't understand anything well it did
the program did suggest suggest some new
research programs which you know the
research programs writer is it's not
true or false no either it's useful or
it isn't useful I think this one has
been useful the research program that it
suggests is to start by assuming that
the language is essentially perfect that
it precisely in the most optimal fashion
satisfies the interface conditions
there's a few who of course it of mine
since about 1980 we'll remember that
every course started by saying ok let's
assume this and then started looking at
the facts and everything fell apart so
you get anywhere but the around the 90s
the program started to make more sense
and my guess is it's going to turn out
to be the right program it's hard to
show but I think that's kind of a
long-run goal that people might keep in
mind and I think there's reasons
but that what that means is try to
formulate what's sometimes called a
strong minimalist thesis not these
strong minimalist thesis we don't know
enough to do that but one that looks
plausible the one that says here would
be a perfect solution to the external
conditions on I language a couple of
ideas about what that should be
and then arrays two kinds of questions
one of the kinds of questions is
descriptive when you apply when you take
a look at the data of wide variety of
languages from this starting point you
find a lot that doesn't work so the
first most automatically so the first
descriptive problem is see if you can
show that what doesn't seem to work is
based on miss analysis of the data or
miss formulation of the principles and
if you can do that okay you've advanced
the program and I think there's been a
lot of work going in that direction that
we're near the end but quite a lot the
other question you can ask is kind of
more abstract and that is assuming that
something like your strong Millis thesis
is correct what does that tell you about
the nature of language the architecture
of language or maybe as cognition
generally and actually I think it tells
it quite a lot which more than generally
appreciated oh the well as I said every
let's just proceed some that this is the
right way to approach the I mentioned
that any strong minimalist thesis in
fact any approach to language is going
to have to assume emerge like operation
so the question is what it is well of
course if you just proceeding in the
normal manner of science that is
following the minimalist program
so what is at least you'll start by
assuming that the operations as simple
as possible okay it goes wrong you've
complicated as simple as possible means
that when you merge say two things x and
y and neither of them will change so
you're minimizing I'm the overriding
principle that one ought to try to keep
- is a sort of minimal computation try
to show that the system is has as bad as
it was at least the least messy it has
to be so minimal computation I don't
think that's a Eugene principle I think
it's I sometimes call the third factor
principle it's an overriding principle
that works for the sciences altogether
mr. maybe it's a law of nature or
something or a law of human cognition
whatever you think it is but it it
determines what counts as rational
inquiry so look for minimal
communication computation that means
you're not going to that the merge merge
XY is not going to change either X or Y
that's called the no tampering condition
but it's just minimal computation which
it has interesting consequences very
interesting consequences the other
condition at automate is that its
unordered that's simpler than being
ordered so the least computation will
take X and y and not change them and
leave them on ordered which means it
just forms the set X Y that's what it
amounts to that would be the perfect
answer here we get into a real morass
because where does ordering come from
and it's all over the place and
complicated issues related to it well
one thing that shouldn't strike you
right away is that ordering is required
and other arrangements in fact are
required at the sensorimotor system like
we can't talk on ordered set you know
hierarchically structured on order sets
something's going on at least in the
externalization that's imposing order
and in fact other arrangements like in
sign was more than order and even speech
not prosody and so on but at least order
so maybe it's a reflex of linearization
of the externalization one possibility
if that's true it shouldn't just by the
general architecture of the system it
shouldn't enter into narrow syntax and
semantic interpretation
you know the mapping to the CIA
interface and I think there's a fair
amount of evidence that that may be true
of these interpretations typically seem
to involve hierarchy not order they work
the same with different orders and that
suggests that collection of observation
suggests that maybe ordering is just
that an artifact non-linguistic artifact
connected with the fact that the system
has to get the sensorimotor system well
if you take a look at the evolutionary
for as I mentioned the study of
evolution of language is such a member
ass that I didn't want to get into it
it's I have never seen so much confusion
on any topic literally actually begins
from the name of the topic one of the
problems with the study of this a huge
library growing library on evolution of
language and one pretty obvious problem
with it is the topic doesn't exist
languages don't evolve evolution is
something that happens to organisms the
languages don't have genes you know they
don't evolve languages change but that's
not evolution and if you look at the
literature it's actually studying change
that's not in setting change of language
it's studying change of communication
practices and it's not even studying
that because so hogwash
it's just concocting stories you know
maybe it happened this way maybe
that way well there is a field of
historical linguistics serious field but
you can't get away with it in that field
by saying maybe this happened or maybe
that happened you know and but that's
almost the whole field of what's called
evolution of language however there are
a few things to say about it
very few I actually know of only two two
things that can be said about one is
that there's been it's a it's of course
evolution of the language capacity it's
an evolution of humans language users
and one thing we can be quite confident
about is that nothing has happened for
at least fifty thousand years whatever
the date is from when humans began
leaving Africa small number of humans
started cursing out of East Africa
roughly 50 maybe 75 thousand years ago
something is archaeological evidence
about this and since that time nothing's
happened and you can be pretty sure that
just from the fact that infants today
are equally capable of acquiring any
language without any difficulty so
they've all got the same language
capacity I mean there's there are
individual differences but I don't think
there any group differences no no not
everything's been studied of course but
the evidence on this is pretty
overwhelming
so there's strong evidence that either
nothing or nothing of any significance
has happened for maybe fifty seventy
five thousand years the second piece of
evidence which is less certain but
reasonable at least is it if you go back
another say fifty or seventy-five
thousand years there's no evidence
archaeological calling for logical
evidence there was anything like
language okay you don't get the
artifacts complex symbolic
representations it all seems to come
along pretty suddenly sometimes well the
Great Leap Forward by
paleoanthropologists roughly in that
window well that's an extremely narrow
window from
Ellucian arey point of view it's a flick
of the eye so what appears to have
happened is that something changed
suddenly which yielded this capacity and
notice that there were no selectional
effects at that time the things that
change are happened to an individual
like a group doesn't undergo rewiring
the brain or genetic alteration or
something an individual does and that
individual is under no selectional
pressures zero I mean the capacity could
proliferate through a small breeding
group which is what our ancestors were
and maybe after a while you know a lot
of people have it and at that point it
would make some sense to figure out a
way to make it public it's all going on
in the head
that's externalization externalization
is a tough problem
it's a tough cognitive problem you have
to match whatever is in the brain which
got there somehow probably like you know
some small rewiring you've got to match
that with a sensory motor system which
had been around for hundreds of
thousands of years I went for that
there's good fossil evidence so there's
a sensor and maybe as far back as
chimpanzees
no.12 many years ago about 6 million
years ago but the you've got to match
these two different systems which have
nothing to do with each other and that's
a pretty complex process which can be
done in a lot of different ways a lot of
ways of mapping something that sort of
satisfies the strong minimalist thesis
to a system that has definitely nothing
to do with it and in fact it we just
know you know the overwhelming
complexity of what we observe in
language overwhelmingly the complexities
in the externalization of course you
know maybe we just don't know other
things about what's internal but the
vast complexity looks like it's in the
externalization also diversity I mean
that's where languages seem very diverse
on the surface but the more you look you
find them
less diverse at the computational level
the I language level which makes it and
they're also very easily subject to
change at the externalization level and
it is happening every generation you
know teenage jargons or norman invasion
changes the externalization of massively
and it's the whole history of language
not evolution but change so it looks as
though just from data like these that
the externalization problem aspect of
language is some ancillary phenomenon
it's kind of tacked on after something
developed which had no selectional
pressures so therefore it would have
been optimal it would have been
something like a snowflake yeah it just
happens by laws of nature well that's
the strong minimalist thesis that there
ought to be a snowflake in there which
is mapped on to the sensory motor system
by a lot of different complex ways which
can be rediscovered and changed and be
modified and so on but it may not even
be part of I languish in that kind of a
narrow sense maybe it is maybe it isn't
there's questions about it but anyhow
it's kind of ancillary not much more
interestingly there's a linguistic
internal linguistic evidence that leads
to the same conclusion and that's much
more interesting because these are all
speculations based on the two or three
facts we know about language evolution
the internal evidence is much more
significant and that comes right away as
soon as you look at the most elementary
combinatorial operation merge so go back
to merge it's kind of no hypothesis is
it doesn't change the things that are
merged and it doesn't impose order okay
just take the first of those doesn't
change the things that's merge well just
by the logic of the situation nothing
else if you look at merge of XY it has
two possibilities
exactly two
that one of them's called external merge
the others called internal merge and by
just logic not in the debate those two
are available and they have a definite
output external merge is essentially
what puts things together and leaves
them as a unit so you take whatever
underlies you know the man and whatever
underlies is tall and put them together
you get something that underlies the man
is tall okay external and internal merge
which is the only other possibility
takes some unit let's say you know read
the book and take something that's
inside that unit and merges it to it so
the book read the book or what the man
saw was you know okay
that's internal merge now notice that
that has two properties for one thing it
yields the displacement displacement so
ubiquitous property of language you see
it all over the place the other is it
yields the copy theory they both remain
okay that's the null hypothesis there's
a lot of confused literature about the
copy theory assuming it involves other
operations you know copy murders and so
on no nothing it's just the most
elementary case of merge if it doesn't
occur in some language you got to
explain why so you need some stipulation
to block it okay because it's just free
now that's important for a number of
reasons for one thing in physics you
know the lyritrol know about this those
are you work on it that the copy theory
has extremely important consequences at
the CI level not acceptable intentional
level it yields most of the basic
reconstruction effects automatically now
that's quite significant these are very
complex somatic effects
about them they're very complex somatic
judgments and it's extremely mysterious
where they come from a child has no
evidence for them zero but everyone
knows them and they know them in a very
specific way so it's gotta follow that
they just come from some elementary
mechanisms is there any how and yields
these results
no it doesn't yield all of them and that
suggests a research topic show that it
yields all of them because it ought to
and if it seems that it's not yielding
all there's something we don't
understand about reconstruction
processes and you should important topic
of inquiry is fill in the gap I'll show
that in fact if we understood everything
yeah it would you all was enough to make
that plausible and it's conceptually
natural because it ought to you know the
second fact fact about it sorry
the second important fact about it is
that it yields it produces the major
complications in parsing communication
those of you who've worked on parsing
programs are aware that the toughest
problem is what are called filler gap
problems okay so you hear our sentence
with a wh phrase at the beginning you
got to figure out where it comes from
well why does that happen well let's go
back to the principle of minimal
computation as least computation as
possible what that's going to do is give
you the copy theory internally that's
going to wipe out all copies except at
least one because every one that they
have to have at least one or you know
anything's happened but it has to wipe
out all the others because that each
other copy and there can be many copies
you know it's not as simple as what did
John see you look at more complicated
sentences copies all over the place yeah
it has to one of those copies is
complicated to compute and to articulate
and they can be of arbitrary complexity
remember each of these phrases can be of
arbitrary complexity so if you
pronounced all the copies it would
overcome almost all of the filler gap
problems but it's a lot of expensive
computation so what you have is a
conflict between computational
efficiency and communicative efficiency
it's one of many such conflicts and in
every case I know correct me if I'm
wrong computational efficiency wins
hands down
there's never even any competition
everything works by computational
efficiency doesn't give a damn what the
effects are for communicative efficiency
and that shows up all over the place I
mean take just ambiguous structurally
ambiguous sentences you know flying
flames can be dangerous they come about
if the rules just apply with nobody
fiddling with them but they cause
communicative problems or what are they
called garden path sentences another
example probably islands
I mean islands are basically things that
you can think that you can't say you
know you have to find some paraphrase
and to the extent it's an interesting
topic trying to understand them but to
the extent that they're understood which
is limited they seem to follow by making
optimal rules and there's another gap
try to show that it's always the case
it's always the cases it should be then
there'll be another case at that point
well another example which is
interesting because of its history and
its consequences and because it's been
very intensively studied is a structure
dependent that was noticed as a puzzle
back in the 50s it was never regarded as
a puzzle in the preceding several
thousand years of intensive language
study but if you take a sentence like
instinctively eagles that fly swim very
simple sentence instinctively goes with
swim it doesn't go with fly okay no one
ever makes a mistake about that the
children never make mistakes about it
there's no a lot of the discussion of
this has been confused by the fact that
the examples that are looked at
involvement displacement it Sorella and
so people have all kind of complicated
theories about displacement but it
doesn't matter you have exactly the same
phenomena with no displacement and it's
furthermore every construction that's
the fact of it is that there's a simple
computation linear computation as simple
as possible which would get
instinctively to link up with fly
instinctively equals the fly swims the
closest just count
okay so it's the closest you easiest
computation you can get never used the
the actual computation is much more
complex it involves structure it
involves minimal structural distance
which are much harder computation then
it's done in these constructions I think
it's done in every construction in every
language that has any of these
properties there's got to be some reason
for it and a very simple reason would be
that there's no linear order that at the
point where all this stuff is being
computed internally there's no linear
order so therefore you have to use the
next most complicated minimal distance
measure structural distance now that
would yield a whole massive results and
all kind of languages and no exception
none but of course it requires assuming
that the merge operation is unordered
that is that we have something like a
strong minimalist thesis now this one is
kind of interesting because just modern
history there's a small industry in
computational cognitive sciences even
gotten into the linguistic literature
whole issues of linguistic journals
devoted to pointless proposals about
this is you guys know trying to show
that you can get it somehow some other
way you know statistical analysis a
couple of examples in The Wall Street
Journal I mean they're all kind of crazy
proposals are given they are interesting
because they can be investigated they're
clear enough to be investigated so you
can easily demonstrate that everyone is
not only a failure but an remediable
failure no way to get out of it you know
and yet they keep coming because it's
just not permitted that there be a
linguistic principle of ug in fact that
would account for a huge complex massive
phenomena the kind of interesting
pathology in the field
try to explain it with a very
interesting principle simple one its
rooted and as a conceptually natural
base and it does suggest that order is
just the reflex of the sensory motor
system
well prima facie that doesn't look
possible it conflicts with a lot of
important linguistic work prima facie so
what we want to ask is does it really
conflict I think the most striking
conflict the conflict perhaps is with
the work on what's called cartography no
Cinque Ricci others so say take a Cinque
so when he calls Universal base
hypothesis no move tense verb object
that kind of thing and plus a lot of
refinement
you know extensive refinement of these
categories with dozens of postulated
functional categories in his system
which are ordered in a particular way
well this seems to inflict Lou because
that all enters into semantic
interpretation however these studies
which are extremely interesting and the
empirical work is very impressive I
think but it just can't be right you
know that there's no way in which it
anyone could possibly learn that
functional structure was inconceivable
there's no evidence for it you know and
so it could develop through an
evolutionary process it's pretty hard to
imagine how I mean why should evolution
ever give this crazy thing why not
reordering them somehow so the natural
assumption and I think Jane Clayton kind
of agrees with this we talked about it a
lot is that luigi Ricci also that there
ought to be some semantics or pragmatic
reasons why they come out this way and
not some other way
and there's some work couple of
dissertations some other work trying to
work it out well is a good reason to
expect that that's where it's going to
go if we learn enough so another gap to
look at but if it does then this work
well you know I'm not questioning its
significance it's very significant that
probably won't have to do with language
I language if you can reduce some
observed phenomenon to a pragmatic
consideration let's say like it wouldn't
be useful to do it the other way it's
this an extraneous source you know
outside the I language system and of
course there's plenty of interaction of
all kinds of things so I think that's a
direction to look important direction to
look anyhow what all of this seems to me
to suggest is that we abandon a
contemporary dogma and I stress
contemporary very modern dogma that the
core of language is communication now
that's the last 50 years if you go back
before that the traditional view was
that language is an expression of
thought and that goes all the way back
now you get it in linguists like William
Dwight Whitney the card Galileo
hours though everybody language is
supposed to be an expression of thought
today it is literally a dogma that it
has to be based on communication like in
the philosophical literature there are
articles by good people was saying it
can't you can't understand how I can
even question this since it's kind of
it's like that nose on your face it's
got to be true
well this strong evidence that isn't
true of the kind that I mentioned but
that doesn't matter it's got to be true
of why well interesting question but my
my suspicion is that it's
consequence of the behavioral science
dogmas of 50 years ago which cover the
whole field you know
the whole range of fields linguistics
psychology philosophy and so on had to
believe in them and if you believe that
then it's natural to think that the
communication would somehow be the core
of language
I suspect it's also based on total
misunderstanding of evolutionary biology
which is very common among the people of
talk about it not not evolutionary
biologists but anyone who alludes to it
that's the belief that there is a phrase
in Darwin it's there which crucially
there are you know right in front which
says evolution has to be the result of
small changes you know welcome ulation
of a lot of small changes that gives you
different organisms his book of course
is called Origin of Species
but if notice there's nothing about
species in it because there's even today
it's extremely unclear how species
develop but the evidence right now it's
quite well known that no one's
questioning Darwin's insights yeah of
course natural selection is significant
but it's very well known that that's
just not true there's case after case of
dramatic change probably involving
species appearance which is sudden from
an evolutionary point of view so for
example classic example is just not
certain but it's widely assumed by
evolutionary biologists as the change
from invertebrates to primitive
vertebrates chordates seems to have come
from a tiny change which all of a sudden
changed the whole body plan and
everything else and there's plenty of
other cases so there's no reason to
believe it no it's not an accord with
evolutionary biology it's a doctrine you
learn it and eighth grade and so on but
you know put it out of your head if you
believe it then it makes sense to trace
language back to
in occasion because you get
communication you know a back to
bacteria so every organism has some way
of communicating interacting with the
environment or each other and you can
make up a story which is or a thousand
stories they're all as each is as good
as the other about how maybe small
changes in communicative practice led
the language you can't make up any story
about how I language developed by small
changes because that's a sudden change
it's a new principle new phenomenon had
to be a kind of rewiring in the brain
may be a small genetic change though he
knows enough to say but it's very hard
to even imagine a plausible alternative
but apart from general plausibility
there is there's very strong evidence
most of it internal linguistic evidence
so therefore nobody looks at it because
one of the principles of cognitive
science these days is you're not
supposed to know anything it's kind of
crucial not to know anything literally
like my own University if a student in
the cognitive science department has a
thesis on or an article on language
which involves knowing something about
language it's almost automatically
thrown out and that covers a lot of the
field and I think there's an origin for
that too it comes back to the early days
of artificial intelligence it's deeply
rooted in the computational cognitive
sciences you're not supposed to
understand anything because the
principle is if you have huge massive
data and you throw a big computer at it
and you have a lot of Statistics
something's supposed to come out well
chances of that happening or
approximately zero and if you look at
sixty years of it I think the results
conformed the expectations but if you
adopt that way of looking at things and
if you're kind of you've got in the back
ear of mine
the whole behavioral science framework
it sort of these conclusions come out
pretty naturally but I think they were
it's very it's kind of important that
people in the field you know this field
our field of leaks what I take to be my
field it's not going to survive unless
the surrounding intellectual environment
can see why there's a point in carrying
it out and to a very large extent that's
not the case and it's diminishing which
is a problem for those of you who are
not my age should I think about not a
problem for me I won't be around well
there are a lot of stuff and when I get
into but when I stop them leave it
actually you should have been
interrupting all along since we took the
light then yeah I can go on sort of
indefinitely
[Applause]
which you have to say that I think it is
when you're interpreting that's a very
straightforward interpretation what did
John see what you can write it out in
classical logic I don't say that's the
way it's done but it's easy for which X
X a thing John saw the thing X that's
what you want to interpret know that but
that's a way of an ode to see them as
far as the brain is concerning it may
just look at what did you see what okay
we can write out what it's doing in a
way intelligible to us because we
studied elementary logic in which we
express it as for which thing X John saw
the thing X but there's no reason to
believe that's what's going on in here
it may be just looking at what John saw
a wad interpret that way
you know these are all notice there's a
lot of ways of saying it but they're all
saying the same thing this thing we've
get this thing what John so what and
we're asking what's a natural way of
putting it in terms that we understand
no I don't say that these are just
arbitrary choices like the different
choices say Danny foxes and someone else
sometimes have empirical differences but
not often if you look they're usually
enter translatable so you can do with if
there are different is fine then you
look at them and that gives you more
insight into exactly how it's being
interpreted but notice that what we're
looking at we're looking at the rules
that are called formal semantics okay
these are generally understood to be
operations that take the narrow
syntactic objects like what did you see
what and turn it into something
interpretable @ci okay but then we're
back to the question I asked before
let's say there are differences among
the different approaches I don't think
it's all that obvious but let's say
there are then then there's a right
answer at or on the answer okay there's
a right mechanism and a wrong one where
is that mechanism is it in the I
language or is it in the thought system
well we don't know but okay so there's
some mechanism the interesting to find
it and then we'd have to explain it
no we're not a Tribune to get just say
we don't know I mean it doesn't you know
there's no more complexity assuming it
tributing the one than the other
I mean first thing you have to show is
that there are empirically significant
differences between different ways of
interpreting what the narrows index
gives you it's not a simple task as you
know but suppose you can if you can then
you have an argument for one mechanism
over another mechanism next question
where's that mechanism in the whole
architecture of cognition third question
why is it there well maybe the reason
why it's there is some third factor of
principle that we don't know but since
these since we don't have a theory of
computation that holds for thought
systems or semantic interpretation you
can't talk about the third factor
principles this is very much like narrow
syntax in the 1950s you postulate
whatever mechanism you need you know T
markers or whatever it may be to give
you some phenomenon and that just can't
be right for the same reason it wasn't
right and narrow syntax so you have to
ask okay why is it this way not some
other way in other words you have to
pursue the minimal program you have to
and that I'm not criticizing it but it
hasn't even been undertaken in these
domains with the all the work you know
maybe rightly it's devoted to how to get
mechanisms which will give you the
descriptively accurate results okay and
that's fine I'm not I don't mean to be
critical like I wasn't critical of the
work in the 50s of NARAS index but it's
just the beginning yeah
you got to go on and answer all these
other questions it's kind of like
cartography I think extremely
interesting work raises all kind of
questions okay
go on to pursue the question and I think
these are the questions that arise in
this case
but for all the formal semantics notice
that formal semantics is not semantics
it's miss named its syntax formal
semantics is symbol manipulation and by
definition that syntax the classical
notions of you know syntax semantics
pragmatics are for simple manipulation
of syntax and then our question where
it's going on and semantics has to do
with relations to some outside world
okay and it's very possible in fact my
view correct probably that language just
doesn't have a semantics and when we
talk about the outside world but that's
referring we're talking about those are
actions from the fact that we refer to
things which you certainly do it doesn't
mean that there's a reference relation
in language and I think there's strong
evidence that there isn't there is an
animal communication as far as we know
so it looks as though in animal
communication one of the many respects
in which animal communication systems
look totally different from human
language in almost every respect but one
of them is that you're Andy gal
Estelle's worked on this among others
that it seems to be the case in animal
communication systems that every symbol
has a one-to-one relation to some
externally identifiable physical
phenomenon
so you know the leaves flutter in the
vervet monkey eliminates you listen it's
what we call a warning call or some
hormonal change and elicits what we call
I'm hungry you know and that looks first
of all it looks reflexive like they got
to do it and it also seems to have a
denotational property you know there's a
mind independent characterization of
some event in the world
that's one to one related to the
internal symbol a human words are not
like
oh there's a notational dogma that
claims that were just announced resort
of things you know first two events and
so on since you look at the words they
don't do that at all I mean any word
that's ever been looked at doesn't work
like that
it's perfectly true that we refer to
things but not that way it looks like
part of the theory of action and if
that's correct language anymore half a
semantics it'll have an internal syntax
and a pragmatic I'm not saying you can
prove this but it's my view is that's
what the evidence points to but the in
the work that you're talking about which
is quite fascinating ya know integration
is syntactic work by definition that's
true and certainly of all of model
theoretic semantics
if model theoretic semantics for those
of you work on it postulates individuals
and studies arrangements of the
individuals no predicate so were the
individuals and so on but the
individuals are mental object they're
not things in the world there are
anything you postulate to make the
mechanisms work and you somehow have to
relate all this stuff to the world well
at that point you're getting into
semantics but nobody looks at this and
in fact if you do look at it I don't
think any way to do it it's not that the
models are wrong it's just that to find
a way of showing how they enter into the
acts of referring is going to be a
tricky thing it's not just you see a cow
and yes a cow no doesn't work at all
well you can snake same are again a
generative process can be studied at any
of his three levels actually only well
let's take an input outputs of general
process are different but pick what he's
talking about say vision so you can
study vision which was his topic at all
three levels you can say at the
computational level the problem of is
is take a real case you have three dots
on a hysto scopic image and you have a
series of these three dots okay that's
the external part the internal part is
you see a rigid object in motion a
pretty crazy thing but it's true it's
called the rigidity principle so the
computational problem is it's just what
I said you get a series of three dots on
the Kiska scope you see a rigid object
in motion that's the computational part
then comes the algorithmic part figure
out the right mechanism the right
procedure that'll map one into the other
okay then and you gotta get the right
one because good the other the next step
would be what's going on in the visual
cortex that implements this algorithm so
you got all three when you look at a
generative process you only have two
there's an internal process maybe the
kind I described maybe something else
which is yielding these structures it's
not forming them I mean that's kind of
like its thing to say if you're studying
mathematics you think of a function I
mean the way you kind of intuitively
think about it is the function is taking
this and it's yielding that but a
function is just a relation it's not
doing anything you know this thing here
is a relation you know that's a kind of
intuitive way of thinking about it but
or take a proof you study and the same
logic and you learn what a proof is you
take the axioms apply the rules of
inference and ultimately you get the
theorem
that's nothing to do with proofs that
defines geometrical profe is a
geometrical object it's a certain
geometrical object and the axiom system
determines the infinite set of those
geometrical objects but proving a
theorem is nothing
that I'm the way you prove a theorem is
you got something you think may be true
you know try to figure out a little mo
maybe it follows from this and so you
can establish the lemma and then do some
other crazy thing well you know get a
flash of insight whatever maybe that's
proving a theorem but a proof itself
though it's described as if it's an
action isn't that just as a function
isn't an action or a rule of
multiplication is not an action it's
just saying here's the triples such that
X equals y times e you know just listing
them and that's what generative
processes so there aren't any algorithms
there's there's a computational account
you can say here's what's doing
somewhere which we don't know there's
some mechanisms that are going on but
there's no middle level that's why the
applications of Dave Mars very
interesting and valuable approach just
don't work for generous processes
like give you a personal anecdote if you
don't mind but I got my degree PhD which
was a total fraud incidentally I hadn't
done any work or anything else happened
but I had no professional qualifications
and that's why I went to MIT cuz they're
here
they didn't care because they were
getting a ton of Pentagon money for them
to do research or do whatever you like
but that's how a lot of us becomes like
I was talk to the director of the lab
and listen it was interested as a
scientist you know told him was working
on it sounded kind of interesting so he
asked me if I wanted to work on a
machine translation project that they
had and I said that's a stupid project
I'm not gonna work on it but if you want
to hire me under the project that's fine
and then I'll do the work that I'm
talking about and he thought that was
pretty good answers but I suggest that
as a pro but work in this case the
reason I was a stupid project is
linguistics is nowhere near enough to
give a principal to answer to hey you
might do something like that so if you
want to get it done do it by brute force
you know take Canada well what they
actually do by now after having given up
in linguistics properly they take the
Canadian hands are you know
parliamentary records they're in French
and English parallel so do a ton of
totally boring and irrelevant
statistical analysis and you can kind of
get an approximation to which french
phrases and which English phrases more
or less
together that's how the translation the
Google translation programs work just
match up a lot of garbage and do some
techniques that don't give any insight
and it'll it's like building a bigger
bulldozer no there's nothing wrong with
big bulldozers but you know study
physics that way so sure it's fine that
a lot of things you can do that way in
fact I want anything in areas that you
don't understand or it done that way I
mean almost all of engineering was done
that way up until a generation ago like
when I got to MIT main engineering
school in the world
there were very good maths and physics
departments but they were service
departments they were just teaching
engineers tricks and if you wanted to
build something you would go to MIT you
learn how to construct an electric
circuit or build a bridge or something
okay go to MIT it's mostly brute force
and you know at lore things that people
have learned by practice the physics and
math kind of help out to sort of
formulate thing within ten years it it
totally changed by the 1960s when you
guys were there or later it was a
science university anyone who no matter
what engineering profession you're
interested in you study the same basic
science and then maybe some applications
to different areas and the reasons are
simple for the first time science really
had a lot to tell engineering the
furthermore technology started changing
very fast there was any point learning
how to design an electric circuit if ten
years later it's all gonna be done in a
computer you know and the same with
every other field so that's it's very
recent notice it's very recent that
science had much to tell engineering
it's same with medicine I'm until
frankly the last generation in fact is a
famous line in the history of medicine
but I think I forget what year maybe in
1920 was a critical year in the history
of Medicine
because it's the first time when if
there was a confrontation between a
patient and a doctor the patient might
improve from it and the reason primarily
was chemistry and engineering so if you
get drugs that really cure things and
you know people didn't fix your broken
bones and stuff like that but almost all
medicine is still just lore now good
doctors or nurses and others kind of
know from experience intuition know
where it's coming from that this is a
way to deal with this problem sometimes
right sometimes wrong but science is
finally contributing something and you
know linguistics is nowhere near physics
and biology we don't understand the most
elementary thing and machine translation
is much more complex than curing
pneumonia or something so there's a huge
gap and in that gap these statistical
models are fine they're brute-force
methods don't yield any insight or
understanding except than the way that
Charles does it integrated with UG
principles which gives you something you
know and I think that makes sense there
shouldn't be any conflict about it I bet
a lot of people are pretty hysterical
about it I know if you read Peter
Norfolk's diatribe the guy who runs
Google and crazy guy and he gave a lot
of examples which are right those are
examples of brute force in areas where
you don't understand anything and so
yeah you go by
I'm not I don't well you know a lot more
about an idea but see I'm interested
seeing what you think but my feeling is
that decimals alone have a record of
zero success is that an exaggeration at
least I don't know the case and nor do I
expect them to why should they they've
got to be based on something you know
you know if you're doing Bayesian models
you start with priors where'd they come
from you know if you look at the
literature on it's a famous very
well-known study by a colleague of mine
Joshua the Penan bound came out in
science on how to grow a mind or
something you know that paper he starts
by postulating the priors and the priors
are a kind of a network of concepts
which answers all possible questions
before you start except that the
concepts are all wrong and then he does
a lot of complex statistical analysis
and ends up saying well there isn't much
to say I'm gonna say about this that's
considered a major contribution if
that's if you think that's a caricature
read the paper but a lot of stuff in the
field is like that and it's what you
expect I mean if you say you wouldn't
study physics by taking a ton of
videotapes of what's happening outside
the window and doing complex statistical
analysis of it I mean you might get a
pretty good prediction about what's
likely to be outside the window tomorrow
if I way better than the physics
department can give you but it's not
physical I think one of the best ways of
predicting the weather and Boston I
learned years ago is to read the
Cleveland newspapers
we usually get their weather the next
thing okay that kind of works probably
as good as meteor rocks that's different
we don't know whether there's ordering
and thought because the only
introspection we have is into internal
externalize language so if you just
introspect you can't go a minute without
talking to yourself but you talk to
yourself in externalized language what's
going on inside well that's not
accessible to consciousness but if you
introspect about the process there
hasn't been much work about that so
let's talk my own personal introspection
my impression is that when I try to say
something even to myself
that something is there first I mean I
know what I mean and I try to say it it
doesn't come out right and you try
something else
maybe that gets closer and sometimes you
find you just can't express it you know
you can't find a way to express it that
captures what you're thinking that kind
of experience and there's a lot actually
there's some experimental work that's
like it really bears on it that seems to
indicate that probably everything of any
significance is going on beyond
consciousness the experimental work has
to do with choice the lipid experiment
which I think have been badly
misinterpreted but there are some
experiments that show that if I intend
to pick up a cup say milliseconds before
I intend there's something going on in
the
you know motor organization system okay
that's argued to show you don't have
free will doesn't show anything it just
shows that it's all the decisions are
all going on unconsciously and by the
time they read consciousness which
sometimes happens sometimes doesn't it's
kind of peripheral phenomenon it's all
done and that's probably true of
everything now studying unconscious
thought is no trivial matter I mean it's
it's not impossible
so for example there have been studies
of there have been studies of somebody
will know the details of people who are
just thinking just thinking about things
to say it turns out you can detect the
very slight lip movements and things
like that now I've asked some people who
worked on sign and they're some people
are looking at it to see if when people
are thinking and first of all nobody
knows how people are thinking inside and
it just hasn't been investigated like
take a a native speaker of sign language
I mean or they're obviously thinking all
the time just like we are are they
thinking in sign well if they are what
what's it like and can you detect a hand
movements minimal and movements well you
know you could pursue enquiries like
this would give you something but
they're not going to go very far because
what's going on beyond the level of
consciousness is probably almost
everything significant that
consciousness is some kind of peripheral
thing which picks up somewhat what's
going on in our head it's not a small
problem you know but we shouldn't
pretend it's not there because we don't
understand anything we don't know we
don't know we don't know that we're
thinking in language which comes to
consciousness
first of all at least me when I
introspect into my use of language
it isn't sentences it's scattered
phrases no bits and pieces of phrases I
mean I can restate them as a sentence
but when I really think about it I'm
getting you know a word here other word
there somehow it's all the listening
something that's really back there
somewhere and you put it together try it
sometimes it's kind of interesting to
introspect into what you're doing when
you're just talking to yourself we're
not talking to ourselves and something
is right there again something to speak
and it gives the impression at least to
me is if something going on in there
that bits and pieces come out
occasionally and we kind of construct
them and try to put them in a
intelligible form and when you speak or
when you're right that's another step
that's trying to do it but this just
guesses nobody's really studied yeah
I'll give you some names if you want
Michael Tomasello look what he says it's
shared intentionality he doesn't say
anything about principles of computation
shared intentionality is totally
irrelevant totally because people
without what
no that's different that's use of
language but you can have an autistic
child and in fact know some who have no
idea what anybody else wants and can't
deal with anyone else but his language
is perfect and in fact if you look at
the just the acquisition rate the
acquisition of language is very early
acquisition of what's called theory of
mind or something shared intentionality
that's considerably later yeah and any
kind of experimentation that's done I
mean it's you know three or four year
olds that are picking up the ability to
do this theory of mind experiments but
there's much more serious problem even
if we believe it exists suppose it's
based on shared intentionality as he
claims how do you go from shared
intentionality to structure dependence
or anything
yeah but categorization is a different
thing that's a thought process that's
not language I mean if it shows up read
the people who write about it like Susan
Curtis has expensive work on any kind of
dissociation you can think of about that
she no she storm at normal languages
well and in fact the they're people with
normal language use who have all kind of
other in capacities and conversely
yeah so there are cases where it's not
true there are cases where it is true
that's the case where it is true that
are interesting I mean I just gave you
one autistic kids whose language is
perfect and have no sense of shared
intentionality and you know some of them
have say fantastic arithmetic ability
and the language yeah okay that's yeah
it goes almost any way you look and this
plenty of studies of no cause autistic
as you know I'm sure you know it's not a
category it's some kind of spectrum
that's not understood so that's what we
call autism there's all kind of
different things but there are children
who are diagnosed as autistic whatever
that means
in fact they know some who have the
language capacity is essentially perfect
you can't maybe with some complicated
experiments you can show something they
don't know and they have no conception
of how to deal with anyone else they
can't get along with anyone you know
okay and it works the other way there
are people who kids who get along fine
with everyone who don't speak and
there's every other kind of dissociation
you like well I think the literature's
pretty strong okay
whatever you think but even if there
weren't dissociation suppose there were
none still the proposals of the safe
Tomasello is making are completely
vacuous because there is no way to get
from shared intentionality or culture
whatever that is to anything simple that
you think of say you know structure
dependence to take the simplest thing in
fact if you look at the work
he has zero his account is somehow we
know subject-predicate because of this
and that and the other thing so
therefore we use structure dependent
rules which is knowing to do with the
question I mean you can have a lot of
the cognitive computational cognitive
science work makes exactly the same
mistake they say look we have a way of
getting hierarchy that shows he is
structure dependence doesn't show a
thing you could have hierarchy in fact
you must have hierarchy still leaves the
option of two methods of relating say
instinctively to a verb in the case that
I mentioned one is linear order that's
available the other is minimal
structural distance the fact they have
hierarchy didn't tell you what you get
you haven't linear order to so once you
use it outlet of this work it's just
totally irrelevant it doesn't think
through the most elementary questions
like both of those options are there
with the F hierarchy or not and say
Tomas oh it was right and his kind of
speculation that somehow you know
subjecting somebody in a predicate or I
grant him that tells you nothing about
why you don't use the linear order
nothing doesn't even raise the question
and the same is true in every other
property of language find one that isn't
what not for things like this is that's
an other in communication you sometimes
do like there's a you know uwh movement
let's say it's to the left not to the
right
okay that's linear order so you look for
reasons they're probably pragmatic
reasons Ricci has a lot of evidence
about how Lydia order shows up okay look
at it but the idea that but it just
doesn't bear on any of these topics it
doesn't it bears on the various what I
mean language use is a very complicated
thing has all kind of things interacting
you can find some which involve you know
emphasis focus the some cases of say
affronting of negation which change
things a furthermore incidentally on
this case
there happens to be direct and pretty
interesting neuro physiological evidence
that you don't look that you can't use a
linear order and the court cases the
work that came out of the Milan group
you know that well the very interesting
studies that came out of a it's been
replicated a lot by now but in about ten
years ago a a research group in Milan
Andre Amoros the linguist involved and
they did some very straightforward
experimental work they took speakers of
I think German and gave them two kinds
of nonsense language the one kind was
modeled on some language they didn't
know but accorded with UG the other
involved extremely simple prints
computational principles that aren't
known in language like for example
negating a sentence by putting the
negative particle in the third word
physician well the they were just
studying neural correlates it turns out
that when they give them the ug
conforming nonsense you get the normal
activation in the language areas when
you give them the trivial computation
put the negation in the third word say
you get its puzzle you know people can
solve it with different areas of brain
are working in fact it's very diffuse
all over the brain it's puzzle solving
and there's some experimental work that
tricky that conforms to this you know
Smith and simply's work with their Chris
they're sort of language genius this is
a guy who has essentially no very low
cognitive capacities you know they have
to help him go upstairs there's because
you know where to go and the house where
he lives almost nothing but he learns
language very quickly actually turns out
he learns phonology and morphology very
quickly and lexicon he learns those
aspects of language he doesn't it looks
as if he's learning syntax and semantics
but
you look closely probably not it's just
there you know but he acquires languages
very fast they tried to teach him and a
group of normals a different languages
some of them were some language in
neither of them knew okay Chris acquired
what looks like confidence very quickly
he doesn't know time memorizes
dictionary things like that the normals
not a problem you know sometimes they
finally solved the puzzle then they gave
them he gave them they gave them
nonsense languages which did same as
moral did and did not violate ug the
ones that did violate ug the normals
treated it like some language they never
heard of they finally got it as a puzzle
that Chris could do nothing it's just
because it can't solve puzzles okay
there's that kind of evidence but I
think the evidence is very strong and
quite apart from the evidence the
evidence really doesn't matter because
there is no way to go from the kind of
things that say Tomasello looks at to
anything about language
it's just hand waving you say okay you
do it by induction and analogy or you
know something else that's nothing
that's what I meant by saying this desk
is hand waving a bad name I think it
really does is try to work it out that's
pretty strong
No well first of all I would like to
qualify that because of what I said
later I think it should satisfy the CI
level optimally because the sensorimotor
system seems ancillary not it has to
satisfy that - probably optimally but
it's going to be quite complicated so
the question is fair question what is
optimally mean well you know we don't
have a perfect theory of computational
complexity computational complexity is
used in biology and in fact for physics
all the time without a perfect theory of
it but some ideas about it and the way
you refine these ideas is by seeing what
works and asking what does that tell you
about computational complexity so and
some of the ideas are quite simple for
example less is better than more okay
less computation is better than more
computation ok that's alone is
sufficient for everything I said or
minimal search is better than deep
search because it requires more
complexity they're not what I call the
no tampering condition you know you
don't mess with the things you're
merging is more efficient than changing
them that's any theories computations
when I have that property or eliminate
copies on the way to externalization it
gives you a massive restriction of
computation or to take another case that
I didn't mention it's kind of laying
that was internal here but if you look
at work on displacement over the years
it's been assumed by me too that
displacement is somehow a complex
property as distinct from what I call
the internal merge is something
complicated
somehow I have to explain away it's a
kind of an imperfection of language and
external merge you know just putting
through things together is
straightforward but actually it's the
opposite it turns out if you think about
it external merge requires a lot more
computation than internal merge
technically external merge requires
searching the entire space of accessible
object
you know the whole lexicon the whole
workspace and big search program and
then you can put together C and John you
know internal merge is much simpler
you're looking at one object you're
picking what's technically a term of it
that's a well-defined notion and you
merging that to the whole object that's
straightforward but there's a lot of
literature arguing good linguists that
copies should be that internal merge
should be replaced by external merge so
take what did you see what okay the
argument is waste you just generate you
see what and then you take what which
you've generated outside and yet
externally merge them it's a very bad
idea for a lot of reasons for one thing
it requires for one thing it requires a
stipulation you have to block internal
birds which is free
that's like blocking any other thing
that comes free second is it involves a
huge amount of computation every thing
that's displaced has to be independently
generated and it can be of arbitrary
complexity and it can be present Anouar
arbitrarily many times in the
construction and you got to do all that
computation instead of doing a very
elementary computation take a term of an
object and merger now any theory of
computation is going to at least meet
that condition and I think you
generalize this isn't something true in
other parts of biology so for example if
you look at say
you know Christian hacks work on
optimizing neural networks he done an
interesting work showing that take very
simple organisms like in a nematode it's
a couple hundred neurons and you look at
the white with where the wiring diagrams
known you know you know everything about
how they're connected you know nothing
about what the damn thing is doing but
that's another problem
but he's shown I think pretty
convincingly that you can predict the
wiring diagram by a principle of
computation which essentially is the
same principle that's used in building
transistors a minimized wire length
because if you minimize total wire
length you get the nemeth though he
argues that may extend to the fact that
vertebrates have the brain at one end
not in the middle you know things like
that well that's good work
but why that principle of computation
you can think of others well that's the
way science works you know you try to
find sensible principles that makes
sense see if they work you can ask well
are there other principles that don't
work what's the difference between them
can I refine the theory such a good
question but I think it's a research
question and for our purposes at least
at this primitive stage of languages
study just obvious properties of
complexity work like less is better than
more the same thing two words for
something were searching for
we're searching for the general
principle of biology and maybe Avnet of
the natural world that tries to make
things simple and you know that goes
back to the origin that's all of science
so it takes a Galileo
I mean his you know the principle that
he proposed for the sciences and that
everybody follows fins is we have to
believe that nature is simple
maybe because God made it that way
nature is simple and it's the task of
the scientists to prove it if you can't
prove it you're wrong and all of the
sciences are based on this you know you
throw that out you're just collecting
data in fact you nine to collect me data
because even to collect data requires
prior assumptions about what is data so
so it's just it's just it's asking a
good question but it's a general
question about the nature of human
inquiry and it does show up in cases
like this and sometimes you know
sometimes you might find real examples
like say with journey AK is there
another mode of computation with
structure dependence is there another
mode and if you can find alternative
proposals about optimization good then
you search you try to distinguish them
on some other grounds but it's a
research question you can't answer at a
priori you can start with reasonable a
priori assumptions which get you pretty
far but you have to be willing to
question them later on because they
could be wrong but that's just inquiry
you can't get around those problems
