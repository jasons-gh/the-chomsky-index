this is specific or radios democracy now
the exception to the rulers I'm Amy
Goodman attending today's funeral of
King Hussein president clinton as well
as representatives of countries that the
US has recently bombed from iraq to the
sudan and as the president's impeachment
trial nears its end this week his policy
towards Iraq including prolonged bombing
and economic sanctions are being
increasingly criticized just last week
the group voices in the wilderness which
opposes us UN sanctions against Iraq
completed a 250 mile walk from the
Pentagon to the United Nations in
protest of US policy towards Iraq
according to UN estimates the sanctions
are responsible for the deaths of more
than 1 million Iraqi children we turn
now to professor Noam Chomsky professor
of linguistics at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology well-known
political dissident author of many books
his latest profit over people just a few
weeks ago he talked about the issue of
Iraq in a speech entitled the crisis in
Iraq understanding us motives behind
sanctions and confrontation well you've
all seen the I assume the title of the
meeting and I'd like to begin by
distancing myself a little bit from it
and just adding some qualifications
which I think ought to be kept in mind
in any such discussion I saw laments say
it once and then forget about it when we
talk about the motives behind some state
policy in the first place when it's a
recent when we had no internal evidence
we don't have documentary evidence so we
don't have an evidence about the
planning but that doesn't really matter
much if we had a full record including
transcripts of everything that was said
we still really wouldn't have the answer
and in fact the participants wouldn't
know the answer either and furthermore
that's something we all know from our
personal experience if you try to figure
out your own motives and doing something
turns out they're complex and there's a
mixture and it's very hard to sort them
out and you
may not be the best judge and that's
true whether it's personal affairs or
affairs of state there are complicated
motives and even the participants don't
know what they are we can at best
surmise and try to analyze but there
should be always a level of skepticism
home I'm not going to add it anymore but
should be an undercurrent for everything
i say or everything you read anywhere
else or hear anywhere else well with
that said let me now sound confident
from that one the there's a kind of a
reasonable way to proceed to figure out
what the motives are we can run through
possibilities if some of them can be
excluded and we can sort of narrow it
down on some possibilities there left
the one that immediately comes to mind
and the first one to pay attention to is
the one that is universally expressed
and vociferously expressed I never
questioned now that's close to true I
mean you know I maybe there's some
statistical error and it's occasionally
question but you have to look hard to
find it that is you hear it in high
places you know Tony Blair Madeleine
Albright commentary reporting editorials
I'll just take one example because it's
close to home the Boston Globe the day
of but is completely typical it's unfair
to pick the globe the the day of the
last latest bombings there was a an
editorial called a just attack and the
reason there was one reason for it and
it's a standard one there's Saddam is a
vengeful despot who has already used
chemical and biological weapons on his
own citizens which is the ultimate
horror obviously such a creature has to
be destroyed poses an enormous threat
can't be tolerated so you bomb imposed
sanctions and so on that that's
essentially the universal view the
universal explanation unchallenged the
kind of instructive exercise would be to
check to see to what extent there's been
any question raised about that
justification well that justification
does have at least one merit it's very
easily tested it takes a minute to test
it you simply have to ask what was the
u.s. British reaction when Saddam
Hussein carried out the ultimate heart
that is used chemical weapons against
his own people he certainly did no doubt
that he's a monster and he certainly
used it carried out this act of his a
vengeful despot who has used chemical
weapons against his own people that's
undoubtedly true Emily in 1988 when he
carried out a major several times
gassing campaign against Kurds he also
used the nerve gas and chemical weapons
and other chemical weapons and so on on
the war against Iran that was just
finishing up at that time and in fact
the use of increased till the end so it
happened and there is a reaction on the
part of the United States and Britain
and the Boston Globe and everybody else
is talking about it and you can see what
that reaction is it's on the record you
know well the reaction was that the
United States and Britain increased
their support for their favorite monster
they'd been supporting him avidly right
through his worst crimes and after the
gassing they increase the support it's
not you know it's not a secret you can
easily discover it so how do they
increase the sport well in some
interesting ways the US had been
providing Iraq with all kinds of aid but
particularly at that point they
increased the Reagan and later Bush
administration's increase the subsidized
food aid subsidized means you know you
guys are paying for subsidized
agricultural experts to Iraq now widen
Iraq is a agricultural producer had been
a country which one of the few countries
in the region which it was actually an
efficient producer food and even
exporter's what did it need agricultural
exports for it well that was actually
connected with Ag asset
the gassing of the Kurds I mean Saddam
Hussein the vengeful despot was
destroying agricultural areas and the
people who lived in them so therefore
there was actually a food shortage and
therefore we had to come to the rescue
to help out with this project of gassing
Kurds in the north and we did by
increasing the subsidized agricultural
exports to Iraq essentially for that
reason at that time discontinued so
during the invasion of Panama George
Bush took off a moment to announce that
we were going to increase the this is
December 1989 year later we're going to
increase the credits to Iraq to allow
them to purchase from us agricultural
and other producers wasn't just
agricultural this wasn't I don't think
this was reported in the press nor as
far as I could discover was it reported
that one senator senator Dean ooh yay
from Hawaii I thought this was kind of
surprising and asked for clarification
and he was given an official
clarification by the State Department
which again I don't think was reported
he was told official government policy
that we were going to increase our
support for our favorite eventual despot
mass murderer they didn't say that but
we were going to increase the sport
that's that I'm saying that's the globe
because here it is it would increase US
exports and put the United States in a
better position to deal with Iraq on
human rights issues well they didn't
have to be any laughter because it
wasn't reported but at that time let's
forget the small thing about increasing
US exports meaning increasing the
profits for agribusiness and the high
technology industry and so on at that
time the line was we are in a better
position to deal with Iraqi human rights
issues if we subsidize the monster a
year later
it turned out that we're in a better
position to deal with human rights
issues if we starve the Iraqi people and
the submission somehow you're not
supposed to notice that the line changed
for some reason but whatever reason it
changed for clearly had nothing to do
with the ultimate horror the using of
chemical weapons against his own people
because that already happened and it
just led us to increase the support okay
so that's put that in the back of our
minds in fact this issue certainly has
risen I mean for example Madeleine
Albright us perhaps you recall was asked
on national TV about a year two years
ago I guess 19th 96 she was asked on 60
minutes what she thought about the fact
that about it was reported that about
half a million Iraqi children had been
had died as a result of the sanctions
which are putting us in a better
position to deal with Iraqi human rights
violations and she said she agreed that
this was a hard choice and but she said
we think the price is worth it so that's
the moral level of the way in which we
deal with Iraqi human rights violations
by killing half main Iraqi children we
think the prices we're willing to pay
that price that's nice to hear the
subsidies for our favorite killer when
he was carrying out the ultimate horror
we're not restricted to subsidized your
cultural exports they also included
technical equipment dual-use equipment
equipment that could be used for
military purposes helicopters for
example a lot of equipment which could
could even be used for production of
chemical and biological warfare this was
all revealed afterwards that went on the
at the time the there was suspicion that
Saddam Hussein had biological warfare
facilities the u.s. denied he's our
friend after all he wouldn't do that
sort of thing but they were discovered
by a very good journalist he was at that
time
the Middle East reporter for ABC
television Charlie glass he was able to
find high-level Iraqi defectors in
London general actually and from
information that he got from them using
French commercial satellites which are
low grade but you know certainly nothing
like what the Pentagon has he was able
to locate and identify biological
warfare facilities and ABC television
let them run a spot on the news showing
biological warfare facilities giving the
evidence from defecting Iraqi generals
then they switched immediately to their
Pentagon correspondent whoo-hoo food it
said Pentagon says this is nonsense
forget about it and the story died now
those same biological warfare facilities
are being presented as proof that the
you know this reincarnation of Attila
the Hun has to be destroyed by
massacring his population same ones and
you're not supposed to remember that
either right according to the Iraqi
dissidents there has been for a long
time a ban an official ban u.s.
government ban against any contact with
Iraqi dissidents the Democratic
opposition it's not because they're big
radicals or anything like that head is a
London banker others are professionals
but there was a ban and according to
Iraqi dissidents that man was instituted
forcefully right after the last gassing
episode so as not to irritate our friend
Saddam Hussein I can't vouch for that
but that the ban has been in operation
is absolutely true in fact it was it's
been reiterated repeatedly after we got
up to December 1989 january nineteen
ninety a few months after that in april
a group of high-ranking US senators when
to Iraq they met with Saddam and the
Kurdish city of Mosul remember the Kurds
are the ones are getting gassed they're
the delegation was headed by Robert dole
who brought the president's greetings to
the Saddam Alan Simpson who I think is
over at the Kennedy School now pardon is
he you know he was in the delegation he
told the Saddam that Saddam's problems
are not with the American government
which has no objections to him there
with some journalists kind of loose
cannons and he advised Saddam that what
he should do is invite them to Iraq so
they could kind of see for themselves
you know he disagrees notions an israeli
scholar Middle East scholar who's
writing about this in retrospect says
accurately that the fawning before the
dictator reminded him of Munich that's
pretty good analogy well that's up to
april nineteen ninety that's already two
years after the halacha massacre the
ultimate horror the and this carries us
up to this continues up until the day of
the invasion quake okay so that's when
overwhelmingly saddam hussein's crimes
were committed during that period some
some of the worst ones were committed
afterwards I'll come to that but the
major ones were committed up till that
period and us supported him all the way
through in fact with a good deal of
enthusiasm so did written that tells us
something it tells us that they cannot
just by elementary logic the crimes
can't be the reason why we're what we
have to destroy the monster I mean
nothing could be more obvious than that
well what about the threat posed by
Saddam Hussein that's real that threat
peaked in the late 1980s thanks to our
support that's the time when he was when
he was most threatening and most
powerful
there's a measure of how great the
threat was that was at the in the he was
have been at war he had attacked Iran
with our support and there was a war
going on he was unable to defeat Iran
that's a country which had just
decimated its officer corps and top
military at the time of the revolution
from any revolution the revolution which
led the Khomeini it even with the
Iranian military largely decimated Iraq
was unable to defeat them with the
support of the United States Russia
Britain Western Europe in the Arab
states so it gives you a measure of the
threat at its peak the but the u.s.
today in comparison Iraq as well as
Charlie glass again wrote in a recent
article the Iraqi army is approximately
back to what it was when the British
established it established it as a means
to suppress the population violently so
that the rulers would be able to export
oil to the west and ensure that the
profits go to the west not to the people
of the region that's the role of the
most of the armies in the Middle East
and the Iraqi army is about back to that
level its equipment is antiquated its is
the far weaker than it was a lot of the
weapons have been destroyed not so much
by bombing but by the inspection system
which has destroyed a lot of weapons and
of course by the destruction of the
economy so yes it's a threat it was a
much greater threat ten years ago and
how did the US and Britain react to the
threat at its peak we all have already
mentioned it but the main reaction was
to increase the threat that was the
reaction at the peak of the threat and
the US took it very seriously I want to
remember how serious it was a bear in
mind that Iraq was the only country
actually there's only one
other country Israel but apart from
Israel Iraq is the only country that was
authorized to attack us ships and to
kill US sailors that authorization isn't
given anyone else in may may I think
1987 Iraqi missiles struck the US
destroyer start killing 37 sailors 37
personnel and they got a kind of tap on
the wrist but that's it that's an
unusual authorization that shows you're
really committed to somebody the what
was the u.s. Stark doing there well the
u.s. at that the US Navy at that time
was being introduced into the Gulf to
back up Iraq and support them him in the
war against Iran and of course in his
war against his own population that
continued that Alliance strengthened a
year later in july 1988 another a us
worship the events in has shot down an
Iranian commercial airliner just taking
off from Iranian airport professor Noam
