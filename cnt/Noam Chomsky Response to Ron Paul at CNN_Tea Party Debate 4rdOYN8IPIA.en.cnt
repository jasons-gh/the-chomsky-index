our I'm Amy Goodman with Aaron Matta our
guest for the hour is MIT professor Noam
Chomsky his latest book is called 911
was there an alternative that last
question was there an alternative
referring to the assassination of Osama
bin Laden Aaron well Noah you mentioned
the changes in discourse between 10
years ago and today and actually this
issue of the reasons behind 9/11 came up
last night at the Republican
presidential debate congressman Ron Paul
of Texas drew boos from the crowd and a
rebuke from other candidates on the
podium when he criticized u.s. foreign
policy in discussing the roots of 9/11
we're under grave threat because we
occupy so many countries we're in a
hundred and thirty country we have 900
bases around the world we're going broke
the purpose of al Qaeda was to attack us
invite us over there where they can
target us and they have been doing it
they have more attacks against us and
the American interest per month then
occurred in all the years before 9/11
but we're they're occupying their land
and if we think that we can do that and
not have retaliation we're killing
ourselves we have to be honest with
ourselves what would we do if another
country say China did to us what we do
to all those countries over there so
this whole idea that the whole Muslim
world is responsible for this and
they're attacking us because we're free
and prosperous that is just not true
Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda
have been expressive they have been
explicit and they wrote and said that we
attacked we attacked America because you
had bases on our holy land in Saudi
Arabia you do not give Palestinians a
fair treatment and you have been bombing
I didn't say that I'm trying to get you
to understand what the motive was
behind the bombing at the same time we
had been bombing and killing hundreds of
thousands of Iraqis for ten years would
you be annoyed if you're not annoyed
under some problem that was Republican
Congress member Ron Paul of Texas
speaking last night at the Republican
presidential debate Noam Chomsky
responds I think what he said is
completely uncontroversial you can read
it in government documents you can find
it in polls maybe people don't like to
hear it but as I mentioned before it
goes back to the 1950s actually right
after 9/11 The Wall Street Journal to
its credit did a study of privileged
Muslims sometimes called moneyed Muslims
people in the Muslim world who are
deeply embedded in the u.s. global
project lawyers of directors of
multinational corporations and so on not
the general population and it was very
much like what Eisenhower had was
concerned about it and the National
Security Council in 1950s there was a
lot of antagonism a lot of antagonism to
us a policy in the region
partly support of dictators blocking
democracy and development just as the
National Security Council concluded in
1958 also by then by 2001 there were
much more specific things very much a
lot of anger about the u.s. backing for
the way Israeli occupation of
the occupied territories settlements the
bitter oppression of the Palestinians
and also something that didn't discuss
much here but meant a lot there and
remember these are privileged Muslims
leaders of those who kind of carry out
implement the general US economic and
social policies in the region the other
thing besides the Israeli support of
Israeli crimes was the sanctions against
Iraq this is 2001 remember the sanctions
against Iraq were brutal and destructive
they killed hundreds of thousands of
people the both of the international
diplomats who administered the
oil-for-food program distinguished
international diplomats at Dennis
holiday on sueance Banach in sequence
both of them resigned in protest because
they regarded the sanctions as genocidal
they were carrying out a kind of a mass
slaughter of Iraqis they were
strengthening Saddam Hussein they were
compelling the population to rely on him
just for survival
and the these were major crimes of the
1990s and privileged Muslims money
Muslims and the in in the Saudi Arabia
elsewhere they were bitterly opposed to
this not because they hate our freedoms
because they don't like murders and
brutal policies know'm before you were
quoting a CIA analyst saying that the
u.s. had actually become a summa bin
Laden's biggest ally through being drawn
into so many wars abroad and talking
about how all this engagement has
undermine us standing what has this
decade of war meant here at home for the
domestic situation and how that relates
to bin Laden the goals of bleeding the
United States yeah he was pretty
explicit about that he wanted he wanted
to draw the
United States into what intelligence
agencies called a trap which would lead
which would inflame and incite hostility
in the Muslim world he hoped help
mobilize people for his cause I don't
think that happened about also bankrupt
the u.s. at home
I mean current estimates was a recent
estimate study at Brown University
estimated the cost just in the two wars
at about four trillion dollars if you
count in the costs of you know Homeland
Security and so on probably doubles that
that's pretty serious that's the between
the wars the the housing bubble and
wishes tax cuts for the rich that it
creates the economic crisis that we're
now in
