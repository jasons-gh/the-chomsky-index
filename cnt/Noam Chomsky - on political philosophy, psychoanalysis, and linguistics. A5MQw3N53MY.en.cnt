yes I can you okay one second let me see
what I can okay can you can you speak
now yes no yes can you hear me yes can
you hear me
yup perfectly perfect amazing the ID
sorry I couldn't hear with you the set
what wait were you saying something
yeah they didn't ask for the ID this
time okay well okay so let's begin yep
okay the video just froze okay it's
working now so my name is Hamza I am a
student from XC college in Pakistan it's
an honor to have you
professor Chomsky we know that you're a
world-renowned linguist and political
commentator so effectively there what I
want to have as a conversation is that
we create a certain amount of discourse
within our society that's related to
both political philosophy as well as at
the end we'll have a tangent into
linguistics as well right so right now
one of the issues that Pakistan is
famous for in terms of what it's facing
is religious extremism particularly from
radicalized is long or politicized Islam
so you being an individual who's known
for advocating secular causes as well as
having an approach that's political
Anarchy particularly anarcho-syndicalism
what I would say ask for is that how is
it that in your viewpoint an
anarcho-syndicalist approach could be a
response towards the religious extremism
that exists within our society how could
we boil that down into political
activism moving to any form of an
anarchist society is a loan
complicated affair doesn't happen in an
instant
we live in a very different kind of
society it's like trying to move from
feudalism to capitalism that didn't
happen in a day what you can't write
what one can do in fact is follow the
suggestions of one of the leading
figures in the early stages of the
movement Mikhail Bakunin and as he put
it try to construct the germs of the
future society within the present one
so for example if you establish a
community which observes democratic
participation in its organization when
it's budgeted and it's functioning which
can be done and in fact is done that's a
small element of an honor for society
now workers a worker owned and managed
enterprise is another example and some
of these incidentally have reached an
enormous scale so the huge one in the
Basque Country in Spain it doesn't call
itself anarchist but it's basically what
it is huge conglomerate mondo gong with
worker owned democratically participated
participation inside industrial
hospitals schools housing and very
successful even in the capitalist market
and many other things can be done like
that an expansion to a much more free
and democratic society that overcomes
the slave like worker master
very present society so for example one
thing that can be done in the United
States that's even within the laws is
this provision called Aesop's the SOP
which allows workers in an industry in
an enterprise to buy shares in the
enterprise maybe using their pension
funds if they do this to an efficient
sufficient extent they essentially take
over the company they can become the
majority shareholders they can estate
workers control they can decide on what
should be produced and so on and that's
these things are being done to a certain
extent a few they don't you usually call
themselves anarchists but they're moving
in that direction there's a look up some
of the things that are happening there's
an organization called the new systems
project which tries to organize and
integrate many efforts of this kind
cooperative owned enterprises localism
and so on let's really requires a basic
change in consciousness so people today
take for granted that it's that your
life is fulfilled if you get a job a
decent job but what's a decent job that
means that for most of your waking hours
you're a slave you're under the control
of a totalitarian institution that has
more control over you that Stalin did
install an employee when you could go to
the bathroom or who you were allowed to
talk to what was he after weird but
that's what it means to get a job look
at the early stages in the Industrial
Revolution workers bitterly resented
this slaughter against regarded as a
fundamental attack on their human
dignity and human rights
over time it just gradually came to be
sort of common sense
you just accepted people shouldn't be
here and ask one question wouldn't you
say that this sort of dynamic that
exists of individuals working at
particular said ours don't you think
that's something that contributes to a
certain amount of productivity that we
need for the consuming of the goods that
we have okay
could you say it a little more slowly
yeah so if we are working in what you
describe as slave-like conditions do you
not think that said working ours
contribute to productivity which
otherwise would not exist or productive
than a capitalist Enterprise doesn't
capitalist enterprises waste an enormous
amount of time and cost and simply
supervising workers making sure they do
what they were supposed to do he was in
a row was that when it's a democratic
institution people do organize and
decide what to do and then do so what do
you think is basically the incentive for
these capitalist enterprises to keep
people working at set ours and in set
ways
well there is a capitalist ideology
which claims that what people really
want to do is just lie and look at the
sky and they have to be forced to work
somehow
but every one of us knows that that's
totally false creative work on the
Garonne initiative was one of the
greatest things in life I'm used to take
some working guy who works in general in
a oral plant or something
he works like a slave all week
we can do right now no do nothing he
goes into his garage and builds machines
something else Lancer Gordon does
something a t-rex would look people want
to do something from childhood people
are basically inquisitive creative they
want to do something that matters that's
sort of driven out of their heads in the
educational system and the general
cultural system they kind of trained
that what you have to do is go to the
shopping mall and see if you can buy
something but that's not the highest
golden life for a freedman
and being artisans they pride in their
work they want it done right if a woman
in Pakistan somewhere weeds rugs who
wants to do it the world away even if
that's not the point you want an
artistic project preparado that's what
unions are like so I don't think there's
a problem in surgeries that's capitalist
mythology all right so for the common
individual if they want to bring about
some sort of revolution or some sort of
change of this sort that challenges the
capitalist enterprise and along with
that also comes in to clash with the
religious ideals within a society so how
do you think that an individual ought to
go about doing that and not put
themselves or their family members at
risk depends on society and Pakistan
it's extremely hard because the power of
the religious authorities control even
the control of consciousness and belief
I leave religious authorities not just
for I had to break out of that it's
quite a battle I can't just do it
overnight it took I mean even to say
overcome slavery
took centuries visible period of time
when like most most of human history it
was considered perfectly natural with it
there to be slave
it was believed that there couldn't be
higher civilization and this category of
people were slaves so you go back to
classical Athens or Rome which were sort
of models our free society but what
there are some there but that basic
belief was it should be a free society
for elites who can spend their day
wandering around the central Athens and
they didn't discuss and meanwhile
somebody else does all the work
otherwise you couldn't have a they did I
took a little time to beat the people's
with now it sounds worth this if I were
to draw parallels between the example
that you used of slavery right one thing
that we saw was that there was of course
protest from those who were slaves but
there was also a certain amount of
action I was taken by those who were
essentially the masters or the rulers
now similarly in our society right now
with currently caught futile actuals or
few political leaders who are teachers
essentially who are trying utilizing the
privilege that they have to try to
create a sort of top-down approach where
they unite workers do you think that
that leads to a certain amount of
hijacking that if a rich individual
comes and tries to give voice to the
poor do you think that that leads to the
rich essentially hijacking the struggle
of the oppressed class somebody who
comes in and tries to give leadership to
the poor yeah from Professor if you come
there as if you come in from the
privileged classes depends how you come
you come to participate and offer your
own skills and abilities and privilege
to be used by the community where do you
come in to dictate to them what they
should do what they should believe the
very differences and what do you think
is more likely to happen in such a
scenario do you think a person from a
privileged background coming to
affectively need the masses do you think
that would adopt a dictatorial sort of
regime a perspective can happen that's
what happened the Bolshevik Russia for
example look at 1917 the very
revolutionary society a lot of worker in
peasant activism that's forming Soviets
workers councils and communities lively
that's basically democratic socialists
in society
I'm after lemon took over it's all
crushed what turned out was just the
most one of the most Adi socialist
societies in the world old doesn't
happen it's possible for people to come
in and participate so for example I was
a wonderful woman and professor
University
I went to lived in a poor village in
Rajasthan where she's working there I
think it'd be 20 years he's been living
in poverty with helping them which he
can do with the skills and advantages
that she has become a there are plenty
of people to do this I mean they don't
get known in history but for example
during the US wars in Central America in
the 1980s
thousands of people from ordinary
American life but many of them from
church roots went to live with the
people who were under attack and to try
to help them and give whatever
protection a white face gives and help
them to resist oppression build some bed
of lives watch some of the done nobody
remembers any of their names
they don't render history but it makes a
big difference so in Pakistan one issue
that we face is that obviously education
and students have a strong role to play
in developing the consciousness of our
people but the issue that we face is
that when our professors try to teach
critical thinking they face two types of
issues one issue is that they encounter
a student body that's radicalized which
doesn't want to accept their ideas
because they think they're too free or
they fall into the realm of sin and the
other issue that we face is from
authorities which do not want students
to develop critical thinking in order to
keep the massive body passive an example
of this was an individual known as a
model II John who you also lent support
to once he was thrown into jail nobody
was kicked out of the university that he
was teaching at because they believed
that he was somehow creating more of a
hey walk rather than creating critical
thinking so how do you think educational
institutes ought to go about this or
what role of education Institute's play
in general now what they what to do what
they ought to be is fostering people
like that offering opportunities
fostering creativity independence
students faculty and so on easy to say
or to achieve those are struggles there
has to be taking place and service with
boys example somebody has spent his life
in this it's not easy there's no simple
hmm odds in struggle so over here one
final question with regards to political
ideology would be that we recently had a
woman's March and it was something that
was criticized for several reasons one
reason that it faced would one
accusation it faced was that its elitist
and the other one that it faced was that
it's sort of well it was going against
what they called the norms of society so
how do you think that any sort of
narrative especially within the time of
social media could be created and do you
think that or at March or the woman
rights March could be merged with other
ideologies such as Marxism because a lot
of their demands revolves around saying
things like we should not be taking
loans from IMF you think that that's the
right thing to do there's no general
answer you have to look at the specific
cases if a loan comes from IMF with
conditionalities that require
subordination of the country to foreign
domination then you don't take if a loan
comes from say the World Bank to counter
the growth of AIDS in the country that
can be very helpful then Africa in fact
such loans have virtually eradicated
major AIDS epidemic so fine this is
coming foreign affairs purpose you don't
exactly can't be a general rule of these
things you have to look at each
particular case find out what's the best
way or often what's the least bad way
all the options are negative with some
are worse than others that's world in
which we live it's always been true it's
been true of every
campaign history abolitionist campaigns
example went on for a century okay so
now let's move on towards the other
thing that you're famous for which is
linguistics
so you're known as the founder of the
universal grammar theory or the language
acquisition device a few questions that
I had about that was firstly when you
talk about the language acquisition
device its moved on from there to go
outwards what's known as the language
acquisition support system and could you
draw a difference for us with pursue
what's the difference between the two
and which one do you lie on or rely on
more or leave words for 1082 language
acquisition device and language
acquisition support system what's what
so language acquisition support change
well the language acquisition device I
think the way that it was going about
was that it doesn't necessarily need a
lot of triggers from within society for
language to develop but I think these
are just descriptions of different
things right the language acquisition
device is not you take a look at its
definition right it's it's an abstract
description of what takes place in the
process of language acquisition it
doesn't describe the mechanisms by which
it takes place the person isn't magic
it's it's not a what it says is that
here's what happens in language
acquisition you start with innate a
system which has built-in structure it
gets data fed into it it ends up with a
soup in another state and we can
abstractly study what's the relation
between those two states the initial
state before any data came in the final
state
after the data came in when he get very
interesting results that way we
discovered the nature of the initial
state what had to be in it setting but
[Music]
you have to take a look at the
interactions between the infant and met
people in the environment to what extent
is the motors mother's voice matter to
what extent to peers matter other things
like that but these are just different
topics one is the abstract study of what
has taken place the other is the
investigation of the mechanisms by which
it takes place so there's no choice it's
one they contribute to each other ok so
another question that I have is related
to the development of language in terms
of its evolutionary history so most
people say that language to allow for
effective communication
you've been somebody who's leaned more
towards saying things like that it will
it
for the understanding of inner thought
or for comprehending one's own thoughts
what made you draw that sort of
conclusion or become a minority in the
linguistics in the community for holding
such a view well I can't describe this
in a minute it's there's extensive work
on the nature of language we chose that
the it's just it's basic design is for
expression of thought it can be but need
not be externalized in one or another
sensory modality it's usually speech and
just as well design could even be touch
sound has some advantages but these are
not intrinsic to the nature of language
when
turns out that when you look at it
closely whenever there is a conflict
between the theory of generation of
thought and communicative efficiency
communicative efficiency is always
sacrifice it's not not a driving element
and in fact very design of language
dance two structures that are difficult
for communicating harm communication
that takes something as simple as
ambiguity like flying planes many
dangerous to me neither the fly planes
claims the flawed kind of thing harms
communication could it make theory of
the lane Jim the simplest rules were
expressing thought just gives us results
and there are many such cases so if you
look closely at it turns out that even
externalization to a sensory modalities
and secondary to in language and
communication even more so because it's
based on the externalization and the
belief that language evolves for
communication is just a dogma that comes
from the assumption that we must have
evolved animal communication system but
that's just a religious dogma no reason
to believe that all that we know about
language evolution is that about 200,000
years ago modern humans emerged
different species and we have good
evidence that language was already
implanted in them it wasn't very long
after that the in evolutionary time like
twenty five thousand years human groups
began to separate
and in fact they're scattered in
different parts of the world is no
contact have the same language travel it
must have been there before they
separated so it seems to have come about
along with its modern humans and
anything some and in fact there isn't
any evidence for symbolic behavior
usually the appearance of units so all
the evidence seems virgin saying when
modern humans appeared did precursors
one of the differences that something
changed in their brains which implanted
this system which has properties if
nothing else has let's just
misunderstand
so to last final questions one thing is
that how much of a role has Sigmund
Freud and psychoanalysts in general such
as Jeff Locke are have played in your
understanding of language has there been
any influence from these figures none
whatsoever
when I was your age I was interested in
social analysis always interesting look
more closely looked into it I think
there is nothing there I mean it may be
and apparently is a useful therapeutic
technique I mean I know people who have
gained from working with the
psychoanalyst somebody who was able to
get them to bring out things that were
hidden in the history of their own
thinking so it kind of works that's fine
shaman's work in indigenous cultures
that's fine but when
try to ask was there any theoretical
content you know there's as I say I was
seriously interested in one time thought
it was exciting so on my own view is you
just can't find serious intellectual
substance so there is this one concept
of Freudian slips where you mean to say
one thing but you end up saying another
and the other thing that you say they
say reveals dirt is inner hidden desire
so do you think that holds any weight in
terms of that certainly crude so be your
experience so yes there is there are
things like that and you can look to
them and ask why we did it but I don't
it doesn't seem to me very much I mean
you mentioned inner speech before yeah
but the fact of the matter is when you
study if it's lies speech that we're
just not making noises from but what's
going on internally is very different
from what we call the inner speech and
there's good evidence for what so one
last question which is simply but we
know that you wrote an essay where you
pointed out why you felt that BF
Skinner's approach towards language is
something that you didn't necessarily
agree with and one thing BF Skinner's
you have to you know yeah absolutely
vacuous and you pointed out the poverty
of stimulus as one example as to why you
don't agree with it right so could you
just tell us what that is
how're your stimulus is something recent
you to world trial it's you can
demonstrate that they know a great deal
that they have never experienced I'm you
can see it even with the meaning of a
simple word ask yourself what's the real
meaning with a simple word like tree or
River or so on turns about turns out to
be very complex so children learned that
uh two exposures and tell them anything
about the meaning so it's all junk
there's of course you have to experience
tells you something like I don't speak
who we're doing for example because I
didn't have that experience but it turns
out that the languages say we're doing
English are fundamentally very similar
at the core may be pronounced a couple
things differently you pronounce the
word for tree differently the word order
was a little bit different few things
but at the root when you start looking
at the nature of the language saying and
that fundamental content of language
simply can't be learned by now we have
very detailed careful statistical
studies of the total linguistic input to
it two or three year old child and you
don't even get many cases of two words
in sequence and it's very impoverished
and what is known is that's the
furthermore we're constantly even young
children are constantly creating new
expressions which are part of the length
would you maybe never been used before
certainly nothing than their experience
the idea is that everything is just a
rimmed home biases the ground
when people try to do it the way spinner
did it totally falls apart as you can
see by just looking at the elementary
exam they still believed by many people
it's better so that's not I'm not
expressing it consensus view but since
you asked me my opinion and I think it's
a little questionable
okay well thank you for joining me today
was incidentally also my 21st birthday
so anyway this was kind of like a
birthday present to me so thank you so
much relation yeah
