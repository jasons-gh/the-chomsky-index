it's a privilege to be able to endorse
the launching of the 2012 US occupation
movement it's called the American spring
as with the civil rights struggle and
other genuine popular movements the
American spring provides all of us with
an opportunity to become involved at the
grassroots level and to challenge the
right of the one percent to destroy the
earth foreclose on our homes and
undermine the well-being of the poor and
oppressed today and of future
generations they're counting on our
silence and apathy and we should not
grant them that lethal gift the spring
renewal of the Occupy movement is being
launched at the Environmental Protection
Agency which has a sordid record of
discrimination and retaliation against
whistleblowers and also policies that
harm the poor and communities of color
it's a record that led Congress to pass
the no fear act the events are
extensively documented by Marsha Coleman
adebayo who spearheaded the struggle in
her book no fear over the past months
it's been impressive and heartening to
see how people from all walks of life
have joined the Occupy movement to
engage in the struggle to free the
country from corporate domination the
government repression and its
subordination to private power we should
not stand idly by in the face of this
assault on basic values and rights and
the renewed Occupy movement provides a
framework to resist and to overcome
working in our own communities and
beyond we are the 99 percent we have the
chance to take power back and rescue the
country and the planet from a grim fate
