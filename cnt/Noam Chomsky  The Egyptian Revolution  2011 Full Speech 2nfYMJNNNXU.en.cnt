when we settled on the title of of this
talk a few people that could have
realized how apt it would be when the
time came that is how dramatically the
world would be changing how far-reaching
are the implications for domestic and
world order referring of course to the
democracy democracy uprising in the arab
world it's been quite a spectacular
display of courage dedication and
commitment by popular forces and it
happened to coincide
fortuitously with a remarkable uprising
of tens of thousands of people in
support of working people and democracy
in Madison Wisconsin and a number of
other US cities still continuing one
very telling event took place on
February 20th in the middle of both of
these uprisings Kamal Abbas is one of a
labor leader
one of the major labor leaders in Egypt
sent a message from Tahrir Square to
Wisconsin in the name of the Egyptian
labor organizations it said simply we
stand with you as you stood with us well
as I said Abbas is a leader of the many
years of struggle in Egypt for
elementary rights this uprising on
January 25th didn't come out of nowhere
no there's a significant background
actually the background is worth
thinking about as I'm sure you know the
January 25th uprising was
initiated by a small group of tech savvy
young people who called themselves the
April 6th movement the reason for the
name is that in April 6 2008 there was a
major labor action prepared at the one
of the biggest industrial sites in Egypt
the mahalo textile plant is to be a
strike for better wages decent working
conditions and so on and it was to be in
connection with a large solidarity
actions so all of that was crushed right
away by the dictatorship didn't have any
resonance in the West but remembered
major so that's the April 6th
demonstration non demonstration the name
of the movement that started the January
25th uprising with it's remarkable
consequences Abbas is measure of
solidarity evoked the traditional
aspiration of the labor movements
throughout the world solidarity among
workers of the world and in general
among populations of the world well
however flawed their records may be
labor movements have regularly been in
the forefront of popular struggles for
basic rights and for democracy in
tougher Square and choir cairo in the
streets of Madison and many other places
the popular struggles that are underway
now reach quite directly to the
prospects for authentic democracy that
is for associate associate of political
systems in which people are free and
equal participants in controlling the
institutions in which they live and work
that's contrary to
a standard democratic theory which holds
that people should be spectators not
participants leave the important things
to others right now the trajectories in
the Cairo and Madison are intersecting
but they're headed in opposite
directions
in Cairo they're heading towards gaining
elementary rights that were denied by
the us-backed
British back dictatorships in Madison
they're directed towards defending
rights that have been had been won and
long and hard struggles now under severe
attack and in fact the fundamental right
of collective bargaining has just been
eliminated by the governor and the
legislature in Madison they're sure to
be far reaching the consequences of what
is taking place in the decaying
industrial heartland of the richest most
powerful country in the world in fact in
human history and what is taking place
in what President Eisenhower many years
ago called the most strategically
important area in the world
a stupendous source of strategic power
probably the richest economic prize in
the world in the field of foreign
investment those are the assessments of
the State Department u.s. state
department in the 1940s and of course
that was a prize that the u.s. intended
to keep for itself and for its allies in
the unfolding world over there of that
day well despite all the changes since
there's every reason to suppose that
today's policymakers are still guided by
a judgment that was articulated by one
of President Roosevelt's leading
advisors a burly who observed that
control of the
comparable energies that preserves the
Middle East would yield substantial
control of the world
and correspondingly that loss of control
would threaten the project of global
dominance that was clearly articulated
during World War two that has been
sustained in the face of major changes
in world order since that day and that
is very much alive today you can be
confident that in the major planning
centers of the United States Britain
France other countries with some intent
on global reach they're very much
concerned that loss of control of the
energy reserves of the Middle East will
undermine the prospects for control of
the world and are acting accordingly
you'll have noticed I'm sure that the
closer demonstrations come to the u.s.
British dominated oil-producing centres
the harder that the lower the prospects
for demonstrations yesterday in Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait major centres the
demonstrations were crushed before they
started he'd give some lessons to China
in Saudi or in Riyadh that and not a
single person showed up to frighten and
not no comment from the West checked the
US newspapers this morning no comment
if it had happened in Iran there'd be
major headlines you can be sure but too
much is at stake when you get to the
real centers of power in fact President
Obama has changed the rhetoric the
official rhetoric with regard to the
democracy uprisings as they come close
to significant areas actually he and
other Western leaders
did not did not support the uprisings in
fact the only political leader to
support the uprisings strongly and
immediately was promised the Erdogan of
Turkey was by far the most respected
leader in the area the others waited and
when it was clear that you couldn't
preserve your favorite dictators anymore
they was followed the usual gameplan and
send them out to pasture try to maintain
the regime and they did use words like
regime change at the end but it gets to
Bahrain and Saudi Arabia and Kuwait the
terminology changed officially to regime
alteration so maybe some slight
modification but no change in regime as
I said in Saudi Arabia Kuwait nothing
can't to much of a police presence
Bahrain is particularly significant for
two reasons that one reason it hosts the
u.s. 5th fleet a major military force in
the region the other which is even more
significant is that Bufferin has a it's
a sin a dictatorship but it has a
majority Shiite population and it's
right across the causeway from Saudi
Arabia Eastern Saudi Arabia which is
largely Shiite and where most of the oil
is there's a kind of an accident of
history and geography which has placed
the bulk of the world's energy reserves
at the northern end of the Persian Gulf
region right there which is
overwhelmingly Shiite and there's been a
deep concern and planning sectors for a
long time that there might end up being
some kind of a Shiite Alliance
independent of the West that which would
control most of the world's oil and
that's why demonstrations in Bahrain are
regarded as so sensitive no calls for
regime change they're certainly not
Kuwait from Saudi Arabia
well from the outset of the Second World
War in 1939 Washington anticipated that
the war would end with the United States
in a position of overwhelming power
high-level State Department officials
foreign followed policy specialists met
in a group called the War Peace Studies
Group right through the wartime years to
lay out plans for the post-war world the
core notion was what they called a grand
area that the u.s. was to dominate in
the post-war world that included at a
minimum the entire Western Hemisphere
the entire Far East and the former
British Empire which the US was going to
take over that includes its Middle East
energy resources the British I should
say we're not entirely happy about this
there was actually a kind of a mini war
going on during the Second World War
between the United States and Britain
over who would control Saudi Arabia that
kind of jewel in the crown the u.s. won
the conflict President Roosevelt
declared Saudi Arabia vital for the
defense of democracy and freedom that
allowed it to get lend-lease aid to sort
of push the British aside and make sure
the right people took it over the
British Foreign Office recognized
ruefully that from now on the best they
can hope for is to be junior partners of
that's their phrase
and so it's remained since that's called
a special relationship technically well
that was the plan for the post-war world
in the early years it was assumed then
that Germany would remain as a dominant
European power but as Russia began to
grind down the Nazi armies after
Stalingrad a grand area of planning
changed the goals extended to as much to
include as much of Eurasia as possible
at the very least its economic core in
Western Europe within the grand area and
now quoting the US was to maintain
unquestioned power with military and
economic supremacy that while ensuring
the limitation of any exercise of
sovereignty by States that might
interfere with its global designs the
words are worth remembering they still
apply the these careful wartime plans
were very soon implemented it was always
recognized from from the very beginning
that Europe might choose to follow an
independent course people of doing that
NATO was established in part partially
intended to counter that threat it's
interesting to see what happened as soon
as the official pretext for NATO ended
in 1989 anyone who believed fifty years
of propaganda it would have concluded
okay NATO will disappear it was there to
save Western Europe from the Russian
awards okay no more Russian words no
more NATO and not exactly what happened
rather NATO was expanded immediately was
expanded to the east in violation from
verbal pledges to Gorbachev which he was
naive enough to believe since then it's
been extended even further it's become a
u.s. run a global intervention force
very far-reaching
scope the the scope actually spelled out
by NATO secretary-general yup the Hope
Scheffer who informed the NATO
conference that I'm quoting him and NATO
troops have to guard top pipelines that
transport oil and gas that is directed
for the west and more generally NATO
must protect sea routes used by tankers
and other crucial infrastructure of the
energy system that's everything in other
words
so that's NATO's job grand area has
expanded at least an intention grand
area doctrines clearly licensed military
intervention at will and that conclusion
has been repeatedly expressed was
probably articulated most clearly by the
Clinton administration which declared
I'm quoting it that the US has the right
to use military force unilaterally to
ensure uninhibited access to key markets
energy supplies and strategic resources
and must maintain huge military forces
forward deployed in Europe and Asia in
order to shape people's opinions about
us and to shape events that will affect
our livelihood and our security and
those that goes well beyond the
notorious Bush Doctrine for Clinton it
wasn't even necessary to concoct pretext
for military intervention it's enough
just to say our our security and power
depends on it
Clinton's pronouncements went didn't did
not arouse much comment Bush's led to a
huge protest the reason didn't have to
do with content it had to his style as I
said Clinton's act position actually
went further but the bush presentations
were Eric
dismissive European leaders don't like
to be told to their face as they were
either you do what we say or you're
irrelevant they're perfectly happy to
accept that conclusion but it has to be
said politely and kwitny said it
politely so everyone was happy that's
one of the reasons for Obama's
popularity the same principles that
governed the invasion of Iraq as the
u.s. failure to impose its will in Iraq
that was becoming unmistakable the
initial goals of the invasion the actual
goals that could no longer be concealed
behind pretty rhetoric so the government
began to express them in November 2007
the White House issued what it called a
declaration of principles concerning
Iraq it had two points it demanded that
US forces must remain indefinitely in
Iraq with the right to carry out
military operations and secondly Iraq
must privilege American investors two
months later President Bush sharpened
that he informed Congress that he would
reject any legislation that might limit
the permanent stationing of US armed
forces in Iraq or quoting it or that
would interfere with United States
control over the oil resources of Iraq
those are the war hands forget the
business about democracy promotion the
these were demands incidentally that the
u.s. had to abandon shortly after in the
face of Iraqi resistance so quite an
interesting story in itself in Tunisia
and Egypt the first major centers of the
uprising
and the ones worked so far have been
most successful the current popular
uprising has indeed one impressive
victories but they're limited the
Carnegie Endowment a few days ago two of
its specialists reported that while
names have changed the regimes remain
and they pointed out that a change in
ruling elites and system of governance
is still a different distant goal in
both countries the report goes on to
discuss internal barriers to democracy
for example the role of the Egyptian
military and nominating a large part in
the economy but it doesn't touch the
external barriers which as always are
quite significant the United States and
its Western Allies are sure to do
whatever they can to prevent authentic
democracy in the Arab world to
understand why it's only necessary to
look at the studies of our public
opinion that are conducted by leading us
polling agencies released by prestigious
institutions most recent by the
Brookings Institute in Washington well
these are barely reported in fact in the
u.s. 0no report in England I've been
able to find one report by Jonathan
Steele good commentator but they're not
they're not reported but certainly known
the planners even be certain of that and
what they reveal is that by overwhelming
majorities Arabs regard the United
States and Israel as the major threats
they face in Egypt that 90% of the
population regard the United States as
the major threat the figures for the
general region are scarcely less yes
there are some who regard Iran is a
threat at 10 percent opposition to US
policy is so strong
that a majority believed that security
would be improved if Iran had nuclear
weapons in Egypt that's about 80 percent
other figures are similar so if public
opinion were to influence policy as
would happen in anything that deserves
the name of the democracy the u.s. not
only would not control the region but it
would be expelled from it written as
well that would undermine fundamental
principles of global dominance that in
the case of Britain go back more a
century more than a century in the case
of the United States back to the Second
World War and that's not going to happen
easily so talk about democracy and
that's for ideologists and propagandists
in the real world the elite dislike for
democracy is very strong and it's the
norm that's it's been reluctantly
conceded by the better scholarship that
not just in this case but globally that
the United States supports democracy
insofar as it conforms to strategic and
economic objectives in that case you can
say democracy is fine but not when it
conflicts with it and in this case
there's a massive conflict actually the
general elite contempt for democracy not
just planners but the whole educated
culture that was revealed very
dramatically in the reaction to the
WikiLeaks exposures the ones that
received the most attention big
headlines and so on euphoric commentary
were the cables reporting Arab support
for the u.s. stand on it
the reference of course was to the
ruling dictators the attitudes of the
public were unmentioned because they're
insignificant in the power of
intellectual culture the there's a
guiding principle that was stated pretty
clearly by Carnegie Endowment Middle
East specialist Marwan washer is
formerly a high official of the
Jordanian dictatorship the principle is
there is nothing wrong everything's
under control
in short if the dictator support us what
else could matter the dictator support
us populations passive quiet beaten down
not making any noise everything's fine
that's our conception of democracy
actually domestically as well I should
say this wash our doctrine is its
rationale and its venerable let me just
mention one case that's highly relevant
today and ought to be kind of headlines
of the Free Press we're functioning this
is 1958 internal discussion in the
United States since Declassified
President Eisenhower expressed concern
about what he called the campaign of
hatred against us in the Arab world and
not by governments there okay but by the
people the highest planning body in the
US the National Security Council issued
a memorandum in which they explained
what it's all about they explained that
there's a perception in the Arab world
that the United States supports
dictatorships and blocks democracy and
development and that we do that so as to
ensure control over their energy
resources furthermore the NSC went on
the perceptions accurate and furthermore
it's what we should be doing they're
relying on the washer doctrine
long as the people are subdued quiet
repressed that dictator support us
everything's flying
now that's 1958 now there were Pentagon
studies conducted after 9/11 reached
very much the same conclusion and the
same holds today and furthermore that's
the understanding in the educated
culture in the West as you can see for
example from the reaction to the
WikiLeaks doctrines revelations and even
from the lack of reporting of our public
opinion I don't know about the Dutch
press you can tell me but in the press
that I've looked at it's not even
mentioned because who cares what Arabs
think as long as the dictator supportive
of course if they raise their heads we
have to do some things but not much
well it's quite normal for the victors
to consign history to the trash can
old-fashioned stuff of no interest but
the victims tend to take it pretty
seriously
for obvious reasons so let me make a
couple of few remarks on this topic it's
quite an important topic but a couple of
comments may be useful in this
connection actually today is not the
first time that Egypt and the United
States are facing similar problems and
moving in opposite directions that was
also true in the early 19th century
economic historians have pointed out
that in say around 1830 Egypt was quite
well placed to undertake rapid economic
development at the same time the US was
there were more or less in the same
situation that both Egypt in the United
States had rich agriculture that
included cotton which was the fuel of
the industrial early industrial
revolution kind of the oil of the time
of course there was a difference unlike
Egypt the United States had to develop
cotton production and a workforce by
conquest extermination and slavery
consequences still remain one
fundamental difference between Egypt and
the United States in fact the
determining one was that the United
States had gained independence and Egypt
had not therefore the United States was
free to ignore the prescriptions of
economic theory they were delivered in
the late night 18th century by Adam
Smith into the United States shortly
after its independence using terms that
are quite familiar in fact they're
pretty much the same as the ones that
are preached to the so-called developing
societies by the World Bank and the IMF
and economic good specialists today
Smith urged the liberated colonies to
keep what keeps of what was later called
their comparative advantage to produce
primary products for export and to
import the superior British
manufacturers and certainly not to
attempt to monopolize the crucial goods
particularly cotton the most important
any other path he wrote would would
retard instead of accelerating the
further increase in the value of their
annual produce and would obstruct
instead of promoting the progress of
their country toward real wealth and
greatness if any of you have studied
economics you know that that's the right
conclusion it's the same conclusion
that's given to the South the third
world today well having gained their
independence the colonies were free to
ignore his advice to ignore what's
called sound economic theory and to
follow England's own course of
independent state guided development
ethically rejected sound economic theory
ways that are to be understood here for
example with England was stealing high
technology from the Low Countries and
from Ireland and using state force to
create a powerful economy so the u.s.
followed the same course it set up high
tariffs to block British exports first
textiles later steel carried out
initiated ulcers of other devices to
accelerate Industrial Development and
the now independent Republic also
attempted to gain a monopoly of cotton
came pretty close the reasons were
stated explicitly the reasons were to
place all other nations at our feet
particularly the British enemy which was
militarily more powerful in those days
but could be brought to the feet of the
United States if the US had monopolized
the cotton which is crucial for their
early industrial development
those were the Jacksonian presidents
their announcement when they conquered
Texas and half of Mexico but notice that
the US policies in the mid nineteenth
century were essentially those that were
attributed to Saddam Hussein there were
wild claims that he was trying to
control the energy resources of the
Middle East and bring the rest of the
world to his feet well that was a
fantasy but it wasn't a fantasy when the
u.s. carried out those policies in the
mid 19th century that's one of the ways
it became the most powerful richest
country in history well for Egypt
there wasn't any comparable course
because it was barred by British power
Lord Palmerston declared that no ideas
of fairness toward Egypt ought to stand
in the way of such great and paramount
interests of Britain as preserving its
economic and political hegemony that he
expressed what he called his hate for
the ignorant
arian muhammad ali developmental leader
of egypt who dared to seek an
independent course he deployed britain's
fleet major military force of the 19th
century and british financial power was
also overwhelming that to terminate each
with Egypt's quest for independence and
economic development and so it continued
after World War two when the United
States displaced Britain as global
hegemon Washington adopted the same
stand Washington made it clear to the
Egyptians that it would provide no aid
unless Egypt adhered to the standard
rules of the rules for the week that is
meanwhile the u.s. continued to violate
them for example by imposing high
tariffs on Egyptian at the bar Egyptian
cotton now that's the usual
interpretation of market principles
they're fine for the weak but not for
the strong at home as well that's why
maybe a quarter of the US population and
is now qualifying for food stamps and
while the bankers are providing
themselves with enormous bonuses those
are market principles in Adam Smith's
defense I should say that he recognized
what would happen if Britain had
followed the rules of sound economics
and now it's called neoliberalism it's
not very different he warned that if
British manufacturers merchants and
investors turned abroad they might
profit but England would suffer but he
felt that that wouldn't happen because
they would be guided by what's called a
home bias so as if by an invisible hand
England would be spared the ravages of
economic rationality actually that
passage and wealth of nations is pretty
hard to miss it's the only time that the
phrase invisible hand appears in the
book the namely in an argument against
what we now call neoliberalism that's
the one occurrence of the famous phrase
the other leading founder of classical
economics David Ricardo he drew similar
conclusions he hoped that the poem bias
quote him now would lead men of property
to be satisfied with the low rate of
profits in their own country that rather
than to seek the more advantageous
employment for their wealth in foreign
nations the feelings he said that I
would saw be sorry to see weakened put
aside their predictions but the
instincts of the classical economists
were sound and significant than that
confirmed conformed to economic history
the the democracy uprising in the Arab
world is sometimes compared to Eastern
Europe in 1989 but on very dubious
grounds in 80 1989 the democracy
uprising was tolerated by the Russians
and of course it was supported by
Western power or in accord with the
standard doctorate doctrine that
democracy is okay if it conforms to
strategic and economic objectives so
it's fine in Eastern Europe where it's
breaking up the global enemy but not in
Central America at the same time whereas
being crushed by violence there's no
Gorbachev in the West today
on the contrary Western
Western power remains very hostile to
democracy in the Arab world for quite
good reasons as I mentioned there are
actually more apt comparisons between
what's happening today and developments
in the past but to talk about them later
if you like
but there's I'll put them aside now for
reasons of time well coming to the
present a grand area doctrines pretty
much in the way they were expressed back
in the Second World War they continued
to apply to contemporary crises and
confrontations so it take what's called
in in western policymaking circles and
in political commentary it's taken for
granted that the major threat to world
order today is what's called the Iranian
threat in fact this is called the year
of Iran and therefore it has to be the
major focus of u.s. foreign policy with
Europe trailing alone lightly as it
tends to do so we might ask ourselves
exactly what is the Iranian threat in
fact you might look and see how often
it's discussed and it's also always
worked up but exactly what is it what's
the Iranian threat well we actually have
an authoritative answer to that question
it was provided by the Pentagon and by
US intelligence services every year they
give an annual report to Congress on
global security the most recent one
couple months ago they of course had a
section on the Iranian threat and what
they say is that the Iranian threat is
not military quote unquote Iran's
military spending is relatively low
compared to the rest of the region its
military doctrine is strictly defensive
designed to slow an invasion
and force an invasion of iran and to
force a diplomatic solution to
hostilities the iran has only a limited
capability to project force beyond its
borders its military spending as a
fraction of saudi arabia of course in
comparably less than the United States
or its allies and according to General
Petraeus head of the US Central Command
the Iranian Air Force could be taken out
almost instantly by the air force of
Qatar forget the rest so that's the
military threat with regard to the
nuclear option
they say Pentagon intelligence Iran's
nuclear program and its willingness to
keep open the possibility of developing
nuclear weapons is a central part of its
deterrent strategy okay those are all
quotes the clerical regime brutal
clerical regime it's doubtless a threat
to its own people but it hardly outranks
US allies in that regard that can't be
the problem the threat flies elsewhere
and it's ominous and the reports say yes
it's ominous that one element of the
threat is Iran's potential the deterrent
capacity that's an illegitimate exercise
of sovereignty that might interfere with
us freedom of action in the region it's
glaringly obvious why Iran would seek a
deterrent capacity and just take a look
at the disposition of military bases and
nuclear forces in the region then
actually that's been recognized seven
years ago Israel one of the leading
military historians in Israel Barton
from Fairfield the rook that was right
after the invasion of Iraq the world has
witnessed how the United States attacked
Iraq and fir as it turned out no reason
at all had the Iranians not
tried to build nuclear weapons they
would be crazy his words
particularly when they're under constant
threat of attack by the US that
incidentally in violation of the UN
Charter anyone cares about minor
technicalities whether they are
developing nuclear weapons actually no
one knows but maybe they are if so it
certainly be understandable as long as
they're under constant threat
however Iran's threat the reports
continue pentagon intelligence they go
beyond deterrence Iran is also trying to
expand its influence in neighboring
countries the Pentagon and the
intelligence services report that is
they're trying to destabilize the region
it's an interesting term actually those
are the technical terms of foreign
policy discourse notice when the u.s.
invades and occupies Iran's neighbors
that's stabilization Iran's efforts to
extend its influence to them is
destabilization hence the illegitimate
that's routine usage just to give one
striking example very prominent foreign
policy analyst James Chase he was
properly using the term stability in the
technical sense that when he explained
quoting him that to achieve stability in
Chile in 1973 it was necessary to
destabilize the country namely by
overthrowing the elected government and
installing a vicious dictatorship that's
the right usage other concerns about
Iran are equally interesting to explore
but perhaps that's enough to reveal the
guiding principles
and their status and imperial culture as
to get and go back to grand area
planning President Roosevelt's planners
emphasized that the dawn of the
contemporary world system that the u.s.
cannot tolerate any exercise of
sovereignty that interferes with its
global designs that's what it means to
own the world and to rule it the United
States and Europe are united in
punishing Iran for its threat to
stability but it's useful to recall how
isolated they are they're referred to as
the international community but remember
that has a technical meaning to the
international community means the United
States by definition and anyone who had
to agree with it at the moment
that's the international community
everyone else is kind of like Arabs and
their opinion so what about the non
people will the unaligned countries
non-aligned countries that's jority the
world's population they have vigorously
supported Iran's right to enrich uranium
all the way through within the region
that I mentioned Arab public opinion
that not only supports the right to
carry out uranium enrichment but quite
strongly favors irani and nuclear
weapons the major regional power Turkey
voted against the latest us initiated
sanctions motion in the Security Council
along with Brazil which is the most
admired country of the south in fact
Europe and the United States are
extremely isolated on this they are the
international community by definition
but by other standards they're very
isolated the disobedience of Turkey in
Brazil led this sharp century not for
the first time Turkey had been bitterly
condemned
in 2003 when the government followed the
will of 95% of the population and
refused to participate in the invasion
of Iraq that demonstrated their very
weak grasp of democracy in the Western
sense and they were punished by the u.s.
for that and very hostile commentary the
same after their refusal to support the
US sanctions proposal in 2010 that
turkey was warned by Obama's top
diplomat on European affairs that it
must demonstrate its commitment to
partnership with the West scholar and
the Council on Foreign Relations asked
how do we keep the Turks in their Lane
where they're supposed to be acting like
the Democrats and following orders
Brazil's president Lula he was
admonished in a New York Times headline
that his effort to with Turkey to
provide a solution to the Iranian
uranium uranium enrichment issue outside
the framework of u.s. power is what they
called a spot on the Brazilian leaders
legacy in brief do what we say or else
but there's an interesting sidelight to
all of this which was effectively
suppressed that is that the Iran the the
Iran Turkey Brazil deal was approved in
advance by the Obama administration
presumably on the assumption that it
would fail that would provide an
ideological weapon against Iran actually
after the censure of Brazil its foreign
office released a letter from President
Obama in which he'd Raziel to proceed
with it hoping that it would suspect him
that it would fail well when it's
exceeded the approval turn to censure
and Washington rammed through a Security
Council resolution
which is in fact so weak that china
readily signed and china incidentally is
now chastised for living up to the UN
resolution that it's signed but not
living up to Washington's unilateral the
directives which go well beyond it it's
in the current issue of foreign policy
Foreign Affairs major foreign policy
Journal
well the US can sort of tolerate Turkish
disobedience though with some dismay but
China's harder to ignore though the
press warns that China's investors and
traders are now filling a vacuum in Iran
as businesses from many other nations
particularly in Europe that pull out and
in particular China is expanding its
dominant role in Iran's energy
industries
Washington is reacting to this with a
touch of desperation the State
Department warned China that if it wants
to be accepted in the international
community which has the definition I
mentioned that it wants to be accepted
in the international community then it
must not skirt and evade international
responsibilities which are clear follow
us orders I'm sure that elicited some
amusement in China's Foreign Office's
they're unlikely to be impressed there's
also a good deal of concern about the
growing Chinese military threat the
Pentagon study came out recently and it
warned that China's military budget is
approaching one-fifth of what the
Pentagon spent to operate the wars in
Iraq and Afghanistan of course a
fraction of the US military budget they
weren't further that China's expansion
of military forces might deny the
ability of American warships to operate
in international
waters off its coast that's off the
coast of China nobody yet has declared
that the US should permit Chinese
warships to operate freely and say the
Caribbean but gotta understand why
China's lack of understanding of the
rules of international civility
it was also illustrated by its
objections to plans u.s. plans to send
an advanced super aircraft carrier a
nuclear-powered aircraft carrier in the
George Washington to join naval
exercises a few miles off
China's coast the with capacity to
attack Beijing with nuclear weapons in
contrast the United States the West
generally understands that such US
operations are legitimate they're
intended to develop to defend stability
in the technical sense in the US again
the liberal magazine New Republic
expressed its concern that China sent
ten warships through international
waters just off the Japanese island of
Okinawa which is indeed a provocation
unlike the fact that they didn't mention
that Washington has converted okinawa
into a major US military base in
defiance of vehement protests by the
population which still continued that's
not a provocation on the standard
principle that we own the world talk
about the aprotic ation well putting
aside the deep-seated Imperial doctrine
which is so so deep-seated that people
can't receive it even progressives and
so on you just can't see it but let's
put that aside there is good reason for
China's neighbors to be concerned about
its growing military and commercial
power
and going back to the Middle East
although Arab opinion strongly supports
an Iranian nuclear weapons program that
doesn't mean that we should we certainly
shouldn't and the foreign policy
literature is full of proposals as to
how to counter the threat there is an
obvious way which is never discussed the
that is to establish a nuclear weapons
free zone in the region or at least move
in that direction that would do a lot to
mitigate maybe end whatever threat there
is well that issue does arise outside
the West it arose again at the
non-proliferation treaty review
conference last May's meeting every five
years Egypt which is the was the chair
of the non-aligned countries 118
countries it called for negotiations on
a Middle East nuclear weapons free zone
actually that had already been agreed to
by the West at the 1995 review
conference but they never did anything
about it international support for this
was so strong that President Obama had
to formally agree so it's fine idea
Washington informed the conference but
this isn't the right time for it so some
day when the Messiah comes furthermore I
noticed my environment
furthermore the the United States made
it clear that Israel must be exempted
from the nuclear weapons-free zone so
the Obama administration explained that
no proposal can call for Israel's
nuclear weapons-free program to be
placed under the auspices of the
International Atomic Energy Agency or
Cantwell for release of information
about Israeli nuclear facilities and
activities that's out otherwise it's a
great idea
some day well so much for that method of
dealing with the Iranian nuclear threat
well grand area doctrine still prevent
prevails as in these cases the capacity
to implement it has declined the peak of
u.s. power was right after World War two
at that point the u.s. literally had
half the world's wealth and position of
unimaginable security and military power
well that naturally declined other
industrial countries reconstructed from
the devastation of the war
decolonization took its agonizing course
and by the early 1970s the US share of
global wealth had declined to about 25
percent still enormous but not 50
percent by that time early 70s the
industrial world had become what's
called tri-polar
economically North America Europe and
East Asia which at that time was Japan
based there was also a sharp change in
the US economy in the 1970s Europe as
well but particularly striking in the us
towards financialization of the economy
and export of production there's no time
to go into the details but they're
interesting and important
what really happened is that a variety
of factors converged to create a vicious
cycle of radical concentration of wealth
in the US that's by now literally in a
fraction of 1% of the population that's
what's causing the huge inequality that
means mostly CEOs managers hedge fund
managers people like that
well concentration of economic power
leads almost automatically to
concentration of political power that
yields the capacity to formulate state
policies that increase the economic
concentration means fiscal policies like
taxation rules of corporate governance
deregulation much else so you do get a
vicious cycle sharp concentration of
power in the economy and the political
system and continuing because they
reinforce each other
meanwhile the costs of electoral
campaigns skyrocketed the next campaign
2012 is anticipated to cost them two
billion dollars in the United States
that drives the political parties into
the pockets of concentrated capital
which is increasingly financial capital
the Republicans reflexive the Democrats
who are by now what used to be called
moderate Republicans they're not far
behind
in fact elections have become lost in
total charade take the 2008 election
which Obama won as you may know shortly
after the election he won a second
victory he won an award from the
advertising industry for the best
marketing campaign of 2008 executives
were you for in the business press they
explained that they'd been marketing
candidate
like the toothpaste ever since Reagan
but this was their greatest achievement
that would change the style and
corporate boardrooms and so on
well 2012 election is gonna be more
extreme so it's not surprising that
Obama is now selecting business leaders
for his top positions that's where the
money is
hence the political power the public is
quite angry and frustrated but as long
as the washer principle prevails that
doesn't matter
in our conception of democracy well
wealth and power have narrowly
concentrated in the past roughly 30
years but for the general population
that real incomes have stagnated their
working hours of going sky-high support
systems of decline people have been
getting by more or less but it's with
increased work hours far beyond Europe
right now with debt and with asset
inflation which is regularly destroyed
by the financial crisis that began as
soon as the regulatory apparatus left by
the New Deal was dismantled
there weren't any financial crises in
the fifties and sixties and seventies
there were several during the Reagan
years they've been getting worse ever
since most recently the huge crash that
we're still in the middle of basically
well none of this is problematic for the
very wealthy because they benefit from a
government insurance policy
it's called too big to fail that which
is an insurance policy what it means is
that the banks and the investment firms
and on Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Chase
their equivalents in the Europe they can
make very risky transactions the risky
transactions you rich rewards and when
the system crashes it's inevitably going
do they can run to the nanny state for a
taxpayer bailout you know clutching
their copies of Hayek and Milton
Friedman and so on that's been a regular
process since the Reagan years each
price is more extreme than the last for
the population that is so right now in
the United States
unemployment is literally at the level
of the Great Depression for much of the
population that meanwhile Goldman Sachs
one of the main architects of the
current crisis is richer than ever it
just quietly announced seventeen and a
half billion dollars in compensation for
last year the CEO Lloyd Blankfein gets a
twelve and a half million dollar bonus
and his base salary more than triple its
just in England for the last couple of
days and front page of the newspaper
every morning is the same story with
Barclays Bank and the rest of them you
know that's great that's what happens
when the government insurance policy
well obviously it wouldn't do to focus
attention on things like this so
propaganda has to find ways to blame
others in the past few months in the
United States it's been to blame public
sector workers and their fat salaries
exorbitant pensions and so on all total
fantasy but kind of more or less works
if you repeat it often enough so the
idea is we all must tighten our belts
whether it's the United States United
Kingdom Europe everyone else that almost
all that is like not the managers of
Goldman Sachs or Barclays banks they
have to loosen their bills
well teachers are particularly good
target in the United States that's part
of a very deliberate effort to destroy
the public education system
it's happening here too from
kindergarten through the universities
by eventual privatization again that's
good for the wealthy it's a disaster for
the population it's also a disaster even
for the long-term health of the economy
but that's what economists call an
externality or something that you put
aside when you're making business
decisions it doesn't affect your
short-term profit
so it's an externality you can put it
aside insofar as market principles
prevail another fine target that always
is immigrants that's been true
throughout US history even more so at
times of economic crisis and it's
exacerbated now by a sense in the United
States which has its counterparts fears
that the countries being taken away from
us in the United States the white
population is soon gonna become a
minority that's what the House
Republican leader John Boehner means
when he says it's not the country that I
was I grew up in they're taking it away
from us well who were the immigrants who
were targeted I happen to live in
eastern Massachusetts many of the
immigrants there are Mayans and her
cleaned genocide in the Guatemalan
Highlands that was carried out by Ronald
Reagan and his favorite killers the
devastation still exists people are
fleeing other immigrants are Mexican
victims of Clinton's NAFTA north
american free trade agreement that was
one of those rare government agreements
that succeeded in harming the
populations of all three countries
involved not the rich they did fine
Carlos Slim of Mexico is now the richest
man in the world he just added another
twenty billion dollars to his wealth
last year partly an aftereffect but not
the populations this was understood
1994 was the year that NAFTA
was rammed through Congress over popular
objection and it's the same year that
Clinton initiated militarization of the
border of Mexico and the United States
it had been a pretty open border you
know pretty much the same people on both
sides of people visiting their relatives
and so on
the Porter was militarized in 1994 and
the reason was understood it was
understood that Mexican casinos are not
going to be able to compete with highly
subsidized US agribusiness and that
Mexican businesses are not going to be
able to compete with the US
multinationals they have to be granted
what's called national treatment in
Mexico so they have to be treated like
Mexican companies that's quite unlike
the Mexican creatures of flesh and blood
they don't get national treatment in the
United States needless to say these are
corporate persons so-called to get those
privileges well not surprisingly those
measures led to a have been lead into a
flood of refugees and to rising and
Egret the immigrant hysteria by the
victims of state corporate policies at
home and much the same appears to be
happening in Europe
I've always felt and I think it's now
becoming clear that racism is more
rampant in Europe than it is in the
United States in many ways wasn't so
evident because the societies kind of
looked homogeneous
I mean if everyone is blonde and
blue-eyed you can say yeah I'm not a
racist but when you get a couple of
percent of people who aren't all of a
sudden that comes out so right now for
example one can only watch it and wonder
as say Italy complains about the flow of
refugees from Libya Libya in fact
eastern Libya the now liberated East
that was the scene of the first major
post-world War one genocide
literal genocide carried out by Italy's
fascist government now they're
complaining about refugees from Libya or
when France for example which is now the
main protector of the brutal
dictatorships and its former colonies
France manages to overlook its hideous
atrocities in Africa
well Sarkozy warms of warns of what he
calls the flood of immigrants and marine
lepen kind of the Oh fascist party which
happens a majority party in France no
she objects that he's doing nothing to
prevent this flood of immigrants well I
don't have to mention Belgium which
probably wins the prize for what Adam
Smith called the savage injustice of the
Europeans the rise of neo-fascist
parties in much of Europe that would be
a frightening phenomenon even if we were
not to recall what happened on the
continent in the very recent past so
just imagine the reaction today say if
Jews were being expelled from France to
misery and oppression and then take a
look at the non reaction when that's
happening in France to Roma who were
victims of the Holocaust and Europe's
most brutalized population in Hungary
the Neo fascist party of Jobbik gained
70 percent of the vote in national
elections now the dominant party which
is maybe unsurprising when
three-quarters of the population feel
that they're worse off than under
communist rule you might be relieved
when in Austria the ultra-right haider
party that won only 10 percent of the
vote in 2008 you might be relieved if it
were not for the fact that he was that
they were outflanked from the right far
right by the freedom party which went on
/ it was 20% that's 30% for essentially
neo-fascist parties pretty chilling to
recall that in 1928 the Nazis won less
than three percent of the vote from
Germany we know what happened a few
years later in England the British
National Party and the English Defence
League on the ultra racist right are
becoming major forces what's happening
in Holland you know all too well I won't
talk about it
in Germany see the Saracens lament that
immigrants are destroying Germany was a
runaway bestseller he was dismissed and
the Chancellor Chancellor Merkel
condemned the book but she declared that
multiculturalism had utterly failed the
meaning that the Turks who were brought
in to do the dirty work in Germany are
failing to become blond and blue-eyed
the true Aryans you know something wrong
with them
instantly those who have a slight sense
of irony
it might be interested in recalling that
Benjamin Franklin who was you know one
of the leading figures the Enlightenment
he warned the newly liberated colonies
that they should exclude Germans because
Germans are too swarthy swedes as well
incidentally also too swarthy not pure
anglo-saxons like us
well well into the 20th century
ludicrous myths of anglo-saxon purity
were very common in the United States
that includes
presidents you know people like Thomas
Jefferson oh we have to Theodore
Roosevelt and others other leading
figures leading writers and so on racism
in the literary culture has been not
just and I'm saying
of course it's far worse and practice
it's gonna be a lot easier to eradicate
polio than this horrifying plague which
regularly becomes more virulent and at
times of economic crisis so we can
expect it to grow because the crises are
going to very likely gonna get worse
European economic policies almost
driving the continent into permanent
crisis
well I've barely skimmed the surface of
these issues but I don't want to end
without a couple of words on another
externality
that's dismissed in market systems for
institutional regions the fate of the
species in the financial system what's
called systemic risk the probability
that your transaction that you make
which is good for you may crash the
system which happens all the time
well systemic risk can be remedied
namely by the taxpayer calling the
taxpayer to build out the rich but
nobody's going to come to the rescue if
the environment is destroyed and that it
must be destroyed is virtually an
institutional imperative it's important
to keep that in mind the business
leaders and business leaders are
carrying out major propaganda campaigns
which they announce to convince the
population that anthropogenic global
warming global warming caused by human
activity is liberal hoax now those same
business leaders understand very well
how grave the threat is to what they own
for the grandchildren and so on but it
doesn't matter in their institutional
role as business leaders they must
maximize short-term profit and market
share and not because they're bad people
but because that's an institutional
necessity if they don't do it they're
out somebody else is in who does do it
that's a another vicious cycle and this
one could turn out to be really lethal
for the species
just to take a look at how a grave the
danger is today just take a look at the
new Congress in the United States most
powerful and important country in the
world has propelled to power by business
funding propaganda anti-immigrant
hysteria and nativist extremism and so
on but it's there that almost all of
them are climate deniers in fact they've
already begun to cut funding for
measures that might mitigate
environmental catastrophe cut it very
sharply worse than that some of them are
really true believers so for example the
new head of a Subcommittee on the
environment explained that global
warming can't be a problem because God
promised Noah that there wouldn't be
another flood well you know if things
like then he speaks for a lot of the
country as this were happening and you
know some small and remote country
somewhere you know might might laugh but
you can't laugh in this case it's the
richest most powerful country in the
world that what happens there is going
to determine what happens globally and
this is what's happening and before we
laugh we might also bear in mind that
the current economic crisis is traceable
in no small measure to another fanatic
religious faith the faith in such dogmas
as the efficient market hypothesis core
dogma of economic theory and in general
to what Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz
fifteen years ago long before the crisis
called the religion that markets know
best no basis for it in empirical fact
artifact of economic religion and so on
but given the dogma that markets are
necessarily efficient it was possible
for the central bank the Federal Reserve
and for virtually the entire economics
profession it was possible with them not
to notice
that there was an 8 trillion dollar
housing bubble that had no basis
whatsoever in economic fundamentals and
Brooke from a hundred-year record of
housing prices pretty much conforming to
the general value in the economy
but you couldn't see it because because
you have a religious doctrine the
markets are efficient so I'll take care
for care of it and of course devastated
the economy and brought down a lot of
Europe when the went first Europe had
similar phenomenon well all of this and
a lot more can proceed as long as the
washer doctrine prevails as long as the
general population is passive apathetic
diverted to consumerism or hatred of the
vulnerable then the powerful Hindu as
they please
and those who survive can contemplate
the outcome
