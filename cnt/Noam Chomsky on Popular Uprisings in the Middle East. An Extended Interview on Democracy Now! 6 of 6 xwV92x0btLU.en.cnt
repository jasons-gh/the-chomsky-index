known finally as we wrap up I've asked
you a lot about what this means for the
Middle East this rolling revolution from
Tunisia to Egypt what we're seeing in
Jordan and Yemen and beyond but what
about what these mass protests mean for
people in the United States I think they
mean a lot and I've been trying to hint
about that as a doctrine that everything
is fine as long as the population is
quiet that applies in the Middle East
was in Central America it applies in the
United States for the last 30 years we
have had state corporate policies
specifically designed specifically
designed not accidentally to enrich and
empower a tiny sector of the population
1% in fact one tenth of one percent
that's the basic source of the extreme
inequality tax policies from rules of
corporate governance whole massive
policies have been very explicitly
designed to achieve this in the
regulation and so on well for most of
the population that's meant pretty much
stagnation over a long period now people
have been getting by by sharply
increasing the number of work hours far
beyond Europe by debt by asset inflation
like the recent housing bubble but those
things can't last and the as soon as
Obama came into office he came in in the
midst of the worst crisis since the
depression in fact Ben Bernanke we know
from recent testimony that was released
they had said was even worse than the
banking crisis in 1929 so there was a
real crisis a who did he pick to patch
up the crisis the people who created the
Robert rugen gang Larry Summers Timothy
Geithner basically the people who were
responsible for the policies that led to
the crisis and it's not surprising I
mean his Obama's primary constituency
was financial institutions they were the
core of the funding for his campaign
they expect to be paid back and they
were they were paid back by coming out
richer and more powerful than they were
before the crisis that they created
meanwhile the population much of the
population is literally in depression if
you look at the unemployment figures the
among the you know top few percent this
is maybe ten twenty percent unemployment
is not particularly high tax rather low
when you go down to the bottom of the
income ladder you know the lower
quintiles unemployment is it depression
levels on manufacturing industry it is
at the depression levels and it's
different from the depression in the
depression which I'm old enough to
remember other was it was very severe
amount families mostly unemployed
working class but there was a sense of
hopefulness something is what we can do
something there's CIO organizing there's
sit-down strikes to compel the New Deal
measures which were helpful and hopeful
and there was a sense that somehow we'll
get out of this we're in it together or
we can work together we can get out of
it that's not true now that now there's
an a general atmosphere of hopelessness
despair anger and deep at rationality
that's a very dangerous mix hatred of
foreigners in all
a mix of attitudes which is volatile and
dangerous quite different from the mood
and depression and but the same
governing principle applies as long as
the population is accepts what's going
on is directing their anger against
teachers I you know firemen and
policemen pensions and so on as long as
they're directing their anger there and
not against us the rulers everything's
under control everything's fine until it
erupts well it hasn't erupted here yet
and if it does erupt it might not be in
a constructive direction given the
nature of what's happening in the
country now but yes those Egyptian
lessons should be taken to heart we can
see clearly what people can do under
conditions of serious duress and
repression far beyond anything that we
face but they're doing it if we don't do
it the outcome could be quite ugly noam
