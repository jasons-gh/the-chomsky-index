there's a couple of things wrong with
the concept of American exceptionalism
the one is the facts you know yeah okay
yeah the other is it's not American yeah
every great power has had the same
exceptionalism Britain and when it was
virtually genocide all over the world
was praising itself on its magnificent
sure I mean this crown all had the
civilized mission well the French
Minister of War was calling on the army
to exterminate the population of Algeria
if we had records from the Atilla the
Hun he would probably be just
overwhelmed with good the fact that
every country's thought that they've
been the unique source of goodness and
yeah because of there's nothing
exceptional about an exceptional well
but since it isn't exceptional what
about is diversity giving examples are
our other countries I mean other
countries are trying to assumedly impede
American economic progress and what's
the response here how can they impede
American economic well well I guess
though I mean let me let me just let me
give you I'm not an economist my
ignorance is gonna show here but I'm
assuming you should know better than to
judge some specialists but I mean it's
to some extent China can impede American
progress by being able to produce the
same goods and services much more
cheaply but maybe that was producing
them in China US corporations who want a
funk my work in China where if US
corporations don't like Chinese rules
they can invest somewhere else
anyway but there's an article in today's
New York Times that said exactly that
right it was the response to some of the
pressure and Trump one might say I don't
know if you saw this article but it was
basically saying there's some impact to
what's going on and some companies are
stopping having made things in China but
what they're doing is not bringing back
the United States are just finding
another place to do it yeah which is
that but but the idea that it's unfair
for China to impose technology transfer
restrictions or partial ownership
restrictions on say Boeing is it's not a
question of national policy if Boeing
doesn't like that nobody's forcing them
to invest there
yeah okay so what right do we have to
punish them for trying to do that well
quite apart from the fact that the whole
is that's how we develop our England
develop how everybody developed
