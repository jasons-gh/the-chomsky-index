so tonight let us imagine what should be
the next steps in the process of
achieving peace in the Middle East for
your knowledge a coin toss conducted by
the Harvard speech and parliamentary
debate Society has determined that
professor Dershowitz will speak first
for 10 minutes after that we will go to
directly to Professor Chomsky and then
the floor will be open professor
Dershowitz it's a great honor for me to
be participating in a debate with a man
who has been called the world's top
public intellectual my connections to
Noam Chomsky go back a long time in the
1940s I was a camper and he a counselor
in a Hebrew speaking Zionist camp and
the Pocono Mountains called Capra Mossad
in the 1960s we both worked against the
Vietnam War in the 1970s we had the
first of our many debates about the
arab-israeli conflict I advocated ending
the Israeli occupation in exchange for
peace and recognition of Israel he
advocated a one-state solution modeled
on Lebanon and Yugoslavia we debated
again in the 1980s in the 1990s
I have the text I hope that our
once-a-decade encounter will continue
for many decades to come though I doubt
we will agree with each other the debate
today occurs at a time of real potential
for peace Shimon Peres Israel's elder
statesman in the peace camp today quit
the Labour Party and announced his
support for Ariel Sharon in the upcoming
election quote in my eyes it is not a
problem of parties but a problem of
peace how to create a strong Coalition
for peace
the elements are now in place for a real
peace as I wrote in the case for peace
when the Palestinian leadership wants a
Palestinian state more than it wants to
see the destruction of Israel that will
finally be a two-state solution the
untimely death of Yasser Arafat makes
the two-state solution a real
possibility I call our thoughts death
untimely because if it had occurred five
years earlier we might now be
celebrating the anniversary of
Palestinian statehood our Fonts decision
to turn down the Clinton Barack plan for
Palestinian statehood was characterized
by prince bandar of saudi arabia as
quote a crime against the palestinians
in fact against the entire region the
crime and the death that it needlessly
caused can never be undone but this is
the time to move forward and to assure
that the crime is not repeated the time
has come for compromise my friend Amos
oz the great novelist and leader of the
Israeli peace movement has said there
are two possible resolutions to a
conflict of this kind the Shakespearean
and the Chekhovian
in a Shakespeare drama every right is
wrong every act is revenged every
injustice is made right and perfect
justice is prevail prevails but at the
end of the play everybody lies dead on
the stage and a Chekhov play everybody's
disillusioned embittered heartbroken are
disappointed but they remain alive we
need to check off in resolution for the
arab-israeli tragedy this will require
the elevation of pragmatism
over ideology it will require that both
sides give up rights rights giving up
rights is a hard thing to do it will
require that each side recognizes and
acknowledges the pain and the suffering
of the other and it will require an end
to the hateful attitudes and speech that
some on each side direct against the
other sometimes it's better to start at
the end the ultimate solution is not as
much in dispute these days as is the
means for getting there I believe that
even professor Chomsky and I have the
same basic agreement about a number of
very important elements of what a
pragmatic resolution might look like
professor Chomsky now acknowledges that
the two-state solution may be quote the
best of the rotten ideas around I'll
settle for that he also seems to
acknowledge that those who advocate the
so-called Palestinian right of return or
pandering to their people and misleading
them into believing that there is yet
another weapon a demographic weapon that
can destroy Israel I think we both agree
that Jerusalem should be divided
essentially along demographic lines with
the Palestinians controlling the
Palestinian population and Israel
controlling the Jewish population that
the borders between Israel and the
Palestinian state should be based
roughly on the UN resolution 242 that
Israel properly ended its occupation of
the Gaza and that it should end its
occupation of all Palestinian cities and
population centers on the West Bank that
terrorism must stop and that the
Palestinian state that results from this
peace must be as contiguous as possible
and economically and politically viable
they remained considerable differences
between us and more importantly between
the Israeli government and the
Palestinian Authority that must resolve
these issues and actually sit down and
make peace some of these differences are
attitudinal I believe that peace is a
realistic possibility
whereas professor Chomsky apparently
believes there is no chance for peace
at least as reflected by the German
title of his new book kinda Shantz fear
Frieden which translates as no chance
for peace why a Palestinian state is not
possible to be established with Israel
and the United States I hope you're
wrong but the differences are quite
specific relating to precise boundaries
and considerations that are quite
important the devil always being in the
details I strongly believe however that
there is a genuine will for peace on
both sides now and that the pragmatic
differences can and will be resolved and
here I think the Academy can play a very
important and positive role in fostering
peace at the moment I'm sad to report
that many academics around the world are
contributing to an atmosphere that makes
peace more difficult to achieve they are
encouraging those Palestinians who see
the end of Israel as their ultimate goal
to persist in their ideological and
terrorist campaign by demonizing and
dealer Jetta mating Israel in the
international community and on
university campuses throughout the world
they send a doubly destructive message
to those who must make peace on the
ground to the Palestinians the messages
don't compromise if you hold out long
enough the next generation of leaders
will buy into your efforts the dealer
Jetta mate Israel and will give you the
total victory you seek to the Israelis
the messages whatever you do in the name
of compromise you will continue to be
attacked demonized divested from
boycotted and D legitimated so why make
the compromise efforts as I travel
around college campuses in the United
States I notice a stark difference many
of those who support the Palestinian
cause tend to be very lightly opposed to
Israel
comparing the Jewish state to Nazism and
apartheid comparing Shimon Peres to
Hitler and IDI men calling Israel the
world's worst human rights violators and
suggesting that Israel should be
flattered by a comparison with the
Gestapo these are all quotes the amend
Hitler quote from professor Chomsky the
comparison with Gestapo from Norman
Finkelstein whereas most of those on the
Israeli side tend to be supportive
of a peaceful Palestinian state but
another way pro Palestinians tend to be
anti Israel whereas pro Israelis are
often pro palestinian as well it was not
the Israelis who scuttled the United
Nations two-state solution in 1948 and
themselves originally occupied Gaza and
the West Bank with little or no
objection from the international
community that was Egypt in Jordan it
was not the Israelis who turned down
resolution 242 in 1967 with the famous
three knows no negotiation no peace and
no recognition as Abba Eban put it this
is the first time in history that the
side who won the war sued for peace and
the side that lost the war demanded
unconditional surrender it was not
Israel that turned down the generous
offer at Camp David and Taba the
Palestinian leadership has never missed
an opportunity to miss an opportunity
but it is not too late for peace now I
wish to end my opening remarks today by
making a specific proposal directed to
my distinguished opponent I propose here
today a peace treaty among academics who
purport to favor peace between Israel
and the Palestinians I believe that by
agreeing to this peace treaty and by
implementing it academics can actually
contribute to encouraging a pragmatic
peace I call today for those who have
supported the Palestinian cause to stop
demonizing Israel to stop dealer Jetta
mating Israel to stop defaming Israel to
stop applying a double standard to
Israel to stop divestiture and boycotts
of Israel and most importantly to stop
being more Palestinian than the
Palestinians themselves I call on
academics who support Israel not to call
for a greater Israel nor to call for a
continuation of the occupation of
Palestinian cities to stop being more
Israeli than the Israelis themselves and
to join the vast majority of Israeli and
American supporters of Israel who favor
the two-state solution if the two elder
statesmen of Israel Sharon and Peres can
place pragmatism before ideology in
peace before party and
together toward the center in the
interest of a pragmatic piece then
surely two elder statesmen of the
American academic debate over Israel who
share this platform can I can also make
our contribution to the peace process by
encouraging those who respect us and
sometimes follow our guidance to move
closer to the center and closer to
accepting a pragmatic non-ideological
resolution of this bitter conflict
ecclesiastes many years ago said to
everything there is a season a time to
throw stones a time to gather stones a
time for war and a time for peace this
is the season of peace let us not let it
pass us by thank you very much
hmm Thank You professor Durst with
Professor Chauncey mr. Mendell will
confirm there was an explicit condition
for this debate that is that neither
participant tried to evade the issue by
deceitful allegations about the other so
I therefore congratulate mr. Dershowitz
on having made a true statement I was a
counselor at Mossad about the rest there
happens to be an ample record in print
or if you like you can ask a question
but I'll keep to the topic and the rules
the topic is where do we go from here
the answer to that is largely up to us
evidently it requires some understanding
of how we got here the question of where
we're going now has a clear answer it's
given accurately by the leading academic
specialists on the occupation Harvard's
Sarah Roy as she writes that under the
terms of disengagement gazans are
virtually sealed within the strip while
west bankers their lands dismembered by
relentless Israeli settlement will
continue to be penned into fragmented
geographic spaces isolated behind and
between walls and barriers her judgment
is affirmed by Israel's leading
specialists on the West Bank
Marin and Venice T who writes that the
separation wall snaking through the West
Bank will create three Bantu stands his
words north central and south all
virtually separated from East Jerusalem
the center of Palestinian commercial
cultural and political life and he adds
that this what he calls the soft
transfer from Jerusalem that is an
unavoidable result of the separation
wall might achieve its goal quoting
still the goal of disintegration of the
Palestinian community after many earlier
attempts have failed the human disaster
being planned he continues
hundreds of thousands of people into a
sullen community hostile and nurturing a
desire for revenge it's another example
of the sacrifice of security to
expansion that's been going on for a
long time a European Union report
concludes that us back Israeli programs
will virtually end the prospects for a
viable Palestinian state by the
canonization and by breaking the organic
links between East Jerusalem and the
West Bank
Human Rights Watch in a recent statement
concurs there was no effort to conceal
the fact that Gaza disengagement was in
reality West Bank expansion the official
plan for disengagement stated that
Israel will permanently take over major
population centers cities towns and
villages security areas and other places
of special interest Israel in the West
Bank that was endorsed by the US
ambassador as it had been by the
president breaking sharply with US
policy along with the disengagement plan
Israel announced investment of tens of
millions of dollars and West Bank
settlements Prime Minister Sharon
immediately approved new housing units
in the town of Malaya to mean to the
east of Jerusalem the core of the
salient that divides the southern from
the central Bathurst and to use
benveniste Sturm and also announced
other expansion plans there is near
unanimity that all of this violates
international law the consensus was
expressed by US judge Bergen Thal in his
separate declaration attached to the
world court judgment ruling that the
separation wall is illegal in Bergen
tells words the Fourth Geneva Convention
and international human rights law are
applicable to the occupied Palestinian
territory and must therefore be fully
complied with by Israel accordingly the
segments of the wall
built by Israel to protect the
settlements are ipso facto in violation
of international humanitarian law which
happens to mean about 80 percent of the
wall two months later Israel's High
Court rejected that judgment ruling that
the separation wall quoting must take
into account the need to provide
security for Israelis living in the West
Bank including their property rights
this is consistent with chief justice
Barack's doctrine that Israeli law
supersedes international law
particularly in East Jerusalem a next in
violation of Security Council orders and
practically speaking he's correct as
long as the United States continues to
provide the required economic military
and diplomatic support as it has been
doing for thirty years in violation of
the international consensus on a
two-state settlement you can find
detailed documentation about all of this
in work of mine and others who have
supported the international consensus
for 30 years in print explicitly in
Israeli literature like Beni Morris's
histories you can find ample evidence
about the nature of the occupation in
Martha's words founded on brute force
repression and fear collaboration and
treachery beatings and torture chambers
and daily intimidation humiliation and
manipulation along with stealing of
valuable land and resources like other
Israeli political and legal commentators
Morris Reserve special criticism for the
Supreme Court whose record he writes
will surely go down as a dark day in the
annals of israel's judicial system
keeping to the diplomatic record the
first in both sides of course rejected
242 the first important step forward was
in 1971 when President Sadat of Egypt
offered a full peace treaty to Israel in
return for Israeli withdrawal from the
occupied territories
that would have ended the international
conflict Israel rejected the offer of
choosing expansion over security in this
case expansion into the Egyptian Sinai
where general Sharon's forces had driven
thousands of farmers into the desert to
clear the land for the all Jewish city
of young eat the us-backed Israel stem
those decisions led to the 1973 war and
near a disaster for Israel the US and
Israel then recognized that Egypt could
not be dismissed and finally accepted
that's 1971 offer at Camp David in 1979
but by then the agreement included the
demand for a Palestinian state which had
reached the international agenda in 1976
the major Arab states introduced a
resolution to the UN Security Council
calling for a peace settlement on the
international border based on UN 242 but
now adding a Palestinian state in the
occupied territories that Syria Egypt
Jordan and every other relevant state
the u.s. veto the resolution again in
1980 the General Assembly passed similar
resolutions year after year with the
United States and Israel opposed the
matter reached ahead in 1988 when the
PLO moved from tacit approval to formal
acceptance of the two-state consensus
Israel responded with the declaration
that there can be no as they put it
additional Palestinian state between
Jordan and the C Jordan already being a
Palestinian state that Shimon Peres and
yasashii Emir and also that the status
of the territories must be settled
according to Israeli guidelines the u.s.
endorsed Israel stand I can only add
what I wrote at the time it's as if
someone were to argue the Jews don't
need a second homeland in Israel because
they already have New York in May 1997
for the first time Paris's Labour Party
agreed not to rule out the establishment
of a Palestinian state with limited
sovereignty in areas excluding major
Jewish settlement blocs
that is the three Canton's that were
being constructed with us support the
highest rate of post Oslo settlement was
in 2000 the final year of Clinton's term
and Prime Minister Barack's knops of the
us-israel proposals at Camp David Shoah
salient east of Jerusalem bisecting the
West Bank and a northern salient
virtually dividing the northern from the
central Canton I have the maps if you
want them the current map considerably
extends the salience and the isolation
of East Jerusalem accrue the my maps are
from the leading Israeli scholars run
boondock the director of the Shimon
Peres Center the crucial issue at Camp
David was territorial not the refugee
issue for which RFA agreed to a
pragmatic solution as fullback the
leading scholar reveals no Palestinian
could accept the canonization including
the u.s. favourite Mahmoud Abbas a
Clinton we often debate it because
Clinton recognized that Palestinian
objections had validity and in December
2000 proposed his parameters which went
some way towards satisfying Palestinian
rights in Clinton's words Barack and
Arafah Arafat had both accepted these
parameters as the basis for further
efforts both have expressed some
reservations the reservations were
addressed at a high-level meeting in
Taba which made considerable progress
and might have led to a settlement but
Israel called them off that one week at
Taba
is the only break in 30 years of us
Israeli rejection ISM high-level
informal negotiations continued leading
to the Geneva Accord of December 2002
welcomed by virtually the entire world
rejected by Israel dismissed by
Washington that could have been the
basis for a just piece it still can
bye-bye then however Bush are on
bulldozers were demolishing any basis
for it every sane Israeli Hawk
understood that it was absurd for Israel
to leave 8,000 settlers in Gaza
protected by a large part of the army
while taking over scarce water resources
and arable land the same conclusion was
to withdraw from Gaza while expanding
through the West Bank and that will
continue as long as Washington insists
on marching on the road to catastrophe
by rejecting minimal Palestinian rights
I'm quoting the warning of the four
former heads of Israel Shin Bet Security
Service there are clear alternatives and
if that March the catastrophe continues
we will have only ourselves to blame
thank you
in the spirit of discussion of this
forum we are now going to open the floor
to your questions so there are four
microphones one here one got it there
one here in the intermediate stage and
one on the floor directly in front of me
we're going to proceed as follows and so
I want you to listen carefully to
respect this civility of the discourse
that I intend to make sure that we
follow here I'm going to ask you to
introduce yourself and to ask just one
question as the Dean of our school
always reminds people questions and with
a question mark and out of respect for
all of our colleagues and students here
this evening waiting patiently at the
mics I will insist on only one brief
question I would also ask that you wear
appropriate direct your question to one
of the panelists after that panelist
response I will invite his colleague for
a brief comment and then we will return
to the floor so that you know what's
coming I will begin over here go up
across and then back down hi my name is
Michi Hartmann I'm from in Jerusalem and
this is a question for asking professor
Chomsky I wanted to know if you think
that it actually is relevant to dwell on
forming a shared narrative of both sides
in in in going forth towards any any
solution of peace between us is it
important for us to actually agree what
what what forty-eight represents for one
one side and what 48 represents for the
other in order to live together in peace
in the future
yes I think it's very relevant to
understand history if you want to
understand the present because it there
so it's a congri and I think the history
has to be objectively verifiable and it
doesn't become true because professor
Chomsky says it's true there was a
two-state solution proposed by the
United Nations in 1948 and if the
Palestinians had accepted what the
Israelis accepted a small non contiguous
state with Banta stands to quote
professor Chomsky and instead of not
invaded and if the Egyptians had not
occupied the Gaza something that nobody
complained about it was literally a
prison for twenty years and if they're
Jordanian said and occupied the West
Bank literally a prison for twenty years
and had the situation gone forward as it
was supposed to go forward in forty
eight we would not be here we'd have a
two-state solution but what happened is
it's clear that the Palestinian and Arab
leadership was more interested in
destroying the nascent Jewish state of
Israel than in establishing a
Palestinian state that is simply the
truth and there is no way to deny that
and no amount of rhetoric can undercut
that reality 1948 I'd be glad to discuss
that if you like though it's not
relevant
okay I began with 1967 for a good reason
because it's in 1967 that UN 242 was
passed and a friendly was laid for peace
settlements and since then it's the wid
well let me bring us I was whoa well I
participated in the drafting in a small
way of 242 I was off the Goldbergs
assistant at the Supreme Court he
drafted two for two he conferred with me
and consulted with me two for two
clearly contemplated Israel retaining
some of the territories needed to create
secure boundaries in 1967 the UN
rejected a formulation of Israel
returning all the territories or the
territories and kept only territories
and as the result of that Israel
accepted two for two and at Khartoum all
the Arab states and the Palestinians
unanimously rejected two for two and
issued their three knows no which no
compromises no
cognition no peace if we can do the
truth of the matter is if we can't ever
the friendly Foreign Relations their
United States which points out that are
as old very approached the Jordanians
and the others and agree that got them
to agree to to accept qualified
acceptance of two for two on the
condition that there would be minor and
mutual adjustments with no substantial
change to the mat okay there were curved
lines and it was agreed that they should
be straight alright what you can't see
behind the podium is that both of my
colleagues are armed with several dozen
maps and that could get that could that
could get dangerous in this part of the
conversation so I'm gonna ask for some
restraint so we make sure that we go
directly to our participants yes sir
thank you Ken sweeter I'd like to bring
it to the present and I'd like to ask
professor Dershowitz since this was a
major point made by Professor Chomsky
whether or not you believe Israel is
ready to negotiate for a contiguous
state not one of three separate Bantu
stands yes now contiguous depends of
course on whether it means contiguous
with in the West Bank or contiguous
including a connection between the West
Bank and the Gaza now it was the UN that
created the lack of continuity between
the Gaza Strip and the West Bank in fact
the original proposals for Israel
required complete non continuity the
north was separated from Tel Aviv Tel
Aviv from Jerusalem yet Israel accepted
a non contiguous state under the Clinton
parameters there would be complete
continuity with a circumferential
highway around Jerusalem much like route
128 it would take nine extra minutes to
get from Ramallah
to Bethlehem then in the middle of the
night through Jerusalem because the
shortest distance between two lines
taken into account traffic is not a
straight line now there are all kinds of
creative proposals for functional
contiguity between the West Bank and
Gaza including a high-tech rail line
recently designed by the ran foundation
I have a picture of that in the in my
book it
also looks much like the Danish railroad
a high-tech waterway all kinds of ways
of connecting all the Palestinian States
do we cities to each other under this
proposal no point in Palestine would be
more than 90 minutes away from any other
point in Palestine including Gaza it
would take 34 minutes to get from Hebron
to Gaza City on the rail line that is
functional contiguity and the fact that
the leader of the Labour Party for years
has quit his party to join a new party
and the leader of lis could has quit his
party both in the interest of making
peace persuades me plus an hour I had a
loan in Israel not so long ago with
Prime Minister Sharon and much time that
I've spent with the former prime
minister Perez that the will toward
peace is absolute in genuine having said
that I also believe the will to peace by
Abbas and many of the leaders of the
Palestinian Authority is genuine - thank
God Israel has to make peace with the
Palestinians and not with the
professor's comment from 23 from the
vendor's table speak for those of you
who want to see the maps that lie behind
Meir and benveniste and Sarah Roy's and
Human Rights Watch in the European Union
and other comments I have them here but
there's a very simple test that we could
try let's if those are that's a valid
approach to contiguity for the
Palestinian state in 22 percent of the
former Palestine let's propose it for
the Israeli state 178 percent of the
former Palestine let's ask who would
dream of proposing that it was proposed
the peel Commission prefer I accepted it
in 1937
well you know relevant period right when
we're talking about today Wednesday who
would oppose that for Israel thousands
of people have been killed by terrorism
you don't expect a country to go back to
a proposal that was offered and rejected
many many years earlier options change
when rejection ISM sets in okay let's go
to our next question
connection between author professor - my
name is Terrell Salman whether you
mentioned the connection between Gaza
and West Bank right but I think to
follow up on my on the on my colleague
I'm not sure if this is what he meant
what about the pieces of West Bank we're
going to end up with elements are
continuing to be built inside the West
Bank the wall is being built inside the
borders of 1967 so now please talk to me
about peace about pro-palestine when it
comes to building walls and actually
separating the West Bank from East
Jerusalem okay here's what a Palestinian
state would have looked like had Camp
David and Taba been accepted it would be
a completely contiguous West Bank with
an area that including male adumim and
some of the other areas rights out of
Jerusalem which would become part of
Israel and would remain within the wall
the ultimate goal is to have a
separation fence that is on the border
the accepted border and I'll tell you
what I think the real options are today
the real options are if this new peace
party wins if the charr own Paris peace
party wins it will offer the
Palestinians a very good deal a deal
much like that what was rejected at Camp
David and Taba and by the way if you
think it was the Israelis who rejected
it just ask Bill Clinton he has told me
Dennis Ross has told me it was
completely in the fault completely in
the hands of the are thought and that's
true of Prince Bandar as well but if it
gets accepted this time there and if the
peace party prevails again they will be
offered something very very close to
that it will be a viable Palestinian
state much more viable than anything
Israel was offered and accepted in 38
and in 47 and I think every reasonable
person today would urge the Palestinians
not to repeat the disastrous mistakes
they made in 48 they made in 67 they
made in 2000 they made in 2001 this time
say yes accept the Palestinian state
build it create an economy create a
political system and finally peace can
be achieved thank you professor
for those who you would like to see the
map I have it it says I said from wrong
boondock the leading Israeli scholar the
head of the Shimon Peres Peace Center it
shows that this is the Camp David map
which was which Clinton recognized was
impossible which is why they went on to
Taba and it cuts through the West Bank
completely it's not that it's the
scissor it is this is wrong okay that's
not a Palestinian he's the head of the
Shimon Peres city Janus Ross's map yes
Dennis Ross was the US negotiators right
where it is meaningless is wrong to
undock is for meeting Israeli scholars
and if you want to go into why Ross's
book is worthless I'll be happy to say
it it's obvious to any reader it stops
you know right obvious to you about
obvious to other kids well I'll tell you
why it stops
notice that his book stops immediately
before Taba
why because Clinton's parameters and
what Clinton said about the acceptance
of them by both sides and the table
negotiations completely undermines
Dennis Ross's book so he therefore
terminates it right before that and can
therefore make these absurd claims but
if you want to learn something about it
look at Israeli scholarship it's much
more serious thank you good evening I
like to thank both professors for
speaking so eloquently tonight my name
is Josh Cisco I'm a recent alum of
Harvard College and I'm really glad to
be back I have sort of a simple question
for a professor Chomsky it seems to me
that you left out in your analysis the
element of violence psychological
physical against Israel against Jews and
it seems to me also that the history the
professor dish was described a lot of
that is dictated by what what happened
the terrorism the wars against Jews
especially considering the immediate
history right before the establishment
of the State of Israel the Holocaust and
everything that has happened since so
I'd like you to address the effect of
the psychological effect in the physical
effect of war and terrorism on Israel
that's
with a very important question the other
half of it is what's the effect of war
on terrorism on the Palestinians now if
you take a look at that we are not
supposed to talk about that question
here but if you look at the booth you'll
find that what many Mars described is in
fact correct the balance of terror and
violence is overwhelmingly against the
Palestinians not surprisingly given the
balance of forces and that's even true
that's true right to the present I mean
for you know for decades Israel was able
to run the West Bank virtually with no
forces as Laura's point out others point
out because the population was so
passive while they were being humiliated
beaten tortured land stolen and so on
just as I quoted finally there was a
reaction and it's interesting to see the
u.s. reaction to it in the first month
of the Intifada this one October 2000 in
the first month of the Intifada a 275
Palestine 74 Palestinians were killed
for Israelis were killed so on the
occupied territories the Israeli army
according to its own records fired a
million bullets in the first day which
disgusted the generals when they learned
about it
Israel first few days of the Intifada
was using us helicopters they don't make
them us helicopters to attack civilian
complexes apartment houses and so on
killing and wounding dozens of people
and the u.s. did respond to that Clinton
responded by sending the biggest
shipment of military helicopters in a
decade to Israel the press responded to
by not publishing it
I should add refusing to publish it
because it was repeatedly brought to
their attention well while the ratio was
20 to 1 which is pretty much what it's
been for a long time there was no
concern here then over the next 2-3
years the ratio reduced to closer to 3
to 1
and then came enormous concern about the
one not the three and this goes back for
a long time what I quoted from Mara's is
accurate well you know
follow the very brief response the idea
that there is this vast conspiracy arc
in media and both Democrats like Clinton
and Republicans like Bush to hide the
truth from the American public just does
not bear reality Israel's an open
society any newspaper can come and cover
it why would not the newspapers cover
these stories before one reason they are
figments of Chomsky's imagination well
then and there just never happen now is
it I want to talk about another figment
of his imagination shows them constantly
quotes constantly quotes many Morris as
if many Mars supports his position what
happened is many Merce was asked whether
or not I accurately quote him in my book
the case for peace and Benny Morris
responded as follows he still holds the
views that I attributed to him that I am
right about his views and that someone
could read Morris's books this is a
quote from Morris and arrived at exactly
the same conclusions and yet professor
Chomsky by selectively quoting and by
picking tidbits out of context knowing
that you're not going to check up on him
tells you essentially that what you
believe in the American media whether it
be the Washington Post The Boston Globe
or the New York Times is not true in
order to get the true meaning of the
world you have to move to Planet Chomsky
where the news reflects his perspective
on reality
well I urge you to move to the real
world read the real news don't read the
Selective Israeli journalist that he
talks about listen to Dennis Ross Dennis
Ross actually helped to draw the maps he
was there when I haven't done my two
minutes when he said when I asked Dennis
Ross a long 10 minutes about these maps
and what what apparently Chomsky would
say in response Ross said ask professor
Chomsky one thing were you there Dennis
Ross was there
he knows what maps were presented to the
Palestinians and what they rejected
thank you the head of the cemetery
though the head of the C Mon Paris Peace
Center Braun ton doc as the leading
on this and doesn't cut it right before
right we know her right before he's
refuted the way Dennis rusted presents
he was involved in negotiation since
before Oslo right through Camp David up
to the present a long historical account
of it you can read it if he can read
Hebrew some of it's in English the one
all this smoke that was blown had to do
with one fact that I mentioned one and
you can check it and please do in the
earth in the first month of the Intifada
and now using Israeli sources 74
Palestinians were killed for Jews in the
occupied territories the first few days
this is reported in the press here
Boston Globe Israel was using us
helicopters to attack apartment
complexes Clinton reacted with the
biggest deal in a decade check it out
it's in the public record not it not
questioned by anyone to send military
helicopters to Israel
the there has been a database search of
the US it was reported in Europe it was
reported by Amnesty International it's
reported in jane's defence weekly the
main military magazine in the world
there was a database search for the u.s.
press and they found nothing I know of
explicit cases and I'll be glad to tell
them to you where the press was
approached and asked just to report the
fact why did you okay
Chomsky why didn't they report it are
they bad reporters what's their motive
explain why because time so the post
wouldn't report this great story from
Planet Chomsky gentlemen if I could
weekly from the International Press and
so on yeah they wouldn't you have to ask
them why they didn't report it I'll give
me my opinion in fact I've written them
let's here given that the JFK forum is
here for the purpose of creating
educated citizens and participants in a
very important debate I would ask each
of you to exercise a bit of restraint so
that we can have more of our questions
from the audience please and identify
yourself
see Murray and if you want the answer
why didn't they report a CPC propaganda
and the promised land now my question
getting back to today and your
functional continuity contiguity
contiguity I would like to know have you
seen not just the wall but the eight
terminals that are being built under
your vision under your compromise will
the terminals be dismantled will the
wall be dismantled will Jerusalem East
Jerusalem be under the sovereignty of
Palestinians not just under the control
and will the Palestinians have their
water resources back will they have
freedom of movement I mean is this the
kind of vision you have is a genuine one
or are you talking about Sharon's plan
well I can work it what so-called
palette I can only tell you what my
proposal is and I think it's a proposal
that's today widely supported within
Israel that is that the ultimate the
security fence I've been through not
only the terminals but the most recent
terminal the most recent high-tech
terminal that was just built I proposed
actually that the security fence be
placed on wheels and constantly be able
to be moved consistent with Israeli
security needs the Israeli Supreme Court
the Israeli Supreme Court ruled last
year and Chomsky misstated it no Israeli
justice has ever said and I challenge
you to find a statement that Barak has
ever said that Israeli law Trump's
international law that is simply not
true what he said is that Israeli law
enforces international law but
international law is not determined by a
body in the International Court of
Justice which excludes Israelis from
serving on it and which will not allow
an Israeli ever to be a member of that
Court it would be as if southern black
in the 1930s accepted as the correct
statement of American constitutional law
a decision by an all-white Court in a
case involving a black and a white man
no Israel accepts international law
enforces international law
and the goal of course of my peace
proposal is that the security fence will
eventually be dismantled when terrorism
ends but before that it would be on the
border the way the Gaza fence is now on
the border and that water rights would
be respected there would be complete and
total freedom of movement within the
contiguous West Bank and between the
West Bank and Gaza even today
Israel has given up control over the
Rafah crossing it now has a video which
it can watch to see as Palestinians
monitor exit and entry through the Rafa
a gateway that's going to be the future
and if there is a will to peace if there
is a desire to make sure that there are
two States not simply once day a
Palestinian state then all of these
issues can be resolved and will be
resolved Israel has shown the will to
resolve these issues certainly I support
a resolution that gives dignity gives
economic viability gives political
freedom and freedom of movement to the
Palestinian people yes once again I
purposely quoted justice Bergen to all
because I know of mr. Gershowitz his
opposition to the World Court I
therefore cut coach I quoted the US
justice not the World Court who stated
that the segments of the wall being
built to protect the settlements are if
so facto in violation of international
humanitarian law that's 80% of the wall
two months later Israel's High Court
stated in contrast that the separation
wall must take into account the need to
provide security for Israelis living in
the West Bank including their property
rights that's in direct contradiction to
justice Bergen Thals separate
declaration United sleep with the world
court that's right and if you would like
his comment about how international law
Israeli law supersedes international law
in East Jerusalem because now it's next
to Israel illegally I'll be happy to
provide it to you just a meaning but
that's not what you said please hold
let's go to the next I'm a second-year
student at the law school professor
Chomsky it seems like you've done a lot
of remembering and very little imagining
and Alan Dershowitz has ideas if they
seem funny to have a train or you know
some type of other high-tech connection
at least they're creative and at least
they're moving us forward how do you
deal with the issues of refugees how
would you connect Gaza and the West Bank
or is the only solution in your mind a
one-state solution what would you do
about Jerusalem well as you would know
if you looked at anything I'd written
instead of if you would know if you look
at anything that's written I've been
supporting a two-state settlement since
the early 1970s and in print and perhaps
you can show me some of mr. mr. dersh
oasis material in print supporting it I
haven't found it but yes that's my
position since the early seventies all
in print as for connections the issue
recall at Camp David and at Taba and
today is territorial in the West Bank
okay
if the and the current proposals are
exactly as I described go through the
sources I mentioned or find any other
ones that you think are serious those
are the major Israeli and Western
academic sources and human rights
organizations and so on yes they break
up the West Bank into three Fanta stands
as benveniste said with a virtually no
organic connection to East Jerusalem
which is the center of Palestinian life
that's why the EU and Europe in the
European Union and Human Rights Watch
and others flatly reject them now it is
possible what Israel is in fact doing
now is developing a huge infrastructure
system in the West Bank with highways
for Israelis and paths for Palestinians
so that they don't have to interact with
one another which means that this
network around the West Bank which will
be annexed to Israel roughly 40 to 50
percent people can travel in it in great
comfort from the suburbs around Tel Aviv
including all the water resources
including the most arable land they can
get to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem the
Palestinians will be found has actually
I can read to you if you
like how Israeli journalists are
describing that and if you'd like to
check it out for yourself I suggest some
time that you take what's officially
called the Palestinian Road from
Bethlehem to Ramallah which takes like
10 minutes on the Jewish highway I've
taken it it's a little a winding road
that the road goes right next to a wadi
if it's not raining you're lucky if you
don't fall into it and often the hill
you can see the pads where people are
sort of moving on the days when the
settlers are not traveling the roads are
empty because there's no way to get
anywhere I mean you're going up
broken-down taxi cab up to a barrier and
then you transport someone who needs
dialysis a or a pregnant woman caring
over a ditch and as you go to another
cab and so on yeah that's kind of
continuity and again I say the same
thing if that's reasonable then fine
let's impose that kind of contiguity on
Israel
okay hold please a very brief first of
all listen to the words there's an
element of racism in one of the phrases
we've heard today in describing this as
a Jewish highway 1.2 million Israelis
are Arabs many of them are Christians
there is no such thing as a Jewish
Highway in Israel there are Jewish there
are Muslim highways in Saudi Arabia
there are Muslim only roads in other
parts of the world but there is no road
there's nothing in Israel that is opened
only to Jews even synagogues everything
is open to Israeli Arabs every Road is
opened to an Israeli rare Arab when the
peace solution is finally proposed had
the Camp David and Taba Accords been
accepted the Palestinians would be free
to build any super highways they choose
and indeed Israel has offered now a
super highway in a super roadway between
Gaza and Jerusalem picked up straight
between Gaza and heparin and the idea of
it's very difficult I acknowledge how to
connect East Jerusalem to Bethlehem to
Ramallah and to Jericho will require a
challenge but people are working on it
there are creative solutions being
proposed
I am waiting along with the student who
asked the question for some creative
positive imaginary imaginative solutions
from Professor Chomsky all we're hearing
is a recitation of the past and a
pessimist is the evil American Empire
and Israel are involved there will be no
peace that's good well I congratulate
mr. dersh wits again for one true
statement they are not Jewish roasts
their Israeli roads that is they are
roads of the sovereign's what I'm
quoting the High Court the sovereign
state of the Jewish people in Israel and
the Diaspora oh that's great that's like
saying that British roads are roads of
the sovereign Anglican people I mean as
well we can have agreed leader
qualification there are Israeli roads
there are Israeli highways and
Palestinian pads if you want a creative
solution I mentioned one let's go to I
mentioned the Geneva Accords the Taba
agreements which Israel cancelled is
separate tops I accept the table
agreements we're gonna focus on this
next question you are yes hi my name is
Abraham Riesman I'm a sophomore in
college it's really a question for both
of you but I guess I'll ask professor
Chomsky just because it's sort of funny
that we're all here given that a lot of
us have never been to Israel never been
to Palestine and it's long been one of
the sort of strange paradoxes in world
politics that Americans and people the
world over can get so enraged about
either side when it's a conflict that
many of us will never first-hand
experience specifically how would both
of you like to see young people like
me and a lot of us here envisioning the
conflict in the future because a lot of
us have a tendency to internalize it to
a degree where it's not about people
anymore on both sides there are people I
know who are ardent Zionists who never
go to Israel who believe in it because
they're very religiously Jewish and all
of a sudden it becomes attached from the
realities on the ground and there are
people who are very Pro Palestinian who
are strongly in favor of social justice
and economic just okay thank you yeah
how do you professor Chomsky well I my
feeling is you should you should
approach as an American and for them as
for an American it is one of the lead
issues in the world the you know Israel
is able to do these things to dismantle
and destroy the West Bank to
disintegrate the community because of
the United States gives it massive aid
unparalleled in international affairs
not only military and economic but also
diplomatic by as I mentioned for the
last 30 years unilaterally blocking the
two-state settlement which Israel also
totally rejected alone the two of them
and as long as you the American taxpayer
goes on supporting this yes it will
continue and it'll lead to exactly what
the ban to stand style solution that
benveniste and others describe right on
the ground and yes so therefore it's
enough of enormous importance to
Americans as for solutions pretty
straightforward there they were coming
close to a solution at Taba until Israel
called it off if negotiations continued
leading to several proposals of which
the most detailed were the Geneva
Accords you can find out what I thought
about all of those in print you can ask
mr. Dershowitz where he supported them
in print the Geneva Accords in December
2002 were accepted by essentially the
whole world Israel rejected them the
u.s. refused even to send a message to
the Jiva meetings but they're still
potentially alive and American citizens
can compel our own government to reverse
its program to accept the international
consensus for the first
time and then we'll be on the way to a
solution thank you I too have written
about the Geneva Accords and in Chapter
six of my book and I generally support
many elements of the Geneva Accords I do
not support the right of return that is
the idea that 700,000 or now 4 million
Palestinians can demographically destroy
Israel which is ejected in the Geneva it
is of course it is not accepted or
rejected it is left for future
negotiations left because you already
it's accepted and it's left open it's
not explicitly precise ok did not say
anything about that because the
Estonians had already at Camp David Anna
Taba accepted the so-called pragmatic
settlement which would not affect the
demographic character that Israel if you
want to learn about it we wrote the
serious scholarship like that is simply
head of the sponsor I can tell you that
President Clinton told me directly and
personally that what caused the failure
of the can't David Taub Accords was the
refusal of the Palestinians and our
thoughts to give up the right of return
that was the sticking point wasn't true
salam it wasn't borders it was the right
of return well you believe if you
believe that the united states has
unilaterally rejected the two-state
solution that's what we heard from
Professor Chomsky that it's the United
States that has rejected the two-state
solution when every modern American
president has favoured the two-step
solution I say welcome to Planet Chomsky
here's a simple exercise you can believe
one of two things the extensive
published diplomatic record which I give
you a sample of and you can find in
detail and books of mine and others or
what mr. Dershowitz says he heard from
somebody no war and check the diplomatic
records addressed
check the map serve your question
Andrey Denis Russia's book which
contains appendices which have the
diplomatic record what Chomsky is
telling you to do is read the available
record in Esperanto he constantly tells
you to read sources he knows you can't
read because he knows if you check his
sources they are false that's the
reality how many of you are capable of
reading English you don't find it in the
press his answer is it's not in the
press it's part of a conspiracy to keep
it out of the press thanks very much
guys the documentary record ok it's in
the documentary record which happens to
be quite different
ok not only on this issue but you know
you alright I will Horton's
gentlemen I think it's important that we
take advantage of your expertise your
many years of wisdom by hearing a couple
more questions please you are hi my name
is tal silverstein and I was campaign
manager and later on special advisor to
Prime Minister Barak and Camp David so I
think I know at least no less than there
one boondock my friend about what
happening come David in Java and in Taba
I'm saying it's only because I think
that what mr. professor Chomsky said
here a lot of things are inaccurate
even though do you have a question yes
please no but I think just before the
question because it's very important so
directly to your question
Nick you know there was a question
before that had about a seven-minute
prerequisite this is it this is an
expert who was there who was an
eyewitness I think he should be
permitted to proceed his question with a
1 minute corner I don't I don't want to
go I don't want to go into history and
I'm a little excited because you have to
understand one thing I believe we have
only one last opportunity to which piece
and this is this coming party and this
coming election
now my question to you professor Chomsky
and I and I go with you is well has done
a lot of crazy and terrible things to
Palestinians and Christine has done a
lot of crazy terrible things to Israelis
but let's say that this new party after
the election
guided by sean is to offer the
palestinians a deal it doesn't matter
which the a deal that will be accepted
by most Palestinians would you support
this deal even if it doesn't reflect the
views or your ideological views well I'm
glad to see that you I assume you
endorsed run Boondocks expert expert
knowledge correct I therefore recommend
to all of you who read English that you
read the summary of his review of all of
this in the Journal of the Institute for
of strategic security studies in England
and the for those of you who read Hebrew
like you I presume you read the much
longer study that run conduc and Ariely
wrote it's on the Paris Center website
which describes in detail if you like I
can quote it from you as to what I was
that was nothing
pardon one thumb that was not he was one
of the negotiators in the background he
was one of the negotiators in the
background and he was from he was from
Oslo and his study lamaze no he wasn't
studying he was one of the advisers as
you know Charles Reid you're the one who
told me
you agree with him you think if you
think not tell these human power center
to fire a miss director those are the
basic Israeli documents furthermore
they're supported by plenty of others if
you want to know more about Taba you can
read the European Union report accepted
by both sides which says exactly what I
said
as to your question yes I already told
you the answer there is a very good
solution on the table it's the solution
that they came close to in Taba before
Israel cancelled it and that was then
carried forward by high-level Israeli
and Palestinian negotiators informally
leading to the Geneva that's why it's
leading to the December 2002 Geneva
Accords which are right there you can
read them in English you can read them
in Hebrew there on the web
no problem look up the gue Shalom Shalom
website that's a pretty good solution
that's the answer to your question yes
and most Palestinians important even if
it wasn't the plan that you think is
optimal oh hi what a moralist in Ian's
because I know most Israelis probably
would vote for it if most Palestinians
would vote for it even if it's not
documenting it's not going to be optimal
it literally if most Palestinians would
vote for it would you accept it it's not
up to me to accept it you asked what I
thought it what I thought is what I
think is if there's a very simple
creative solution which hasn't been very
close to the international consensus
that I've been supporting for 30 over 30
years and the United States and Israel
been unilaterally blocking it was
reached by high-level Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators and though there
hasn't been a vote about it I my guess
is that if there was a poll on both
sides majorities on both sides would
probably accept it but that's totally
different from the proposals of of the
Sharon Paris party the Kadima or
incidentally of Paris's Labor Party so
far so far he simply
worse the expansionist program that
breaks up the West Bank into Canton's
perfect perfect selective use of shimon
peres you know the Shimon Perez Peace
Center I want to read you a quote from
norm Tomsky he described Shimon Perez he
described Ronald Reagan at one point as
the semi-divine Reagan as one of the
iconic group of mass murderers
from Hitler to Idi Amin to Perez so on
the one day of the week you find no I'm
Tom ski describing Perez this great man
of peace as an iconic mass murderer and
on another day he's quoting the
authority of Shimon Perez to make peace
I mean where do you stand on Shimon
Perez is he a man of peace or is he an
iconic mass murderer he is a an iconic
mass murderer and I've given plenty of
evidence for it and he is not a man of
peace what I did not refer to Shimon
Peres I referred to the director of the
Shimon Peres Peace Center not FEMA and
Peres you stick the argument that Shimon
Peres the man who just joined in to make
peace is an iconic mass murderer woman
not a man of peace I think that says it
all
they want me to run through his record
and including the fact that as late as
1996 he informed the press that a
Palestinian state will never happen and
in 1997 he said maybe we can ultimately
tolerate it somewhere but we're not
saying we're that's not a man of peace
thank you you are my name is amy levin
I'm a first year at the Kennedy School
my question is for professor at
gerschwitz you had said that one of the
steps in your plan for peace in the
future was for the Palestinians to stop
their terrorism activities so my
question would be if you were advising
the Israeli government is there anything
about their current strategy and how
they respond to these terrorism tactics
that you would advise them to change to
move forward yes I would I do not favor
for example house destructions on the
other hand I do think that targeted
killings of ticking bomb terrorists
leaders and terrorists has been quite
effective
hundreds perhaps thousands of terrorist
acts have been prevented including an
attempt to blow up a gas tank outside of
Tel Aviv including an attempt to blow up
a port in our code tens of thousands of
Israelis probably would have been killed
but for the intelligence activities and
the preventive activities of the Israeli
government I have a book coming out in
January called preemption where I set
out all the parameters of where I think
pre-emptive acts are justified where I
think they're not justified I think
Israel gets a C+ or a B - in its
compliance with human rights in fighting
terrorism which is higher than any
country ever has gotten comparably
facing any external threats and I
challenge in fact anybody in this room
or professor Chomsky to name me any
other country which has faced comparable
threats of terrorism comparable external
threats which has ever had a Supreme
Court and an academy which has been more
sensitive to the human rights and civil
rights of those who would destroy it I
say C + D - if I were in Israeli I would
demand much more I would demand that it
get up to the B+ range but surely a much
better standard than the United States
has followed in Iraq
surely a much higher standard than Egypt
or Jordan surely a much higher standard
in France followed when faced with
terrorist threats and at least
comparable and probably better than
England when it was facing terrorist
threats from Northern Ireland so when
you make comparisons and you argue that
Israel is the worst Human Rights
violator in the world which is the
mantra on planet Chomsky one always has
to look at comparable factors and
comparable countries it's not enough to
single out Israel and say Israel isn't
perfect if in fact you wanted to have
divestiture which Chomsky before he
opposed it favoured it if you wanted to
have divestiture I'd favor it if you
listed all the countries in the world in
terms of their compliance with human
rights and did divestiture in order of
their compliance you would never even
to Israel on that bless professor John
if you would like to here's an exercise
here's an exercise for the reader I
won't waste your time on it write a
letter to Alan Dershowitz ask him to
cite the source where I described Israel
as the worst human rights violator in
the world or even anything remotely like
it if he had ever if he would ever look
at a word that's written so he would
know for example that I was supporting
the two-state settlement in the early
70s when he was saying nothing about it
and hasn't until recently he would also
know that I described in detail how the
us-israeli record was considerably
better than the US record but to answer
his challenge there are certainly cases
that are much better than Israel's
record countries that have suffered far
worse terrorism and have not done
anything
well start let's take to the to take an
obvious case Nicaragua uncontroversial
case uncontroversial because much as you
hate the World Court the World Court
ruled that the United States was
carrying out what it called unlawful use
of force against Nicaragua that's
international terrorism in lay language
the case was run by one of your
distinguished colleagues the and ordered
the u.s. to stop the terrorist attacks
and to pay massive reparations the u.s.
rejected the court judgment vetoed two
Security Council resolutions supporting
the court judgments went on to
practically destroy the country the
number of people killed in that
terrorist attack translating to per
capita equivalents here it would be
about 2.25 million that's more than the
total in all US wars ever there were no
target assassinations and unlike Israel
Nicaragua didn't even close newspapers
I mean Israel has repeatedly closed
newspapers even in Israel but mostly in
the occupied territories because it
claims that they have some connection
with terrorists the leading newspaper in
Nicaragua right to the end was owned by
a supporter of the u.s. terrorist army
and was openly on its
pages calling for the overthrow of the
government occasionally they reduce some
of its newsprint they never close but
that's one case an obvious one take it
even more obvious case Cuba the United
States launched since birth of Kennedy
Center I can point out that John F
Kennedy launched a major terrorist
attack against Cuba in 1961 right after
the failure of the Bay of Pigs it was a
very serious terrorist war plenty of
documentation about it from the best
sources you can you like Arthur
Schlesinger Raymond kartoffel if you can
read that major terrorist Wars going on
right to the present based in Florida
Cuba has not carried out terrorist
actions in the United States so Cuba has
a better human rights record than Israel
not Chomsky on the issue
nowhere else I'm sorry on the issue of
preemption which is the one you raised
yes you raised the challenge of a
preemption and I told you that there are
many much better cases no I didn't say
that very clear let me be very right now
Israel and the United States are both
threatening Iran with destruction well
you know preemption according to
Dershowitz would require that Iran be
carrying out targeted assassinations in
Israel in the United States these will
hold there we're gonna go this is gonna
be our last question of the evening um
my name is Laurie crassula I'm a second
year MPP student thank you for this
lively debate what I have a question
kind of directed at both of you but
Professor ardour Chris near book you
said you hope to have a win-win
situation where everyone had to give
something up and what's clear to me
after this debate and just looking at
history that no one's able to come to a
resolution where they're willing to give
up enough to the other person so it
seems to me that the only way to win is
to have everybody lose so I'd like you
to comment on a proposal where maybe if
you all lost we'd actually come out
winning well I think there is a win-win
possible
in Israel has been giving up much it
gave up the Gaza it by the way offered
to give up the Gaza to Egypt way back in
the early 1980s Egypt wouldn't take it
back there was no international outcry
over the occupation of the Gaza by Egypt
for twenty years no is there any
international luck and I'm sure there
must be a long record check Chomsky's
writing he must have in print large
opposition to the occupation of Gaza by
Egypt and strong opposition to the
occupation of the West Bank by Jordan
funny I never came across it in my
research but I'm sure it must be there
if you check at least the
Czechoslovakian version of one of his
writings and and so I I do think there's
a win-win solution the win-win solution
is the one I proposed starting in 1967
and that is Israel make territorial
adjustments necessary to secure its
boundary and Security's consistent with
Palestinian rights no occupation of
Palestinian cities a two-state solution
that is a win-win situation and and let
me tell you why I consider myself pro
palestinian I am pro-israel and pro
palestinian because i favor a viable
healthy economically strong politically
democratic palestinian state that will
be good for palestine it will be good
for israel it will be good for the world
israel has a major stake in the success
of palestine whereas the palestinians
have never had a major stake in the
success of israel and so i see a
successful palestinian state a viable
largely contiguous palestinian state as
a win-win situation not only for Israel
and the Palestinians but for the United
States and the rest of the world I only
hope that professor Chomsky can join me
in agreeing that we're not going to get
a perfect solution and let's just
advocate a solution that's acceptable
the question that was asked before was
to me the key question if the
Palestinians accept the solution that
professor Chomsky finds unacceptable
will he use his
Armus resources as the most influential
intellectual in the world today to turn
the Palestinians against this peace
proposal or will he lend his great
prestige to urging the Palestinians and
his academic supporters all over the
world to accept a pragmatic compromise
solution professor Chomsky a lot turns
on you you are a very important and
influential person and therefore you
were to understand your power and use it
in the interests of peace just before
just before I asked one of the most
influential intellectuals today to
respond to Laurie's question just to
tell you where we're headed professor
Chomsky will respond then in accordance
with our rules of procedure and decorum
for this evening I will ask professor
Chomsky to offer a two-minute summary
for the evening to be followed by
professor Dershowitz professor Chomsky
well with regard to my opposition to the
jordanian egyptian occupation there is
ample material in print and there has
been for 35 years ever since i publicly
and openly and very prominently
supported the two-state settlement with
mr. Schue it says he now supports I'm
glad to hear that I don't know the
background evidence
let's return and that means of course
opposing jordanian egyptian occupation
let's turn to the question we were asked
to address where do we go from here
well we actually have two fundamental
choices one choice is to support
Washington's
continued dedication to the road the
catastrophe that's outlined by Israel's
four former security chiefs namely
watching in silence as Washington funds
the canonization of the West Bank the
breaking of its organic links to
Jerusalem and the disintegration of the
remnants of Palestinian society that
choice adopt the advice of
moshe dayan to his cabinet colleagues in
the early 70s the han was in charge of
the occupation he advised them that we
must tell the Palestinians that we have
no solution you shall continue to live
like dogs and whoever wishes may leave
that's the solution that is now being
implemented don't take my word for it go
check the sources I cited very easy all
English there's an alternative the
alternative to is to return to the
spirit of the one break in us Israeli
rejection ISM that is the weak in Taba
in January 2001 before Israel called it
off and to take seriously the follow-up
proposals from high-level negotiators on
both sides of which the Geneva Accords
are the most detailed there is
overwhelming international support for
taking them as the basis for a political
settlement it does come close to the
long-standing international consensus
that the United States and Israel have
barred them that I've personally been
supporting for the last over 30 years
that's the road away from catastrophe
towards an end to violence and towards
eventual reconciliation either choice is
within our reach from that point on it's
up to us
professor Dershowitz we do seem to have
a remarkable point of agreement I think
we both do agree that the proposals made
at Taba do provide a useful basis for a
peace process now Taba didn't end
because Israel left Taba ended because
our fought rejected Camp David thereby
causing the election of sharone over
Barak there was no government
essentially that could carry out the
table of proposals which were favored by
a very very large number of Israelis
that's why Prince Bandar are said to
Arafah at Camp David and a table if you
reject the proposals at Camp David
you're gonna get your own instead of
Barack you're never ever gonna get a
better deal thankfully he was wrong
Sharon emerged as a man of courage and a
man of vision and I myself although I
never did support your own in the past
strongly support the efforts made by
Sharon in Paris a great great man of
peace a man who has vision a man who
imagines the future a man who can bring
about peace in the world and peace in
the Middle East and I think the
prospects for a peace based on the table
of proposals are quite realistic I think
that if this party wins the election and
invites the Palestinians to the table
and the Palestinians don't again miss an
opportunity to miss an opportunity there
will be a real prospect for negotiation
a real prospect for a peace based on
pragmatism one final word about the
sources please the other area where
professor Chomsky and I agree check his
sources take him at his word go back
tonight and Google and read the sources
read them in English read them and
whatever language you can and then email
us both as to what the sources show and
finally in a constructive and positive
way
I urge you imagine peace imagine the
peace dividend that will come to the
world if finally a pragmatic solution
based on peace comes to the Palestinian
people and the Israeli people I'm hoping
for Shalom for Salaam and for peace
thank you thank you
