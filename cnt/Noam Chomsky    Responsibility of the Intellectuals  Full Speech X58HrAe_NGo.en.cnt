tonight we celebrate an honor Noam
Chomsky's lifetime contribution to
critical scholarship both for his
importance to our collective past and
has a role model for being an engaged
activist intellectual for our collective
future I don't have to waste time saying
what's obvious how pleased then grateful
I am for this honor which also offers an
occasion to look back over the years
when I do so what comes to mind with
particular salience
for me are the earliest years and put in
part because I've been thinking about
them lately for other reasons reasons
that are somewhat unpleasant I'm just
old enough to have memories of Hitler's
speeches on the radio seventy-five years
ago I didn't understand the words but I
couldn't fail to grasp the Menace of the
tone and the cheering mobs the first
political article I wrote was shortly
after in February 1939 it was right
after the fall of Barcelona I'm sure it
was nothing particularly memorable it
was fourth grade newspaper of which I
was a
I was the editor and probably the only
reader
maybe my mother I'm not sure but I could
recall a little of it much more clearly
than the few words I remember are the is
the mood of fear and foreboding it
opened with the words Austria Falls
Czechoslovakia Falls and now Barcelona
Falls this was immediately after the
fall of Barcelona and Spain with it a
few months later the words have somehow
always stayed in my mind along with the
move the dread the sense of the dark
clouds of fascism gathering over Germany
than Europe and no one could see how far
beyond as a growing force of
unimaginable heart no one could foresee
the Holocaust but just a few weeks
earlier Christina had taken place and
the desperate flight of refugees had
been building up over several years many
of them unable to believe what was
happening in those days the same
childhood years I also had my first
experience with critical intellectuals
what are often called radical
intellectuals though they wouldn't be
called intellectuals by the way the term
is standardly used that's standard
leaders to apply to people with status
and privilege who are in a position to
reach the public with thoughts about
human affairs and concerns and since
privilege plainly confers opportunity
and opportunity confers responsibility
the question always arises
to how they're using that responsibility
actually the article that Eric just
quoted was based on an article by Dwight
MacDonald mid-1940s on responsibilities
of intellectuals which was about the
same topic and those are very live
questions in those years
Russell Dewey Eric from McDonald or will
and others work that I soon became
familiar with when I was a little older
but the radical intellectuals of my
childhood the first ones I met were
different they were my working-class
relatives in New York was the
depressions mostly unemployed one uncle
who was disabled was able to get a
newsstand thanks to New Deal measures
which helped disabled people and since
he had employment he was able to support
a good deal of family my these relatives
most of them had very limited formal
education uncle who I mentioned was who
was an enormous influence in my life he
never went past fourth grade but it was
one of the most lively intellectual
circles I've ever had anything to do
with on the periphery as a child of
course there were constant discussions
about the latest concert of the wood of
a string quartet of the controversies
between steckel and Freud of every
imaginable branch of radical politics
and also about activism and the activism
in those days was reaching pretty
impressive heights particularly
significant by the mid 30s were the
sit-down strikes that's just one step
short of workers taking over factories
eliminating management and ownership and
radically changing the society these are
ideas that ought to be very much alive
today
and if they're not that's the fault of
today's critical intellectuals among
others
well the rising labor activism aroused
enormous concern in the business world
leading figures of quoting worried about
what they called the hazard facing
industrialists in the rising political
power of the masses and the need to
intensify the everlasting battle for the
minds of men on Iran like that they at
once whether late 30s were instituting
fairly sophisticated programs even more
so later to overcome this threat to
order and discipline it was put aside
during war but taken up afterwards with
extreme dedication and scale it's quite
good scholarship on this it's worth
bearing in mind that the United States
is unusual among industrial societies
and it has an extremely class-conscious
business community it's constantly
relentlessly fighting a bitter class war
by 1941 I was spending the large part of
my time in downtown Manhattan
gravitating to another group of radical
intellectuals these were in small
bookstores on 4th Avenue for those of
you who know New York down below 14th
Street below Union Square either there
or in the anarchist offices in Union
Square which was nearby the bookstores
were mostly refugees many of them
anarchists refugees from the 1936
revolution they too didn't fit the
standard formula for intellectuals but
if by intellectuals we mean people who
think seriously about about society
about human affairs about the problems
of life with a background of knowledge
and understanding and
consider carefully the problems and
possible solutions then by that standard
they were indeed intellectuals and they
were quite happy to spend time with a
young kid who was fascinated with the
1936 anarchist revolution at the time I
was able to pick up a lot of material
which was quite interesting I used a lot
of it later on thirty years later when I
was writing about the Spanish revolution
well among those memorable of these
materials is a collection of primary
documents put together by peasant
societies that were carrying out a
collective spontaneous their own
collectivization efforts it was
published in 1937 by the CNTs the
anarcho-syndicalist union that's happens
to be celebrating its centenary this
year one particular contribution has
resonated in my mind quite often it's by
peasants of the village of membrillo
quote parts of it in the miserable huts
of membrillo live the poor inhabitants
of a poor province 8,000 people the
streets are not paved the town has no
newspaper no cinema neither a cafe or a
library food clothing and tools were
distributed equitably to the whole
population money was abolished work
collectivized all goods passed to the
community consumption was socialized it
was however a socialization of not of
wealth but of poverty the whole
population lived as a large family
functionaries delegates the Secretary of
the Syndicates the members of the
Municipal Council were all elected and
they acted as heads of
family but they were controlled because
special privilege or corruption would
not be tolerated membrillo
is perhaps the tourist diligence main
but it's the most just these words
capture with rare eloquence the
achievements and the promise of the
anarchist revolution promise which is
yet to be fulfilled the achievements
didn't just come from nowhere they were
the outcome of many decades of struggle
of experiment brutal repression as I
mentioned the CNT which is behind a lot
of it is celebrating its antenna
centenary centenary and that also meant
learning so knowing how to go on this
experiment of creating a world the
freedom and justice was crushed all too
soon by the combined forces of fascism
Stalinism and the liberal democracy the
global power centers understood very
well that they must unite to destroy
this dangerous threat to subordination
and discipline before they turn to the
secondary task of dividing up the store
spoils among themselves that's what we
call the Spanish Civil War but the basic
the revolution was over before the
Spanish Civil War really took off
crushed well in later years have
sometimes been able to see the firsthand
the at least a little of the lives of
poor people like those of membrillo
for people suffering often suffering
brutal repression and violence in the
miserable slums of Haiti at the peak of
the terror in the early 90s supported by
Washington though the facts are still
suppressed and highly relevant to
today's tragedy in love in Haiti or in
refugee camps in Laos where tens of
thousands of people were huddled they
were driven from their home
recently been driven from their homes by
a see a mercenary army that swept
through northern Laos this is after
years of tried to survive and caves
under a relentless bombing that point
the heaviest bombing in history which
had nothing to do with the Vietnam War
incidentally it's one of the gravest
atrocities of modern history I think
it's still largely unknown and still
killing many people because the land is
saturated with unexploded ordnance or in
Palestine or southeastern in Turkey of
many other places among these
particularly important to me for
personal reasons is southern Colombia
where right now company knows digitus
people Africa Colombians are being
driven from their devastated lands by
terror and from many sources and by
chemical warfare by us here it's called
fumigation as if we somehow have the
right to destroy other countries on
predicts that we manufacture these are
people capable of the most miraculous is
sympathy and humanity and despite the
awful suffering in which we play a major
part while usually looking the other way
though in this case at least not in
Madison thanks to the work of the
Columbia support group here
one of the things I learned in the
anarchist bookstores and offices 70
years ago was that I had been wrong in
taking the fall of Barcelona in 1939 to
be the death knell for freedom in Spain
it was actually two years earlier in May
1937 when the industrial working class
was crushed by communist led repression
and communist armies swept through the
countryside destroying the collectives
with the assistance of the liberal
democracies and with Hitler and
Mussolini waiting in the wings well a
few years after that I went off to
graduate studies at Harvard and first
time away from home there I found had my
first extensive experience with what's
called the intellectual world the
intellectual world shortly after arrival
I went to the standard faculty run party
for incoming graduate students and I was
regaled very distinguished philosopher
won't mention his name with an account
of the depression which he assured me
had not taken place it was a liberal
fabrication so there were no ragpickers
coming to our door in the early 1930s
trying to get some pennies to survive
and there were no women being beaten by
security forces on strike outside a
textile plant one jet passed by when I
was maybe five years old on a trolley
cart with my mother and there were none
of my unemployed working-class relatives
a few businessmen might have suffered
but beyond that nothing happened is
perfectly obvious from Harvard Square
historic
well unfortunately that's not an
exception such attitudes are broader I
could mention other cases some of them
pretty ugly but most of the people were
Stevenson liberals Liberal Democrats
these are the people who applauded when
Adlai Stevenson said at the United
Nations that we have to defend Vietnam
from what he called internal aggression
new concept that was invented we have to
defend them from the assault from within
that's what President Kennedy called it
and these are words that we hear again
today for example last Sunday in the New
York Times where we read the following
front-page story after the conquest of
Marja in Helmand province the Marines
have collided with the Taliban identity
so dominant that the movement appears
more akin to the only political
organization in a one party town with an
influence that touches everywhere we've
got to read that reevaluate our
definition of the word enemy said the
commander of the marine expeditionary
brigade in Helmand province
most people here identify themselves as
Taliban we have to readjust their
thinking so we're not trying to chase
the Taliban out of Marja we're trying to
chase the enemy out it's a subtle
distinction since the Taliban are the
enemy that's that's familiar problem
it's a problem that's bedeviled the
conquerors from way back he's very
familiar to the United States from
Vietnam for example back in the mid
sixties the leading US government
scholar ended up being head of the
Indochina Archives at Berkley he wrote a
widely praised book in which he lamented
that the enemy within was in his words
the only truly mass based political
party in South Vietnam and any effort of
our
to compete with it politically would be
like a competition between a minnow and
a whale so we can't do that
we've got to find a way to overcome
their political force by using our
comparative advantage which is violence
as we did successfully others have faced
similar problems for example the
Russians in Afghanistan in the 1980s
that was an invasion which elicited here
the kind of outrage that we muster for
the crimes of enemies Middle East
specialist William Pope who was there
reminds us that the Russians and his
words won many military victories and
through their seven action suit Civic
action programs they actually won over
many of the villages and in fact as we
know from reliable sources they created
substantial freedom in Kabul
particularly for women but to go on with
Polk over the decade of their
involvement the Russians won almost
every battle and occupied at one time or
another
virtually every inch of the country but
they lost the war when they gave up and
left the Afghans resumed their
traditional way of life it's not exactly
accurate he's overlooking the fact that
when the Russians left the radical
Islamist forces that the United States
had organized with help of Saudi Arabian
Pakistan
ravaged the place so they were so so
devastating the population welcomed the
Taliban when they came in and many of
them are now what we call the governor
the warlord government of Kabul the
dilemmas that are faced by Obama and the
crystal aren't quite the same as those
faced by the Russians the enemy who the
Marines are trying to chase out of their
own villages have virtually no outside
support
the Russian invaders in sharp contrast
we're facing a resistance that received
vital support from the United States
from Saudi Arabia from Pakistan
they were busy rounding up the most
extreme radical fundamentalists they
could find anywhere arming them with
advanced weapons while carrying forward
the program of radical Islam ization of
Pakistan that's when another one of
Reagan's gifts to the world along with
the Pakistani nuclear weapons the goal
of these US operations was not to defend
Afghanistan that might have been
acceptable policy but that was not the
goal the goal was explained most clearly
by the person in charge the CIA station
chief in Islamabad he was running the
operations he said the goal is to kill
Soviet soldiers he boasted that he loved
this noble goal that making it very
clear in his words that the mission was
not to liberate Afghanistan which was he
didn't care about many of you are should
be familiar with his big knee of
Brzezinski's somewhat similar boasts by
the early 1960s I was pretty deeply
engaged in that he wore activities
details are informative that tell us a
lot about the intellectual cultural
climate and places like say liberal
Boston where I was I'll skip that but by
1966 my personal involvement was deep
enough so that my wife that went back to
college after 17 years to get a degree
had three kids to take care of and it
looked as if I might be facing a long
prison sentence which actually came very
close the trial was announced but
shortly after that it was canceled
because of Ted offenses it's a very
significant event we
convinced the business community in the
United States the ones who fundamentally
make the decisions that the war was
becoming too costly and in any event the
major warnings have been achieved that's
another long story I won't go into
well after policies shifted after the
Tet Offensive in policy quickly shifted
it suddenly turned out that everyone in
Cambridge had been a longtime opponent
of the war in the deep silence I should
say the Kennedy memoirists Paulo people
who wrote the memoirs that count a lot
in the early 60s they all rewrote them
they rewrote the memoirs radically -
revising they were untroubled and
commentators were untroubled by the
radical revisions or by the extensive
documentation that the new tale that
they were telling was completely false
the tale the new tale was that Kennedy
had been a dud was trying to end the war
and so on the assassination prevented
this noble effort the evidence is just
overwhelming the documentary public and
private evidence that he was kind of the
hawkish end of his administration he
knew that the war was very unpopular so
figured better get out of it pretty soon
but he insisted to the very end a couple
days before the assassination that we
can't consider withdrawal before
victories assured but even before the
Tet Offensive say 1966-67
there were growing doubts in these
circles not doubts about right and wrong
those are questions that don't arise
when we're engaged in some activity
somewhere but rather about the question
that does arise mainly the likelihood of
success maybe a paradigm example was a
widely read book by historian Arthur
Schlesinger one of Kennedy's advisors he
it was beginning to be concerned by the
1966
that victory might not be so easily at
hand here's the way he put it he said we
all pray that the Hawks will be right
and that the surge of the day will bring
victory and if it does we will be
praising the wisdom and statesmanship of
the US government in gaining gaining
military victory and then he went on to
describe accurately what the victory
would look like military victory while
leaving the tragic country gutted and
devastated by bombs burned by napalm
turned into a wasteland by chemical
defoliation a land of ruin and wreck
with its political and institutional
fabric pulverized so if that succeeds
we'll all be praising the wisdom and
statesmanship for the American
government remember this is a Liberal
government we're talking about the
liberal intellectuals but he thought
probably the escalation wouldn't succeed
and would prove to be too costly for
ourselves so perhaps strategy should be
rethought and after the Tet Offensive it
was really thought under essentially
under instruction by the business world
well not that much has changed today who
went say Obama's hailed as a leading
principled opponent of the Iraq invasion
because he said that it was a strategic
blunder there's no new ideas you could
read that you could have read that in
Pravda in the early 1980s there were
plenty of people in the Communist Party
writing openly saying it's a strategic
blunder to invade Afghanistan we're not
going to gain anything it's my cost is
too much we don't call that principled
in that case but we call it principled
in our case which is just an indication
of how deeply rooted the Imperial
mentality is extricating it is no easy
task
but it sad to say but unfortunately it's
not false but within the dominant
spectrum attitudes like these
which might call liberal imperialism
they're the good guys there's a likely
alternative it's revealed by some of the
most recent polls some of them the last
few days about half of voters say that
the average Tea Party member is closer
to their views than President Obama
fewer select Obama on virtually all
issues the Republicans are according to
the polls are trusted by the electorate
more than Democrats in many cases by
double digits other evidence suggests
that these polls are not recording trust
they're recording distrust the level of
anger and fear in the country is like
nothing I could recall in my lifetime by
comparison the 1930s where the
depression was much deeper we're sort of
a period of hope you know somehow it's
going to get better we can do something
about it now and since the Democrats are
in power and those are the attitudes the
revulsion over the current social and
economic political world attaches to
that and unfortunately these attitudes
though they in some respects surprising
given their scale and depth they're not
there are understandable for over 30
years real incomes for the majority of
the population have stagnated or
declined social indicators basic
measures of the health of a society they
have steadily deteriorated since the mid
1970s before that they grew closely
tracking growth as you'd expect but
they've been declining their last
figures are from a couple of years ago
it's back to 1960 what people but these
are in large part the consequences of
very conscious decisions in the 1970s to
radically modify the nature of the
economy financial izing the economy and
that has a corollary
corollary is the hollowing out of
domestic production it still goes on but
not here yeah like the same managers and
owners producing in Mexico or China or
somewhere else and that means no jobs
well what people see before their eyes
and what's clearly fueling the anger and
hatred is that the bankers who are
primarily responsible for the current
crisis and who were then saved from
bankruptcy by the public they're now
reveling in record profits and the huge
bonuses while official unemployment
which is way below actual unemployment
is a at about ten percent in
manufacturing industry it is actually a
depression level someone at one and six
and the good jobs are not likely to
return for the reasons I mentioned well
people you know they want some answers
why is this happening to us we're not
living in third world it's not the Stone
Age it's not third world conditions but
why is this happening at a rich Society
they see plenty of wealth going ended at
very few pockets probably record levels
of inequality they want to know why this
is happening and they were hearing
answers from only one place pop radio
Fox News Sarah Palin they're giving them
answers and the answers actually have
some internal coherence I mean I spent a
lot of time listening to talk radio I'm
driving and it's interesting shouldn't
be laughed at the people involved may be
complete sentence but the people call in
art they're sincere they have grievances
they want answers that getting answers
and the answers are internally coherent
if you're willing to sort of suspend
disbelief and forget what you know about
the world
it's not a joke and enter into you know
kind of a world of the rationality and
deceit it does hang together it's an
answer
I think ridiculing Tea Party shenanigans
is a serious error it should be far more
important I think it is far more
important to understand what lies behind
this and to ask ourselves a question why
are these justly angry people being
mobilized by the extreme right and not
by forces that did so quite successfully
in during my childhood in the days of
the formation of the CIO and other
constructive activism I'll just take one
illustration of the recent illustration
of the operation of which Michael really
existing market democracy which does not
much to do with markets or democracy
Obama his primary constituency is
financial institutions they have gained
such dominance in the economy that the
share of corporate profits has risen
since the 1970s from a few percent to
about a third which is tremendous
economic power
they preferred Obama to McCain and they
largely blocked the election form their
funding they carried it at the end and
they expected to be rewarded and that's
why you put your man in office and they
were but a few months ago
responding to the very visible rising
anger Obama began to criticize what he
called the greedy bankers so on who had
been rescued by the public and he even
proposed some measures to constraint
some of the things they do and
punishment for this deviation was very
Swift the major banks announced at once
very prominently front-page stories in
the New York Times that if this they
were going to shift their funding to
Republicans if Obama persisted with this
fences rhetoric well he heard the
message within a few days he informed
the business press that bankers are as
he put it fine guys he singled out for
special praise the chairs of the two
leading beneficiaries of public largesse
JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs his
friends great guys and he assured the
business world that I like most of the
American people don't begrudge people
success or wealth it's referring to the
bonuses and the profits that are
infuriating the public they went on to
say this is part of the free market
system and not inaccurate the way free
market is interpretive and state
capitalist doctrine well people see that
you know not very happy about it
none of this ought to be surprising
there was an encouraging radical who
talked about it a couple of centuries
ago his name was Adam Smith he observed
that the in 1776 that the principle is
talking about England of course he said
the principal architects of power of
policy in England are the owners of the
society in his day they were merchants
and manufacturers today the
multinationals and financial
institutions and the principal
architects of policy makes sure that
policy will attend scrupulously
to their interests however Grievous the
impact on the people of England
and even more so on the victims of what
he called the savage injustice of the
Europeans abroad he was speaking of
primarily of British crimes in India
that was a primary concern of an
old-fashioned conservative with moral
values might take Diogenes to find them
today
but he's basically right that ought to
be a truism it's one of the few
principles of political science that's
overwhelmingly supported obvious and
denied of course like anything simple
and revealing there's a great deal of
fevered discussion these days about
whether or when the United States is
going to lose its dominant position in
global affairs to China and India the
rising world powers and there's a
particle of truth to these laments but
not much apart that's partly based on
serious misconceptions about debt and
deficits and crucially the actual state
of India and China which is nothing like
the image dispersion Aidid but also much
more seriously into that the discussions
are based on a very serious
misconception of the nature of power and
its exercise in fact several
misconceptions one of them is Adam
Smith's truisms but there's another one
which nominates scholarship of
discussion on international affairs in
the these areas it's common to identify
the actors in international affairs as
States which pursue something called the
national interest that some mystical
notion that's uniform for the CEO of
General Electric and the janitor claims
the floors and this national interest is
totally divorced from the internal
structure of power quite distinct from
Adam Smith well Smith actually had a
sharper eye and his radical truism
provides a useful corrective to all of
this discussion so bearing it in mind we
can see that there is indeed a global
shift of power though it's not the one
that's occupying center stage it's a
further shift from the substantial
further shift from the global work force
the transnational capital has been
sharply escalating during the last
couple of decades so-called neoliberal
fury the period here of financialization
and the industrialization and the cost
is pretty substantial it includes
working people in the United States and
those suffering much more severely like
for example starving peasants in India
where peasant suicides are rising at
about the same level as the number of
billionaires and millions of for testing
probably tens of millions of protesting
workers in China where the labor share
of national income is declining even
more rapidly than it is in most of the
world China is indeed playing a leading
role in these global changes it's become
pretty largely an assembly plant for a
regional production system so Japan and
Taiwan and other advanced Asian
countries for export parts and
components to China they provide most of
the sophisticated technology and Chinese
labor assembles it and exports it it was
give one example there was a recent
study of this by the slum foundation
which took us one of their examples an
iPod that costs $160 and they estimated
that 4% at $4 that's like 2% of the
value added that was had it in China
it's counted as Chinese exports but
they're not doing much except putting it
together there's a lot of concern to
read all over the place about the US
trade deficit with China which is
growing enormous Lee but there's less
emphasis of practically not an exception
of business press about the fact that
the trade deficit with Japan and Taiwan
is sharply decreasing well that's part
of the same regional production system
and US manufacturers are
they're following the same course
providing parts and components and
technology for China for them to
assemble an export mostly back to the US
well for the what Smith called the
principal architects of policy for the
financial institutions the retail giant
wal-mart and so on the ownership and
management of manufacturing industries
and the various sectors closely related
to this nexus of power all of this is
just heavenly but not for American
workers
but as its pointed out their fate is not
the concern of the principal architects
of policy well
returning to the charges against the
greedy bankers we should recognize in
fairness that they have a they have a
valid defense they have a task their
task is to maximize profit and market
share in fact that's their legal
obligation if they don't do it they'll
be replaced by somebody who will so
that's an institutional fact not because
they're bad guys and the also an
institutional fact is the inherent
market inefficiency that you learn about
your first term of economics an
inefficiency that requires them to
ignore what's called systemic risk that
is the likelihood that the transactions
that they enter into will harm the
economy and the population generally you
don't take that into account when you
make a market transaction so they know
full well say the that define guys in
goldman sachs they know perfectly well
that the transactions they enter into
are likely to tank the economy don't
take a genius to figure that out but
these externalities as they're called
are not their business and they cannot
be again not because they're bad people
but for institutional reasons it's also
unfair to accuse them of irrational
exuberance
was Alan Greenspan's phrase and his
brief recognition of reality during the
artificial tech boom of the 1990s late
90s actually there are zoo birds and
their risk-taking are quite rational in
the knowledge that when the inevitable
collapse comes they can flee to the
shelter of the nanny-state clutching
their volumes of Hayek and Friedman and
Rand and so on and they'll be paid off
the government insurance policy which is
always there in the background that's
what that's why they put these guys in
office that's one of the many perverse
incentives that magnify what are
inherent market inefficiencies they
could be overcome by regulation but that
would have to be carried out by
officials reflecting acting for a
different constituency and not the
constituency that actually puts them
into office well after the latest
disaster occurred the last couple of
years there was a discussion and you
know leading economists about that what
was called an emerging consensus that we
must pay attention to the stability of
the financial system as a whole and not
just its individual parts I happen to be
quoting Barry Eichengreen one of the
most respected analysts and historians
of the financial system two prominent
international economists said that
there's a growing recognition that our
financial system is running a doomsday
cycle whenever it fails we rely on
fiscal policies to bail it out this
response
teaches the financial sector to take
large Gamble's to get paid handsomely
and don't worry about the costs they'll
be paid by taxpayers the ones who are
now flocking to the Tea Party movement
will be done through bailouts and
if other devices and the financial
system is therefore resurrected to
gamble again and to fail again the
system is a what's called a Doom loop by
the official of the Bank of England who
is responsible for financial stability
it's understood and it was understood
years ago in fact the late 90s there was
a book by two leading international
economists called the global finance at
risk which discussed exactly this the
fact that the market inefficiencies of
systemic risk our doom look especially
when magnified by the policies carried
out by the architects of policies or
their position to the people who own the
society so the regulation of the extent
exists is very thin well financial
crises are bad enough a lot of people
are suffering from them but they're much
worse things and the same logic applies
a year ago the about a year ago the
business world was pretty impressed by
the success of the insurance companies
and big pharma in destroying the
possibility of any meaningful health
reform in sharp defiance of the public
will and it's pretty serious matter I
mean not only for the people who suffer
from the dysfunctional health care
system but even on narrow economic
grounds
we're instructed constantly they were
supposed to deplore the deficit well the
question about whether we should but if
we do we should notice that about half
the deficit is attributable to
unprecedented military expenditures
they're going up under Obama and most of
the rest of the deficit is attributable
to the increasing costs of the virtually
unregulated privatized a health care
system which is being preserved that's
unique in the industrial world it's also
unique in the gifts that are
to drug companies promised again by
Obama that's over the opposition of a
mere 85 percent of the population in
this case last August
Businessweek had a cover story
celebrating the victory of the health
insurance industries of course no
victories ever enough so they persisted
in the struggle and gaining more again
against the will of the large majority
that's another interesting story I'll
have to put aside well observing this
victory the American Petroleum Institute
backed by the Chamber of Commerce and
the other great business lobbies
announced very publicly again read at
New York Times though that they were
going to use the model of the health
industry campaigns the successful
campaigns to destroy health reform they
were going to use that model to
intensify their already quite
substantial propaganda efforts to
convince the public to dismiss concerns
about anthropogenic global warming now
and they did and that's been done with
great success those who believe in this
liberal hoax have been reduced to barely
a third of the population the executives
who are dedicated to this task and know
as well as the rest of us that the
liberal hoax is quite real and the
prospects are pretty grim but they are
fulfilling their institutional role the
fate of the species is an externality
that they ignore and they must ignore to
the extent that market systems prevail
so no one part of their lives they may
care that well I see the grandchildren
and everything that they own is going
down to two but in the other part of
their lives they have to make sure that
that happens and that's what we're
seeing in front of us right now well I
want to go on too long but one of the
one of the most moving and clearest
articulations of the public mood at
least
I've seen was written by Joseph Anders
stack you may remember that a couple of
months ago he crashed his small plane
into the office to an office building in
Austin Texas committed suicide he left a
manifesto explaining his actions it was
mentioned in the press mostly ridiculed
but I think it deserves much closer
attention stacks manifesto describes it
traces the life history that led him to
this final desperate act story begins
when he was a teenage student living on
a pittance and Harrisburg Pennsylvania
former industrial area right near its
heart it doesn't the heart of the
industrial center he had neighbors she
was a woman in her 80s she was surviving
on cat food quoted now she was the
widowed wife of a retired steelworker
her husband had worked all his life in
the steel mills of Central Pennsylvania
with promises from big business and the
Union that for his thirty years of
service he would have a pension and
medical care to look forward to in his
retirement instead he was one of the
thousands who got nothing because the
mill management and the Union not to
mention the government raided their
pension funds and stole their retirement
all that his widowed wife had was Social
Security to live on he put it going on
to say that there are now concerted and
persistent efforts by the super-rich and
their political allies to take even that
away on spurious grounds and that may
happen in the next few years well going
back to stack he decided he couldn't
trust big business and he would strike
out on his own and he soon discovered
that he couldn't trust a government that
as he put it cared nothing about people
like him but only the rich and
privileged or a legal system in which
there are two interpretations
for every law the one for the very rich
and one for the rest of us he couldn't
trust the government that leaves us with
the joke we call the american medical
system including the drug and insurance
companies they're murdering tens of
thousands of people a year with care
rationed largely by wealth not by need
all of this is a social order in which a
handful of thugs and plunderers can
commit unthinkable atrocities and when
it's time for their gravy train to crash
under the weight of their gluttony the
force of the full federal government has
no difficulty coming to their aid within
hours and the federal government of
course means the taxpayer stack says
that his desperate final act was an
effort to show that there are people
that willing to die for their freedom in
the hope of awakening others from their
torpor it wouldn't surprise me though he
didn't say so if he had in mind the
premature death of the steel worker that
caught him about the real world when he
was a teenager
now that steel worker didn't literally
commit suicide as far as we know but he
was he died after how quickly after
having been discarded to the trash heap
and that's very far from an isolated
case it's a it's and we can add his and
many similar deaths to the colossal toll
of the institutional crimes of state
capitalism there are poignant studies of
the indignation and the rage of those
who have been cast aside as the state
corporate programs of financialization
in the industrialization have closed
plants destroyed families and
communities I can say only rather
similar studies of similar reactions in
Chinese areas sometimes called their
rest the rest bill where similar things
are happening
these reveal the scent a sense of acute
betrayal on the part of working people
who believed that they had fulfilled
their duty to society in a kind of a
moral compact with business and
government only to discover that they
were just instruments of power and
profit cast aside when they were no
longer useful
these are truisms from which they had
been carefully protected by the
doctrinal institutions while returning
reading Jos tax manifesto and all other
stuff like it I do find myself
recovering childhood memories and a lot
more that I didn't understand at that
time the Weimar Republic Germany was 20s
and early 30s that was the peak of
Western civilization it's worth
remembering that in sciences the arts
and literature was also regarded as a
model of democracy through the 1920s the
traditional ruling parties the liberal
and conservative parties they entered
into the climb inexorable decline and
suddenly it was well before the process
was intensified by the Great Depression
in 1925 general Hindenburg fresh an
aristocrat was elected president and the
coalition's elected him was pretty
similar to the mass base that swept
Hitler into office eight years later
that compelled the aristocratic
Hindenburg to select as Chancellor we
call the little corporal who he despised
but he had to do it because of the mass
support as late as 1928 the Nazis had
less than 3% of the vote
two years after that the most
respectable Berlin press was lamenting
the sight I'll quote them of the many
millions in this highly civilized
country who had given their vote to the
Communists hah lowest and crude crudest
charlatanism the public
becoming disgusted with the incessant
wrangling of by mark politics democratic
parliamentary politics and the service
of the traditional parties to powerful
interests and their failure to deal with
popular grievances and at the same time
they were being drawn by persuasive
forces that were dedicated to upholding
the greatness of the nation and
defending it against invented threats in
a revitalized armed unified state which
was marching on to a glorious future led
by the charismatic figure who was
carrying out what he called the will of
eternal Providence the creator of the
universe he berated to the mesmerized
masses his speeches I was hearing and
not understanding that sort of grasping
in some sense back in the mid 30s by May
1933 the Nazis had largely destroyed not
only the traditional ruling parties but
also the huge working-class parties and
they were enormous and also their
associations which are very powerful and
rich they were gone within a few years
the Nazis were declared May Day 1933 to
be a workers holiday first time that was
what the big less parties had never been
able to achieve and many working people
took part in the enormous patriotic
demonstrations on May Day 1933 more than
a million people estimated in the heart
of what was called red Berlin working
left-wing working-class City they joined
farmers artisans shopkeepers petty
bourgeois paramilitary forces Christian
organizations athletic clubs military
clubs and the whole rest of the
coalition that was coalescing as the
center very quickly collapsed by the
onset of the war
probably 90% of Germans were marching
enthusiastically with the brown shirts
well the world's too complex for history
to repeat but there aren't some
unpleasant memories reverberating and
there are lessons to keep in mind I have
to expand on them
there's for those who want to choose the
vocation of critical intellectuals
there's no shortage of tasks that's true
whatever their station and like life
whether they're called intellectuals or
not they can sweep away and try to sweep
away the mists of carefully contrived
illusion and reveal the stark reality
which is often quite simple when you
clear away the mists they can become
engaged directly in popular struggles
they can help organize the countless Joe
stacks who are destroying themselves and
maybe the world and they could join them
in leading the way to a better future
