within some not long period it'll become
clear to the Trump the working-class
voters of for Trump there are others
like the religious groups and so on to
the working-class voters that they're
not getting what they were promised
there aren't going to be steel mills
coming back to Indiana there's not going
to be more coal mining in West Virginia
what happens then when they're
disillusioned the reflexive reaction of
a autocratic state to disillusionment is
to scapegoat blame somebody else blame
people are even more vulnerable like
here blame the immigrants blame the
North Africans not look at what's
happening blame the North Africans but
don't look at the fact that two-thirds
of the people in jail are North Africans
don't look at that and what it means
similarly in the United States
similarly in Britain and the migrants
that they're blaming there are from
Europe not from Africa not from the
Middle East well that's the kind of
reaction that is almost reflexive blame
people who are more vulnerable okay see
if you can divert attention away from
the core problems to the people who are
really in trouble make them the problem
so you take a look at American voters
for Trump say they're not necessarily
there the popular base is not deeply
impoverished they're people who are kind
of cast aside by the neoliberal policies
but they live they have houses have cars
and so on their anger is directed at
people more vulnerable than they are the
image that's been used correctly to
describe them as that they see
themselves as standing in a line they've
been working hard all their lives there
parents worked hard they gradually moved
forward you know the American Way ahead
of them in the line there people are
moving into the stratosphere with huge
wealth but that doesn't bother them
because that's the American myth you
know you work hard you get well what
bothers them is the people behind them
in the line people who are worthless
like immigrants or blacks who are being
helped by the federal government and put
in front of them in line it's not
happening but that's the picture the
federal government helps the people
behind me to get ahead of me so I hate
the federal government and I hate those
worthless people not what's really
happening that's the kind of thing that
kind of scapegoating that goes on
there's plenty of examples of it the
Hitler of the Jerusalem Temple an
extreme case and it's happening right
here in front of your eyes and Friends
and it could will be happening in the
United States very likely
