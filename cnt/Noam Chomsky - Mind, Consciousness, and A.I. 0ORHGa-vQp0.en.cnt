do you believe that the mind is in
principle computable implying that it
could be emulated on other substrates in
the future another substrates like
silicon I think he's talking about the
mind is organized matter it's organized
in a particular way which we don't
understand but we don't understand much
about be communication and there's no
reason we don't know of any physical
reason to believe that the particular
components of that organized matter are
critical for its operation it appears to
be something about the way it's
organized that's as far as we know so
therefore it could be emulated
presumably in some other substances yeah
maybe that's a physicist I mean it's it
it we are a computing machine of some
sort some and it happens to be it has a
hat we happen to use a certain system
for storing and and and reproducing
whether its genetic or or electrical
it's hard to imagine any other system
would that if we were able to reproduce
all that information we wouldn't get the
same the same person but it's one of
those cases as you said before where you
really have to be humble because so
little is understood about it and the
major question what's what is the
puppeteer doing yeah that one we don't
even know how to address this this
emerging notion that many of our
conscious decisions are really not
conscious maybe you want to elaborate on
that
well there's increasing expert there's
some experimental evidence by now that
when you undertake a voluntary action
like say picking this up very briefly
before you're conscious of making the
decision the parts of your brain that
are organizing the action are already
active which means that the decision is
made
pre consciously and then reaches
consciousness at some point most of our
decisions never reach consciousness that
we're doing all kinds of things all the
time and totally
and parts of the way are we have two
brains remember there's this one and
there's this one sometimes called the
gut brain the enteric nervous system
which is a real nervous system rich in
neurons as it suffers Alzheimer's is
very similar to this one and we have the
slightest consciousness about what it's
doing it's work unless you get a
stomachache then you know it's not
working properly but with regard to
language unfortunately there has been no
investigation serious investigation of
the question though it could be
investigated so we're left at the moment
with introspection that's not a good
state but try it when when you
introspect about your thinking and
language I think what you find is that
the expressions you articulate to
yourself you know come almost
instantaneously indicating that there
was pre conscious organization of the
thought that is sometimes reaching
consciousness and often is not and I
suspect that when these topics begin to
be investigated which is not impossible
that's what we're going to discover that
most this mystery of what the puppeteer
is doing is probably preconscious we
will not get access to it through
conscious introspection but only in
indirect ways the way we think we learn
what the enteric nervous system is doing
that's a guess about what will be
discovered if these topics are ever
investigated seriously one of the
reasons they're not investigated is
because of the assumption in modern
philosophy psychology that consciousness
is the hard problem I don't think that's
true
I suspect consciousness is a problem
that we know how to address you know you
can find the mechanisms involved in
consciousness
learn a lot about it preconscious
decision choices I suspect as a much
deeper problem ok well that this is
interesting I mean we're both vast as to
speculate on things about the future
virtually really as we should emphasize
about a system that we don't understand
much of now but in that spirit and
following up on this idea that maybe we
could we could that the brain is a
material entity and and therefore might
be reproduced elsewhere Bishop is asked
do you think that a and this is a real
interesting question I think do you
think that AI will have the same
snowflake language apparatus or quick
evolutionary moments in regards to
creativity and language namely assuming
AI becomes conscious will it it would
you imagine it would have the same kind
of language development it's a really
specular question but it's interesting
one it seems to me first I should be a
little cautious about AI what exactly is
it there's two variants of AI one is
roughly you know science and engineering
I'm it's a rough distinction there's the
kind of AI which is trying to construct
devices that are useful
you know self-driving cars robots that
can clean your house things like that
that's fine you know it's not really
contributing except very indirectly to
the understanding of how cognitive
systems intelligent systems work it's
doing things that are useful which is
fine it's like building a big bigger
bulldozer great there's another kind of
AI which is which is pure science which
is trying to discover the nature of what
is going on when a nematode decides to
turn to the left or when I decide to
pick this up but that's the same as its
cult map might be called AI if you like
but it's the same as just science
cognitive science what will happen if
the I think the question is asking what
if robots
are designed which have the same
properties that the mechanisms that we
will come to understand are central for
come for consciousness will they be
conscious that we can already asked that
question about dogs I mean are they
conscious in fact you can ask that
question about me you know you're
conscious do you know that I'm conscious
no just because I tell you that doesn't
mean it robot could to we there's the
Turing test which it turns out to me not
a very good test after all
well the Turing test is kind of
interesting Turing himself was a very
brilliant mathematician and scientist he
understood that the test didn't amount
to much the history of the Turing test
is kind of intriguing this is based on
an eight-page paper around 1950 called
the can machines think for something
touring and that paper says the question
whether machines can think is too
meaningless to deserve discussion and
then he's right asking whether machines
can think is like asking whether
submarines swim if you want to call that
swimming it's swimming it's a and in
fact like it takes a
you know it takes a the airplanes fly in
English they fly in Hebrew they glide do
people fly in Japanese when they're
jumping they fly in English they don't
these are terminological questions what
we can do and touring up with touring
Sydney did suggest this imitation game
but it is not as he pointed out an
answer to the question where the
machines think because it's not a
serious question the notion thinking
isn't well enough defined so you can ask
whether it's being achieved by some
device that's kind of striking that if
you go back to the 17th century the same
questions were asked but as scientific
questions so go back to Descartes who
observed as far as we know correctly
that this creative aspect of language
use is a unique human capacity well that
immediately led to experimental
proposals the corps de moi won the minor
Cartesians outlined tests that you could
use a series of experiments that you
could use if there was another creature
who looked like you and you wanted to
find out if he had this capacity and he
pointed out like a scientist that if the
creature passes all the tests you can
think of then it would be reasonable to
assume that he has the capacity doesn't
prove it but you don't prove things in
science that was a serious version of
the Turing test it was about something
real alleged the namely a capacity that
you're comfortably you're trying to test
for it's kind of like a litmus test for
acidity there's something real you're
trying to find out whether some object
has it that's very different from the
Turing test in fact in many ways I think
there's been a kind of intellectual
regression from the 17th century to
today replacing the serious tests for
about reality
litmus tests for a particular capacity
by a test
basically like answering the question
whether submarines swim but men much
more let's follow up in that little
because the you know you talked earlier
this evening about the idea that maybe
things the the whatever was that that
initiated the possibility of language
had to be in a sense because of the laws
of nature the thing that I would be
interesting to me is whether therefore
there is a unique set of cognitive
processes and so it would be interesting
if one had machines that think to see if
they think differently I think that
would be a fascinating question
certainly we know that there are some
that are different so for example a an
automated procedure for say determining
whether a paper in the American
Mathematical Society gives a real proof
if you look at things that are called
proofs there lots of intuition and you
know appeal to what people know and so
yeah you try to formalize it and fill it
in the details it's pretty hard we have
to turn sometimes generally very hard
but you can think of automated ways of
doing that which are not the ways we do
it and as I've said in the stage before
we know the computers think at least
right now think differently because they
could lose energy in a very vastly
different way they do all kind of things
we can do but and they also do it with
much in some sense more much more
inefficiently in terms of energy
consumption so to sort of sort of cars
yeah yeah
