the Chomsky I'm just wondering if you
would like to share some of your views
on the recent changes taking place in
Latin America that's very interesting
and important thank you very very much
related to the Middle East incidentally
remember the u.s. is a global power so
you can't just look at one region you
have to look what's going on everywhere
so if we go back say to the last
intelligence projection of the Clinton
administration national intelligence
council year 2000 their projections for
the next 15 years they just keeping to
energy but there's a lot more they took
it as a matter of course that the United
States would control Middle East oil
they don't discuss that much and then
they say the United States though it
will control Middle East oil because
that's a lever of world control
nevertheless it itself will rely on what
we're called more stable Atlantic Basin
resources meaning West African
dictatorships and the Western Hemisphere
that's what the US will rely on well
what's been going on in Latin America
since then significantly threatens that
for the first time in its history first
time since the spanish colonization
latin america is moving towards a degree
of Independence and also a degree of
integration the history of Latin America
atlanna Mary Sharpe Lee split between a
tiny rich elite and huge poverty and the
rich elite or the only have been the
only active ones politically they were
not they were oriented towards the
colonial power so that's where they
shipped their capital that's where they
have their second wealthy homes you know
send their kids to school the whole
business very little integration
internal to Latin America I mean even
the transportation system shows that all
right it's beginning to change they are
moving towards the degree of
Independence and towards a degree of
integration and the United States is
terrified just keeping the oil alone it
means that the energy resource I mean
the major energy producer in the
hemisphere is Venezuela the u.s. kicked
the British out under Wilson would
Wilson's known as wilsonian idealism
they kicked the British out as soon as
the oil age began because they knew that
Venezuela had enormous oil resources
that meant supporting a bunch of utterly
brutal dictators while Venezuela became
by 1928 the leading oil exporter in the
world it's remained very high Venezuela
is now I'm going towards independence
and the United States is frantic that's
why you have this hysteria about Chavez
it's not because he's attacking anyone
or anything like that it's hysteria
because he's not following orders that's
kind of like Serbia but much more
serious because this is a big energy
producer furthermore it influences
others the major energy producer in
South America second to Venezuela's
Bolivia well you know it just happened
there they're moving towards
independence as well and in fact the
whole region from Venezuela down to
Argentina is pretty much out of control
not totally but pretty much the US in
the past has had two fundamental
mechanisms for controlling Latin America
one is violence the other is economic
strangulation they're both weakening the
last exercise of violence was in the
year two thousand two when in its
dedication to democracy promotion the
u.s. supported a military coup to
overthrow the elected government of
Venezuela well had it back down for one
thing because it was a popular uprising
in Venezuela but another reason was just
the reaction in Latin America where
democracies taken a lot more seriously
than it is in the United States amusing
anymore to have elected governments
overthrown by a military coup so you had
to back down and turn to subversion
instead which is what's going on now in
the that's the last major use of
violence it's only the u.s. preparing
for more use of violence if you take a
look at the number of US military
personnel throughout Latin America the
military bases the training of Latin
American
officers that's all going up very
sharply in fact it for the first time in
ever ever there are now more US military
personnel in Latin America than
personnel for the major federal age aid
organizations that never happened during
the Cold War also military training for
Latin American officers and you know
what that means military training is
being shifted from the State Department
to the Pentagon that's important the
Pentagon the State Department is under
congressional supervision and there are
conditionalities human rights and
democracy conditionalities they're not
imposed very much but they're there you
know and they have some effect you
switch it to the Pentagon there's no
control do whatever you want the and the
whole reason surrounded by bases and I
suspect there will be secessionist
movements coming along in Venezuela and
Bolivia and possibly i ran the so the
military option has by no means been
abandoned but it's nothing like what it
was before i'm in the past you just
overthrew governments you know didn't
think twice about the s for the economic
option that's being lost to the most
dramatic case perhaps was Argentina
Argentina was the poster child for the
IMF and following IMF rules that led to
the worst economic disaster in its
history totally collapsed then violating
IMF rules radically they pulled out of
it and have had rapid growth and the
international investing community and
the IMF which is a branch of the
Treasury Department couldn't do anything
about it even the refusal to pay debt
and Argentina in fact the President of
Argentina said well we're ridding
ourselves of the IMF that means of us
economic strangulation and worse he was
helped in that by Venezuela which bought
a large part of the debt Bolivia is
probably doing the same and Brazil had
already done it well you know you rid
yourself of the IMF meaning the Treasury
Department
that's seriously weakening the
controller method the measures of
economic strangulation and it's worse a
lot of these policies are gaining
significant popular appeal I just read a
scholarly paper by one by very
anti-castro Cuban Mark Cuban American
scholar who reports and if he's where it
got it from that he said about 170,000
Latin Americans have been in the last
couple of years have been treated in
Cuban medical facilities most of them
restoring site under her Cuban
Venezuelan programs where Venezuela pays
for it and people blind people others in
need medical care and the u.s.
dependencies where they can't get it of
course are sent to Cuba where they come
back seeing they were blind you know
okay that has its effects on countries
is called Operation miracle and a lot of
and within Venezuela you know as far as
we you know you can like it or hate it
but the interesting question is what
Venezuelans think about it okay well
good knowledge of that there's extensive
polls taken Latin American North
American polls and turns out that the
popularity the government has shot way
up in the last since 1998 and it now is
the most popular elected government in
Latin America in fact in the hemisphere
because this government is not popular
so it's the most popular elected
government in Latin American it keeps
going up well reasons not to obscure but
it sure it's driving the United States
berserk that's why you have the constant
hysteria from the government and the
media about the terrible things in
Venezuela and Bolivia not just in the
United States the Financial Times for
example which my opinion may be the best
newspaper in the world it had an article
on Morales and the article I wish I get
quoted exactly but it said something
like how he's showing authoritarian and
dictatorial and anti-democratic
tendencies what worthy what were they
well the first was that he
nationalised bolivian gas resources in
accord with the will of ninety-five
percent of the population so that's a
clear sign of an authoritarian
dictatorial anti-democratic move the
other was that he was adopting some of
Chavez's mechanisms and even support for
support for aid for the poor and you
know social welfare and so on well that
really proved seems kind of a second
Hitler something but that's a pretty
consistent strain and Western reporting
and you can understand it when you have
anticipated that all of this is going to
remain under your control so you don't
have to worry about it and then you
begin to lose it that's problematic
