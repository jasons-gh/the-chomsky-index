I'm Eleanor Wachtel and this is writers
and company today dissident intellectual
and world famous linguist Noam Chomsky
described as a latter-day Copernicus
Chomsky has turned around the way we
think about language and about political
discourse in democracies the most
frequently quoted praise of Noam Chomsky
originates in the New York Times Book
Review
it says Noam Chomsky is arguably the
most important intellectual alive today
these words appear on the dust jackets
of Chomsky's books and they're mentioned
whenever reporters talk about Chomsky's
political activism the irony is that for
Chomsky the New York Times is one of the
major perpetrators of what he calls a
web of deceit or thought control in a
Democratic Society the story goes that
Chomsky's dentist noticed that he'd been
grinding his teeth his wife observed
that it wasn't happening at night when
he was asleep eventually they figured
out it was occurring every morning when
Chomsky reads the New York Times Noam
Chomsky is an iconoclast and an
assiduous gadfly of power he speaks for
no particular ideology and no party
claims him despite his fierce critique
of American foreign policy during the
Cold War he was no favorite of the
Soviet Union either his works even his
scholarly writings on linguistics were
banned there in Chomsky's view the
responsibility of intellectuals is to
speak the truth and expose lies he said
that more than 25 years ago and he still
believes that today the Oxford Companion
to the English language says that
Chomsky is considered to be the most
influential figure in linguistics in the
later 20th century in the late 50s and
60s Chomsky argued that humans have an
innate capacity to learn language a kind
of deep grammar that is bred in the bone
and is part of our genetic makeup a
fundamental element of being human he
said is the ability to create language
the impact of his work was so great it's
been dubbed the Chomsky and Revolution
according to the Citation Index in the
arts and humanities and the social
sciences
skee is the most cited living author and
he ranks eighth if you include living
and dead writers beating out Hegel and
Cicero Noam Chomsky is 65 years old and
he maintains a daunting schedule he
spends several days a week on the road
lecturing 20 hours a week answering mail
plus his day job as a professor of
linguistics at MIT he produces about a
book a year I estimated 45 titles and he
said he didn't know for sure
I talked to Noam Chomsky from National
Public Radio Station WGBH in Boston the
picture that I have is of a really
tireless dedicated and even ascetic life
and I not a long time ago that's how
Norman Mailer described you after
sharing a jail cell briefly because of a
Vietnam War protests use the word
ascetic how does that word sit with you
it's more or less accurate I guess
although you might do plenty of things
too that are quite totally
self-indulgent I even think increasing
now that I have grandchildren can you
give me an example of a self-indulgent
playing with my grandchildren for
example that's that's the maximum of
self-indulgence I was waiting for
something a little richer you know
richer well well you know over the
summer we I go into total hermit owed
over the summer the only way I've been
able I discovered over the years of the
only way I can survive this schedule
from beginning of September through the
end of June is to disappear entirely
over the summer and you know barely
answer the telephone I see a couple of
old friends and family comes by and that
sort of thing and then I work most of my
wife and I both work most of the day but
we you know we'll take off in the late
afternoon and go swimming or have a pair
go say oh I have sailboat out there
that's everything
even during the summer you'll be working
most of the day oh yeah most of the day
you once said that it's not unlikely
that literature will forever give far
deeper insight into what is sometimes
called the full human person then any
modes of scientific inquiry might may
hope to do and yet you rarely refer to
work
the imagination how have you been
influenced by fiction that's hard to say
I I read a lot of fiction I read a lot
more when I was younger I do actually
refer to it now and then but it's it
creates one's sensibility in ways that
are hard to explain understanding of
people and what they do would enriches
when one's intuition and particular ways
I find it hard to point to when you read
fiction what do you turn to
I have fairly conservative tastes
usually nineteenth early twentieth
century literature sometimes modern
things I was struck and maybe just the
sort of the nature of the world that I
move in which is more literary and I've
struck my sentences that you said about
how you'd always been resistant
consciously resistant to allowing
literature to influence your beliefs and
attitudes insofar as I can so for
example I would not like not just
literature but the visual arts
documentaries and so on I it it's one
thing to have your your imagination
stimulated and heightened and so on it's
another thing to find the truth and to
the one can't get out of one's skin
naturally but to the extent that
self-awareness and self-criticism allows
I would try to put to the side intuitive
feelings emotional reactions
perspectives that are not determined by
the evidence itself that's a obviously
an unattainable ideal and I don't claim
to attain it and I don't even know the
extent to which I try but at least one
ought to as a normative principle I
think it's a good one Noam Chomsky I'd
like to get at the origin of your sense
of justice your sympathy for the
underdog
the origin like the origin of my life
for and it's the origin of my life comes
from having grown up in the depression I
suppose and early childhood memories
being people coming to the door and
trying to sell rags or apples or
something like that driving at a coming
traveling in a trolley car past a
textile factory where women are on
strike and watching police riot where
they you know beat the strikers and and
then on to experience that isn't
immediate the kind of experience that
comes from reading from from film from
secondary sources plus plenty of
personal experience there's there's an
from another point of view it just comes
from the assumption that human beings
have fundamental intrinsic rights which
are infringed upon in in numerous ways
leading to sometimes Grievous and
injustice right before our eyes and a
particular concern to the extent that we
ourselves I myself let's say I'm
involved in it so I'm much more
concerned about crimes committed say by
the United States where I have some
degree of responsibility than for the
crimes of Genghis Khan I could get upset
about those but I can't do much about
them what effect do you think it had on
you to grow up in a neighborhood in
Philadelphia that that was a pro-nazi
during the early days of the war that
was kind of frightening I was we were
the open for large part of my childhood
the only Jewish family in a neighborhood
that was mainly German and Irish
Catholic very anti-semitic most of the
kids went to Catholic school in fact I
should say that until I was well past
the age of reason I still had a kind of
a visceral fear of Catholics in Catholic
schools it was hard to overcome when I
met people like say the berrigan's and
others although I knew it was irrational
the the neighborhood was pro-nazi this
was the 1930s and I recall celebrations
when Paris fell my brother and I knew
that we had particular paths that we
could take not others to you know get to
the bus or to the store or whatever I
don't want to exaggerate that either I
mean the anti-semitism was real but you
could still play with the kids you know
or you never knew what was going to
happen next but so there's a little
wariness but some to some extent part in
the neighborhood that was always in the
background and then of course the what
was I was the what was happening in
Europe was very frightening I mean I can
remember listening to Hitler's Nuremberg
rallies not really understanding that
understanding my parents reactions and
then by the time I was say you know
eight or nine or ten are able to
understand what was happening in the
world to some extent watching one part
of Europe after another fall to
hitlerism I was that that was
frightening especially when right near
by me and around me I could see
resonances of it so that your anarchist
interests go way back to early childhood
hmm how does that come about I find it a
hard to picture a early chime yeah I
know a young a young kid and having a
grasp of that or an affinity to that
well I was very miss is the 1930s
remember which was a very lively
exciting period with lots of political
debate and discussion a lot a lot of it
although his deep depression lots of
hope for the future my family was a
large part of it was unemployed
working-class but though there was the
poverty objectively speaking was worse
than unemployment was certainly much
worse than anything we have nevertheless
there was a sense of hopefulness and
discussion and debate and work and I
grew up in the midst of that and became
very much involved that interested in
all these issues
and by the time I was old enough to sort
of act on my own at all I yeah I was
frequenting fourth Avenue bookstores in
New York anarchist offices picking up
literature talking to people or members
that vote relatives who were involved in
these movements and concerns were
important later holder other people I've
met met now the Spanish Civil War was
one event that really caught my interest
enormous ly I actually guess the first
article I wrote or can remember writing
was right after the fall of Barcelona
and you're through later I was beginning
to pick up anarchist pamphlets and
literature and think about what had
happened then the and what it meant and
those interests and concerns would
simply never changed I mean my my own
greatest political involvement at that
time was with with in what was then
Palestine what became Israel later this
is early 1940s I was I grew up in a
family in a virtual ghetto I suppose my
family were my parents were both deeply
they lived primarily in a in a Jewish
environment a Jewish sort of
first-generation immigrant environment
they're both Hebrew teachers and the
important thing in life was the revival
of Hebrew culture the the cultural
revival of in Palestine and the I would
read Hebrew literature with my father
from childhood 19th and 20th century
Hebrew literature and older sources of
course I spent my time in Hebrew school
later became Hebrew teacher and out of
all of this came a very
connected with my political interest
this naturally converged to an interest
in Zionism and I was at that time that
committed to a a wing of the Zionist
movement which was Signet still
significant in the 1940s which was
opposed to a Jewish state though it was
considered part of a live part of the
Zionist movement and was concerned with
the possibility of Arab Jewish
cooperation in a framework of
cooperative socialist institutions and
so on I never actually joined anything I
wasn't much of a joiner than the actual
movements that were involved in these
things I was I couldn't I was associated
with them but I could never join them
because they were all either Stalinist
or Trotskyist and I was very anti
Leninist already at that time and a
Marxist in fact and so I well i agreed
with them about lots of things i could
never really become a member I did
actually live on a kibbutz from those
groups some years later for several more
a brief period in fact thought of
staying there but joining was an
impossibility because of my darkest
commitment these anarchists commitments
going back to such a young age I mean
the fall of Barcelona writing this piece
for the school newspaper when you were
10 saying that from the time you were
around that age around 12 or 13 that
your views haven't really changed that
much what is I'm obviously they've
gotten more sophisticated but what does
that say about you that your views would
be so firmly fixed at such a young age
hmm it means that I'm up - or maybe it's
a matter of seeing that something's
right and just sticking to it and trying
to understand I mean I think that those
are the right ideas when I think about
human nature and human fulfillment and
self-realization it seems to me that the
intellectual tradition that led to
modern anarchism and that includes
incidentally the mainstream of classical
liberalism which in my view is very much
misinterpreted by that I mean Adams
villains and humble - inspired mill the
libertarian side of Russo Rizzo sort of
complex but there is a libertarian side
and that developed into the classical
liberal tradition which was then
seriously aborted in my opinion by the
rise of industrial capitalism that
tradition I think is of is a very valid
one it leads to modern libertarian
socialism were parts of the anarchist
tradition and I think that it's it's
basically a sense that human beings have
a fundamental right to self-realization
self fulfillment under conditions of
freedom and voluntary association the
classical liberals like Humboldt did not
want they were not individualist sin the
primitive style of Rousseau but so as
Humboldt put it he wanted to remove the
fetters from human society but to
increase the bonds these being bonds of
voluntary self Association classical
liberalism in this form had was sharply
critical of property values so for
example Humboldt argue to get again that
the worker who cultivates a garden is
more its owner than the the person who
simply enjoys the fruits of the other's
labor but may technically own it Adam
Smith's anti capitalism derives from the
same root a recognition and he was in
many ways an anti-capitalist his
recognition that division of labor is
ultimately intolerable because it will
turn every human being into something as
stupid and ignorant as it is possible
for a creature to be therefore thereby
undermining the essence of human nature
which is the right to create freely and
constructively under one's own control
and without external constraints out of
this comes a conception of freedom and
rights and so
organization which places any form of
authority and domination under challenge
asks that it justify itself sometimes
such justifications can be given maybe
under contingent historical
circumstances or maybe more deeply but
the burden of proof is on the system of
authority and domination quite typically
that burden can't be met in which case
one will try to work with others to
overcome that those structures of
authority and domination and to increase
positive freedom freedom not simply in
the sense of removal of say state
controls but freedom in the sense of
forms of social organization that allow
people to realize their their their
potential their their their need to be
active creative and or whatever other
aspects their personality may have have
there been any societies where these
ideals have been put into effect yeah in
every society to some extent so for
example at our society to some extent
these ideas or realized to other extent
than other respects they're not what we
seek if we're honorable and my opinion
is the respects in which they are not
met which are enormous and those we try
to confront and remove remove those
fetters create new social bonds in
Humboldt's terms it's 30 years now since
you made a decision to become an
activist to commit so much of your life
to political action it was 1964 you were
a successful linguist you had a family
everything was sort of perfect have you
ever looked back have you ever thought
about the things that you had to give up
oh sure lots it I knew right away I mean
as a as you mentioned this we've
discussed I hadn't really changed my
views at that point but I did decide
that it was just intolerable to symp and
intolerably self-indulgent merely to
take a passive role in
the struggles that were then going on so
signing petitions and you know sending
money and showing up now and then in a
meeting and so on I thought it was
critically necessary to take a more
active role and I was well aware of what
that would mean it's not the kind of
thing where he could put a foot in and
then you know in the water and get it
wet and then leave you go in deeper and
deeper and I knew that I would be
following a course that would confront
privilege and authority and would
therefore be my own views which were
indeed highly critical but I didn't have
much of an effect when I expressed my
opinions and small groups or to you know
our so let's say refused to get
clearance in the lab at MIT or something
like that it would become a much a
larger part of life and the damaging
part as I proceeded I have no illusions
about the nature of the intellectual
community its conformism its techniques
for marginalizing or trying to eliminate
critical and independent thought it's
always been true remains true and I had
a fair picture of where it was going
didn't was unhappy about it means giving
up lots of things but felt it was
necessary and there are many
compensation what what sort of things
did you give up and what what sort of
damage would have did you have to endure
well you know I live in a world in which
a world of constant lies vilification
denunciation and also simply
marginalization and what I gave up is
lots of free time to work on things that
I find really exciting as I do right now
plus just the other you know the large
parts of life just disappear I'm so for
example large parts of personal life
simply disappear for plain physical
reasons because they has 24 hours what
pushed you over into that level of
activism back then
it was a combination of what was
happening in the civil rights movement
the the growing us war in Vietnam which
by 1964 was very serious and that I felt
I should say completely hopeless about
it at the time
recall that in 1964 there was virtually
no opposition to the war no organized
opposition or vocal opposition in fact
that didn't develop four years later and
it seemed to me highly unlikely that it
would ever develop what did develop a
couple of years later came to me as a
big surprise and the early stages were
by no means pleasant so for example as
late as take say Boston which is where I
live which is quite liberal City maybe
the most liberal city in the country
until late 1966 that means when there
were a couple hundred thousand American
troops in South Vietnam and the US had
been bombing North Vietnam for regularly
four than a year and a half and till
about then it was virtually impossible
to have a public outdoor demonstration
against the war in Boston even meetings
and churches were attacked they were
just physically attacked and it was even
true of meetings in in churches I will
remember in early 1966 when public
meetings and downtown churches were
simply physically attacked and that was
considered right so there was no protest
against that by the liberal community
they in fact on the contrary there was
protest against these people who were
daring to question and criticize
American state power and it's it's
exercise and that's pretty much what I
expected I also got involved very
quickly and the resistance movement and
felt that anticipated that that would
have unpleasant consequences like for
example years in jail which was not
remote at that time Noam Chomsky in
Boston he's my guest today on writers
and company on CBC stereo and in the
United States on the news and
information station of Minnesota Public
Radio I'm Eleanor Wachtel now back to my
conversation with linguist and political
radical Noam Chomsky
you're sharply critical of American
foreign policy everywhere in the world I
think that's probably even an
understatement I get the sense that it's
not so much that the United States
behaves badly because you recognize that
all countries act out of self-interest
and if I can quote you violence deceit
and lawlessness our natural functions of
the state any state and given that the
United States is such a big and powerful
state it only follows that it will do
all that in spades
but what really seems to enrage you is
the hypocrisy of the American system
that it claims to take a high road is
that true the hypocrisy of the political
leadership doesn't particularly enrage
me I just take that for granted but what
I do what what what I do find well rage
is the right word I guess and never get
over this emotion though I realize it's
impropriety is the way in which the
educated sectors behave in the manner of
commissar class it's their deceit and
distortion and subordination to power
and unwillingness to face the realities
in front of them that it's just from a
an aesthetic or emotional point of view
I find it hardest to tolerate maybe
because I sort of live in those circles
yeah I should I should understand that
objectively that that's their role as
much as it's the role of a person who
wields state power to be deceitful but
it's the distinction is nevertheless
there emotionally
no but commissar class you're referring
to intellectual world or academia of the
media the role that you expect more from
I don't expect any more from them and I
never did it's just that seeing what
happens day after day in not all of
course I don't exaggerate but in large
parts of the media and in educated
respectable educated sectors rather
generally that strikes me is just
appalling and intolerable though I
recognize that that's an emotional
reaction because I never expected
anything else and I don't know either
in fact if you look back at history
you even go all the way to the earliest
sources this is the way it's always been
say to take the Bible you know the
earliest literary source that we have
and consider the people who are now
respected the prophets well they were
then reviled they were you know
imprisoned driven into the desert hated
and so on
in large part because of their both
because of their moral teachings and
because of their geopolitical analysis a
large part of what they gave was what we
would today call a political or
geopolitical analysis they warned of the
consequences of policies that were being
taken the people who were honored at
that time were those who we now call
false prophets and I think that that
that that there are good reasons for
that obviously pandering the power will
lead to respect and authority and
privilege condemnation of immorality of
the abuse of power of the
destructiveness for the general public
of the use of power such policies will
lead to antagonism on the part of those
who have the capacity to to use violence
or to organize masses against people who
question their authority that's obvious
and the picture that you see in the
Bible is one that replicates itself over
and over again in every society
including ours I don't want to accuse
you of presumption but do you identify
with these prophets in the world no I
would say that this is true of every
critical element in any society I
mentioned that because it's the classic
example how does the media do what it
does I mean is it as the target of your
critique the hypocrisy of the media is a
key subject they they claim to be
gadfly's but you you find that they
their work in a blender and complicit
way how do they do that and how does it
work so well I should say incidentally
that the media are not fundamentally
different in my opinion
from a substantial part of scholarship
and intellectual opinion so say the
journals of opinion and the action you
know the operations of those who call
themselves public intellectuals or
whatever are not very different from the
media the media are a lot easier to
study because there's a ton of material
and you can look at it systematically
and it's there and day by day and so on
but what they bring out is not unique
how does it work
well they they operate within a rather
generally there again there are
exceptions these are these are
overwhelmingly true generalizations I
think they operate within a framework of
assumptions and understanding which are
supportive of existing power structures
which tend to exclude or downplay or
some sometimes totally eliminate or even
lie about actions of domestic power
state and other power in our societies
that means corporate financial state
power actions that are that they that
are conducted by these power centers
that are inhuman violent harmful to
human values and human interests those
are marginalized and downplayed and a
picture of the world is presented that
is conducive to and that tends to
justify their authority and their
actions in fact if the institutions
didn't behave that way they themselves
would be undermined and replaced by
others that do so for example if the New
York Times lets say started telling the
truth about the world including the
truth about the exercise of domestic
power financial corporate and state
power it would not exist for very long
it after all is a major corporation
selling a product other businesses it
relies on its relationships to the state
for a good bit of its function and this
would be gone also if individuals
entered into the major media
at high managerial positions I include
by that cultural managers like editors
and columnist and so on who did not if
such and of individuals moved into those
positions who hadn't internalized those
values they wouldn't last very long
now it's not that the people are lying I
think they're being honest but for the
most part that they get where they are
because they've internalized values that
are supportive to power although on you
know again I don't want to say claim
that it's monolithic so for example the
Boston Globe just ran an op-ed of mine a
couple of weeks ago and I have you don't
have personal friends there all the way
up to the top editors over the years so
it's it's it's it's a complicated
country yes yes it's a you any you know
and any kampala scription of any
complicated system is going to be
misleading it is over what it we happen
to have a highly effective doctrinal
system and a very narrow ideological
spectrum but there are exceptions
furthermore it's widened over the years
in my opinion so for example the media
are considerably more open now in my
judgment than they were say thirty years
ago why do you think that is I think
it's because the country's changed and
when the country changes its
institutions change so the the public is
far more critical and far more dissident
just by orders of magnitude than it was
thirty or thirty five years ago I
mentioned a little while back that the
even in the mid sixties 1965 in 1966 in
a liberal city like Boston public
demonstration say on the Boston Common
or even meetings and churches were
simply physically attacked often by
students incidentally with the support
of the media liberal media in this city
that's an inconceivable today in fact
the the the gently move the the
attitudes and perceptions and
understanding of the general population
have changed radically on a whole host
of issues well let's take take what's in
some ways the most striking the original
sin
of American society is what the founding
fathers were honest enough to call the
extermination of the native population
that's one which that's the the the
people like John Quincy Adams were
pretty appalled by at at least in his
later years but in American culture that
was really not recognized until the
1960s I mean when I was growing up we
played kids played cowboys and Indians
we were the Cowboys and felt nothing of
it until the 1960s when a major cultural
change took place in the United States
there was no recognition of the
horrifying atrocities that led to our
living where we are and doing what we do
the fact that the American industrial
revolution like the English Industrial
Revolution was based on extermination of
the natives or expulsion of the native
population in the United States and then
in you know enslaving masses of people
well to something certainly known in a
certain sense but it wasn't recognized
as the major crime that it was it's only
since the 1960's that there has been
even in scholarship I should say a
recognition of the enormity of what
happened to the native population and a
general willingness to at least come to
try to come to terms in some some ways
with that extremely ugly aspect of our
history you could see it in 1992 it was
assumed that the Quinn Centennial would
be a celebration of you know the
discovery and liberation of the
hemisphere that didn't happen not at all
and it didn't happen because the public
simply wouldn't tolerate it 30 years ago
that's exactly what it would have been
well those are that's one aspect of a of
an improvement in moral values of a of a
cultural advance which is quite
significant shows up in many other ways
with regard to feminist issues
ecological issues solidarity with third
world peoples
a different respect multiculturalism is
a case in point all of these things have
their as in the case of any popular
movement there's gonna be a fringe which
is unpleasant ridiculous
maybe intolerable but the main
development is quite significant I think
and it has affected the media as well so
the kinds of the kinds of support for us
violence and terror that would proceed
without question in the 1960s that you
might find them in short bursts today
but they would be open to criticism in a
sense in a manner that was not true then
it's very nice to hear you talk this way
after going reading a lot of very
fiercely critical books of yours of
American point this out all the time I
mean I don't put it you know I don't put
it in headlines I know I know that's
true Chomsky in Revolution in
linguistics suggests that we're born
with this linguistic silver spoon in her
mouth was the capacity to acquire
language that Nature has given us this
headstart on language it also does seem
to go beyond language it seems that at
heart a more democratic a more
optimistic view of humankind it could
come out of it you can I don't want to
push it too hard because when you get
beyond language and you know some
aspects of vision and a few other things
real scientific knowledge begins to drop
off very fast and we're back in the area
where we started at the beginning
looking at literature in history and
experience and intuition and so on but
it can be used as the basis for a rather
optimistic view and indeed was if we go
back to the to the Enlightenment again
these connections of this kind were in
fact drawn well for example by home
Baltimore so who I mentioned earlier who
developed a kind of an optimistic view
of human nature the idea that the human
nature is based on a
what was later called an instinct for
freedom a drive to be free creative
outside the free of external constraints
and so on and that indeed came from a
basically Cartesian picture saying that
some asked the fundamental aspects of
human nature in particular human freedom
are simply beyond the outside the range
of any mechanism that at the core of
human nature is what was called as far
back as the 16th century a generative
capacity a capacity to create to
innovate to construct from the resources
of your own mind the principles on which
your knowledge is based and in fact to
construct new thoughts to express new
thoughts the idea that the intelligence
is a generative faculty in this sense
goes back at least to the late 16th
century and was developed richly in the
Cartesian Revolution and later picked up
by the romantics and in the
Enlightenment and entered into political
theory in this in a way which is rather
natural though by no means proven the
belief that at the core of human nature
is this drive for self fulfillment under
conditions of free action undertaken by
oneself and out of one's own volition so
from the point of view of say Humboldt
again of the every person is at heart an
artist and if they act a craft a
craftsman let's say who acts under his
or her own volition is an artist if the
same craftsman does the same thing under
external control well as humble puts it
we may admire what he does but we hate
what he is did you have a lot of faith
in an ordinary common sense that people
with only they had all the information
would make the right decisions and at
the same time you probably more than
most of us have spent a lot of time
scrutinizing international atrocities
being
aware of what goes on in the world and
looking at it when most of us even if
the information we're available to us
don't really want to or our too
preoccupied elsewhere with our daily
lives to spend to pay that kind of
attention mm-hmm
well you know how optimistic or
pessimistic I or some other person is is
really not important
I mean suppose that I were to believe
that there's let's say 2% probability
that if people are brought to see the
actual facts of the world about them
then they'll act in a moral and humane
way then I would devote myself to that 2
percent and so would any reasonable
person to enhancing that 2 percent
probability and seeing what can be done
with it no I haven't you think it's a
much much greater than that I should say
incidentally that this kind of what in
my view is so and what you describe as
optimism about people's capacity to act
in decent humane ways when they
understand the realities that's shared
by by people in power almost universally
if you look through history including
just today you'll very rarely if ever
see a say a statesman or a leader of
some sort turn to the public and say
look it would be an our interest to go
slaughter those guys over there or to
rob them or torture them or terrorize
them so therefore let's do it you never
find that what you find is an elaborate
set of rationalizations and excuses and
quite elaborate constructions developed
by intellectuals which make it appear as
if robbing them and torturing them and
killing them and so on is right and just
well why bother with that unless you're
afraid at some level of your
consciousness then if people know the
truth they're not gonna let you get away
with it Noam Chomsky you've occasionally
been chided by your friends for not
coming up with enough positive
alternatives for not coming up with some
revolutionary strategy to get at the
root of problems how do you respond to
that
it's image is that part of here is that
part of your job sure I mean to the
extent that I first of all I don't think
that anybody certainly not me
is smart enough to plan in any detail a
you know a perfect society or even a you
know the society to show in detail how a
society based on more humane commitments
and the and concern for human values
would function I think we can say a lot
about what it would be like but we can't
spell it out in great detail furthermore
what it would be like I think is a
reasonably well understood and has been
for in some ways for centuries we would
like to see a society in which people in
which we overcome course of institutions
absolutist unaccountable institutions
should not be tolerated in our time that
means primarily the financial and
corporate centers which are basically
totalitarian and character and are now
transnational and scale and the state
powers that and by now larger than state
powers that respond to their interests
and the same is true for structures of
authority and domination down to the
level of inside the family those should
be combated and overcome we should work
for democratic control in communities in
workplaces over investment decisions
eliminating hierarchic relations and
relations of dominance among people and
states and ethnic groups and so on all
of that understandable I think you can
go on to describe in greater detail how
possibilities about how such freer and
more democratic structures might might
function but the real answers will come
by experience and testing we don't
nobody understands enough to say you
couldn't spell out in detail in the mid
18th century the parliamentary democracy
might work you had to try it the general
ideas could be there but you had to try
them and explore them and the experiment
with them and so on and the same is true
of
expansion of freedom and democracy and
justice today as for a revolutionary
strategy I've never heard of one when I
look over history the only strategy I
see is trying to educate yourself to
help others become educated to learn
from others to organize and to the
extent that organization proceeds to
take action to try to relieve injustice
to extend freedom and so on now that
action can take many different forms so
just in my own life I've been involved
in things ranging from direct resistance
to giving talks or you know thinking
part in meetings and the the there are
no further secrets as long as far as I'm
aware I mean the problem is one of
dedicating oneself to the extent you can
at least nobody's a saint
the dedicating oneself to the tasks that
have to be undertaken and you know we
can see what they are you used to draw
parallels between the Soviet Union and
the United States as to power blocks and
the Soviet Union the the dictatorship
resorted to violence to maintain control
in the United States it was more as
democracies do relying more on
propaganda since the breakup of the
Soviet Union do you see any I I know the
what's confronting us now into when we
look in that direction is obviously not
particularly positive but do you take
anything positive to come out of that
well the elimination of Soviet tyranny
is a major step for human freedom in
fact in my view it's a great victory for
socialism contrary to the propaganda of
both of the great power blocs the
Western power bloc in the eastern
powered power bloc contrary to their
propaganda the Soviet Union from its
first days from the days when Lenin
Trotsky took Lenin and Trotsky to power
was militantly anti-socialist in every
respect they immediately destroyed the
socialist institutions and understood
what they were doing it was done in
principle so there's a great I think
there's an opening for freedom on the
other hand the
Soviet Union though most of Eastern
Europe quite predictably in my opinion
is now being driven back to a third
world level to a large extent that's
what the third the Cold War was about
the no part in an international society
dominated by private capital and private
power and it's it's state manifestations
no sector that a large part of the world
is just kind of a service area the south
or the third world or given one or
another designation former colonial
world and no part of it is permitted to
be to pursue an independent path doesn't
matter whether it's Grenada or you know
or a sixth of the world and to a large
extent the Cold War was thought about
that really began in 1917 and 1918 as
the better historians notice ok the West
the more powerful combatant one war
meeting the rich and powerful sectors in
the West won the war the large part of
the population in the West lost the war
in fact the Eastern Europe or large
parts of it is now returning to its
third-world origins pretty much where it
was back at the early part of this
century that means a very serious
decline and it also means enrichment
remember a third world Society has sect
typically as any of our dependencies
have sectors of great wealth and
privilege and Eastern Europe does as
well so take Russia the the economies
collapsing people are suffering UNESCO
really recently reported that there's
about an excess of they estimate about
half a million deaths a year in the
Soviet Union since 1989 as a result of
the collapse including the neoliberal
reforms that are imposed on them on the
other hand they're selling were Mercedes
Benzes for one hundred and fifty
thousand dollars a shot than in Moscow
than in New York and the people who are
buying them are often the old Communist
Party leaders there's what's sometimes
called in the make Latura
capitalism they're the victors of the
Cold War not the people of Russia large
parts of Eastern Europe are returning to
a kind of third world service role
that offers new weapons against working
people in the West so General Motors our
howdy and so on can find workers in
Eastern Europe at a fraction of the cost
of Western workers who are now being
called upon by the business press to
abandon what are called their luxurious
lifestyles and to reduce them set to to
become more competitive meaning to face
the fact that it's easy to gain profits
and power by exploiting much cheaper
labour in the east
now when General Motors moves over to
say Poland they of course insist on a
let's say a 30% tariff protection or
something of that kind as VW does when
it goes to the Czech Republic because
they don't believe in free markets they
believe in free markets for the poor not
for the rich state power and protection
for the rich but these are the
consequences of the end of the Cold War
and sure they're not pretty on the other
hand there is the elimination of one of
the worst systems of tyranny of human
history and that offers all sorts of
possibilities of liberation and new
scope for human spirit and human freedom
I'd like to thank you very much thanks
again for taking the time and coming in
thank you thank you
