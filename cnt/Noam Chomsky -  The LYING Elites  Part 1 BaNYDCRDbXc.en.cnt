he wrote because the masses are
notoriously short-sighted and generally
cannot see danger until it's at their
throats our statesmen are forced to
deceive them into an awareness of their
own long-run interests deception of the
people may in fact become increasingly
necessary unless we're willing to give
our leaders in Washington a freer hand
and in 1981 as the United States was
launching a new crusade for freedom
Samuel Huntington the fessor of
Government at Harvard said in a private
but published discussion and interchange
you may have to sell intervention or
other military action in such a way as
to create the misimpression
that it is the Soviet Union that you're
fighting that's what the United States
has been doing ever since the Truman
Doctrine the basic problem is this the
idea is that if you have a society in
which the voice of the people is heard
you got to make sure that that voice
says the right thing in totalitarian
societies it's not a big problem
you got a club in your hand and if
people don't behave the right way you
hit them with a club or threaten them
with it so it doesn't really matter much
what they think what matters is what
they do and that you control by force
but as the capacity of the state to
control by force erodes it's necessary
to control what people think and in fact
I think you find much more sophisticated
concern for Thought control precisely as
the society becomes more free according
to this alternative view the media do
indeed fulfill a societal purpose but a
very different one their societal
purpose is to inculcate and defend the
economic and social and political agenda
of the privileged groups that dominate
the domestic society we are privileged
to see in here a presentation by one of
America's foremost intellectuals Noam
Chomsky as he evaluates the American
power structure and the mass media right
now on all
turn ative views
I've talked to some people who live in
other countries who have traveled widely
and they say that Americans are the most
heavily indoctrinated and propagandize
people that they have ever encountered
in their travels well why should this be
if this is the land of the free press
and democracy one of America's leading
intellectuals Noam Chomsky discusses
this in his book which he co-authored
called manufacturing consent and we're
very fortunate to have dr. Chomsky to
give us an address on the subject of why
Americans are so manipulated and
controlled and how far back in our
history this goes
dr. Chomsky is a professor at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
specializing in linguistics the title is
particularly the subtitle manufacturer
consent in a Democratic Society is a bit
paradoxical manufactured consent refers
to indoctrination and indoctrination is
inconsistent with a democratic society
so you can't have manufacture of consent
in a democratic society and there's in
fact a standard view on this matter
which does make it inconsistent the
standard view is expressed for example
by Supreme Court justice Powell when he
speaks of what he calls the societal
purpose of the First Amendment enabling
the public to assert meaningful control
over the political process that's pre
obvious idea it the idea is that a
democracy functions to the extent that
people have free access to I to
information and opinion and of course
the opportunity to act on it well that
sounds obvious in fact perhaps almost
tautological but it's worth bearing
mind that there is a contrary view in
fact a very well-represented contrary
view in fact the country review is
probably the dominant view among people
who actually have written and thought
about the nature of modern democracy and
this contrary view can be traced right
back to the origins of modern democracy
in the 17th century English revolution
as in the case of most revolutions may
be virtually all that was a
multi-dimensional affair with a civil
war between the supporters of the king
and the supporters of parliament but
then a big popular movement was against
all of them and didn't want and was
trying to and had a very populist
radical Democratic character to it and
was defeated the Democrats were defeated
within about 20 years by 1660 and you
read their pamphlets they were saying
that we've lost the only question now is
who's slaves the poor shall be king or
Parliament many revolutions have the
same consequence
maybe all so far till one yet to come in
the course of that struggle there was a
great deal of concern over the fact that
the general population was gaining the
opportunity and the even the idea of
becoming involved directly in shaping
their own affairs and that led to great
concerns John Locke wrote that day
laborers and tradesmen the spinsters and
dairymaids must be told what to believe
the greatest part cannot know and
therefore they must believe one of the
contemporary historians man named
Clement Walker wrote at the time that
the deep concern of the liberal elements
we're talking about now over the fact
that these guys with their little
printing presses putting out pamphlets
and you know agitating and the army and
that sort of thing we're beginning to
reveal the mysteries of government
and he said if they do that they will
make people so curious and arrogant that
they will never find humility enough to
submit to a civil rule that has to be
stopped and the same idea comes right up
to the modern period without running
through the American Revolution you can
find it and so on in the modern period
you find major thinkers picking up the
same themes for example Reinhold Niebuhr
who's a much respected Marlys than
political thinker and very very
influential and among modern political
leaders wrote that rationality belongs
to the cool observers but because of the
stupidity of the average man he follows
not reason but faith and the naive faith
of the proletarian requires necessary
illusion and emotionally potent
oversimplifications which have to be
provided by myth makers to keep the
ordinary person on the right course
walter Lippmann who was the Dean of
American journalists wrote about what he
called the manufacture of consent that's
where that phrase comes from and he said
that the manufacturer of consent has
become a self-conscious art and a
regular organ of popular government in a
revolution in the practice of democracy
and this he thought was appropriate
because the common interests very
largely elude public opinion entirely
and can be managed only by a specialized
class whose personal interests reach
beyond the locality that would be
neighbors
cool observers now that was right after
World War one and the timing is
important during World War one John
Dewey's circle of liberal intellectuals
were extremely impressed with in their
words and their perception with having
imposed their will upon a reluctant and
indifferent majority with the aid of
propaganda fabrications about hun
atrocities and jingoistic
oversimplifications the point was that
as usual the population was pacifistic
and didn't want to go to war any point
in it
Woodrow Wilson won the 1916 election on
the slogan peace without victory a man
they which he predictably interpreted as
meaning victory without peace very
quickly and with the aid of the
intellectuals they felt at least maybe
they were exaggerating their own
contribution that they had whipped the
population into a war fever and American
Historians also joined enthusiastically
in the cause they formed the National
Board for historical service the founder
of it said that what was needed with
what he called historical engineering a
method to serve the state by explaining
the issues of the war so that we might
better win it the Wilson administration
established the first official
government propaganda agency in the
United States called the Creole
Commission mission on public information
which was a straight propaganda agency
to try to turn this reluctant and
indifferent majority into a willingness
to fight the war and succumb the
jingoistic fanaticism that's actually a
predecessor of a much more ambitious
program developed during the Reagan
administration the Reagan's office of
Latin American public diplomacy
theoretically under the State Department
would actually apparently run by the
National Security Council that was an
illegal operation as the Congressional
General Accounting Office later
concluded in a study of it a legal
operation which had the intent of
intimidating critics and the controlling
debate and discussion over Central
America its goals as they put it were to
demonize the Sandinistas and of course
to build up support for the US client
states the u.s. terror States in the
region
that was exposed during the iran-contra
hearings by one of the very few
journalists who actually did some work
on the hearings did some journalistic
work instead of just repeating the
handouts Alfonso HRD of the Miami Herald
exposed this and when he exposed being
an expert leader
came out a lot more details and
congressional hearings when he exposed
that he went to high administration
officials to ask them to talk about it
and they described the these propaganda
efforts as a spectacular success one of
them described the efforts as the kind
of operation that you would carry out an
enemy territory it's a very evocative
phrase and it expresses the attitude of
the Reaganite political leaders and in
fact of state leaders generally towards
their own populations they're an enemy
it's the domestic enemy that you have to
control and marginalize and you want to
make sure that they don't become so
curious and arrogant that they won't
find humility enough to submit to a
civil rule the out of the creel
commission but going back to World War
one there were a number of consequences
one of the members of the creel
Commission was a man who went on to
become the leading figure and sort of
patron saint of the modern public
relations industry Edward Bernays he
later wrote about what he called the
engineering of consent which he said was
the essence of democracy it's and the
public relations industry is devoted in
the words of its own to major industry
that which was devoted to controlling
what they call the public mind educating
the American people about the economic
facts of life to ensure a favorable
climate for business and a proper
understanding of the common interests
the public mind won AT&T executive
observed 80 years ago the public mind is
the only serious danger facing the
company and it's got to be controlled
Edward Bernays went on to carry out such
operations as demonizing the democratic
capitalist government of Guatemala
working for the United Fruit Company
when the United States was planning to
overthrow it as it did in 1954 turning
the country into a charnel-house which
has remained ever since there's also an
academic twist all of this in fact it's
a major theme in the academic social
sciences going back at least 50 years or
more
one of the most prominent modern
American political scientists Harold
Lasswell who was a leading figure in
communications and such things he wrote
the article on propaganda in the
International encyclopedia of social
sciences which was published in 1933 and
in it he says that we should not succumb
to democratic dogmatism about men being
the best judges of their own interests
they are not the best judges are the
elites us smart guys the cool observers
and we must therefore be ensured the
means to impose our will for the common
good of course this he said will require
a whole tech new technique of control
largely through propaganda because of
the ignorance and superstition of the
masses same theme all the way through
the basic problem is this the idea is
that if you have a society in which the
voice of the people is heard you got to
make sure that that voice says the right
thing in totalitarian societies it's not
a big problem
you got a club in your hand and if
people don't behave the right way you
hit them with a club or threaten them
with it so it doesn't really matter much
what they think what matters is what
they do and that you control by force
but as the capacity of the state to
control by force erodes it's necessary
to control what people think and in fact
I think you find much more sophisticated
concern for thought control precisely as
the society becomes more free I don't
think it's surprising that the
sophisticated discussion things like the
public relations industry and the
academic side of it and you know the
journalistic side and all this kinds of
things I've been sampling I suspect if
one did a comparative study you'd find
that they developed primarily in
relatively free societies ours is a very
free society in the sense that the state
has by comparative standards very
limited resources to control by force
and I think it's undoubtedly in fact the
most sophisticated in the terms of in
the reliance on techniques of
indoctrination and control public
relations industry in particular is
American creation you'll notice of
course the close similarity to Leninist
ideology to Bolshevism which also
assumes that the radical intellectuals
are the specialized class the land guard
may have got to lead the stupid and
ignorant masses to a better society in
fact the two conceptions are very much
alike I think that's probably one of the
reasons why there's been historically
such an easy transition from one to
another the move from being Leninist
enthusiast to a you know a passionate
supporter of state capitalism and you
know working for American aims that
takes place overnight it's been going on
for years it's called the God that
failed transition and it happens very
simply I mean in the early stages it had
some authenticity to it when people like
Ignacio Salona and others were making
this transition but in recent years it's
become just a farce
I mean technique of opportunism and the
transition is very easy I think because
there isn't much of a difference in
ideological change it's just a matter of
where you think power lies if you think
there's going to be a popular revolution
and you can ride that revolution to
state power and then wield the whip over
the masses you're a Leninist enthusiast
if you see that that's not going to
happen and power lies in the state
capitalist institutions which you have
to serve as a manager an ideological
manager you do that but it's basically a
very similar position and in fact in the
last century or so since there's been a
more or less identifiable secular
Intelligencia I think you find typically
that they fall into one or the other of
these two categories they associate
themselves with one or the other system
of power and hierarchy and subordination
in fact what I just said is almost a
tautology it's only if you submit to
those systems that you're counted as a
respectable intellectual for obvious
reasons well coming up to more modern
times in the post Second World War
period character find again of deep
concern over the
to control and deceive the public to
control the public mind presidential
historian Thomas Bailey wrote in 1948 at
the time when we were sort of setting
off on a new war the Cold War he wrote
because the masses are notoriously
short-sighted and generally cannot see
danger until it's at their throats our
statesmen are forced to deceive them
into an awareness of their own long-run
interests deception of the people may in
fact become increasingly necessary
unless we're willing to give our leaders
in Washington a freer hand and in 1981
as the United States was launching a new
crusade for freedom Samuel Huntington
the professor of government at Harvard
said in a private but published
discussion interchange you may have to
sell intervention or other military
action in such a way as to create the
misimpression but it is the Soviet Union
that you're fighting that's what the
United States has been doing ever since
the Truman Doctrine which is quite
accurate and gives a certain insight
into the nature of the Cold War in
particular into the nature of the war
against Nicaragua which is what he
specifically had in mind
well these concerns over controlling the
public mind tend to rise to the surface
particularly after periods of Wars and
turmoil like the 17th century Revolution
the Civil War or like the First World
War when Woodrow Wilson launched the
major Red Scare which is the major
example in modern American history of
all of American history of state
repression that was really large-scale
and effective in destroying unions and
destroying independent politics and
eliminating independent thought and so
on and the same thing happened after
World War two with the phenomenon that's
mislabeled McCarthyism it's mislabeled
because it was actually initiated by the
Liberal Democrats in the late 1940s
McCarthy just came along at the tail end
of it and vulgarized it a little the
reason for this is a
is that periods of wars and turmoil have
a tendency to arouse people from apathy
and to make them think and to make them
organize often so that's why you get
things like the Red Scare and
McCarthyism right after periods of war
and turmoil and the same thing happened
after the Vietnam War which had the same
effect after the Vietnam War elites were
concerned about what they called a
crisis of democracy in fact one of the
most interesting books on this topic or
one of the most interesting books on
most of the insightful books I think on
modern on the modern democratic system
is called the crisis of democracy it's a
study the only book-length study
published by the trilateral commission
it's important group put together by
David Rockefeller in 1973 and it
represents the more or less liberal
internationalists from the three major
centers of modern capitalism the United
States Western Europe and Japan and its
trilateral and remember this is the
Liberals this is the group out of which
Jimmy Carter and most of his
administration came the quite what's the
crisis of democracy that they're
concerned with in all of the democratic
societies well the crisis is that during
the 1960's large groups of people who
are normally passive and apathetic began
to try to enter the political arena to
press their demands and that's a crisis
it has to be overcome the naive might
call that democracy but that's because
they don't understand the sophisticated
understand that that's a crisis of
democracy the American spokesmen again
Samuel Huntington wrote in his report
that Harry Truman had been able to
govern the country with the cooperation
of a relatively small number of Wall
Street lawyers and bankers in those days
there was no crisis of democracy things
were working just right but in the 1960s
he got all this turmoil I mean young
people and women
the labor I mean all kinds of weird
people who were supposed to be sitting
quietly in the corners began to get
involved and caused this crisis I mean
the same crisis that arose in the 17th
century and there repeatedly arises when
people begin to try to take advantage of
the formal opportunities that exist
among the terrible things that were
happening during the 60s causing this
crisis they said was that you had this
group of people who they called
value-oriented intellectuals people who
are concerned with things like truth and
justice and all that sort of nonsense
and they're opposed to the good guys the
technocratic and policy oriented
intellectuals they called them the
commissar that ones who just do the job
you know but had these value oriented
intellectuals and they were doing all
sorts of horrible things like under my D
legitimizing the institutions that are
responsible for the indoctrination of
the young like schools and universities
remember this is an internal discussion
so they kind of let their hair down
there are general proposal at the end of
all of this these lengthy and thoughtful
discussions was that what we need is
more moderation and democracy to
mitigate the excess of democracy and
overcome the crisis in plain terms what
that means is that the public has to be
reduced to their proper state of apathy
and obedience and driven from the public
arena if democracy is to survive and the
appropriate sense with the specialized
class you know the cool observers are
smart guys the technocratic and policy
are an intellectuals doing our job in
the interests of the people who have
real power
that's the liberal side I won't go into
what the reactionary side says about the
matter well to summarize there is a
standard view of democracy and it's the
view of Justice Powell the public should
assert another review that he expressed
at least the the view that the public
ought to assert meaningful control over
the political process and there's a
contrary view the contrary view is the
public's a dangerous enemy and it has to
be controlled for its own good
of course the way you control children
like you don't let a three-year-old run
across the street the first view is the
rhetorical view the second view is the
view that's actually held and you can
see that it's actually held when a
crisis of democracy erupts and the
unwashed masses begin to try to enter
into the political arena and have to be
somehow repressed either by force as in
the Red Scare or by other means in order
to overcome the crisis of democracy well
with regard to the media play a big role
in this and with regard to the media too
there is a standard view the standard
view for example is expressed again by
justice Powell and the same discussion
when he claims that it's the crucial
role of the media to affect the societal
purpose of the First Amendment that is
to it
allow the public to assert control of
the political process standard view was
also expressed by Judge Gurfein in an
important decision the Pentagon Papers
decision when he permitted the New York
Times to publish the Pentagon Papers and
he said we have a cantankerous press an
obstinate press a ubiquitous press and
it must be suffered by those in
authority in order to preserve the even
greater values of freedom of expression
and the right of the people to know
that's one view that's the standard view
and given that view we then have a
debate the debate is over whether the
quit over whether the media have gone
too far in their defiance of Authority
and their adversarial stance the
right-wing claims they've gone too far
they're overcome by a liberal bias we've
got to do something about it
the Liberals as in the trilateral
commission or in fact agree they in the
same study they say that the media
threatened government authority by their
adversarial stance and they've got to be
curbed
if they can't curb themselves the
government is going to move in the curve
curb them the executive director of
Freedom House Leonard Sussman asked
whether free institutions must be a must
free institutions be overthrown by the
very freedom they sustain rhetorical
question meaning we got to do something
about
this excess freedom that the press is
using to attack the government he was
writing about the Freedom House study of
the coverage of the Tet Offensive which
became a sort of a classic allegedly
showing that the press lost the war in
Vietnam by unfair criticism of the
government during the Tet Offensive it's
an interesting if there's no time to
talk about it I may try to get back to
it if not maybe get through the
discussion very interesting study it was
total fraud falsified the data you know
the whole thing was faked when you
actually correct the errors it turns out
that the press that the real charge of
Freedom House was that the press
although completely supportive of the
government policy and working completely
within the framework of government
propaganda nevertheless was too
pessimistic they said they didn't tell
you by what standards it was too
pessimistic the obvious standard is to
compare it with say internal US
intelligence assessments which we have
thanks to the Pentagon Papers and it
turns out the press was more optimistic
than US intelligence because they were
believing the public statement and they
know about the private statements so
Freedom House's complaint reduces to the
fact that the press though those totally
supportive of the propaganda didn't do
it in an upbeat enough fashion I
wouldn't have surprised George Orwell
that that should be the criticism of the
press produced by an organization called
Freedom House but that's become the
that's become the standard since
everyone refers to that as the study
that proves that the press was too
adversarial well that's the debate then
then the defenders of the press say no
we're not to adversary or maybe we are
too adversarial but you got to tolerate
us even though we're cantankerous and so
on that's essentially the issue well
outside of that debate between those who
say the press is too adversarial and
must be curbed and those who say well
yes the press is cantankerous and
impossible what we just have to suffer
that managers of freedom outside the
spectrum of that debate which
constitutes virtually the entire
mainstream discussion virtually the
entire discussion but
outside the debate there is another
position the other position challenges
the factual consumption that's taken for
granted in the debate according to this
alternative view the media do indeed
fulfill a societal purpose but a very
different one their societal purpose is
to inculcate and defend the economic and
social and political agenda of the
privileged groups that dominate the
domestic society and they do this in all
sorts of ways they do it by selection of
topics by distribution of concern by the
way they frame issues by filtering of
information by emphasis and tone by
simple fabrication sometimes but
crucially by the bounding of debate to
make sure that it doesn't go outside of
certain limits the bounding both in the
news columns and in the opinion columns
because of course the news columns
themselves embody all sorts of
assumptions and ideological
presuppositions and so on to the
according to this alternative view to
the extent that there is a liberal bias
it serves primarily to bound thinkable
thought that is to instill the
unchallengeable assumptions which in
fact reflect this rather narrow elite
consensus so the liberal bias performs a
real function it says thus far and no
further as far as you can go and I go as
far how far I go is still accepting the
basic presuppositions as unchallengeable
now within those bounds there's ample
controversy and it reflects the tactical
divisions among elites over how to
achieve generally shared aims but these
limits are very rarely transcended so
the media the function in accordance
with what my co-author Edward Herrmann
and I have called a propaganda model in
a recent book that's another view well
the proper the propaganda model has a
lot of predictions has a lot of
predictions about how the press is going
to behave but it also has a further
prediction the further prediction is
that no matter how well confirmed the
propaganda model is it cannot be taken
seriously and therefore must be
effectively excluded from mainstream
discussion
that actually follows from the model
itself the reason is that the model if
you think it through the model rejects
certain principles that are serviceable
to power that is it falls outside the
spectrum defined by the presupposition
that the media are adversarial and
cantankerous perhaps excessively so now
that presupposition is a useful one it's
serviceable to the interests of
established institutions to believe that
what you're reading is actually
criticism if it's in fact support that's
a technique it's a sophisticated
technique of indoctrination
and of course it's very serviceable to
the media themselves nice to think that
Europe you know pride yourself on being
an independent that courageous adversary
of power and since those assumptions are
serviceable they're going to be upheld
according to the propaganda model and no
serious challenge will be permitted
so that prediction indeed is very
readily confirmed the propaganda model
has never taken seriously it can't be
considered notice that the propaganda
model has a rather disconcerting feature
to it plainly as a matter of logic
it's either valid or invalid if it's
invalid you can dismiss it if it's valid
you must dismiss it because it's saying
the wrong thing so one way or another
it's got to be dismissed by its very
nature and notice the truth is no
defense it's very much like the
traditional doctrine of seditious libel
the doctrine that it's you can't it's
libelous it's a crime to criticize state
authorities because that undermines
power doctrine it runs up to pretty
modern times and truth was never a
defense against the dish's libel in fact
truth simply heightened the enormous
enormity of the crime of calling
authority into disrepute
and the same is true here well of course
the basic the basic questions are
factual are the standard assumptions
correct that is is it true that the
press is independent cantankerous
adversarial maybe excessively so or are
the assumptions of the propaganda model
correct that's factual question
and that's the main topic but I'm barely
going to be able to get into it but
before though I won't try to really you
know no no hope in a few minutes of
providing real evidence one way or
another let me just talk a little bit
about the the way you would deal with
this problems of methodological
questions first notice three comments
one the propaganda model has a certain
prior plausibility to it that is if
you'd simply accept uncontroversial
free-market assumptions quite
uncontroversial assumptions about how
society works you're led almost
automatically to the propaganda model
you can see that pretty simply simply
ask yourself what the media are now
notice here I'm talking about what some
might call the agenda-setting media the
media that set the frame that others
adapt to and that's pretty narrow group
it's primarily the New York Times and
The Washington Post and the three
television channels and a couple of
others it's not much else those set the
framework that everyone else pretty well
adapts to within anything like the
mainstream so we're talking about the
agenda-setting media and ask yourself
what they are well what they are is very
large corporations in fact they're
integrated with often owned by even
larger conglomerates now like other
businesses they have a product that they
sell to a market the market is
advertisers other businesses and the
product is audiences the media don't
finance themselves on their audiences in
fact the audiences are usually a loss
the more you subscribe the more the
newspaper loses money and of course the
television set you know they might
anything when you turn it on they make
their money from advertisers advertising
rates go up if you have a the right kind
of audience and certainly a relatively
privileged audience raises advertising
rates so what the media are just as an
institution is major corporations
selling relatively privileged audiences
to other businesses well what would you
expect to come out of such a system you
expect to come out something that
reflects the interests of the sellers
the buyers and the product
I wouldn't be very surprising in fact it
would be amazing if it weren't true
quite apart from that there are many
other things pressing in the same
direction there are after all centers of
power in the society the state the
corporate sector others and they can
impose punishments for things go wrong
and we will offer rewards if things go
right you gain by adapting to them less
costly and so on
furthermore the top managerial positions
in the media editors and colonists and
so on if you make it into those
positions you're part of the privileged
elite
part of the very top in fact though
that's where your associations are and
your perceptions and your friends and
people you play golf with and everything
else and it wouldn't be very surprising
again if you reflected the same
interests and it goes on if you think
through we'd discuss this in our book a
lot but if you think through it there
are just many pressures which lead
immediately to the assumption that the
propaganda model is highly plausible
even without any evidence it's at least
it's got prior laws ability in fact it
would be rather surprising if it weren't
true on uncontroversial assumptions
that's point one point two is it has a
lot of elite advocacy that's what I
started with pointing out that it
represents a position that intellectual
elites have thought the media ought to
observe and the whole system of
education and so on ought to serve
that's the position since the 17th
century probably the dominant position
it's necessary to manufacture consent
for the general good because of the
stupidity the average man and so on we
have to put aside these democratic
dogmatism so we have a position that has
prior plausibility and elite advocacy
and a third point is it's generally
accepted by the public there is very
striking that the debate over the media
is determined by the intellectuals and
they're the most indoctrinated sector of
the society and for them the only debate
is over whether the media are too
adversarial or not but there are polls
you ask the public what do you think
about the media and the public generally
thinks the media are too conformist and
to subordinate the power
in other words they automatically accept
something like the propaganda model so
here we have three facts a position that
has prior plausibility a lead advocacy
and rather general public support well
that doesn't prove that it's valid of
course but it does suggest that it ought
to be part of the discussion it's not
part of the discussion exactly as the
model predicts now by now turning to the
factual matter there are by now
thousands of pages of documentation
detailed close documentation on the
propaganda model and it's been tested in
just about every conceivable way it
subjected to the harshest tests we can
think of I think by now it's one of the
best confirmed theses of the social
sciences if there's any serious
challenge to it I've never seen it it's
generally just ignore it or else
caricature so what you have is this very
well confirmed thesis not proven very
well confirmed thesis no serious
challenge to it to my knowledge it has
prior plausibility the model is
plausible and uncontroversial
assumptions advocated by elites
generally supported by the public but
it's not part of the discussion exactly
in accord with its predictions it's off
the agenda well the next task and the
interesting one would be to look at
actual details as I say there's plenty
of things you can look at in print
indeed thousands of pages and more
coming out and I'm not going to I almost
hesitate to give examples because
they're misleading any set of examples
will be misleading because I think it's
predictions are essentially universally
confirmed with only statistical error so
giving examples this misleading because
you might argue plausibly that the
examples are not properly selected I'd
be a reasonable response and that's why
you have to look at a range of tests to
make sure they are properly selected
like let the people who think that the
media are adversarial pick their own
grounds that's the harshest test that
the model can face so let them pick the
grounds well they've picked their
grounds things like the coverage of the
Tet Offensive and so on and it turns out
that everything you go to Tet Offensive
Watergate
in Contra hearings you take a look at
them they show precisely the
subservience of the press to establish
power compare paired historical examples
I mean history doesn't run controlled
experiments but it runs things that are
reasonably close for example you can
find similar times and similar periods
when you can find atrocities of roughly
the same scale carried out by official
enemies or by ourselves and our clients
and look at the comparative coverage or
good deeds like elections carried out by
our clients and our enemies and look at
the comparative coverage all of these
tests and in fact every other one I've
ever been able we've ever been able to
concoct leads to the same conclusion the
propaganda model is quite valid as a
very good first approximation to the way
the media function just to give a few
examples and I stress again they're
misleading because they're few take say
the question of freedom of press
that's a picket because it's obviously a
matter that the press is naturally much
concerned about and in fact the press
has been very much concerned about
freedom of the press and the last deck
let's just keep to the last decade in
the last decade there's been plenty of
material in the press about freedom of
the press mainly in Latin America and
ask your friends to name one newspaper
in Latin America that has raised freedom
of press issues which newspaper in Latin
America has been suppressed unfairly by
a state and therefore we have to defend
it
well you know 99 people out of 100 will
name la prensa in Nicaragua and the
reason they will name it is because
there have been massive coverage of the
tribulations of La Prensa and Nicaragua
there was a study by in Harper's
Magazine by Francisco Goldman a media
analyst who found that the New York
Times alone was giving something like 5
references a month that's more than one
a week to the tribulations of La Prensa
and Nicaragua that's probably more
than all freedom of the press issues
throughout the rest of the world
combined
probably much more in fact well that's
an interesting choice we can take a look
at it if not not only coverage but also
enthusiastic support I mean the for
example in 1986 in June 1986 there was a
interesting series of events the World
Court condemned the United States for
its unlawful use of force and violation
of treaties in its war against Nicaragua
and called upon the United States to
desist from these crimes Congress
responded to this by voting a hundred
million dollars in aid to increase to
accelerate the unlawful use of force the
Reagan administration announced that
this is for real this is a real war and
there was enthusiastic coverage that the
World Court decision was simply
dismissed as an annoying bit of nonsense
either ignored or falsified but anyway
dismissed that's the court that was the
criminal not the United States and the
in response to this virtual declaration
of war as the Reagan administration
described it the Nicaraguan government
suspended La Prensa and that led the
virtual hysteria in the United States
the Neiman fellows that journalism
fellows at Harvard off immediately gave
the owner of La Prensa Violeta Chamorro
an award the Washington Post had a big
editorial saying she deserves ten awards
no that's a newspaper of Valor that was
the head of the that was the heading
that Murray Kempton the left liberal
columnist in the New York Review issued
a plea to people to provide funds for La
Prensa to keep its equipment going that
those funds could be added to the rather
substantial CIA subvention till the
prints ever since 1979 and on and on
well what is La Prensa the prince has an
interesting newspaper is probably unique
in history it's often believed that La
Prensa is the newspaper that
courageously opposed this the Somoza
dictatorship
and if you read the press that's what
you would believe well it does have the
same name as that newspaper but that's
about where it ends in 1980 the right
after the sanest Revolution the owners
of La Prensa fired the editor and 80% of
the staff left with him because the
staff and the editor refused to support
their Pro contra policy now the editor
and the staff formed another newspaper
on the way though the audio and if a
newspaper is constituted of its editor
and its staff that's the old La Prensa
if a newspaper is constituted of the
money that's behind it well of course
the new the print says the old la
princesa just decide how to decide know
what a newspaper is is it the staff and
the editor or is it the owners and the
equipment this you'll never read about
but it's a fact now the new la prensa
supports the overthrow of the government
by foreign power and does it quite
openly and it's funded by the foreign
power that is trying to overthrow the
government now that's pretty unusual in
fact I can't think of any remote
parallel in history the Western
democracies so for example during the
Second World War
England did not permit Nazi Germany to
put to fund and run a major newspaper in
London and the United States did not
permit Japan say to dominate you know to
invest in and run a major newspaper
coming out of New York in fact we have
to go that far
England and the United States imposed
harsh censorship they wouldn't even let
tiny little dissident newspapers go
through the mails or a pier and so on
there's no power there's no remote
parallel in Western history to this as
far as I can see this incidentally is
never mentioned in media commentary well
nevertheless a true civil libertarian
will defend La Prensa from harassment
even though this is unique in human
history this fact because of your real
civil libertarian you think that the
United States should have allowed Japan
and Germany
to dominate the American media during
the Second World War you're a real civil
libertarian but we now ask man that we
now make the obvious question I mean we
ask whether the you know the great
excitement virtual hysteria of American
intellectuals over La Prensa is reflects
their libertarian passions or whether
it's because they believe or whether
it's because they're serving power as a
propaganda model predicts that's a fair
question and there's a test there's an
obvious test and we all know how to
apply it it's a test that we apply all
the time when we look at our enemies so
for example suppose you take a look at
the productions of the East German Peace
group or the World Peace cannot slow
which is sort of communist front
organization you read their publicity
there and you'll see that they have a
lot of criticisms of the United States
often very valid criticisms in fact
their critical discussion of repression
in the United States and in u.s.
dependencies not only is often valid but
it's often the kind of thing that's not
reported here well do we honor them for
that no of course not we regard them
with contempt and the reason is because
we apply very simple and obvious tests
we ask what do they say about the
repression and atrocities for which they
are responsible well they say about
Soviet repression and atrocities and as
soon as we find out the answer to that
question we just simply dismiss them
with contempt rightly you begin by
talking about your own responsibility
and then sort of you know on a footnote
somewhere you can talk about the bad
things done by other guys at least if
you regard yourself as a moral agent you
know somebody worthy of minimal respect
and attention we understand that in the
case of our enemies and we might have
enough honesty to apply the same test to
ourselves so let's try it we can now
apply the test we have this tremendous
libertarian passion over La Prensa the
first newspaper in history to be funded
by a foreign power calling for the
overthrow of the government in which it
appears in which it's published and
remember this is not a major power it's
not like the United States which was
never under threat during the Second
World War there's a poor third
world country which is barely able to
survive the attack of the superpower so
that we have that and we can ask how the
same press has reacted to other examples
of repression during the same period in
fact in the same area well there are
test cases so let's try a few let's take
out Salvador right nearby except the US
client there once was an independent
press in El Salvador two small
newspapers electronica in El
Independiente two small newspapers they
were not supported by a foreign power
trying to overthrow the government they
were not particularly left-wing they
were independent run by businessmen they
sort of challenged the distribution of
power you know they said maybe we should
have some land reform or something like
that well they're not around anymore
they're not around because the
government that we armed fun train and
support sent its security forces to
destroy them one newspaper was
eliminated by the simple device of
taking an editor and a photo journalist
who were in a son Salvador restaurant
taking them out security forces went in
took them outside cut him to pieces with
machetes and left them in a ditch at
that point the owner fled and that took
care of one newspaper the second
newspaper that little harder took
several bombings three assassination
attempts on the editor finally the army
surrounded the premises with tanks and
then broke in and smashed the place up
and destroyed it they had previously a
machine-gunning attack had killed a
newsboy
at that point the editor fled that took
care of the second newspaper
well that was eight years ago so we can
now ask how much attention did that
receive that's an example of a violation
of freedom of the press a little more
severe than the harassment of La Prensa
well it doesn't answer to that you can
check the New York Times for example it
has never received one word of mention
in the New York Times news columns it
has never received one editorial
mentioned in all of these years and the
same is true the other media it simply
doesn't matter
these are atrocities committed by our
clients the guys we pay and train to do
that sort of thing
so all of a sudden they are concerned
for freedom of the press disappears or
let's take
another US client in fact the major US
client Israel which receives by far the
major US aid and is again not a small
country under attack by a superpower
well here here to history has set up
some interesting tests the same at
exactly the same time that Nicaragua
suspended La Prensa after the virtual
declaration of war in violation of the
World Court proceedings at the very same
time Israel closed down closed down
permanently to Jerusalem newspapers Arab
newspapers of course closed down to
Jerusalem newspapers on the charge that
the security forces had claimed that
they were supported by a terrorist group
by a hostile group well that went all
the way to the Supreme Court and Supreme
Court judge that that was legitimate
because in it as it explained in its
judgement no state will ever permit a
business no matter how legitimate it is
that's supported by hostile elements and
although we have freedom of speech in
Israel it does not extend to activities
that might threaten the security of the
state
well how much cover that's much more
severe than what happened in a la prensa
case how much coverage did that get well
actually that did get one mention in the
US press it was mentioned in a letter of
mine and the Boston Globe commenting on
the hypocrisy of the Nieman fellows
noticed that the they did not give a
prize to these editors in fact that was
never even reported after the Central
America Peace Accords la prensa was
opened the week right at the time it was
opened Israel closed a Nazareth
newspaper that's inside Israel closed
the Nazareth newspaper permanently on
grounds that it had it was supported
again by hostile elements the editor
again went to Supreme Court pleaded that
everything that appeared in the
newspaper passed through censorship that
was disregarded on the grounds that if
the state says it's supported by hostile
elements that's all that's required you
never need any evidence when the state
comes along and says security reasons
the courts just accept it
they also closed
a news office and Nablus on the grounds
that the editor who had already been in
who was already in jail in fact he was
in jail for having alleged not without
charge without legal charge on the claim
that he had contact with hostile
elements his wife had been running a
newspapers claimed that she'd maintained
those contacts they closed the press
office
well how much coverage did that get and
then the u.s. press answer as far as I
can find zero in both cases well I could
hear to hear some real controlled
experiments that history was kind enough
to set up for us I picked the week of
the suspension of the prints on the week
of the opening of La Prensa I picked a
case and I'll solve there just to round
it off let's take our other client state
Guatemala and let's come up to more
recent times Guatemala we the United
States enthusiastically supported a vast
outbreak of terror and violence in
Guatemala in the early 80s the
Reaganites were positively passionate in
their enthusiasm for this maybe a
hundred thousand people were slaughtered
something like that
maybe something roughly that
neighborhood however after sufficient
massacre had been carried out
they had what's called a democratic
election and there supposed to be a
democracy in Guatemala that's what they
tell us well one of the page during this
period of us-backed slaughter they
didn't have any censorship the problems
of the press were taken care of simply
by murdering journalists about 50
journalists were murdered including you
know television journalists right in the
middle of broadcast and so on and for
some reason you didn't need any
censorship when that was going on in
fact I was never barely discussed you
find bare mention of it the press well
after the return of democracy which we
pride ourselves on one of the editors
who had fled and was living in Mexico
decided to return and he opened a small
newspaper about a year ago last February
called la epoca again it wasn't calling
for the overthrow the government wasn't
supported by a foreign power it was just
a kind of a left liberal journal small
left liberal journal when he came back
to Guatemala there were immediately
death threats from the death squads
which are just adjunct to the security
forces warning him he was
you're gonna be killed or flee he wasn't
going out of her in that newspaper he
nevertheless made ahead and the
newspaper published a couple of issues
and then in July 15 armed men broke into
the offices fire bombed them kidnapped
the night watchman and destroyed the
premises the next day the editor Brian
Barrera held a press conference to which
no one came except some people from the
European press and said that plainly
there's no possibility for a free
expression in Guatemala he then received
another death threat warning him he
better get out of the country it'd be
killed he was taken to the airport by a
European ambassador to make sure that he
could get out alive and he fled back to
Mexico
well how much coverage does that get
answer zero nothing in the New York
Times nothing in the Washington Post
that's just last year now it's not that
they didn't know about it we know
perfectly well that they knew about it
first of all because it was on the
international it was on the wires and so
on and so forth but also because they
themselves referred to it obliquely
later about a month later there was an
article in The New York Times on some
cultural conference in Guatemala back in
the arts pages and the question on who
went there had some remark buried in
there about epoca the tripping point it
just doesn't matter I mean that's it's
not just harassment and suppression it's
it's you know destruction and physical
disruption and murder but it's carried
out by our clients so it doesn't matter
well those are the kinds of things you
find when you look that's the end of
this alternative views but Noam Chomsky
we'll be back next time and he'll
conclude his speech and take questions
from the audience we'd like to thank
Paula Kowski and Jim Dickerson who
provided us with the tape of the speech
of Noam Chomsky as it was recorded in
Eau Claire Wisconsin and also lore
