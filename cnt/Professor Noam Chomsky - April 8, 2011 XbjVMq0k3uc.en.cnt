ladies and gentlemen good afternoon my
name is John Osborne I have the honor to
serve as the Dean of the Faculty of Arts
and Social Sciences here at Carleton and
on behalf of the faculty and more
specifically on behalf of one of the
academic units in the faculty the
Institute of cognitive science it's my
great pleasure to welcome you all this
afternoon to this very special event
which is first of a new series of
lectures we have a Carleton being the
Andrew Brook distinguished lecture
series at Carleton we're very proud of
the fact that our engagement with the
process of critical thinking critical
inquiry is not something that we believe
should stop when we walk out the doors
of our classrooms but indeed it's
something that should be pervasive in
our university culture it's one of the
messages I tried to convey to first-year
students is that yes it's important to
go to class but it's also important to I
get involved in things that happen
outside of your classes and thus were
very pleased to have in the faculty very
lively active program of special
speakers and events and this is one of
the last of this academic year but
obviously from the numbers today the
fact that the website crashed for
registrations four times within the
first couple of hours obviously a very
very popular event so I'm very pleased
to welcome you all today and I'll now
call upon professor Raj Singh from the
Institute of cognitive science to
introduce today's speaker
thanks Johnny so on behalf of the
Institute of cognitive science here at
Carleton University I'd like to welcome
you all to today's and Dru Brook
distinguished lecture to be delivered by
MIT Institute professor Noam Chomsky as
you can imagine putting on an event of
this magnitude would not be possible
without many hands coming together in
common cause in the interest of time I'm
afraid I won't be able to acknowledge
all of you by name here today but please
know that all of us at the Institute of
cognitive science are extremely grateful
to you for your efforts
some of you however must be singled out
for having made this event possible in
the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences
our Dean John Osborne and the Institute
of cognitive science art director Joann
LaFave our graduate administrator LeAnn
du Brey are many many student volunteers
especially a graduate student francis
jensen and the institute of
interdisciplinary studies our faculty
colleagues bill Skidmore in Rebecca
shine both of whom you'll see more of
later this afternoon in this afternoon's
talk down across the border Bev stall at
MIT and last but not least
Andrew Brooke without Annie's vision and
pioneering efforts to develop a
cognitive science department here at
Carleton we wouldn't have been able to
experience the fascinating series of
cognitive science lectures that we've
witnessed so far and today's lecture
promises to continue this great
tradition please join me in thanking
these many individuals for their service
just a few words by way of protocol
before I introduce our speaker today so
professor Chomsky will speak for about
45 minutes this will be followed by a 45
minute question and answer discussion
session there will be roving mics so
please raise your hand if you have a
question for professor Chomsky now to
help facilitate an orderly discussion
we'd like to ask you to limit yourself
to a single short question no follow-ups
and please make sure that it is a
question yeah the only lecture we want
to hear today is the one Chomsky will be
delivering so no lectures no sermons
just a single short question please and
we can maximize the number of people who
get a chance to speak with I would guess
now the task of introducing someone that
the New York Times has called the
world's most important intellectual
alive is hard enough as it is but it
becomes even harder when you agree with
that assessment as I do so how do you
find the words to summarize in the span
of a few minutes the achievements of
someone you hold in such high regard
somehow you need to find a way to limit
your objectives and I'll limit mine by
trying to articulate just two of the
gifts that I think professor Chomsky has
given us so first in his intellectual
output he's delighted and stimulated our
minds by showing us ideas that I don't
think we would have reached without his
help
the world is a messy chaotic place and
in both of his intellectual lives one a
scientist of language in mind and the
other as a critic of power and the
intellectuals that serve it
he is pierced through the noisy surface
phenomena of the world and managed to
look into the deeper forces that that
governing the rest of us have been
fortunate to get a glimpse of these
fascinating world that Professor Chomsky
seems to have direct privileged access
to I don't know how the second gift is
the seriousness with which he takes his
role as a public servant someone of his
stature with many lifetime's worth of
good honest and indeed revolutionary
work would be justified in living a
peaceful restful life of well-deserved
privilege but professor Chomsky seems
to be incapable of feeling things that
come all too easily to people like me
fatigue frustration self-absorption more
than anyone I know professor Chomsky
devotes his time and energy to work with
other people he's constantly
corresponding through letters email
often time stamped late into the night I
don't think that's healthy traveling
around the globe giving talks to
audiences like this one with no obvious
benefit to himself but with many obvious
benefits to the rest of us ladies and
gentlemen it is a distinct honor and
pleasure for me to turn the floor over
to Professor Noam Chomsky
I presume you've seen the title language
and cognitive science revolutions and
cognitive science revolutions is plural
and that was by intention my own feeling
is that the major cognitive science
revolution that was in the 17th century
were generally I think there's a
considerable merit and then observation
by famous philosopher historian science
and philosophy powered North Whitehead
who wrote that a brief and sufficiently
accurate description of the intellectual
life of the European races to the
present is that they have been living
upon the accumulated capital of ideas
provided to them by the genius of the
17th century now that includes the a lot
of physics and so on but it which is but
but also it includes the foundations of
neuroscience and what are now called the
cognitive sciences as well as to
significant extent linguistics and to a
large extent philosophy of language in
mind
now unfortunately whiteheads remark is
not accurate for these fields it could
be and I think it should be that it
should have been that they had been
living on that accumulated capital but
they have actually not been to their
detriment I think and in some respects
what was beginning to be discovered back
in the 17th century has been mostly lost
particularly in such crucial areas of
the theory of meaning of the natural
language I will come back to that to a
few remarks about that if there's time
toward the end well in contemporary
usage of the term cognitive
science refers to developments since
secession in the 1950s and they have
certainly been significant it's commonly
called the cognitive revolution my own
feeling is that it's it seems to be less
revolutionary than often supposed if we
take into account earlier often
forgotten achievements well the title of
the talk raises a more substantive
question the phrase language and the
cognitive revolutions presupposes that
language exists that is that it exists
as an independent object of serious
study and not as just some arbitrary
collection of various phenomena and
processes they're more or less like say
today's weather there's no science of
today's weather though there may be of
the many factors that enter into it
well that language exists in a serious
sense that might seem unconventional is
very far from that a major tendency in
the cognitive sciences probably the
dominant one holds that does not exist
and sometimes stakes that forcefully and
quite explicitly it's implicit in much
of the other work well it's worth
remembering that there's nothing new in
that stance so 50 years ago it was
widely held by the most prominent
philosophers and psychologists that
language that does not exist in any
serious since it's just a matter of
conditioning and some obscure notion of
induction and analogy so for probably
the most influential philosopher in the
period and W equine of Harvard a
language is just a fabric of sentences
associated with one another and with
stimuli by the mechanism of
conditioned response and a quite
arbitrary fabric depending on the
accidental history of conditioning then
that was a widely held view even though
if you think about it for a minute it's
actually incoherent where did the notion
sit-ins come from how is a sentence
different from say swimming or catching
a ball or any other act that allegedly
is the result of Association conditioned
response but well in professional
linguistics a dominant view 50 years ago
and more it was that languages can
differ without limits
apart from very restricted constraints
like maybe choice of phonetic features
which could be properties of the
articulatory apparatus and incidentally
the same thing was held about biological
organisms that they could very
essentially without limit depending on
accidental history of selectional
processes by now that's won't go on but
that was the view of the time well
another a further elaboration of this is
that linguistic theory to the extent
that exists at all was just a kind of a
battery of procedures to reduce a body
of data called the corpus to some
organized form in one way or another and
how you do it depends on your particular
purposes but there's nothing real about
it there's no truth of the matter no
serious study later versions of the
non-existence hypothesis within
philosophy were that rules of language
can be justifiably postulated only if
they are in principle accessible to
introspection a dogma that's largely
incoherent in my opinion but that if we
excluded in if we follow it somehow it
excludes virtually everything there are
other variants among them what
prominently the insistence again by
permanent philosophers and others that
language must be regarded as a
socio-political entity of some kind so
it's dependent on things like continuity
of Empires and colors on maps the
literary cultures and national myths
military forces and so on but can be
studied nothing that complex can be
studied a corollary in the mid twentieth
century and since is that there are no
real problems to solve in the study of
language if it doesn't exist as a
serious topic and have a problems now
the only problem would be the only thing
to do is accumulation an organization of
data may be what Vidkun Stein called an
assembly of particulars actually I was a
student in the 1940s at our view was
student monk view among the students was
you know this is kind of fun but what
happens when we've published the
structural analysis of every language so
a finite number of them using the
methods of analysis that were
promulgated which is for assumed to be
more or less settled apart from some
details and which in principle could be
automated in fact the early 1950s the
early days of computers right it was
anticipated that they soon would be
automated so that it would be a mistake
to do anything in linguistics except
just collect data and when the computers
get big and fast enough pour it into the
computers and grind out the procedures
and everything else oh come that's
actually a view that was held quite
explicitly by leading professionals and
the view was pretty sensible given the
non-existence of soldier didn't actually
similar views are not quite prevalent
today namely that the only real object
is
corpus of data and that by automated
analysis in complicated Bayesian
statistics and so on one can derive
everything that's relevant about the
language well the announced topic
language and other cognitive systems
cognitive revolutions that not only
presupposes the existence of language
but are also presupposes a modular
approach to the mind that taking it to
be much like the rest of the organism
that is some complex of subsystems often
informally called organs with enough
internal integrity so that it makes
sense to study each in abstraction from
the others with which it is integrated
and with which it interacts and the life
of the organism so for example the
visual immune that digestive and other
organs the below the neck metaphorically
speaking and the various so-called
mental organs language planning various
structures of memory the organization of
action and so on whatever the right
analysis turns out to be the
neuroscientist Randy galliston has
observed that the biological norm is
modular systems with special accordion
with special growth and learning
mechanisms in different domains and in
different species and I think that's
correct and I think there's every reason
to expect human language to keep to the
biological norm in this respect even
more so because there are apparently
crucial features of human language that
appear to be quite isolated in the
biological world no nothing homologous
in fact nothing closely analogous also
these properties seem to have emerged
very recently in evolutionary time many
millions of years after the separation
of modern
humans from any other surviving species
might say that there were apparently a
lot of hominids but they're all gone
possibly because humans are such a
predatory species nobody knows exactly
why well my own assumption is that
language does exist as a module of the
mind and body mostly the brain but that
the non-existence of products in its
contemporary form in the cognitive
sciences is it's actually raising the
right questions I think although
pursuing them in a manner that's almost
guaranteed to fail at least as failure
and success have been understood for
centuries in the sciences important
point that I'll come back to the study
of language of evolution of language is
quite a hot topic these days that you
can see that by just looking at the
number of books and articles that pour
out with titles like that it's rather
odd in many respects that one reason is
what's odd is that there there are many
much simpler questions which are
scarcely investigated at all because
they're regarded is much too hard so for
example the evolution of communication
and the hundreds of species of these is
plainly a far simpler question but it's
just recognised to be too hard to study
another reason is that very little is
known about cognition the evolution of
cognition generally and furthermore it's
quite possible that nothing much will
ever be known at least by the by any
methods that are understood at all today
that's a conclusion that's been argued
quite forcefully anything persuasively
by a leading evolutionary biologist
Richard Lewontin in the essays that are
well known but
fortunately neglected and a look at the
literature by now quite large literature
on the evolution of language reveals
that it barely even addresses the topic
instead it consists almost entirely of
speculations on evolution of
communication there which is a totally
different matter I mean you can use
language for communication you can use
other things for communication most
language uses not for communication so
there's different topics also this
literature if you look at it carefully
it's based quite often on the very
strange beliefs about evolution will
briefly return to some of them well I
don't have to leave this hanging up in
the air so let me pick there happens to
be one recent essay which very neatly in
capital capsule AIT's clearly the main
assumptions of the contemporary non
existence approach the language in its
evolution the prestigious journal
Science magazine Journal of the reply
yes so I'll use that as an example but
it's just one illustration of many now
this is a review article that discussing
books on evolution of language by a
scholar the Max Planck Institute in jaen
field he finds nothing essentially
nothing of value in the books that are
reviewed and the reason he says is that
they're all Leafly hated by the
existence assumption that is the belief
that there's something to study the
belief that there are that there are
that rule systems of some kind that
determine what's a sentence for meaning
relations the conditions of language use
and so on
to illustrate the fallacy of the
existence approach the article is
accompanied by a photograph of three
infants the suitably interracial and
apparently noticing one another
if you look at the picture and the
caption reads the communication without
syntax the point is to show that rural
systems of the kind studied under the
existence assumption aren't necessary
for communication actually they could
have given a picture of three bacteria
that would have just as well this is
both the author and the editors that's
your idea the title of the article is
with without social context with a
question mark the question mark
expresses the surprised at the fallacy
of the existence approach because it
ignores social context when it seeks to
determine none of the functional rules
that allegedly say relate form and
meaning that determined conditions of
language use and so on well again to try
to make the matter concrete let's take
take an actual example it was simple
enough so in order to black word so just
take the sentence he wondered whether
the mechanics fix the cars and just
consider two questions that you could
ask about that the two questions are how
many cars did he wonder whether the
mechanics fixed the answer three cars
that how many mechanics did he wonder
whether fixed the cars answer three
mechanics but the trouble is you know
you can't say that for some reason you
can't ask how many mechanics did he
wonder whether fixed the cars
the technical terms that's called an e
CP violation with the matter what that
is you could the thought is fine fine
thought but you have to express it in
some kind of paraphrase there's
something about the language design
which poses a barrier to communication
you just can't express a simple thought
like that you need a certain locution
many such
animals well to investigate such
questions of these and according to say
the editors of science and the author of
the article you have to consider the
social context of the use of these
expressions the normal use
now that's very quickly finished that
there is none so you're done but it's a
mistake to raise the question anyway
from this point of view because the
sentences are constructed they're
constructed as an experiment they're not
drawn from a massive corpus of data
where you'd never find anything like
this that is the inquiry proceeds by the
methods of the sciences as they've been
understood since antiquity but that's
another serious flaw and I love to do
that the observation about social
context is actually uncontroversial with
regard to communication I can't study
communication without social context
that's virtual tautology and so of
course the study of communication takes
it into account but it's also
uncontroversial with the study of the
mechanisms so that we put to use in
action whatever it is that study
typically ignore social context and
quite rightly so for example for those
of you know this work the classic work
on the neurophysiology of vision says
you bell and weasels workroom which they
got the Nobel Prize or work on the
object recognition and constancy say
Elizabeth spell key Renee by our German
and others or for example semen Ullman's
study of how very minimal stimuli
remarkably minimal are interpreted as
rigid objects in motion or in fact
virtually all of the fundamental work
that aims to determine the properties of
the modules of cognition at whatever
level is conducted whether it's nor
physiological
behavioral perceptual whatever it
ignores social context totally just as
following the normal methods of the
sciences
now however instructed that the study of
mechanisms used say in the examples I
mentioned these ECT examples over the
study of for example vowel harmony in
Turkish or of the relative scope of
operators or in fact everything else
about language has to depart from the
scientific norm that's a principle it
cannot follow the methods of the
sciences well this kind of critique
which is quite widespread is in fact
accompanied by a novel concept of
science that has emerged in the
computational cognitive sciences and
related areas of linguistics with this
new notion of science which is all over
the literature an account of some
phenomenon is taken to be successful to
the extent that it approximates
unanalyzed data so for example take say
the study of B communication according
to this conception the way it's
generally conducted by B Sciences is a
serious error what they do is devise
complex experiments the circumstances
that never arise in nature so for
example having these training these to
fly to a flower on an island to check to
see if there's an odor trail things like
that and even more complex ones but that
never occurs in nature of course it's
actually according to this conception of
science this new conception what they
ought to be doing is taking the huge
number of videotape so the bees is
swarming and do statistical analysis
achieve that a greater and greater
approximate excessive in approximating
the the videotapes and getting a
tolerably good prediction of what will
happen the next time the score actually
much better
envy scientists can give and actually is
no reason not to do physics the same way
now so don't worry about balls rolling
down frictionless planes and other
things that you know current nature but
what you do is do extensive statistical
analysis of videotapes of what's going
on outside the window let's say you know
leaves flying and so on and so forth and
other natural events and by elaborate
statistical analysis
try to get some approximation to it that
you get a pretty good prediction about
what's likely to happen next again a far
better prediction than the physics
department can give or would care about
for that matter the major cognitive
science journals than general journals
like science regularly publish articles
triumphantly enlisting dramatic failures
which are called successes because they
accord with this new concept which is
unique in the history of the sciences
and very radically restricted in fact
almost specifically the language so no D
would suggest it for physics or B
communication or almost anything else
that because though I've easily observed
that people would just laugh in fact
it's not even suggested for systems as
close to a language as arithmetic olkhon
suppose that capacity so you don't study
arithmetic or capacity by constructing
models based on a statistical analysis
of masses of observations of what
happens when say people try to multiply
numbers in their heads they're without
external memory and at least I hope
nobody does then the infield and the
same article he also puts forth a
far-reaching thesis which is quite
standard in the cognitive sciences and a
very clear expression of the
nonexistence hypothesis quote him he
says language is entirely grounded in a
constellation of cognitive capacities
that each take it separately
other functions as well the notice
that's kind of an updating of the 1950s
the position that I quoted well that
means that language exists that only in
the sense that there exists such a thing
is today's weather which is also a
constellation of many factors that
operate independently for example these
ECP examples that they mentioned the a
few sites a source to justify the
conclusion but if you look at the source
it has essentially no relation to it and
that's not because he's chosen badly
that's because there are none that do
any better
nobody's corrected saying that this is
what most cognitive sciences believe
there's another influential version of
the idea that language doesn't exist
it's sort of highly dominant and
language acquisition studies leading
figures Michael Tomasello so in a recent
handbook of child development he
explains that there aren't any
linguistic rules and there's nothing to
say about descriptive regularities like
those easy P examples rather there's
nothing at all except the structured
inventory of meaningful meaningful
linguistic constructions all of them
meaningful linguistic symbols that are
used in communication that's his topic
there being no such thing as language
the inventory is structured only in the
sense that its elements the words idioms
sentences like the one I'm now speaking
they're all acquired by processes of
pattern finding schema dies ation and
abstraction that are coming to all
primates a few other processes all left
quite obscure so in other words these
ECP examples that I meant
according to this story our learned just
the way a child learns the word horse or
an idiom like how do you do or say kick
the bucket meeting die and so on or the
sentence are all learned exactly the
same way and the child somehow learns
that the ECP violation is not usable for
communication even though the thought is
fine that although the other expression
somehow is and presumably expressions
could have virtually any other
properties in the next language you look
at in fact the inventory as in the 1950s
versions is essentially an arbitrary
collection of unanalyzed linguistic
symbols and it's also finite just like
coins pattern apart from some hand
waving actually I can think of no
rational interpretation for any of this
but it's overwhelmingly dominant in the
fields you might think about it in field
also presents a closely related thesis
that's also very widely held or quoted
there are well-developed gradualist
evolutionary arguments to support the
conclusion that there's no such thing
that has language except as a complex of
arbitrary complex of independent
cognitive processes again no relevant
sources cited and none exist he invokes
this gradualist evolutionary thesis in a
critique of what he calls the South
Asian estar Gyu Minh transition from
finite to infinite to unbounded was not
gradualist that's a strange position but
a standard one it's a logical truth that
the transition was South patientis
no other way to go from finite to
unbounded but South Asian astiz a dirty
word and many circles in the cognitive
Sciences on the basis of a very curious
but widespread misunderstanding of
evolutionary biology it's worth
exploring maybe but I put it aside here
the idea that everything has to happen
in small steps no evolutionary
biologists believe that it's a example
take one recent book by two prominent
evolutionary biologists they take as the
central problem the question how can
small random genetic changes be
converted into complex useful
innovations may give many examples that
one of the leading paleoanthropologists
concludes that the innovation that set
the stage for language acquisition that
moment of evolution that depended on the
phenomenon of emergence whereby a chance
combination of pre-existing elements
results in something totally unexpected
a sudden and emergent event presumably
some neural change in some population of
the human lineage rather minor in
genetic terms that probably has nothing
whatever to do with that application
quotes all of this is salvation' ism
with a vengeance standard in the actual
sciences but considered the like a dirty
word and cognitive science again
intriguing well the fact as we know very
little about evolution of language maybe
we never will but there are a few fairly
clear conclusions and they're kind of
suggested so for example there's very
good evidence that the language capacity
is the same for all human groups which
is kind of surprising if you think about
it so for bids it's apparently a fact
that if you take say an infant from some
remote tribe in the Amazon the
hasn't had other human contact for you
know twenty thousand years and you bring
it to say Boston its language will be
that of my grandchildren and conversely
there are individual differences but
there's no known group differences so it
follows that there's been no meaningful
evolutionary change with regard to
language ever since the time when our
common ancestors who are generally
assumed to be quite a small group maybe
even in the hundreds left African
roughly about fifty thousand years ago
and if you go back say fifty thousand
years before that there's no evidence in
the archaeological record of the
existence of language at all so
somewhere in that very narrow window
from an evolutionary point of view of
their flick of an eye
somewhere in that window there seems to
have been a sudden explosion and as you
see it in the archaeological record a
sudden explosion of creative activity
that complex social organizations the
symbolic behavior of various kinds the
recording of astronomical events and so
on that's what Jared Diamond's called a
great leap forward it's generally
assumed and plausibly assumed by
paleoanthropologists to be associated
with the emergence of language and then
since that done there appears to have
been no relevant evolutionary change if
you want to double or triple the numbers
nothing much changes well these simple
observations which are reasonably well
supported provides some plausible
suggestions about language design I'll
return to them briefly well suppose we
now assume that language exists that is
that this meeting is not a waste of time
and suppose we want
look at language as a normal biological
system some module of the organism then
the standard questions for any module
arrives at once
roughly speaking what how and why
questions what are the properties of the
acquired system each one regarded as an
internal system of an individual how are
these properties acquired and why do
they have these properties and not some
other properties well perhaps the most
elementary property of human language is
that it consists of a discrete infinity
of interpretable expressions so there's
five word sentences and six word
sentences and no five and a half word
sentence goes on indefinitely like the
integers now that's kind of unusual
there's nothing like that known in the
biological world so that's one isolated
property and maybe down to the level of
DNA what it means is that each speaker
each child has somehow internalized a
computational process what's called a
generative process that yields an
infinite array of hierarchically
structured expressions and each of these
is interpreted in fact duly interpreted
interpreted that what are called
interfaces with other systems sensory
motor interface for external ization for
making it available to others and the
what's called the conceptual intentional
interface that means thoughts of
planning of action and so on it's a way
of saying that language is sound with
meaning
Aristotle's common sense dictum the
unbounded range is a very elementary
fact about language that appears to have
been barely noticed if at all until the
17th century scientific revolution it
was noticed by Galileo
Descartes and others and they were quite
mystified by it that it played quite a
significant role especially in Cartesian
thought if you look at it well and
approach the language that doesn't at
least capture this property can possibly
be taken seriously but for language and
any other module internal system whether
it's the visual system or anything else
its growth and development in the
individual involves at least three
factors the one factor is external data
which can have a big effect on any any
system the second is a genetic endowment
that converts for a cognitive module
converts data to experience and guides
the general course of development then
third that principles of broader scope
is presumably laws of nature which are
invariably a major factor in evolution
and development it's much better
understood now than it was 50 years ago
well for language we can analyze the
genetic endowment into a component
specific to human language standard term
for that is universal grammar or UG and
other components of the genetic
endowment that somehow are relevant to
language development so other cognitive
systems and there are physiological
structures and so on it would seem prima
facie that Yugi is critically involved
in determining such phenomena as the one
the one that I gave as an example this
ezp example I feel look closely it's
likely that third factor principles
general laws of nature are also crucial
for that but we can explore the role of
ug and the very early stages of language
development not with complex examples
like that that for example is unknown
that newborn infant instantly and
reflexively extract language relevant
data from the famous that a blooming
buzzing confusion around them that's no
trivial task know when those how that's
done and it's human specific so the
infant's pet kitten their Jim Ben's a
year whatever can't do it it just gets
the data but somehow in an infant pics
out of all of this data instantly and
reflexively the parts that are somehow
language related also also the infant
very quickly acquires knowledge of the
general what's called the presiding
system pitch stress rhythm zone which is
specific to language in fact that even
happens prenatally but as evidence
that's going on in utero and actually
the some of the neural tissues that are
specifically dedicated to this are now
have now been identified and they're
also a human specific well then it
within a couple of months that seems
true the sound system generally it all
appears to be just dependent on that ug
in particular neural structures
associated with ug some of the early
steps may also involve other cognitive
processes so for example in my own first
work on this topic background sixty
years ago I took for granted that the
extraction of words from running
discourse that's a tricky operation to
the kid is hearing just running
discourse I was it breaking the works
assume that this has gotta be based on
evaluation of transitional probabilities
which you know go up and down depending
we're word boundary is so it seemed that
said there just seemed to be no other
relevant evidence however the matter
turns out to be more complex than much
more interesting the recent work shows
that this method fails although the
results very sharply improve when it
interacts with UG principles oh so for
example six month old infants segment
running text running discourse into
elements with word like properties when
high transition probabilities are
aligned with phrasal prose otic
constituents it's a pretty abstract
notion but phrasal prose otic
constituents are picked up by the
language system and if they're aligned
with the sharp that arrives in
transitional probabilities then you get
something like word like elements out of
text well now all of this is done by
unconscious completely unconscious and
reflexive processes well although real
results remain very sparse country to
many claims the role of statistical
reasoning and other cognitive processes
and language acquisition that
potentially at least should be a
significant area of research there's
something that's never been in doubt
since the early origins of current work
there are also presumably the conditions
on imposed on language by the structure
of the brain although so little is known
about that that just can't throw any
conclusions there's knowledge about
localization few other things but
nothing about how it's actually working
in fact it could mean that there were
settings were to look in the wrong place
Randy galas look in well-known nor
linguist he's argued again pretty
persuasively that a fundamental the
reorientation and centuries of the study
of the brain of the brain are going to
be necessary to discover the neural
roots of the computational capacities
that not only in something like human
language have been either than the
insects that wherever the quite
astonishing when you look at them well
let's turn to ug the question whether
language exists is basically the
question whether ug exists is there some
genetic element that's specific to
language as I mentioned this is commonly
denied but I simply am unaware of any
coherent alternative in the early work
on this topic in the 1950s it seemed as
though Eugene must be extremely rich to
achieve any degree to allow any degree
of descriptive adequacy in dealing with
the complexities of language and one
major goal of theoretical linguistics
and maybe the major goal since that time
has been to reduce the postulated
complexity of ug in accounting for the
phenomena of language the reasons for
this pursuit are quite straightforward
and one of them is just normal rational
inquiry so that is trying to achieve
greater explanatory text another reason
is the hope that maybe someday there'll
be an eventual serious study of
evolution of language the evidently this
task to the extent that it's feasible at
all is rendered more difficult to the
extent that the postulated target ug is
more complex
well actually the nonexistence approach
shares the same goal to reduce ug
actually there is zero in that
conception but there are several salient
differences between these two approaches
to the question the first is with regard
to results I think I can't show it here
but I think it's fair to say that there
are virtually no results in the non
existence literature except in terms of
this curious notion of science that has
been contrived that departing from the
entire
of science what I mentioned in contrast
they're quite substantial results of the
existence literature overwhelmingly they
result from investigating that took what
I call third factor considerations the
considerations of computational
complexity back to the inquiry hasn't
been phrased in those terms but that's
what it comes down to if you look at it
closely as these steps of for those of
you know what I'm talking about it will
mean anything to others but these steps
include the dissolving constructions
into more general components elimination
of phrase structure grammar z' which
have extremely rich stipulations the
radical reduction of the complexity of
transformational grammars that these
were designed to accommodate
non-contiguous relations which are
ubiquitous phenomena and in the
displacement and morphological
discontinuity and finally in more recent
years unification of these two
approaches in what appears to be the
simplest possible computation
computational operation one which has to
operate in any a generative system and
seems to accommodate both of these or so
it's poked in the recent years the
inquiry into these topics is often
called the minimalist program but that
term has been extremely misleading I'm
sorry I ever used it as it's just
ordinary science normal ordinary science
extending the main thrust of theoretical
linguistics is since the early earliest
days of contemporary work in the 1950s
and these developments are pretty
natural if you think about it the
language is very clearly a computational
system so it makes very good sense to
seek the role of general principles of
computational efficiency that apply far
more broadly and
indeed the rooted in the organism
independent to natural law and that's
that's particularly natural given the
little we know about the evolution of
language so go back to that it appears
overwhelmingly clear that a generative
process that suddenly emerged at some
pretty recent point may be in the window
that I mentioned great leap forward
right about then well it emerged that
individual that's mutations don't take
place in groups so some individual was
fortunate or unfortunate enough to get
this generative capacity well that's
maybe some slightly pre wiring in the
brain if furthermore there was no
selectional pressure at that time and it
couldn't be it's just something that
happened to an individual and so what
you'd presumably expect what appeared at
that point to be just determined by
natural law there's no other pressures
something kind of like a snowflake and
the same would be true as this capacity
of this property is transmitted to
offspring
notice that the capacity itself that has
selectional advantage but as the person
had this capacity could think it could
plan could interpret you know could
construct internally of course complex
thoughts that you'd expect would have
advantage transmitted to offspring and
some small hunter-gatherer group maybe
couple hundred people and could take
over most of the group after some period
and at that point there would be a
reason to externalize it to make it
available to others so it's not just
your own head and that seems to be the
way language works with externalize
ation being an ancillary process well
consider again the what questions as
soon as the question was addressed
within the framework this
general framework about 50 years ago
that many puzzles came to light which
had previously been unnoticed actually
some of them are still on the agenda
back to that moment is somewhat
reminiscent of the early very early
modern scientific revolution so for
millennia the scientists had been
satisfied with traditional answers to
such simple questions as why a rock
falls to the ground and steam rises to
the sky they're seeking their natural
place Aristotle's answer so that ends
that problem 17th century scientists
were the first ones actually to have
allowed themselves to be puzzled by that
and to investigate it and they very very
quickly discovered that conventional
beliefs were completely false well at
that point science entered no phase to
moderate phase and the capacity to be
puzzled is very wealth well worth
cultivating that's essentially the
Galilean Revolution I don't think it's
happened in other fields but it begins
with the capacity to be puzzled about
very simple phenomena not just to say
well it's natural so nothing to look at
there were myriad puzzles that emerged
as soon as the first efforts were made
beyond you know to go beyond hand waving
about analogy in trading and pattern
formation and so on I'll mention to at
least one maybe two if there's time
because these are among the very few
cases for which answers have been sought
relying on the non non linguistic
cognitive processes and typically
adopting the nonexistence assumption
that one very hoary example has to do
with what's called auxiliary inversion
so take the sentence it can evils that
fly swim simple sentence we understand
right away that the question is whether
evils can
swim not whether they can fly that is
the auxiliary element can is associated
with swim not with fly that's obvious
from the interpretation it's also
obvious from just plain morphology you
can say things like our Eagles that fly
swimming where they are is going with a
swim obviously have Eagles that fly been
swimming
you can't however say are Eagles that
fly swimming it has a meaning it means
is it the case that evils that are
flying swim but kids say it that way
it's something about the design of
language that hampers communication that
compels a paraphrase much like those ECP
examples that I mentioned this is a
perfectly good thought but just can't
express it except in some roundabout
complex way some result of language
designed so the thoughts are fine it's
just can't can't articulate them well
this simple question about auxiliary
inversion which is quite trivial it had
never arisen in millennia of careful
study of language because the point was
just taken to be obvious you like object
seeking their natural place but why
should it be the case so take the
sentence again can Eagles that fly swim
just on a vase of ease of computation
you'd expect that the Fritton of
zillionaire e10 should be associated
with the closest verb that's the easiest
computation hence with fly not with swim
the actually communication would be
facilitated
if both options were available and that
would avoid the need for complex
paraphrase in one case so if you want to
put the matter a little bit differently
there are two concepts of minimal
distance that are available that one is
a minimal linear distance that's just
count get the two things that are
closest that would relate
the sentence to Eagles that can fly swim
Kennedy gel's and fly Swift that's
minimal linear distance wrong result
minimal structural distance it relates
the sentence to Eagles of fly can swim
and eagles and fly swim the writers own
the reason is that Eagles are the client
is a phrase and you look at the
structural distance candidates the
clothes wouldn't if it's near swim well
the question then is why does the
language learner reflexively minimize
the property of structural distance
there rather than adopting the
computationally far simpler property of
linear distance or for that matter
adopting both of them which would
facilitate communication as I said well
notice that there is a good answer to
the white question minimal structural
distance remains unchallenged that not
only in these constructions but in
plenty of comparable constructions in
every language where such things exist
so it's a it's an answer to the white
question somehow minimal structural
distance is built-in and the question
doesn't arise for the child it's the
only choice that still leaves the how a
question and the why question there's a
very simple and quite likely correct
answer and that has to do with the
general architecture of the language
faculty so go back to Aristotle's dictum
languages sound with a meaning but
probably the case that that's not quite
accurate the language is not sound with
a meaning but its meaning with sound now
that it was quite different now that
means that the core of the language
faculty is in a generous procedure that
yields structured expressions that are
interpreted at the thought system
conceptual intentional system while
externalization to the sensorimotor
system is a secondary process
well linear order is clearly required
for externalization but
it appears for the core systems of the
thought syntax and semantics it seems
then that it's just a reflex of the
sensory motor system then as you would
expect it varies depending on the
sensory modality that's used for
external ization so it's somewhat
different for a sign and speech say well
though it's not uncontroversial in this
empirical issues there is growing
evidence that this is indeed the case so
as I mentioned it fits very well with a
little we know about evolution and
what's known about language more
generally I won't go into that but it's
true it would also follow that
communication is an even more peripheral
aspect of language than I mentioned
before of communications contingent on
external ization and that the
substantial literature of speculation on
language evolution is simply on the
wrong track well if that's correct you
immediately get answers to the how and
why questions for auxiliary inversion
the linear order is simply not available
to the language learner the Language
Learners is guided by a very simple
principle of universal grammar look for
minimal structural distance and that's
the only one available because you don't
have linear distance except that's a
peripheral part of language and that
determines the general architecture of
language and it's computationally quite
natural well auxiliary inversion has
been the topic of a considerable inquiry
industry in computational cognitive
science in fact it's the main topic
that's been studied to try to show that
the child acquires this knowledge on the
basis of statistical analysis of the
corpus of data in accordance with the
nonexistence thesis and they're the
papers that come out regularly on this
even the past few weeks they're very
curious properties one is that every one
of them fails and fails dramatically
second is they're all cited as examples
of successes in the literature and they
are examples of successes in terms of
this new notion of success which departs
from the entire history of science
that's more or less matching unanalyzed
data another curiosity is that they all
ignore the simple explanation which is
pretty well conceptually that
empirically based the minimal structural
distance for the reasons I mentioned
another reason is it wouldn't matter if
these approaches succeeded although the
people caring about them seem to
perceive that if these methods succeeded
it would mean nothing because if you had
a in a non language which used linear
distance rather than structural distance
the methods would work for that too but
that's not the case every language uses
structural distance so either if they
work than the total failures it wouldn't
mean anything but that doesn't seem to
matter well kind of a background
question that you might think about is
how does the child even know what the
intended interpretation is in such a
sentences can evils that fly swim unless
it's already relying on the minimal
structure their structural distance
principle without any data at all well I
was going to talk about some of the
cases but I think it's a I'll skip it
because I really do if you like but
there are one or two other cases that
have been extensively discussed in the
computational science literature that's
exactly the same thing you find the same
thing total failures
regardless successes wouldn't matter if
they worked and it's considered funny
it's a strange thing about cognitive
science projects they have to sort of
been thinking about it well I don't end
without at least mentioning another
extremely serious problem which has been
barely addressed a computational
procedure requires certain atoms of
computation something to start with
therefore language that's called a
lexicon a lexicon of minimal elements
may be roughly word life but not exactly
even the simplest of these elements
erased fundamental puzzles fundamental
problems about how they relate to the
mind external world well there are two
aspects to the question the one is
meeting the other sound the sound aspect
is secondary Chancellor if the reasoning
I reviewed earlier proves accurate for
sound that's been investigated the
answers lie in articulatory and acoustic
phonetics and the problems are hard
they've been studied intensively for 60
years they using sophisticated
technology given some answers but it
leaves many outstanding problems
well what about meaning now that hasn't
been investigated because of failure to
reach the level of a Galilean revolution
there's a standard answer like objects
go to their natural place the standard
answer is provided by what's called
referential its doctrine so the word cow
picks out cows that maybe by some causal
relation actually something like that
does seem to be proved for animal
communication so
the symbols and the animal communication
do appear to relate to physically
identifiable external or internal states
so say for a vervet monkey motion of
leaves elicits a warning cry which we
interpret a saying when an Eagles coming
on how the verb it interprets or say I'm
hungry
it goes back to an internal hormonal
state which is identifiable and nothing
remotely like that is true
for even the simplest elements of human
language the cow river person tree pick
any one you want
there are Inklings of that understanding
in classical philosophy back to
Aristotle it was considerably enriched
during the first cognitive revolution in
the work of British neoplatonist sand
classical empiricists that they
recognized that there is no direct link
between the elementary elements of
language and thought and some mind
dependent external entity this is no
link there's no relation of reference in
human language and thought though there
is an act of referring that's a very
different matter they're rather these
minimal elements like these elementary
words now they provide rich perspectives
for interpreting the mind-independent
world 17th century they were essentially
study what we call they didn't call them
this Gestalt properties cause an effect
sympathy of parts concerns directed to a
common end a second continuity and other
mentally imposed properties properties
that the mind imposes on the world the
physicist can't find them similarly in
this respect meaning is rather similar
to sound so for example every act of
articulating some item to say
articulating the internal syllable taw
let's say every act of articulating it
yields a physical
that but no one seeks some category of
physical events associated with thar
there isn't any similarly some but by no
means all utterances uses of the word
cow or river we don't like some of them
refer to physically identical
identifiable entities but there's a
category of such entities this identify
identify well in principle that by a
physicist investigating the mind
external world that David Hume had a
simple phrase summarizing a century of
inquiry into this he said that the
identity that we describe to vegetables
animal bodies artifacts persons and
their minds the array of individuating
properties is a fictitious one
established by what we're called in our
cognitive powers our cognitive powers we
would call known well most of this has
been forgotten unfortunately but there's
quite strong evidence that it's
basically correct and once again fetter
to be puzzled by these things is a very
serious error it seems that these
elements so fundamental to human
language and thought reveal another vast
chasm between humans and other animals
and they pose a huge problem for
evolutionary biology then a comparably a
huge problem for acquisition of language
it's called what sometimes called a
poverty of stimulus problem similar to
those I mentioned now there's
interesting experimental evidence that a
child acquires these words say a word
like cow on a single exposure that means
which on a single exposure to the word
cow in some situation the child
conjectures what it means and that's
almost invariably right the confirming
evidence doesn't seem to have any effect
I mean disconfirming evidence would have
some effect and
pick up something else but it's simply
one trial learning you know there was no
learning at all they're just something
clicks then you get the association with
the meeting of course the meet the sound
symbol Association is acquired but the
meaning is not acquired now that's
somehow coming from the inside without
any direct evidence that much as in the
other cases I discussed and that which
if you investigate the meaning of these
words and turns out what's coming from
the inside is quite rich the what how
and why questions raised by these
systems have only barely been explored
because just of the unwillingness to be
puzzled
despite their fundamental significance
for thought in action the origin of
these basic elements and their
organization then that remains dependent
entirely unknown then if Richard
Lewontin is correct then they may remain
a permanent mystery for human inquiry
but they certainly will leave they're
not even investigated so in this domain
a basic one we really are in the pre
Galilean stage
those are the roving white people I
wonder mr. Chomsky if you might briefly
discuss the difference between literal
interpretation I'm over here to your
left
hi there if you might briefly discuss
the difference between interpreting
language literally and figuratively or
ironically sometimes we tend to take a
singular interpretation versus multiple
meanings from any given snippet of text
that's certainly true these are all very
important complexities but what's
striking is we don't even begin to
understand the simplest cases I mean
let's go back to Galileo and motion
I mean Galileo didn't try to figure out
how leaves fall it's true you know
leaves fall too but you know that's so
overwhelming the complex that in fact
modern physicists don't even try to
study first you want to see if you can
find the whatever works for the simplest
cases and maybe out on the base of that
you can extend to other cases and I
think that's true here too so yeah these
are important questions I don't mean
they shouldn't be investigated you know
you can learn things about them but each
one should recognize we're not going to
understand much about them if we can't
even understand how a child comes to
grasp the concept cow or that person or
the tree or River or anything else and
we're very far from that one of the
questions you one of the things you've
argued in support of language is
productivity and photo uses the same
argument for a language of thought I
wondered if you think language plays a
greater role like fold or does and maybe
that is there such a thing as a
universal grammar of thought well the
one I I do think so and in fact when I
was describing was the language of
thought so I think what actually seems
to have happened
as far as we can piece anything together
and as far as the empirical evidence
shows is that at some point say maybe
75,000 years ago some small neural
rewiring took place of course in some
individual because the only possibility
and that individual had a computational
process which was somehow linked to
pre-existing conceptual structures now
what those pre-existing conceptual
structures are we having a clue about
that that's the problem I ended with
nobody has even a clue what that could
be or where it could have come from but
it's there and it's totally different
from anything in the animal world and if
this the generative procedure could link
to it you do have thoughts so that's a
language of thought and then somewhere
down the line got externalized and you
get you know interactions among
individuals so yeah I think it is a
language of thought but I don't see any
reason to think it's separate from
language I think it just is language in
fact if you look at photos worked and
you asked the question well what do we
know about the language of thought well
turns out to be English I'm not saying
we think in English but the reason it
turns out to be English that's the
language everybody using but probably
you know whatever the language of
thought this internal our own internal
language yours and mine whatever it is
is inaccessible to introspection okay I
mean we'd if you introspect you can't go
one minute without talking to yourself
it takes a tremendous act of will not to
talk to yourself the fact you do it all
night it keeps you up all night but it's
just impossible not to do it but what
your introspecting is the externalized
language so you can tell when you're
talking to yourself you can tell whether
two sentences rhyme let's say
okay or you can tell I mean you know how
long they are something like that and
actually if you really pay attention
that you're not really introspecting
you're not really talking to yourself in
sentences it's kind of odd little
fragments something is going on deeper
which we can't introspect into any more
than you can introspect into the
mechanism of vision and that's the
language of thought and it's probably
universal it's hard to imagine how it
could be anything else there's no
evidence for requiring incidentally an
interesting question which has never
been investigated I've been talking to
some of the researchers on it is about
sign it's been learned in the last 20 30
years that what's called sign language
is almost identical to spoken language
the same mode of acquisition the same
neural representation I mean everything
you look at is the same it's just a
different modality so what designers how
do they introspect yeah but how do they
talk to themselves well you know the
guess of most researchers is well they
probably sign to themselves but we don't
know you know it's interesting talk
thank you very much for your talk mr.
Chomsky I had a question about
artificial intelligence robots and to
your left or actually he's standing so
it's sort of do you think despite the
complications and the lack of knowledge
we have that we will develop some sort
of machine language capability which is
a functionally equivalent to our own or
be similar to our own in the next 10 20
50 hundred years ever will we it's hard
to know what that means actually I mean
we're a machine ok I mean we're not made
out of active plasm so we're some kind
of biological system which means that
you know at least in principle somebody
could construct that system you can ask
that question about the visual system
can you construct a mammalian visual
system well you know everyone assumes
probably you can but
that question is the same as the
question can we understand what the
visual system is and I think it's the
same with language to the extent that
you understand what the system is you
can at least in principle duplicated in
some some other you know physical
modality mechanism but then tell you
anything it's and in fact we can't get
very far in it because so little is
understood art look what I was talking
about is artificial intelligence it's
not called that but this is artificial
intelligence trying to figure out what
the mechanisms are that enter into one
capacity of intelligent behavior that's
what presumably artificial intelligence
is what people usually mean by
artificial intelligence is you know a
little robot that does amusing things
okay it's connected my there was a
famous debate this kind of unfair but
there was a famous debate at MIT long
before your day back around 1960 I guess
between Mars Minsky who's the kind of
guru of artificial intelligence and
Jerry Letton who is very smart biologist
and in the course of the debate Jerry
famously said he thought it was a great
topic artificial intelligence but he
thought it was miss named this should be
called natural stupidity little unfair
can you all please stand when you ask
your questions please dr. Tomsky I was
wondering when you were speaking about
the evolutionary biology part of the
question ie what moment in time when a
member of the species developed the
capacity to have language first of all
without a written language what kind of
evidence can you find in the
archaeological record and secondly is it
not possible that at the moment when the
primate that is us developed language we
became a new species and
such that language is such an integral
part of Homo sapiens that can't really
distinguish between people without
language of people that have language
well that's becoming a new species that
you know that's a matter of definition
if some rewiring took place then it's in
a sense in those species you know how
much change has to take place to call it
little species that's there's no answer
to that so yes it was a different
creature in a minimal sense the reason
what you were just saying is kind of
similar to Richard Lewontin argument he
says by the kind of inquiry that anyone
knows how to carry out we're never going
to find out anything about this not only
is there no written language there's no
tape recordings you know this there's no
direct evidence of what must have
happened but then that's true of
paleoanthropology
altogether all you have is artifacts and
you don't even have soft tissue because
that degenerates what you have is you
know skulls hard tissue and you have
artifacts what like tools you know
drawings the recordings of which you can
pretty well determine are recordings of
natural events well it turns out that if
you look at the palate anthropological
literature there's good summaries of
this like by Ian Patterson for example
one of the main scientists it turns out
that roughly in the period in the window
that I mentioned you know you can't give
a date to it but say seventy-five
thousand years ago plus or minus a
couple of tens of thousands it doesn't
matter you do get that what this
so-called great leap forward all of a
sudden there's an explosion of complex
artifacts which reveal a lot of
creativity if you compare humans with
Neanderthals that's the closest living
almost living relative up till 30
thousand years ago
the they had fun they were all over the
world they were very successful
biologically successful organism all
over the place have very sophisticated
abilities like Neanderthal could make
tools so
find that modern humans can't make them
except with instruments I said but they
were all the same you know you go to
Asia you know Europe Africa wherever
they are it's always the same tool
there's no indication of any creativity
you know it's a little exaggerated but
overwhelmingly there's essentially no
creativity and that's the record of
human origin you know early human
origins - complicated tools but they're
made in a particular way a million years
ago and then they're made in a different
way 200 thousand years ago and but there
aren't signs of major change the big
change seems to be roughly in this
window and it's in direct evidence it's
coming from artifacts there is some
evidence about the brain size and there
it appears to be the case that the you
can tell from the skulls that the brain
that did undergo some big increase
around a hundred thousand years ago and
it's been speculated that whatever that
brain increase was why it would knows
why it happens but whatever was it
allowed for changes in the internal
structure of the brain which we know
almost nothing about incidentally that
permitted this development to take place
I'm it's indirect evidence it's kind of
like cosmology you're not there you have
to reconstruct from indirect evidence
but that doesn't mean you can do nothing
about how in science they had a complete
rework of everything they thought of
maybe in linguistics one of the things
that you have to think of is you put
forth the idea of language existing and
not existing perhaps those are two
totally different entities so maybe one
language the one that exists is
something like math so it's a formal
language then you have an informal or
natural language that's kind of
jury-rigged together in the same way
that like biological organisms are where
not everything works properly and that's
why you get these confusions within
language so you actually you've had
formal languages well I mean is like is
it possible that non-existent language
and it's a language like language exists
and doesn't exist at the same time so
the two different notions that you were
talking about are both correct but they
both refer to two different things and
there is there's a biological question
is there a genetic component to what you
and I are doing no like what I mean is
so you're saying that you can look at
language like when you have these
problems when you use syntax and
semantics and stuff that you can't like
you can't get what the person is talking
about or you're missing data because of
the way that the sentence is constructed
and then I'm still not understanding I
mean there is a straight scientific
question that you and I are doing
something okay does that trace back to
some genetic factor that's common to you
and me and every other member of the
species and is non existent than any
other species that's a scientific
question if the answer to that is yes
language exists if the answer is no then
it's just like today's weather just some
odd collection of things going on it's
not an easy scientific question but it's
scientific question as for formal
languages are did you have formal
languages those are things we invent to
have certain properties the term
language there is used just
metaphorically they don't have the
properties of human language in fact
they're invented not to have those
properties actually if you go back to
say the time I was a student you know
forties fifties the major of you know
logicians and Philosopher's people
excited tarski Carnap but if I go back
farther Ephrata and others they thought
it was ridiculous to study human
language because it's so imperfect you
know why study something that imperfect
it's just a mess why not make up
something that works perfectly what they
go to formal language now you can do
that if you want but that's like saying
why study the human visual system and
then I can make a camera which is better
you know it's proved but not a
scientific point hello professor thank
you for coming and you still look
fantastic I must say so
so with language being so closely
associated with power do you agree or
disagree with language being gender
constructed for example the rule of
his/her in a sentence rather than her
his and is this based on a patriarchal
culture or circumstance or is there some
fundamental principle that can explain
it's an interesting fact but I don't
think it's really a fact about language
it's a fact about society so if we had a
matrilineal society it'd probably be the
other way around
so it's the fact about the way language
is used in particular social and
cultural circumstances now that's one of
those many variable problems at that
point you're studying a lot of different
factors not just whatever the language
is which is probably uniform for all
humans but what happens when this kind
of biological instrument if you like is
used under various conditions and of
course it will be used in different ways
and that those are interesting questions
but you know not in a narrow sense
linguistic questions those are
socio-cultural questions involving
language which is fine nothing wrong
with those questions are just different
ones
dr. Chomsky given the ubiquitous of
information and communication technology
and how that seems to be so much a part
of human development now if you look at
children and what they're exposed to can
you offer some of your speculations on
how moving ahead generations that may
impact language and thought that's a
good question actually there's been some
study of it so you know the children now
are just immersed in the complex
videogames Twitter text messaging I mean
you know like my daughter when she tries
to communicate with her children that
she can't use email anymore that's too
old-fashioned
for a while she used to use and I want
but I think now they have tech maybe
there's something beyond text messaging
you have to use something it's extremely
fast and very short and it doesn't go
you know it doesn't take more than 30
seconds to look at because there's too
much other stuff going on in fact there
was just a study that came out of some
some hospital I forgot where I think it
was in Boston and was studying a new
disease that's developing among teenaged
kids almost all teenage girls sleep
deprivation there's a very serious
epidemic of sleep deprivation and it
turns out that it traces to the fact
that these kids are holding their cell
phones or whatever they use because they
don't want to miss the possibility that
at 3 a.m. some friend of theirs they'll
say I walked across the street you know
so you have to be awake to catch up with
that now these are pretty interesting
facts I'll pay a something that hasn't
been studied but may relate I have a
friend who's who was a bombing pilot
during the Vietnam War his missions were
to bomb northern Laos this is one of the
major atrocity stories of the modern
period there was nothing in northern
Laos these were stone age communities
isolated Stone Age communities people
didn't even know they were in Laos but
they had a lot of extra planes with
nothing to do with after a bombing pause
of North Vietnam zai started bombing
northern Laos I probably wiped the place
out I mean people these people were
living in the caves for two years trying
to survive I've got a lot of work on it
interviewed refugees and stuff anyway
this guy after it was done like a number
of people he had second thoughts about
you know what the hell was I doing
and he's devoted the rest of his life to
trying to do something to help those
societies what's left of them that one
of the things he did he got some
philanthropist to agree to put up cell
phone towers now these people are really
living in the Stone Age you know so they
got cell phone towers now they have cell
phones and I asked him you know what
happens when you give him cell phones he
said well the first thing that happened
is that the teenage girls started
talking to their friends you know and
and then it kind of spread you know some
farmer would it seems to be genetic yeah
I don't know
I thought studies of what effect this
will have and nobody really knows you hi
I want to ask you about the proper
relationship between language
documentation and careful linguistic
analysis because if we're doing this
kind of normal science mode of needing
crucial experiments it seems some of the
crucial data might be disappearing the
crucial day some of the crucial data as
endangered languages disappear we might
be losing ax
some of the data that could inform our
linguistic analyses so what do you think
the proper role of theoretical
linguistics should be with respect to
language documentation to respect to
with respect to language documentation
language documentation yeah like the
kind of old-fashioned linguistics that
preceive and generative grammar I mean
all you know it's reciprocal you can't
first of all language documentation
requires linguistic theory you have to
know what you're documenting okay so
like when I was a student the work that
we did as students was language
documentation you know you take some
Native American Indian language and they
try to get data from it but the data you
were looking for was dependent on what
linguistic theory tells you to look for
you can't there's nothing else you can
do
you know all documentation this theory
guided well as Theory changes people
asked to do different documentation so
field linguists today just look for
totally different things than they
looked for say fifty years ago and then
you were looking for you know phonetic
contrasts and so on now you're looking
for you know are there transformational
rules meeting certain the condition
Island conditions okay that's so sure
it's I'm a documentation is just data
collection and yeah feels of course
required data but the kind of data you
look for the depends on what you think
exists what you think is important and a
lot of the data are just contrived so
these examples that I mentioned say
these ECP examples you'll never get them
in a data in a corpus of data I mean
almost inconceivable but those are
examples you construct on the basis of
theoretical ideas which themselves are
based in data and then you see what
happens in those cases that's exactly
like the normal sciences experiments an
experiment is some very is very remote
from anything that actually has
and you're interested in very exotic
circumstances when you do an experiment
that's even true for Galileo I mean
obviously for modern science so so I
don't really think it's an issue there
there is a there's a constant
interaction between data collection and
the theoretical development and they
influence each other
science slopes for regularities in
behavior trying to induce I guess
regularities of structure and linguistic
theory could be conceived of two ways
once one it is a way of analyzing the
behavior looking for regularities so in
that sense is just a mathematics and you
can have multiple linguistic theories
all of them being different ways to
analyze the data
but linguistic theory could also be
thought of as a cognitive linguistic
theory where it supposes real cognitive
structures in the brain the problem my
questions about computationalism the the
problem with standard science is when
different theories propose different
structures ultimately the only thing
that can arbitrate is that some sort of
microscope whether it's looking for
germs or atoms or whatever in
computationalism it doesn't look like we
have a microscope so the question I have
is linguistic theory under determined by
linguistic evidence sure but everything
is I'm the same is true of quantum
physics is vastly under determined by
evidence that's just the nature of
empirical inquiry it's under determined
by evidence
that's why foundationalism was abandoned
in the 17th century
it was recognized that you couldn't go
any further than what David Hume called
mitigated skepticism you can make your
best conjecture
you can try to improve it but you could
ever you can never establish it there's
no such thing as proof in this
so all theory is under determined by
evidence in the particular case you're
mentioning it would be nice to have you
know important if they have there are
physiological data but it doesn't mean
you can't do anything without it
you can take a look at alternative
linguistic theories and ask how they
deal with specific linguistic phenomena
like say these ECP examples that some of
them explain it as I'm not explaining
and that's perfectly safe good science
it'd be nice if you could find out
what's going on in the brain but that's
pretty far off even for instincts yeah
but that's Joffe is you replied to an
email I sent very recently about the
Foucault debate about the Foucault
debate from 1971 in which you mentioned
to my surprise that there wasn't really
a very pronounced disagreement between
yourself and Michel Foucault do we would
I understand some disagreements but but
I'm wondering in terms of this
structuralist post-structuralist
relation did you do you were you were
defending sort of human the importance
of affirming human nature and the need
to find universal things that
unification eyes yeah that's what I know
that's what I had always been my
impression as well well he says he
denies it but it can't be true and I but
I can't deny it you can't deny it
because it's incoherent yeah that's okay
so the people who most deny it are
dedicated innate nativists you have to
be there's nothing else possible
otherwise everything that happens is
just kind of random yep yep that's
that's what I don't listen it's an
ideology but when you take it apart it
it can't exist oh no I'm sorry today I
just wanted to ask right now I'm
studying linguistics and it's I can't
find an answer to my question and I look
in the books so I figured I trust your
expertise on grammar and language so I
was warning to have any recommendations
for me to be able to talk to women
better one
that's like a lot of the emails I get
you'd be surprised I got one I got one a
couple of days ago actually my wife used
to save these but I got one a couple of
days ago from some guy you know teenage
kid or maybe 20s or something I guess
saying I got a problem I'm an anarchist
and I don't want to get a job in the
capitalist system but my girlfriend says
she's gonna throw me out unless I get a
job so what should I do business seventy
years ago I'm interested in you saying
that meaning is primary and I'm
wondering what the implication is for
creativity do you think that artistic
expression like music or painting
manifests from that primary source and
bypasses language does artistic
creativity come from the same sources
linguistic creativity
yeah the primary source but but that it
doesn't process through a linguistic
through linguistic processing it
bypasses it but this was disgusted no
buddy knows but it was discussed in the
a lot in the 16th and 17th centuries
18th century early aesthetic theory you
know classical aesthetic theory and so
on so there was a conception actually as
far as I know it goes back to a 16th
century Spanish philosopher and one
heart they was first one to talk about
it then was developed in later centuries
that he said there are three kinds of
mr.vain remembered exactly there are
three kinds of intelligence
one is the intelligence of you know
brutes animals you just do things
reflectively the second level is normal
human intelligence which is manifested
in the essentially creative use of
language the kind of thing we all do all
the time yeah make up new sentences they
express new thoughts you know so on and
so forth and then he said there's the
third kind of creativity which has
actual aesthetic value and that he said
that quoting from Plato involves a
mixture of madness but whatever that is
it's beyond these two and then there's a
lot of discussion of that do they have
the same roots nobody knows I mean
there's nothing like artistic creativity
to look at comparatively I mean you
can't even find the second level of
creativity in other organisms and what's
beyond that who knows I mean it's pretty
striking if you look at the human
archaeological record and have you ever
looked at the Lascaux paintings for
example well you know they're pretty
amazing actually my wife and I saw them
before they were closed off by now you
can't see him anymore but we were able
to get to them before the caves were
closed and you can understand how
Picasso for example react this is 40 to
30 40 thousand years ago and what
Picasso saw them he was stunned they
said they're the greatest modern artists
you know it sort of strikes you that way
so who knows where it came from
we have time for three more questions
thank you hi we're often told that apes
do not have the articulatory apparatus
to elicit speech even if they were
capable of it and I'm wondering how we
would go about or basically why that's
the case or what the relevant criteria
would be to adjudicate that question
it's the questions did be really a point
ago I mean look they're playing humans
who don't have the articulatory capacity
for speech would they sign no in fact
the infant's deaf infants invent sign
languages and they turn out to be just
like human languages there are
communities that are now discovered like
Nicaraguan had one Yemen has one were
the people in recent years in fact just
invented a sign language and they're
deaf there are people who learn language
who are deafblind
to Helen Keller for example the Helen
Keller case is somebody who she was
deafblind from nineteen months and she
learned language from a technique that
was later independently invented it's
called the DOMA and Sullivan her teacher
figured out herself where you the person
learns language by just putting their
hand on your face with the thumb on the
vocal cords and so you can tell if it's
vibrating and the fingers on the cheeks
so you can tell what the articulatory
apparatus is doing and well Helen Keller
was a extremely fluent speaker and
writer actually my wife worked on cases
like that at MIT and as a project
working on them and these people gained
incredible knowledge of language there's
an interesting fact though which has not
been investigated and unfortunately
luckily can't be investigated there
aren't any more cases these are almost
all cases of spinal meningitis which in
which kids lost and that's curable now
so you don't get any more cases luckily
but they never were able to succeed with
anyone who lost sight and hearing
earlier than about 17 or 18 months
that's Helen Keller
she was 19 months and what it strongly
suggests is that these kids who are
sitting there look like they're passing
like they're not doing anything
and maybe they're producing one word or
you know bye-bye or something they're
actually learning the whole language
just do the inside we can't test it but
that's what it looks like and that these
techniques are kind of eliciting it but
you know for Apes there's definitely no
reason why they couldn't learn in fact
there were many years of efforts to try
to teach a sign language
the results are general so it's like in
fact the whole idea is you know it's an
illustration of the utter irrationality
with which humans are studies for
example suppose I were to submit the
proposals of the National Science
Foundation the saying that I have a
great idea about how to study B
communication what I'll do is take a
bunch of graduate students and train
them to duplicate the waggle dance it
wouldn't be that hard you know you run
over to a flower you run back and you
know you go like this somebody else runs
over
I mean it's ludicrous what would it be
scientists learn from the fact that
graduate students can more or less
duplicate it I mean actually nothing you
know so suppose you could get some poor
ape to do something it would mean
absolutely nothing you know it's just
that we have this utterly irrational
attitude towards ourselves insisting
somehow we must be just you know
grown-up Apes or something but so
therefore let's see what apes can do and
then we can do it just doesn't work like
that
we're different species radically
different I want to get back to the
language of thought which is very
retaining from my point of view so a the
first products that we find that
basically are also you know indicating
in the paleontology that there is this
new new way of doing things and
creativity are pictorials right so they
are you know some of the of those my
artifacts are you know pitch
and so where I disagree with you is the
interpretation of that evidence why
don't we have why wouldn't be able to
have a thought of images okay which also
displays the same properties like you
know introspection and it as a more
primitive basis on the neural system
like dreaming and instead we interpret
that as the you know indirectly by
derivative the the the degeneration I
mean the creativity of the language
system why is not the imagery system
aimed at the first manufactory not the
products that we find our picture son
well actually it's not the case and if
you take a look at the archaeological
evidence the like say let's go and the
amazing paintings they're much later
they're thirty forty thirty thousand
years thirty forty thousand years the
big burst of creative activity had to be
before fifty thousand years it was a
good reason for that fifty thousand
years is when our ancestors left Africa
okay and we all have these capacities so
whatever was going on was long before
the Lesko and if you go back to that
period say you know I said seventy five
thousand that's a number somewhere in
that range the evidence that you get is
not pictures I mean some of it is
symbolic but a lot of it as other things
like say recording of natural phenomena
I mean take a look at the people you
know anthropologist have worked out that
if you look at the carvings on a bamboo
stick or whatever that can't be been
from the vegan stone I guess so it
remains they you know they reflect the
phases of the Moon you know things like
that you get complex social structures
no these are just evidence of creative
activity and they are pictorial neither
they're not Victorian well I mean
they're they're in artifice to disagree
with you because I have to be an
artifact you wouldn't
I think that there are there are data
poly poly ontological data but they show
that there are pictorials eight of
$80,000 80 80 thousand years ago near in
Africa so there's some but but most of
the stuff is things like complex social
organization more complex tools a lot of
invention that was going on there was
just a lot of creative activity
happening now does that prove that for a
lot of that it's hard to imagine it
happening without language this is
certainly not my thesis it's just the
common assumption of
paleoanthropologists be wrong sure they
could be wrong but it's pretty hard to
imagine why any of this would suddenly
take place unless you all of a sudden
had this means of thinking even
interacting once the secondary process
takes place and so on
so sure you can't nail it down we don't
have that kind of evidence but there was
a kind of a outburst of complex creative
activity it's roughly in the period when
it had to be the case that language
emerged because it can't have been after
the departure from Africa that's
impossible
that could have been 50,000 years some
think maybe a hundred thousand years but
you know somewhere in that range so
they're all happening around the same
time what the sources who knows but if
you can work out an idea of how the
pictorial capacity could somehow leave
the language it would be interesting I
don't think anyone's tried to do it hi
professor John see you and thank you for
your talk I was just wondering how much
of an effect do you think behaviorism
has had on the continued question of the
existence of language we continued
question about whether or not language
exists
there's a good overwhelming impact the
behaviorism can't die it doesn't matter
how often it's refuted than how fully
it's refuted it comes right back to life
it's kind of like genetic somehow
actually I was taught this in Toronto I
was in Toronto a couple days ago I was
talking to a very outstanding
neuroscience Noora linguist to work
suddenly spent a lot of the work on
these topics and she was telling me not
not as a joke about what happens in her
introductory courses this is it she
teaches language acquisition in her
introductory language acquisition
courses the first day she asks kids to
say how is language acquired she's about
a hundred percent say reinforcement and
association yeah I mean it's you know
it's been refuted so overwhelmingly
that you don't know what to say about it
but you're absolutely right it keeps
coming back and it's at the core of
these computational cognitive science
approaches they don't call it
behaviorism anymore but it's sort of the
same idea actually behaviorism in any
serious sense and collapsed in the early
60s just for internal reasons I mean the
you know it something that we're
interesting things that happened that
essentially wiped it out so for example
one or are you a psychologist do you
notice that well if those of your
psychologists ought to know that a lot
of assessment forgotten you know of
course people forget everything it
didn't that isn't on the internet but
it's back around early 60s there was a
very interesting paper in psych review
you know main psychological journal by
Keller and Nancy Breeland there
Skinner's two main students you know the
most loyal Orthodox students they
assumed like everybody that the games
all over
there's no point studying anything
anymore everything's answered so they
went off into animal training and in
fact they're the ones who trained all
the famous animals like you know flipper
the dolphin
all the things that my kids watched I
don't know what you watch but you know
the the and they discovered something
they discovered that when they were
training an animal they got the expected
results up to a certain point and then
the results started to deteriorate was
so for example if they lived under one
case they were training a pig to pick up
a coin and put it in a mail slot
and you know to get a whatever pigs like
you know reinforced by some food and
according to the story the pig is
supposed to improve its behavior you
know don't do any other things just go
more and more right to the coin put it
right in don't waste any time you get
reinforced and that worked up to a point
but then after that point it turned out
that the pig started rooting at the coin
and delaying the reinforcement and would
continue to do it up to the point where
it starved well what was happening is
what they called instinctual drift pigs
root you know that's what they are and
they were interpreting this whole coin
business some crazy thing that the
experimenter made up that's just some
funny kind of routing and the they then
over time went back to their routing
well then they started looking at all
the experiments in the lab it turned out
the experiments are always terminated
when this begins to happen so you get a
smooth learning curve and then things
start to go haywire so you stop the
experiment and say the Skinner
experiments were pigeons pecking well it
turns out there's two kinds of pecking
the pigeons peck for corn and they also
picked for water and they look kind of
alike but there are different kinds of
pecking and the things that the pigeons
were able to be trained on actually were
adaptations of one or the other of these
kinds of pecking you tried to get the
pigeons to do something else you get
nowhere but if you kind of modify their
instinctive behavior slightly you can
sort of fool yourself into thinking
getting results but before too long the
animal takes over and it's doing what I
was doing so it kind of wiped that the
whole feel later work in the mid-sixties
already began to discover that I mean I
remember this happening I was involved
in it but I Mara once gave a talk at the
University of Illinois or somewhere
there's a strict behaviorist department
and you know I thought kind of like this
it was 50 years ago so different but
same ideas saying that you can't get
anywhere with conditioning and
reinforcement for the human behavior so
one of the I got up a very good
behavioral animal psychology and said
how do you know it works for animals so
I said I don't know you guys say it
works for animals so I suppose you're
right and this name was Bill Brewer and
he got interested and he started redoing
the animal experiment that he started
publishing some papers and it turned out
that the animals are getting reinforced
only when they're aware of what's
happening if you set up the experiment
you couldn't do some sophisticated
experiments that distinguish cases where
the animal doesn't know what's going on
and then it doesn't get any
reinforcement and reinforcement done do
anything and other cases where the
animal sort of season what's going on it
gets reinforced so his conclusion and
others too was this is just information
transmission you know so reinforcement
experiments are an odd way of providing
the animal with information and you
can't tell them pecked when you I tell
you to so you do it this other way and
there's more work that did that but by
the yeah and more recent times it's not
even evident that conditioning exists
there is work again Randy Gaston and
others who've argued that it's all an
artifact it's just the various ways of
estimating valuable values of variables
and the whole thing kind of collapses
but it doesn't matter you're exactly
right no matter how much it's refuted
it's right back the next day
you
