afternoon good afternoon are the dialogues on our espresso time 
we started these conversations about our world about our present about 
our future now many weeks ago when Italy lock down and all the 
the rest of the world lived almost the same condition as us 
this week we are approaching the end of this initiative counting then 
to resume it in other forms given the support the interest it has aroused 
but we are at the moment a bit conclusive a bit of taking stock and then 
this afternoon we do it with one of the leading intellectuals of the West 
i would say of the world i don't think this is an expression in fatigue non jones chi 
good afternoon professor chomsky it is a pleasure to be with you linguist 
all-round intellectual philosopher who is being published these days by 
bridge of thanks with a book that is available as a paid ebook here 
we see the crisis of civilization, pandemic and capitalism which is a book that collects 
some world premiere interviews for Italy then the first question is 
very simple professor chomsky what he taught us is what is there 
teaching this global pandemic that in some ways she was heralded 
repeats the World Health Organization several times 
had warned of a pandemic risk but governments did not 
they have done absolutely nothing and capitalist economies have not 
prove able to change what has taught us what is there 
teaching the covip this global emergency and what are the risks for the 
future 
the lesson we must draw from these events is very clear enough that 
let's go back in memory to not many years ago in 2003 there was 
a major outbreak of a coronavirus the farce and scientists have said so 
immediately that it was very likely that there was some at some point of time 
another another epidemic that perhaps could have turned into a pandemic 
scientists at the time said we must prepare and described that 
what you had to do to prepare I think that as everyone knows it is not enough to know them 
things also need someone to do something then who could do something 
what let's see it 1 could do something 
the companies the drug manufacturers the pharmaceutical companies but 
they follow a capitalist logic and capitalist logic dictates to 
only seek profit then make preparations for something 
it is not for today it is not for tomorrow it could happen in ten years it does not generate 
profits and so let's say big pharma did nothing the fuss could do 
something number 2 and governments that are the ones who finance the part anyway 
of the scientific research that scientists who have laboratories and so on 
for example it is due to the funding of the various governments of the world if we have 
found vaccines for many diseases but nothing new was done there because 
let us say the logic of the neo of neoliberalism as this is dominated 
very clearly giving up reggae 40 years ago the government is not the solution 
but it is the problem and therefore this logic says that decisions must be removed 
from the hands of governments and placed in the hands of tyrants and okay let's call them 
private companies that are completely devoid of any sense of responsibility e 
they must not give an account to anyone this is the logic 
this is the fundamental principle and therefore are these industrial groups 
tyrannical private individuals in my view who manage this type of 
consequently also on this level nothing has been done but it is not 
that we have always been at this level of nation under the first the first 
Bush administration ie of bush father actually called the president 
that is, it creates around itself a committee of scientific consultants advising the 
of the white house when barack obama was elected president of the states 
united of america 2009 the first thing he did get the committee called 
to the scientists who were part of it to prepare plans for one 
potential pandemic which was done within five weeks by the way 
creating important infrastructures when already 
took office as president of the united states of america in january 2017 
within a few days he dismantled all that system that was 
aimed precisely at making the appropriate preparations in view of probable events 
like that of a new pandemic has canceled all the programs that 
they served to support collaboration between research scientists 
Americans and Chinese ones in an attempt to identify others 
potential coronaviruses and above all it has always been doing something it does not have 
never ceased to do ie definanzia ie reduces cuts the funds in the center for the 
disease control center for disease control cdc in our acronym 
English does not know has never stopped because even this last February 
when the pandemic was already raging, he made plans for another one 
reduction of the funds of the cdc so here that the system of the united states was 
totally unprepared but how can I say deliberately and intentionally 
in unprepared therefore it can not be surprising that currently we 
we are the ones in the world who are faring worse as a number of new infections like 
death toll but donald trump refused to pay attention to the former 
symptoms that were emerging in US citizens and has 
refused to listen to the news that came from china where 
these things started happening as early as December 2019 
at one point china informed and the world health organization 
that is, there was a rather worrying frequency of 
pneumonia-like symptoms of unknown etiology in the population in 
c. since then they continued to work and identified the source of the impact 
of the pathogen that promoted these symptoms, namely a crown 
viruses managed to sequence the genome and this information was 
spread all over the world so much that in half 
January of this year all the clocks in the world more or less knew 
what there was to know or rather what we say 
we were able to know at that time so that some countries reacted 
instantly the Asian countries of Oceania and Australia reacted 
on two feet without time in between others have a bit delayed but a 
washington for two months plus secret services 
US intelligence has been trying to talk to the White House for two months 
to warn look that we have a problem but without result because donald 
Trump did not want to listen was not available to listen we arrived 
so in March when the sudden drop in stocks on the Wall 
street awakened garnered the president's attention 
and then he turned around and said yes there is a pandemic and I am 
practically almost said I'm the first world ruler 
in short, to find out this has precipitated our country into states 
united in chaos in the disaster because we said there were three 
factors capitalist logic should have changed but it is difficult 
that you change without being imposed on the brake limitations and the 
logic of neoliberalism has further eliminated the brakes and 
and there have been the reactions of governments when at the head of a great nation 
and as important as the united states of america there is some sort of tumor 
walking evil and clear that this is the recipe for disaster today we are in 
same situation as in 2003 in the sense that scientists are saying 
exactly the same things they said then there is a very real possibility 
that another pandemic arrives and the warming of the planet earth does not 
other than to worsen the conditions the circumstances in which and these agents 
pathogens can more easily spread something but 
that must be done and the logic of capitalism must be overcome 
to completely discard ideologies from the neoliberal approach e 
above all it should be in the palaces of government power 
responsible this is the teaching that I draw 
you mentioned roller reagan the government is not the government's solution 
problem was his flag during the electoral campaign that took place 
exactly 40 years ago because ronald reagan was elected president of the states 
united in November 1980 in the same period the year before in England 
the Conservative party led by Margaret Thatcher had won 
she too is a slogan for some even more radical 
the company does not exist have been a bit of the dogmas these two sentences the government is 
the problem the company does not exist I ask if it is 
possible today an afterthought today that everyone 
they discovered the importance of public health the importance of the state 
in the economy in Europe you have contrasted yourself with 
trump model the model of angela merkel that is a ruler who leads 
of a state that cares about its citizens and does not care but is 
only a blaze dictated by the emergency as it was during the 
recession of 2008 or you can hope for a real authentic 
change 
the answer is in the hands of the populations in the hands of the citizens 
she is correctly remembered the phrase you miss the touch and that companies don't 
exists meant that individuals must 
be thrown into the market trying to survive as best they can 
of course she didn't know when she said those words but she was 
paraphrasing something he had said before her in a completely era 
different carlo marx when he condemned, let's say autocratic governments of his own 
it was that they sought, he said, to transform people 
the people in a kind are getting so potatoes ie made everything of 
isolated individuals unorganized and therefore completely exposed vulnerable 
in power the effects of this way of thinking 
I am obviously talking about the last 40 years since the time I do and before 
regal then as she remembered they said those things are before the eyes of 
everyone in the united states i speak for my country because the one i know best 
only 0.1 percent of the population owns 20 percent 
of all the wealth in the country 50 percent of us American citizens have 
a net worth as we say in negative in a nutshell has more debts than 
crisis about 70 percent of citizens 
Americans have substantial difficulties in making ends meet month after month that is 
from when he takes his salary until when 
a month later to really serious difficulties in keeping afloat 
meanwhile the riches and the profits of the very rich have increased to an extent 
astronomical while the wages of those who earn a living remain stagnant e 
benefit then all social services have been cut this is the product 
of neoliberalism that among other things if we really want to say it all from you 
in europe it was aggravated in the age of austerity programs 
We have therefore clearly seen the sources for 40 years 
of this of this situation now as it comes out there are a lot of forces 
powerful people who have created and who perpetuate this situation if it does not exist 
a counter force a force that opposes you will continue to win the 
counterforce what is the hour that are organized citizens are 
bottom-up organizations involving the population I think 
at europe yannis la ruffa kiss the former greek minister founded a movement 
m25 and proposed to join to make common cause with the organization since 
low that was created around the former Democratic presidential candidate 
of the united states for each sanders to form ie to give life to one 
progressive international in short, things do not happen 
it is not by magic that people need to become active and participate in a way 
active to transform all this into reality, therefore the outcome of this 
conflict of this opposition will give us the answer to the question that you me 
certainly posed a conflict is a match 
still open I ask and then I will go all on 
also specific about what political activists can do and what 
it will happen in November with the election of the new president of the united states 
I ask her when we talk about green new deal 
we allude to franklin delano roosevelt's new deal in the 30's over the years 
forty of the twentieth century there is the possibility for a thought 
leftist progressive to propose an idea of   that kind on a global scale 
change of way of seeing a change of paradigm something that 
reverses what has been the characteristic of these years which is the 
disintermediation ie the idea that the individual is alone with himself alone 
facing the economy and only facing consumption and only facing even its own 
individual behaviors there is the possibility that a watershed 
historical like this imposes a new way of thinking and therefore is a great one 
opportunity for progressive thinking or it will be a missed opportunity 
bush let's say the elections that history has given us can be useful 
they can make suggestions even if it is clear that they do not apply in a way 
mechanical if I go back to when I was 
child that is in the early thirties well me 
I remember the problem in America with the great depression that broke out in 29 
it was much more serious than the problems, let's say, of an economic nature 
today is that at that time everyone saw quite clearly that the 
there were two possible ways out and in fact so it was one was the way 
exit predicted by fascism and we know where it led 
the other way out was the one that was adopted by Franchi with his 
my gino and the social democracies in europe and we saw what they were 
the fruits we are today in a situation guards do not hide it much 
that is, there are two possible directions to the intensification of 
system that first led to this crisis with such disastrous effects 
so painful for most people who have lived in the world for 40 years 
to this part that is to this then among other things we must add keep in 
account the new technologies of surveillance control and strengthen the 
repressive tools that are in the hands of governments often piloted by the big ones 
corporation or what she said a new international new deal 
progressive of which what we have called green new deal is a part but is 
only part because this crisis due to the red coronary pandemic 
certainly disastrous but that due to global warming 
therefore to the change in a worse sense of the climatic conditions of the whole 
planet is far more serious I'm saying than since the crisis of 
coronavirus we can exit probably we are already exiting but from 
melting of the polar caps there is no turning back so it is clear that 
the green new deal new ecological green deal is the only way 
di con to counter these phenomena but we always face two choices there 
we come to find today as then I have a resurgence of a revised version and 
corrected contemporary fascisms or the passage but this involves 
truly a paradigm shift to a system that in view of a future of 
true progress organize societies our societies for well-being 
of their members and not of the advantage of small minorities 
right now don't ask me to make predictions because the outcome is not 
predictable as like the thirties and dressed and predictable that 
be an open game helps to be optimistic then the first question on 
this on this game concerns his country we are in a campaign 
very particular electoral is not in fact the electoral campaign of 
past in this story how important it is to reconfirm or not the 
president donald trump what's at stake for november e 
from this point of view I ask you if you will vote the candidate for the 
Democratic candidate that this right now appears to be joe biden 
the slot machines she asked me who who I vote but she knows that the elections go 
given at least the American elections must be seen and this in particular 
they have to be seen a little differently, you don't ask who you vote for 
you ask yourself who you vote against it is certain that I will vote against the trump and therefore 
I will vote Democrat whoever is the candidate and he asks me what the stakes are 
at stake for the presidential elections next November 
it is very high because just look at the policies of fano il tram 
just look at the interests so that they support it just look at 
that people surround themselves and understand everything i think donald trump is 
committing the worst crime conceivable and see what measure 
words in the sense that he knows very well that Hitler was a criminal and absolute 
but without what I tell her she never thought of doing what she is 
among other things by doing ours with its de facto policies it aims and wise 
putting our hand to destroy, let's say the environment in which it can survive 
organized human life as we know it today that crimes will be committed 
monstrous but has never even remotely thought of destroying the environment 
which hosts all of human life organized in the world 
here is donald trump's policies lead to this because for example they are 
Trump is in favor of maximizing the use of fuels 
fossils and quisi of his of the last financial law of the last kiss that 
he submitted to the congress already I said he cut the funds to the center for the 
disease control but also greatly increased subsidies to adults 
industrial groups to corporations that produce what fossil fuels is 
a slave to the oil industry thinks only of his own 
short-term interest and that of the oil industry should 
costing the end of all life on earth 
so in these four years we have almost reached points of no return 
let's say another four years with irreversible turning points 
tram but would be the catastrophe is increasingly difficult I mean 
compensate for the instructions that have already been inflicted on our planet 
another thing donald trump and those around him do is the attempt 
to destroy democracy these are people who really democracy 
they hate her passionately as they know they are a minor 
bend the only way they have to keep their grip on the rest of the 
company is what they are doing does not know what it was doing is filling 
all levels and degrees of the United States justice system 
of america of young ultra-right jurists who will take charge 
how to say to take care of the implementation part at the daily level of 
champ politics is no secret here we don't know everyone knows it 
we see lastly I say again that from the field it is he who is actively 
proceeding with the dismantling of the entire arms control system 
already to say revoked the support of the united states to the treaty of mf that is on 
on medium-range nuclear weapons what they concluded she quoted reagan 
concluded Reagan and Gorbachev in their time now even threatening 
to completely revoke the treaty called open skies and dating back 
even to the era of eisenhower and has already announced that it will not sign the new one 
start treaty to limit the number of nuclear warheads present on the 
world which means hello to the arms control regime 
we can safely commit madness and because there is no we say 
binding treaty signed by the united states 
last example of the trump policies that I said let's tell the 
disapproval of all and the policy held towards iran with 
iran and the united states and europe had concluded an agreement that stood 
working with great effectiveness as he had pointed out not least 
US healthy intelligence donald trump dismantled that saturday being 
by imposing new and harsh sanctions on Iran 
which means to try or rather to encourage 
and stimulate Iran to try to get out completely, let's say that 
had held and cause a serious military crisis in the Middle East as well 
it would blow up all our systems all trump to put it mildly 
one word is a spoiler Trump is a wrecker all he can 
stand in the way of its short-term interests and prospects 
electoral he knocks it down he dismantles it and it is a policy that 
clearly made to keep friends with those large industrial groups I was talking about 
first let him free rein, give him a free hand for another four 
years would lead I'm not kidding to the catastrophe the entire planet has 
explained perfectly what is at stake is why you will vote against 
donald trump and many hope that this challenge will be successful 
but compared to the last things he said give trump the spoiler in hand 
to the great powers I remember that four years ago when it was 
first elected he presented himself as the enemy of wall street and the friend of 
finance the enemy of multinationals that outsourced their industries 
outside American territory outside the states operated outside Michigan 
out of ohio and as the defender of the forgotten lands of forgotten men 
she wrote one of her most well-known major books called the 
consent factory 
these populist leaders of recent years are great builders of 
consensus around themselves in the name of the people against the establishment 
she thinks that these years have served and have been enough 
to remove a tramp from the many trumps that are around the world 
even in European countries this image of guardians of the people with respect to 
stable students who want to suffocate them that they have in short threw 
the mask or they will continue to play this 
part in comedy 
in American history there is a figure but also a character 
elsewhere, of course, a very particular figure is a curious character 
he said at the same time we don't call it kalman which is short for 
confidence man the man of confidence is the guy who comes to you from the bridge 
of brooklyn a bit like toto with the trevi fountain confidence well 
cam this kind of character so distinctive to tomorrow like everyone with 
a holds a banner where it says I love you I will save you 
I will protect as long as you support me with the other hand he stabs you in the back 
here i did the portrait of donald trump 
the whole legislative program of the current president says tax relief 
only for the very richest great achievement this let alone the benefits 
practically everyone went to the world of large corporations to the very rich 
including those who shop real estate sales real estate agents 
which then is his branch of the business for the others almost nothing 
the consequences of this were already announced when it was presented 
we say this this measure already paul ryan in the House of Representatives 
and from the Senate they seek me what they said 
these people's representatives is now we have a big deficit therefore 
what we can do about the only thing we can do is cut services 
social well defined cagliari and cut the assistance that bit of 
public health care we have in america medical coupons 
social security if not how can we do with all this deficit 
that we have this is donald trump's program 
when you subsidize the fossil fuel industry it enriches those 
it is better to enrich and harm everyone else also because thanks 
to the help of the jurists he has placed one by one in key posts is being dismantled 
all that regulatory apparatus because we had it 
in the united states which for example serves to protect the quality of water 
or of the area so it lends a hand to large groups 
industrialists who make profits on condition that no one is allowed to 
check to put a limit on emissions of pollutants 
in the water in the air carbon dioxide rather than mercury I speak of the asp 
and it is also a hand to the large arms manufacturers in short, with one hand both of the 
I love you sign I will support you but you support me and I will save you and with 
the other does everything possible to destroy the very conditions of 
survival of people these are the damages and samp is a big e 
demagogue and is a master in the art of convincing people and meanwhile 
plant a knife against him between the shoulder blades is recognized and is incredible 
the fact that there is a large sector of the population on all of the 
US population who still believe him while he stabs her at 
shoulders I find that it is a remarkable achievement 
what she says I say and while she was talking she passed you a roundup of these 
characters very present also on the European scenario and also on the 
Italian scenario from this point of view we really have nothing from 
envy but I wanted to ask her instead in this match 
the other front, 2019 was an important year for the 
movements to raise awareness on climate change movements 
youth protest movements the boys and girls of greta tombeur le 
revolts in some countries of the world for example Chile against corruption of 
governments against corporations the virus seems to have extinguished those mobilizations 
even on the physical plane our squares are empty yes 
demonstrations cannot be organized e 
all organizations and associations are struggling to keep up 
together at a distance how you can start over how those will start over 
movements from where the movements of non political activism will start 
only about her is she right to say what she says is true but I invite her to 
consider that they have not stopped these guys are continuing is true 
that you can not go to the streets agrees but continue in the work of 
awareness-raising information but also at the level of the GT organization 
development of new programs at the level of activism that is of the states 
united where we are witnessing a resumption of workers' initiative 
which is expressed with strikes with legislative proposals that benefit 
those who work who express themselves by creating new organizations for da 
part of categories let's say that before they were not even unionized one for 
all French let's say in the United States and the 
teachers now returning to my gil of the years 
thirty and that's not it rained from the sky 100 was brought forward 
in the sense that it was also supported and promoted by a level from a type 
of activism on the level of the workers' movement 
Americans had been squashed in the 1920s but recovered and clearly 
the great depression of the 29th somehow served to bring him back on stage 
the great confederation of state labor was fully created 
united ie the umbrella organization of all of all trade unions 
certainly it helped to have an administration that listened to certain 
instances but it could happen again because not you have to work hard why 
those who want to keep the system even worse know no respite then also 
whoever opposes him must know no respite must take action and the ways and 
mode skies are many despite the stop due to the town 
we have already said about the progressive international 
I find it important for a reason the white house of phan fah 
currently from the outside it looks like a great chaos but let's say there is a plan there is a plan 
geostrategic to the White House is to create a reactionary international 
that is, to take all of the world's most reactionary leaders and align them 
all of us behind we say the white house we have already seen the approaches 
between trump and bolzonaro the president of brazil is we know the relations that 
entertains with al fissi who is the worst dictator egypt ever has 
had there even the hand of the 
royal family let's say the royal families of the gulf 
Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States are also increasingly part of Israel's track 
decisive right turn in recent years and the Indian government head ways 
government of the Hindus who did everything to crush 
let's say the independence of kashmir and in fact to strangle democracy 
laica from india is closer to your home 
orban in hungary and right at your home 
a gentleman like salvini who sees himself in between and also very pleased to assist 
contemplate the wretches who are trying to reach Europe 
from Africa they drown in the Mediterranean all these form the international 
reactionary so it is clear that this is a world force that aims to 
to make the living conditions of so many people even harsher and more brutal in 
our world for the benefit of very small minorities 
that is why I think of the progressive national team because it needs forces 
who want to counter these developments unite and find land of 
common organization and intervention and attention the intervention must be a 
level of the individual nations of course but above all at the international level 
because the pandemic has shown us that the pandemic is a worldwide event that 
asks which requires to bring back let's say lead us to normal one 
international effort and an increasing reactionary international effort 
let's say it aggravates the situation of the environment and aggravates the threat of 
a nuclear war must be fought on ground 
absolutely international modalities ways instruments there are and there are 
many certainly some have been limited by the organ for the moment but not 
many remain so it is necessary to grasp and grasp with energy with 
force these opportunities otherwise we will enter a situation that will 
will screw of a catastrophe without end and with no way out 
before getting to professor chomsky's final question about it one 
she once asked about the role of intellectuals 
one of his books called them the new mandarins, that is, they are the ones that 
they have the keys to knowledge in their hands, but we also know how much about that 
ground them of the thought of the word of words this war is fought 
between the reaction as you defined it is progress from this point of view 
what do you think of what has been said that what has been written about almost everything is 
it was thought in these weeks of the pandemic there was a reaction 
at the height a new thought has begun to form or we are all 
very related and ancient patterns 
we get out of having to give her an answer so a little cold shower ie if her 
look and what many intellectuals have covered throughout history 
of mankind sees that it is rather uniform equal to itself through 
over the centuries you think about what happened at the time of the first war 
world and many almost all intellectuals in every country are 
enthusiastically close around the states to which they belong and therefore 
they took part in the war instead of rejecting the war with very few 
exceptions look i want to name them for for 
honoring him in the uk centered break in germany at rosa luxemburg 
eugene jazz in the united states were voices of intellectuality that you are 
opposed to that massacre that ended up in prison for this the story of 
stances of the intellectuals and very much so the majority of 
intellectuals in history makes common front with power indeed provides 
let's say the picture is the ideological framework that serves the self-defense of power 
except for small fringes, that is, we say of figures and situations rather 
historically marginal more or less has always been so I read 
regularly not only the American but also the British press how many 
articles came out that seriously addressed the issue of 
roots of this pandemic that is that they have shown that it makes 10 of 
this pandemic to the bottom of its own in the reserved capitalist logic 
exasperated by the ideology of neo-liberalism of Reaganiana Facari 
Bergamo and there was no memory if you have seen many tell me why me 
surely I have not noticed and say that I still follow this 
press you see the criticism for example to the policies of champ but you have 
the impression that he is being criticized because certain things are not good for him to look like 
I say the writer would do better serious criticisms I do not see many 
I don't even have to tell a strict one in the press that we call independent how many 
articles come out that really highlight the very narrow 
connections between the social and economic policies of the Trump presidency and the 
world of large corporations and the logic of capitalism are fringes 
unfortunately for the most part then I find that the intellectuals have behaved 
as always as usual throughout history the vast majority are 
as an end they jumped on the bandwagon of the winner they had defended ideologies 
dominant and power-like forces what your antonio 
gramsci called the hegemonic thought he wants to say but to me it seems to be so good 
I thank you because we talked about many things but allow me one last 
she asks on a more personal level what struck her most on a personal level 
what is most affected in these weeks of the lock down pandemic e 
what will you bring with you allow me personally these 
weeks of loeb town have certainly not been particularly difficult 
it is not difficult for me to stay indoors to work but we are people 
privileged for most of the others the other people have been 
horrible weeks is the important question that you basically place in 
this whole conversation sort of a red thread what we can learn from 
this coronavirus pandemic experience we can learn why it is 
success, that is, going to find the real root causes and address the causes 
or we can relax and once it's over we hope to leave soon 
that those powers that provoked or facilitated it transform it into something 
even worse these are the things I always think about which I keep on 
to think and I would like to say to which we will all have to dedicate our own 
attention and attention there is not only to think but there is to act and act with 
vigor act boldly boldly to deal with any other crises that 
they could fall on us even if we have not faced them already since 
immediately in an active way in a proactive way in an incisive way you will arrive 
to a point in history that neither she nor I have ever seen a point that will be 
a point of no return I say it in very simple terms such as 
I find that today's generation has the decision on whether that is possible 
human life survives human life and the life of many on this planet 
other species that we are casually destroying with with 
cruelty and recklessness to the issues we face 
there may be solutions but they will not stay here for long we must act 
to make decisions and therefore not only think but also do 
understand the roots of the crises that afflict us today than those that we are 
they threaten for tomorrow and tomorrow the year, however, to understand and act without delay 
there is no time to understand and act I believe this conversation is his words 
have been very important for understanding also as a stimulus 
to action so thank you very much thank you professor 
chomsky for your time and for this important dialogue thank you 
good day to good continuation for everything she thinks she says and 
for his testimony and good afternoon to all of you who have us 
listened and followed until now the appointment for the dialogues on ours 
espresso time is for tomorrow always at 15.30 thanks to all
