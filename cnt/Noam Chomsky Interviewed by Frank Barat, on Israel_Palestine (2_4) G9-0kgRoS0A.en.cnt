but I guess that some people what some
people say is that once you've got a
two-state solution once it's established
you can't really move in your your
finals or status and the settlements for
example they I'm talking about the huge
ones like Guiche John and Maria do mean
they're sitting on water resources and
they so how do you deal with Malaga
meanies as well so these are people who
say that you can't do anything about it
or saying let's give up that's exactly
what they're saying they're saying
nothing is possible let's give up they
may not believe understand that they're
saying that but if they think about it
they are I'll repeat I do not know of
any advocacy of it one state bi-national
state solution that does not move
through stages far as I know there isn't
it there be blue shout about it and have
slogans and say isn't it wonderful and
so on you could do the same about a no
state solution let's get rid of those
Imperial boundaries I don't want to have
states I don't want to have one state
it's just Imperial imposed boundaries
fine that's nice you can propose that
you can propose that everybody should
live in peace you can make all kind of
proposals but if you really want to
achieve those objectives you have to ask
how do we get there and the only way i
know is through the overwhelming
international consensus and
international law the cases you
mentioned are real and something has to
be said about them if you're serious and
what should be said about them i think
is pretty straightforward first as a
practical matter the IDF the art is
early army should withdraw from the
occupied territories and we're not just
talking to israel here we're talking to
the united states which is crucial the
US should stop at once supporting any
Israeli action that in the occupied
territories that's the US government so
no more arms sale it's numb where
military training its US corporations
you know motorola caterpillar the rest
of them our primary short term objective
should be to get them to all withdraw
from any activity in the occupied
Arthur's what's going to happen that
what's going to happen then is probably
ninety percent of the settlers will get
into the glories provided for them by
the government and a few s wants to
subsidize it fine and they'll move from
their subsidized homes in the West Bank
to their subsidized homes inside
Israel's boundaries there'll be some
he'll stay okay then actually removed
they can stay in a Palestinian state
that is in my opinion this week first I
think that's what the IDF and the US is
slowly trying to do by actually training
the PA for stays nails of values until
all totally wrong they're training
repeat what they're trying to do and
planning to do and it's explicit is to
take over most of the occupied
territories I mean the settlements
already cover over forty-two percent of
them that's even not counting the jordan
valley which is we're going to take over
so they take over the Jordan Valley take
over roughly forty percent of the West
Bank train a neo-colonial army which
will repress the population in the
sectors that are left behind and that's
exactly what they're doing and taking
pride in the read people like John Kerry
they you know Obama sort of point man
for the Middle East Senate senator from
here liberal Senator head of the Foreign
Relations Committee he says finally
Israel has a legitimate negotiating
partner because the Palestinian aren't
the Keith Dayton army the army run by
general Keith Dayton during the Gaza
attack was able to suppress all public
opposition to the attack in the West
Bank and that's a great achievement we
now have a neo-colonial army of the kind
that we created in the Philippines a
century ago the National Guard's and
haiti and the dominican republic that's
an old American tradition and the
British did the same before and the
French and so on so we create a
neo-colonial army to control the
population in the regions the little
regions that will allow the Palestinians
to administer and in a further nuke
he'll step which is finally
understanding will allow islands of
prosperity like Ramallah so you Ramallah
can become a tourist center for rich
Americans and Swedes and others where
they can go and enjoy the great theater
and the bars and you know nice hotels
and so on that's like any third world
country and meanwhile the population
will be repressed by the army that we're
creating for them that's what they're
proposing and if we don't like that
maybe we like that maybe somebody likes
that okay I don't have to talk to them
if they don't like that then they'll be
calling for a two-state settlement which
was withdraw the idea from the
territories in fact that will be the
first step given the two-state solution
we keep refilling keep the beats that
commenced I guess on English we don't
keep anything if in the first of all a
preliminary to a two states that there
are many preliminaries but one
preliminary is withdrawing the IDF and
withdrawing any us support for either
the IDF or the corporations that are
operating in the settlements or any of
the products of the settlements or
anything else withdrawal that after that
there'll be no real barrier to the
international consensus so there can be
a two-stage settlement and then what
happens to the people there is up to
them I I think it's very likely that
what'll happen is exactly what I
described the overwhelming majority of
mover economic settlers will go back to
Israel but I mean Israelis clearly if
you listen to all that the you know
state and through all the Prime Minister
Israelis is a colonial estates and so
how would you and settlement the
settlement enterprise is clearly one of
you know the dr of Israel so how do you
and you know how do you put how do you
make sure the supplements exactly never
leave the second is you know
if they want to stay there they can be
part of a Palestinian state but it's not
up to you when it's not up to me and I
don't care I mean if the people in my
Allah do mean want to live in a
Palestinian state it's up to them my
guess is they won't they are subsidized
to stay there if the subsidies withdrawn
and they have to face the fact that they
are not the rulers of the land lords of
the land does their cold in Israel
they're going to go back to Palestine to
Israel but how do you make sure how do
you make sure that I mean at the moment
looks like the settlement enterprise
going to just get bigger and because
we're paying for how do you stop paying
for stop paying for it stop supporting
it subsidizing it stop allowing the IDF
to remain in the territories and Israel
will then have two choices one choice is
to follow us orders another choice is
basically suicide okay that's up to them
if they decide to violate us orders
there alone in the world they have no
protection and in fact in the past if
you look they have always followed us
orders for a very good reason they need
it so the basic problem is here and in
Europe which trails along like cowards
after the United States so the United
States and European that's the problem
if they are willing to take the step of
terminating the occupation compelling
the IDF to withdraw putting an end to
any other support for the occupation
activities Israel has those choices I
think it's overwhelmingly clear that the
government will go along with the orders
at that point there are possibilities
that could be a military coup like there
could be a military coup in Israel if
the armies of our followers okay and
that case is just a pariah state which
will lose all of its port will probably
disappear the other possibility is the
army will go along the settlers will
then have a choice and they can make
whatever choice they like my guess is
their choice will be to leave their
subsidized
homes in the area where they are Lords
of the land and go back to subsidize
homes in Israel looks like and there's
no political wheel from the US to
actually give another level is yeah
there for our if we're serious about a
two state or one state or a no state
solution will be trying to change US
policy and European policy and that's I
guess what I need to know struggle in
the US and Europe and in Europe yeah
sure so you can't change US and European
policy by talking about Israeli crimes
because that detracts from it what I
think in ways that what you're saying
now is what people like supporters
that's going on over at one state or by
national state solution are saying that
actually this it's already one state now
because these then and the surroundings
eternal see that's a logical error
everyone is other people are saying that
on all sides it's just a plain logical
error the way the issue is formulated
now by a lot of the Solidarity movement
by Israel by no international observers
is that there are two options either you
accept the international consensus in
the which would have to be in the manner
i described first getting rid of the IDF
and so on so either you do that or else
it's one state and you have a civil
rights anti-apartheid struggle those
aren't the two options there's a third
option namely what israel in the united
states are in fact doing that's the
third option what they're in fact doing
is what i just described taking over by
now it's over forty two percent of the
territories making sure they control the
Jordan Valley imprisoning the rest
setting up a standard neo-colonial
pattern and whatever segments are left
to the Palestinians no civil rights
struggle no demographic problem as its
gold for Israel no Arabs in a Jewish
state that these these if you don't look
at the realistic option of course you're
not going to make a sensible proposal
and I guess again the people some people
actually if you look at the facts on the
ground
again the two-state solution looks very
difficult than people that lived there
and sort of we're pro two-state solution
I'm not saying how would you work out a
huge bypass road how'd you work out the
settlements as we work out the water
resources huh exactly the way i just
described I don't know how many times I
to repeat it I've in print a thousand
times you do it the first step is to
stop supporting the IDF present in the
occupied territories if people can't
agree with that I really have nothing to
talk to them about I mean if supporters
with one state settlement say I want to
keep the IDF there okay we're not
talking anymore so the first step ought
to be to end all actions that are
helping the IDF stay in the occupied
territories and there are many such
actions right here and in Europe so put
an end to them put an end to support for
the corporate system that is
participating in the occupation put an
end to any support for the settlements
like buying their products or anything
like that put an end to all of that at
that point things will go the way I
described Israel will have to repeat
Israel will have the choice of accepting
the orders of the United States and its
European subsidiary or defying them it's
never divide them in the past for good
reasons because if it does defy them
it's lost if it does decide to defy to
adhere to them then comes the question
as to whether there'll be a military
coup if there isn't we continue if there
is you know see even work is there is
really in bad trouble in that case but I
suspect that what will happen is what
usually happens the state will the
leaders of the state will recognize the
political economic realities strategic
realities and it then follow the orders
of the master call for withdrawal start
implementing and then comes the question
about what the people in the settlements
do and I've already said it I think I
that doesn't matter come it's up to them
but
what I think it's very likely is that
they will move from their subsidized
homes in the place where they are Lords
of the land to subsidized homes in
Israel some will remain there will be
some people from Brooklyn who want to
hang on to every rock okay let them hang
on every rock in a Palestinian state and
that takes care of the water resources
it takes care of everything you've
mentioned furthermore it is the only
proposal but that actually can be
implemented doesn't have any
alternatives there's no alternative
suggestion it's important to recognize
the alternatives that are proposed or
slogans not suggestions as to how to do
anything okay don't you think that she
knew 10 yahoo defied orders about the
sentiments no he didn't because if you
take a look that's propaganda Obama
repeated George Bush's words he repeated
what's in the roadmap and that was
considered very aggressive you repeated
what's in the roadmap don't know natural
growth of settlements but he did it with
a wink when he was asked that a
president his spokesperson was asked at
a press conference are you going to do
what George Bush number one did Bush
number one actually imposed pretty mild
sanctions for Israel's violation of
orders so you're going to do that he
said no this is purely symbolic that's
telling Natalya hood go ahead and do
what you like
