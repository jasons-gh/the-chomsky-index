the issues that are at stake in this
campaign are basically not being
discussed there are very serious issues
so for example the most serious issue
has to do with the severe threat that
unless we eliminate the use of fossil
fuels very quickly the prospects for
organised human life are very dim we I
don't have to run through the record
anyone who's been paying attention knows
this the Trump administration is opening
up new vast new oil fields for oil
prospecting racing towards destruction
with full knowledge of what they're
doing and there's almost no discussion
yes Noam Chomsky let me ask you then it
sounds like to you it is actually what
President Trump is doing that worries
you it's not the language it's not the
rhetoric it's not the culture war it
goes right to the heart of his policies
on the environment that's one thing and
the same is true of his domestic
policies so for example if you take just
take the achievement that the Republican
Party is most proud of their tax bill it
was the what economist Joseph Stiglitz
called the donor tax bill of 2017 it's
an enormous gift to the very wealthy of
virtually nothing for anyone else and it
had the extra advantage of creating a
huge deficit which as we were at once
informed by its architects Paul Ryan
Mitch McConnell it could be used as a
way to undermine and
eliminate the already rather weak social
welfare and benefit system so it's a
blow at the solar plexus of the
population do you think that Donald
Trump has permanently changed politics
now you talk about the ecological policy
you talk about tax cuts in terms of what
politics looks like now do you think
he's changed that forever
not necessarily he's politically very
skilled we have to recognize that Trump
has two constituencies one is the actual
constituency corporate power or extreme
wealth and he's serving them
magnificently they can't believe the
gifts that he's lavishing upon them then
there's also a voting constituency which
is quite different them he's actually
harming seriously but he has to find a
way and so far has succeeded in finding
a way of mobilizing them and making them
somehow believe that he's really working
for them and a large part of the
rhetorical excesses that he's criticized
for are I think quite purposely
undertaken to try to show I'm an
ordinary your defender I'm a straight
ordinary guy I'm standing up against the
hated elites I'm working for you I'm
going to protect you I'm going to defend
you well quietly I'm stabbing you in the
back constantly that's a pretty
effective performance
