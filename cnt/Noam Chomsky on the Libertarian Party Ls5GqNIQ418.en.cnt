the Libertarian Party whatever the goals
and intentions of the individuals is a
party whose programs favor concentrated
wealth and power right therefore a lot
of regular folks though that's what I'm
saying saying perfectly nice people you
know these may be people who say look I
really believe in freedom they're really
equality and so on yeah take a look at
their policies their policies say for
example remove regulation on financial
institutions right what does that do it
frees them to concentrate power to
punish the rest of us and of course in
the background is something that's not
status tape say financial institutions
the the government actually in many ways
is designs policies which ensure that
the taxpayer subsidizes those instant oh
of course
that's not let's go let's not discuss
and you don't mean well they're lavished
with huge government subsidies
