the first thing to do always is to try
to understand the roots and the causes
of the attack if you don't do that you
can't have a sensible response and
there's a good bit of information about
it there has been an extensive study of
what makes young people from the most
almost always Muslim community some
others in the West become part of this
monstrosity Scot atrum others have
investigated it in some detail and it
turns out that it's it traces back very
it doesn't have strong Islamic roots in
fact many of these people are you know
second generation the Muslims about very
little tie to the Muslim community they
pick up the radical Islamic ideology
which incidentally traces back to our
allies Saudi Arabia in the course of the
Association but they join for other
reasons mainly it seems to find some
kind of meaning and dignity and hope and
their existence as marginalized people
with no opportunities and humiliated
degraded they're not necessarily from
the very poorest sector but there's just
these are young men nothing in their
lives this gives them a cause well if
that's the driving force you have to
deal with that and the way to deal with
that is has been discussed by for
example William Polk one of the leading
Billy scholars a long record and high
level of the US National Security
Council planning beliefs and so on what
he's pointed out is look the main thing
it doesn't sound dramatic but the main
thing you have to do is improve their
lives
give them some alternative to the search
for dignity meaning honor in
becoming violent murderers in the with
the utopian goal of establishing an
Islamic utopia you know you just have to
create that alternative now as for the
particular act the worst response would
be military that's what we've been doing
all along it's playing the game that
Isis is asking us to play and that
al-qaeda asked us to play which is
attack Muslim communities and they can
use it as a recruitment tool virtually
every series analyst points that out so
it may feel good to say let's mama
but that's doing exactly what they want
it'll say that I mean that absolutely
includes making a dartboard of the
Syrian city of Raqqa then we're a Isis
have their base if when you attack Raqqa
you're attacking civilians Isis are not
idiots in fact they're doing a pretty
sophisticated planning so their fighters
will be and bases will be scattered
around the city you're unlikely to hit
much what you can't do is destroy the
city and under people who live there and
stir up feeling calls for revenge
elsewhere and throughout a good part of
the world in fact the many of the people
coming in are the Saudis Russians and
French coming from all over for the
wrong reasons and an attack on what they
will perceive as an attack on civilians
some Muslims is just a feeding Isis
propaganda that the Crusaders are trying
to destroy the is the Muslim populations
we can say look that's crazy but that's
exactly the way it will be perceived and
that's been going on for 15 years now
when the so-called war on terror was
called was declared actually declared
Reagan had declared one but by Bush in
2001
al Qaeda the center of Islamic terrorism
was confined to a small corner in a
tribal area in northwest Afghanistan
where is it now all over the world all
over the world of the most terrorist
killings last year according to a UN
study that just came out were by Boko
Haram where do they come from there to a
large extent an offshoot of the NATO
bombing of Libya which destroyed the
country turned it back into warring
tribes sent a flood of jihadis into
Africa weapons all over the place Africa
as far as the Levant that opened a
corridor which hadn't existed before for
African refugees to flow to Europe that
was the effect of the NATO decision to
violate their own Security Council
resolution which is what they did and to
become immediately the air force of the
rebels instead of pursuing the terms of
the resolution
so it's if you have you know it's kind
of the old cliche about if you have a
hammer everything looks like a nail but
yet we have a hammer our comparative
advantages of violence and if you use
that comparative advantage you're going
to have the effects that we've seen for
15 years it's the same with the drone
attacks the global assassination
campaign they probably generate what we
call terrorists faster than they kill
suspects and it's been happening all
over and if we decide to fall into the
Isis trap and respond to these
atrocities by bombing them that's giving
them again if the same if the Russians
decide to
the ISIS for bombing the Russian plane
probably what they want you know it'll
make me more Russians from the people
from the Caucasus will flood down to
join the the terrorist groups
