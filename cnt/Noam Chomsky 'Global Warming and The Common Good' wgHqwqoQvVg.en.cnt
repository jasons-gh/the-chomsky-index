sometimes the attacks on education and
the common good are very closely linked
there's a current illustration which is
pretty striking several one of them is
the what's called the environmental
literacy Improvement Act which is now
being proposed to state legislators by
Alec
that's the American Legislative Exchange
Council it's a corporate funded Lobby
tremendous wealth that designs
legislation to serve the needs of the
corporate sector and the extreme wealth
and has been quite influential well this
particular act which is just now being
proposed the environmental literacy
Improvement Act mandates what they call
balanced teaching of climate science in
k-12 classrooms balance teaching this
you probably know as a code word it
refers to teaching climate change denial
that's the balance authentic climate
science that's stuff you read in science
journals other serious publications and
legislation based on this these alec
models have already been introduced in
several states will probably be
instituted soon since soon this alec
legislation is based on a project of the
Heartland Institute
that's a corporate funded Institute
which is dedicated to rejection of the
scientific consensus on what's happening
to the climate the Institute has a
project which calls for in their words a
global warming curriculum for K to 12
classrooms and its aim I'm quoting from
it is to teach that there's a major
controversy over whether or not humans
are
changing the weather of course so this
is dressed up in rhetoric about teaching
critical thinking and all sorts of nice
things it's very similar in parallel in
fact to the current assault on teaching
children about evolution and about
science quite generally all of that has
to be balanced with raging controversies
and there is indeed a controversy on one
side as the overwhelming majority of
scientists all of the world's greatest
national academies of Sciences the
professional societies of science the
professional science journals the IPC
PCC the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change the general grouping of
scientists that deals with this they all
agree that global warming is taking
place that there's a substantial human
component that the situation is serious
and quite possibly dire and that very
soon maybe within decades the worst the
world might reach a kind of a tipping
point when the process will escalate
sharply and will be irreversible at the
end of life as we know it a very severe
effects on the possibility of decent
human survival actually it's very rare
to find such overwhelming scientific
consensus on complex scientific issues
like this now it's true that it's not
unanimous there is a controversy and the
media commonly reports presents a
controversy between the overwhelming
scientific consensus the National
Institutes of science science journals
and so on on the one side and also scan
the other side skeptics actually among
the skeptics there are a few quite
respected and scientists who caution
that
there's a lot that's unknown which is
correct the fact that there's a lot
that's unknown means that things might
not be as bad as the consensus claims or
they might be it might be a lot worse
that's what it means to say that much is
not known but only the first alternative
is ever brought up and there's something
omitted from this could drive debate as
excellent is actually a much larger
group of skeptics among scientists
highly regarded clients I am climate
scientists who regard the regular
reports of the IPCC as much too
conservative for cludes for example the
climate change a study group at my own
University at MIT and they've repeatedly
been proven correct over the year years
the consensus apparently is too
conservative things are much worse but
they're scarcely part of the public
debate at all although they're very
prominent in the scientific literature
is you can find if you read the science
journals
well the Heartland Institute and Alec
are part of a huge campaign by corporate
lobbies to sow doubt about the near
unanimous consensus of scientists that
human activities are having a major
impact on global warming with perhaps
hominis consequences and not that far
off the campaign is not a secret was
openly announced publicly announced
including the lobbying organizations of
the fossil fuel industry american
chamber of commerce the major business
lobby and others it's had a certain
effect on public opinion
so public opinion in the United States
is not quite as concerned about the
dangers of what we're doing to the
climate as in other
comparable countries but actually a
careful studies show that public opinion
remains much closer to the scientific
consensus then policy is which is an
interesting fact and that's undoubtedly
why major sectors of the corporate world
are launching their attack on the
educational system to try to counter the
tendency of the public to pay attention
to the conclusions of serious scientific
research you've probably heard that at
the Republican National Committee's
winter meeting a few few weeks ago
governor bobby jindal warned the
republican leadership as he put it that
we must stop being the stupid party
we must stop insulting the intelligence
of voters actually alec and its
corporate factor backers have a
different view they want the country to
be the stupid nation and maybe if it is
they'll even join the stupid party that
jindol learned about the major
scientific journals give a very clear
sense of how surreal all of this is what
it would look like to an observer say
watching what's going on on earth and in
fact what it does look like in other
countries so take science magazine as a
major science weekly Journal of the
American Association for the Advancement
of science a couple of weeks ago it had
three news items side-by-side that one
of them reported that the year 2012 was
the hottest year on record in the United
States with all kind of harmful
consequences all over the country the
droughts hurricanes all sorts of things
as that pointed out this is continuing a
long trend the second study second news
item reported a new study by the United
States global climate change research
program which provided some new evidence
for rapid climate change as a result of
human activities and also discussed
likely severe impacts the third news
item reported the new appointments to
chair the committee's on science policy
chosen by the House of Representatives
where a minority of voters elected a
large majority of Republicans thanks to
the shredding of the democratic system
in recent years in Pennsylvania's
probably no considerable majority voted
for house for Democrats for the house
but they won barely over a third of the
House seats well so now we have their
three science committees all of the
three chairs denied that humans
contribute to climate change
two of the three chairs deny that
climate change is even taking place and
one of them denies everything is also a
longtime advocate lobbyists for the
fossil fuel industry the same issue of
the journal has a detailed technical
article which provides new evidence that
the irreversible tipping point may be
ominously closed that's a picture of
what's going on and the context in which
the alec effort is being introduced to
ensure that we become the stupid nation
for those who Adam Smith called the
masters of mankind it's very important
that we become the stupid nation in the
interests of their short-term profits
damn the consequences that's the
conception of the common good that they
want to institute these are essential
properties of reigning contemporary
doctrines sometimes called the market
fundamentalist doctrines inherent in
these doctrines that you have to have
these things going on Alec and its
corporate sponsors that understand the
importance of insuring that public
education trained children to belong for
the stupid nation and not to be misled
by science and rationality well what I
mentioned is not the only case by far of
pretty sharp virgins between public
opinion and public policy that's
important it tells us a lot about the
state of current American democracy and
what it means for us and in fact for the
world of the corporate assault on
education an independent thought of
which this incidentally is only one
striking illustration that tells us a
good deal more its turn to policy in
climate policy the US which is the
richest country in the world with
enormous advantages lags behind other
countries quote a current scientific
review a hundred and nine countries have
enacted some form of policy regarding
renewable power and a hundred and
eighteen countries have set targets for
renewable energy in contrast the United
States has no has not adopted any
consistent and stable set of policies at
the national level to foster the use of
renewable energy to current article or
for that matter has the u.s. adopted
other means that are pursued by
countries that have national policies
that means
everyone some things are being done but
sporadically and with no organized
national commitment which makes them
fairly ineffective that's not a slight
problem for us for your children
grandchildren maybe not too far off and
for the world in the light of the great
predominance of American power indeed is
declining has been for a long time as
power is becoming more diversified
internationally but it's still
completely without challenge it's also
worth mentioning that there are sectors
of the world population that are really
in the lead in trying to do something
about these very dire consequences it's
throughout the world it's the remnants
of the indigenous populations that's
true just about everywhere now whether
the tribal societies and First Nations
aboriginals or whatever they're called
they're the they're the leaders
worldwide and trying to force some
attention to these extremely grave
matters which is the first time in human
history that humans have been on the
verge of destroying themselves and it's
not too far off in the countries that
have substantial indigenous populations
either majority or your majority of the
countries themselves have taken very
strong measures Bolivia which has an
indigenous majority and Ecuador near
majority have legislation to preserve
the rights of nature's it's called in
Ecuador which has substantial well
deposits there are efforts by the
government under pressure from the
indigenous population to leave the oil
in the ground in fact now they're the
government's attempting to get some
support from the European Union
I don't think they're approaching the
United States to subsidize them and
leaving the oil underground so that it
won't destroy all of us we're doing the
opposite effect right here in
Pennsylvania get it to be used as
quickly as possible so it can be as
harmful as possible to future
generations into the world going in and
the same is true of indigenous
populations elsewhere in the practically
a war over at Colombia and Australia
wherever you go Canada the indigenous
populations trying hard to save the
human species while the educated
civilised sector of the world is trying
to destroy the human species
very interesting topic I mean III I
think I mentioned that in Ecuador where
there's a large indigenous population
they have it's not to not be fracking
they have plenty of oil reserves and
there is there are efforts by the
government not to use the oil keep it in
the ground because the understanding of
the indigenous population is we're
better off if we don't use it because
every bit of it that we use harms us
arms our children that harms the world
and maybe severe harm so one possibility
is to take the stand of say the
indigenous tribes in Ecuador and say
much around the world the other is to
take the stand on which say Obama and
Romney completely agreed let's get all
the aisle oil the hydrocarbons that are
underground huge quantities let's use
them all as efficiently as possible
it'll give us a hundred years of energy
independence what's the world going to
look like in a hundred years that's
somebody else's problem what's important
is how much money I can make tomorrow
you know incidentally the oil
independence issue is compromise totally
meaningless I mean if all of our oil
came from say Saudi Arabia we'd have no
more dependence that we have today you
can easily see that in the US policies
towards the Middle East say were exactly
the same
in the 1950s under Eisenhower well we
didn't take hit any oil from the Middle
East fact we were the biggest oil
exporter and the u.s. at that time in
the 1950s initiated a program to exhaust
domestic oil in the interests of profits
for Texas oil producers
so to use domestic oil Texas oil instead
of cheaper Saudi oil because Texas oil
producers would make more profit and
that we'd have big holes in the ground
which we could fill in call the later
calling them the strategical energy
reserve but the policy starts
controlling the middle east and
controlling Middle East oil were the
same so forget the energy independence
issue the real issue is do we want the
consequences of extracting as
hydrocarbons natural gas and oil that to
the maximum extent possible well you can
figure out what the consequences are so
it takes a fracking and it has a lot of
local effects you know I'm sure you know
all know about this and harms water
supplies toxic effects it's very energy
intensive frack natural gas is more is
more efficient than oil you know less
co2 but it also releases methane which
is worse than co2 and it's energy
intensive to extract it but there are
other effects like the economy you know
the economic arguments are that a frack
you fracking and shift to natural gas
that will give us a transition period in
which will have cheap energy which will
enable us to transition to renewable
energies okay so therefore it's it's a
couple of problems with it namely it has
the opposite effect
the main one it has the opposite effect
if you have two cheap hydrocarbons in a
capitalist society there's going to be
no incentive to develop renewables so
the more cheap hydrocarbons you have as
the longer you put off the time until we
begin to do what we've got to do if we
want to survive turn to renewables and
what is being done in other countries I
mentioned that out of 110 countries us
is the only one that doesn't
the national energy policy you look
elsewhere countries are doing various
things like an Ecuador I told you what
they're doing to try to keep the oil on
the ground in China which is huge a
polluter but it's also by now in the
lead
internationally in solar energy its
producing most most of the solar panels
and advanced solar panels most high-tech
advanced sophisticated solar panels so
they're ahead in the technology and earn
ahead in the scale we've fallen behind
the Germany and Denmark are pretty much
switching to renewables there are rich
countries so there are plenty of things
that can be done one of them is to try
to maximize the damage and to put off as
long as possible
the step towards trying to repair it
which may mean putting it off until it's
all over and that's what the fracking is
and that's the national consensus from
Obama to Romney that everyone in between
that's I think that's pathological
frankly
