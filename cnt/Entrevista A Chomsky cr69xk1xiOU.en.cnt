first of all i wanted to ask you how
good or how bad
do you think cognitive science is in
terms of uh
the shape it is nowadays last year
raphael nunes
published a paper criticizing the
progress that cognitive science in the
singular term
had made or had not made actually you
know in the last
20 or 30 years saying that the
original goals that cognitive science
uh put out and uh but have
not been attained basically you know
what were the original goals
i was there when it got started but
the only original goals i remember were
to try to understand something about
how our mental processes work
george miller jerry right right i mean
they had
some ideas but no specific goals that i
recall
i mean there were some who had
a very ambitious uh
expectations people like marv minsky for
example
but i don't think any of us took that
very seriously
what about simon and newell simon and
newell had
some interesting ideas but
you know the logic program was useful
but
very limited don't tell us much about
thinking
it's a hard problem and it's unusually
hard because uh
you know it's in the field of vision you
can learn a lot
by experimentation invasive
experimentation
with other organisms so we know a lot
for example about the neurophysiology of
vision
by experiments with cats and monkeys
but when you get to uh areas where the
the humans are basically unique
you can't do and you don't have any
comparative
evidence to speak of so language
there's no analog so you can't i mean
you can think of lots of possible
experiments
you could do with humans that would give
you a lot of insight
but just can't do them and you can't do
that with their animals because they
don't have the
right so you have to it's a very hard
problem you have to
look around the periphery right and
that's what you say in your book
i show you uh on tuesday
um precisely because of that limitation
there are some new well rather new
paradigms in cognitive science in
cognitive science
after the uh the computationalist
approach you know then came
the connectionist approach and then the
inactive or
embodied approach so what what do you
think of these
new approaches like the embodiment and
inactivism
i don't think it tells you anything i
mean the fact is
something's going on up here and of
course there's all kind of connections
to the rest of the body but
they're peripheral to it so like when
we're talking
i move my arms you know all sorts of
things are happening but they're
just reflections of what's going on in
the head
i don't think they i don't know of any
real results that come out
well there are some studies that link in
an intrinsic manner
body body gestures you know and
meaning so if you are really mad and
you're experiencing
but that we know without cognitive
science
i mean so if you hear the you know
there's experiments showing that uh
if you have a sentence like
the car hit a hit the bus
and compare it with the whore smash the
bus
you'll get a different reaction response
time
things like that but those are not
those those studies should be studies
should be understood as studies of
whether the experimental technique works
i mean if you take say the difference
between smash and hit
we know what the difference is we can
measure it in many ways
that we can try to construct an
experiment which will give the right
result
if it does it was a useful it was a
proper experimental technique if it
doesn't
we just disregard the experimental
technique
uh if you get experimental techniques
that work on the
uh obvious cases where you know the
answer
then you can maybe use them on
non-obvious cases
but the particular test of say
smash versus hit is not discovering
anything about the mind
it's discovering whether the
experimental technique works
and if it's useful for something else so
it's a test of the experimental
technique
and a lot of the work that's done is
like that
we get a result but if it's the wrong
result we throw out the experiment
i mean every experimenter knows
it's very hard to get a good experiment
most of your tries turns out didn't get
to the right thing
you know an experiment after all it's
kind of like a theory
it's an idealization it says i want to
look at this piece of the world and
disregard everything else
which is very much what a theory does
right so whether it's a good experiment
is whether it's like a good
theory so the work within cognitive
science should be limited to to to doing
that or there is room for conceptual
work as well
all like every other science is the same
you take a look at
i mean remember cognitive science is in
an early stage
it's like physics in the 17th century
the great results in physics in the 17th
century
there were thought experiments most of
galileo's experiments
you can't are physically impossible or
if you take go further to say mendel's
experiment
it's now known that he couldn't have
gotten the results he did
it's statistically almost impossible so
he
got something and something was
important and then he
refined it to show what should happen
under
perfect conditions which is valuable but
it's
an interaction of theoretical
understanding
and data attained by experiment
and virtually everything is like that
and do you think that
it's feasible to work in with
together several disciplines as we
pretend to
bring together anthropology linguistics
psychology philosophy and neuroscience
to to be productive
you know the disciplinary boundaries are
kind of arbitrary no reason to take them
pretty serious very seriously
they're for administrators and
universities
but as far as research is concerned you
deal with the issue
if something from chemistry happens to
be relevant
god will use that things do sort of
converge
so studies and vision studies and
language studies and social interaction
studies and let's say political
structures they all
are pretty much different but
there's no reason to be trapped by the
name of the discipline
right especially in the case of
philosophy
until the 19th century philosophy was
just everything
right yeah right right and do you think
philosophy
can or should be sensitive to
experimental work
is something relevant to the
philosophical concerns sure
well that's the thing some people think
that philosophy is only about conceptual
analysis and there is no room for
empirical work
you can define it that way if you want
but i don't agree myself but
it's not a matter of agreement it's a
matter of decision
you can say i just want to study the
conceptual work
okay it's your business but you can't
appropriate the term philosophy for that
there's certainly no historical basis
for it i mean
like i say the term science in english
at least wasn't uh
even used in the modern sense until
william will yule 19th century
german still not used just
listen to everything
what about um experience
i haven't read much about
you talking about experience you know
and
we know that at least in the continental
tradition there is phenomenology
that's the study of experience do you
think there is room for or
there should be interest in studying
experience as such
as part of cognition or in the mind
pretty careful about the concept
experience
we're not presented with experience
experience is a mental construct
so take the simplest things
i look at him say my experience
is a person is sitting there but
actually
the data that's coming to me is just
spots of light at various points in my
retina
everything else my mind is constructing
and it's constructing it on the basis of
all kind of background uh information
and understanding
perceptions when i look at this thing
i see a round table but that's certainly
not what
my retinal image is nothing like that
in fact this all goes back to
discussions by descartes
descartes pointed out that uh you know
this neo-scholastic views that he was
criticizing held but if you
look at a triangle of the triangle
the the form of the triangle moves
through the air and implants itself in
your brain
and descartes pointed out simply
use the analogy of a blind man with a
stick
there's a blind man with a stick and go
around the edge and
perceive a triangle he didn't know it
but that's pretty much the way our eyes
work
it's the psychotic eye motions are just
going all over the place
stimuli are coming to the eye
reconstructing something
and you do it very quickly so i'm sure
you know one of the
most striking results not new
is that uh with a
if you just have a couple of dots on a
kisoscopic
presentation then you give a series of
them
so you're just seeing three dots here
and then three dots here and three dots
here
quickly what you actually see is a rigid
object in motion
you're constructing everything from
inside
and experience is a high level construct
it's not you can describe you can report
it if you like but you're reporting
some very complex events that involve
the interaction of
external events and what your mind is
doing with them
and what your mind is doing with it can
involve many factors
uh including your own personal history
what you must do
sure the idea is to
for me i mean the question really comes
to whether
rel whether experience is a relevant
construct or concept that somehow
constrains
the descriptions that we can do at
another level
well since experience is a construct
a lot of our theoretical work will show
that experience is
not representing the outside world
so let's say the moon illusion your
experiences
the moon is huge but our science tells
us no it's not
it's something that you're constructing
in your mind
so sure you can describe experience but
you're describing a
high level construct and you want to if
you want to understand
it you're going to have to distinguish
between the
external stimuli and the actions of the
mind which construct experience
right right so you're already deep into
cognitive science
it's not that experience is something
immediate
it's not immediate it's highly uh
abstract and constructive
right yeah well very interesting
issues we don't have time to do
development to develop
them unfortunately but uh but i
understand what you're saying
um and in the same vein
do you think there is a role for
neuroscience because neurosciences
have become very fashionable you know
they talk even about neural ethics and
neurotheology
but what about neuroscience in cognitive
science
there's a lot of exaggeration about
neurosis it's a lot of propaganda
and pr so after neurosciences
certainly of valuable discipline and you
can
learn things from it but you're not
going to learn anything about ethics
i mean after what is the information
we're getting from studies of the brain
and we're finding that the blood flow is
faster
here than it is here it's interesting
but
not gonna say of course
but again these are cases where you can
imagine
experiments like if you do invasive
experiments
in deeper parts of the brain the way
they're done say in the
striat cortex in mice or cats
yeah then you could learn things but you
can't do this experiments
um little work being done by
is actually picking up something like
penfield did many years ago now regarded
as
unethical but the study of
a an open brain during surgery
by now there are ways of doing it which
are
plausibly within ethical limits
and it enables you to see what a
single neuron is doing while the patient
is alive and functioning
and you can get some information about
that but it's very superficial
in fact you want to get a sense of what
it's like there was a
an issue of some the journal science was
devoted to the
neuroscience of language about a couple
months ago
if you look it never got beyond the
farthest did god
was saying something about two two word
president
that's it almost nowhere and you're
getting very little about that
it's hard there are some real results
like there's
the most important result i think is
by a group in italy
milan the linguist involved is andrea
moro
they like everything
that series it was guided theoretically
there's a lot of
linguistic evidence now that all the
operations of language
the structural operations the ones that
feed the
semantic interpretation are
what are called structure dependent they
ignore
the linear order of words rather than
just use abstract structures
which is a pretty striking result
because this is
with children this has now been
demonstrated now to about 30 months old
which means essentially no experience
right
but what it means is that the child is
ignoring
100 of what it hears and it's paying
attention only to what it never hears
because you don't hear abstract
structures
so that's a pretty surprising result you
know a
good explanation for it but the the uh
these results suggested to andre amor or
the
group that they try to see with uh
i think the experimental design takes
uh monolingual speakers of uh
i think it was german in their case and
devise artificial languages
some of which are modeled
in one set they're modeled on a language
they don't know
like italian so put in some of the rules
of italian in uh
in an invented system the other set is
just
use rules that violate the principles of
language
like for example rules that do use
linear order
so for example in one set
you would have a rule where negation
let's say works the way it does in
italian it's a
pretty complicated set of rules uh in
the other set
uh negation would just be say the third
word in a
in the sentence very trivial
then ask how the monolingual speakers of
german handle these two cases
turns out there's striking differences
and the
one modeled on the language they don't
know
you get activation in the usual language
areas broken theory and so on
the other you get just diffuse brain
activity meaning people are treating it
as a puzzle
so when they're getting a simple system
find the third word treat it as a puzzle
not as a language
this is duplicated by some
psycho-linguistic studies there's you
know neil smith
no british linguists psycho language
he's been working for years with a
a subject coulson chris
who's has amazing linguistic capacity
he learns languages in no time picks up
a grammar book studies and knows the
language
it has no cognitive capacities at all
and he
can't remember where his bedroom is just
taken to it you know
and come to almost nothing but they've
been a bit of kind of a
detox you know and they tried this with
chris and on the
systems modeled on a language he learned
it very quickly
uh the ones that were used linear order
he could do nothing
right it was just since it's a puzzle
you can't solve it
right now results like that are
interesting to find the you know just
it just shows that there is a detectable
neural basis for strange
properties of language which is worth
knowing this has now been
replicated quite a lot so there are some
things like that
but notice that they're really not
teaching you anything about language
they're just verifying that in another
domain the domain of the brain sciences
you can see that something's going on
related to this
but to find out what's actually
happening in the
computations of the brain is
very difficult and in fact most of the
computational models the kind you were
talking about
the connectionism and so on they all
assume neural net models
but there's very good reason to believe
that neural nets are not the appropriate
model for the brain
that one reason actually goes back to
helmholtz the neural transmission is
very slow
nowhere near fast enough for what we do
you just introspect on your thinking
let's say
you walk into a room somebody walks into
this room sees you and
realizes recognizing you saying say
something i wanted to tell them but then
they noticed me and they said i better
not say it because he's not going to
like it so then you see something
all of this happens in a microsecond
right
there's no time way faster than the oral
transmission
and it's happening all the time you're
constantly making complex decisions
that when you talk to your you know you
think in words you're not producing the
sentences
at least consciously you're just getting
bits and pieces of fragments
and somehow it all comes together and
it's happening
so fast that it's way beyond the speed
of neural computation
so there must be deeper computation
going on maybe
down even to the cellular level same
sort of memory
there's no way for our memories to be
stored in the brain
that just don't have the compute not by
neuron neural nets at least
they just don't have that capacity so
this
we know i mean you know deep learning is
all based on this
and it's useful technically but
it's not giving any real insight into
anything into language
um going back to the ethical issues
do you think it makes any sense to say
that we
one day we will naturalize ethics or
morality doesn't
good well there's i mean there's
descriptive work
which kind of in a way naturalizes
ethics
the experimental work by uh actually was
started really by a
very good young philosopher john mikhail
if you know
me did a dissertation about
10 or 15 years ago it was uh
it started with a critical analysis of
roles work roles early work
was based on a grammatical model uh he
got so much criticism i
i knew him i was working with him at the
time he got so much criticism from
philosophers he just dropped
that part and went ahead with the other
part
but john picked it up again and pointed
out that it was
well designed and just right he pursued
it and
tried to develop a kind of
quasi-grammatical theory of moral
judgment
but then he went on with elizabeth
spelke
to do experimental work with young
children
to see if he could account for their
moral judgments
as as essentially theorems of this
moral grammar this was then picked up by
other people especially mark hauser
cognitive psychologist who did
studies with children but also
comparative studies other cultures
and we're able to get some interesting
results about
non-trivial generalizations about moral
judgment seem to be instinctive
with some theoretical framework of the
michael type to try to
organize and develop a
computational system that'll account for
them
i think that kind of work is productive
but
trying to find the neural basis for it
is
fiendishly difficult you can't even do
it for simple things
almost like people asking how come you
can't find a gene for language i mean
you can't find a gene for height
nothing you can find it for these are
very comple even the
simplest things are very complex after
all nobody even knows
how the genome
provides provides the product the
you know production system the system
that creates
an organism that we know that genes
determine protein folding but how do you
go from that to an
organism it's way out of range
so i think the expectations for
cognitive neuroscience go
are it is totally unrealistic you can't
even deal with
simple traits those terms okay
even with animals where you can do the
experimentation
so trying to figure out how say an
insect navigates nobody
understands the neuroscience of that
a bee has a you know a brain the size of
a
grassy very quick gestation period
you've got
hundreds of species perfect you can do
any experiment you like
but it's just too hard so how are you
going to figure out how
humans make moral judgments that's
strange and
now turning into language something that
i would like to
know is when i was in france
studying i was very keen on
wittgenstein's
philosophy especially his second
philosophy
the late philosophy yes of wittgenstein
but i haven't
heard you or read i mean as far as i
remember
anything about wittgenstein so do you
think what's
what's the use of the light with stein
in your own view
is there any for pragmatics and
cognition
back in the 1960s i i did have an
article on the uh wittgenstein's
uh approach to language acquisition
mainly in the blue and brown books
so i had a critical discussion in that i
think that amounts to but the general
idea
that uh if you want to understand
the meaning you should look at how
things are used is
a valuable idea and carried forward i
think in more
effective ways in many respects by
some of the ordinary language
philosophers especially john austin
right his work i think was very
sophisticated right interesting
i've written about it much but use it
yeah okay
austin himself was extremely who i knew
was very much interested in generative
grammar he was in fact
teaching syntactic structures in his
seminar
before he died i like very much
jonathan's work and
perception he's very smart yes yes
um you talk about
some language of thought in that book i
told you about i showed you
is that similar or the secret is pretty
much the same view as photos
uh language of thought or different
photos without going to the table
personal friend it never really said
anything about the language of thought
take a look at this it's basically
english you know
now the fact of the matter is that a
a generative grammar of a particular
language say
english does yield
uh something like a language of thought
that is it determines the
if it's done right it'll determine the
somatic interpretation of
every one of an infinite number of
expressions
well each of those semantic
interpretations is basically
a thought a linguistically arctic
articulated thought so there is
that language of thought the question is
and if in fact the internal systems of
languages are all fundamentally the same
which seems very likely it seems that
the
differences among languages are mainly
in the
externalization how you map the internal
system into
the sensory motor system one or another
way
but it's very unlikely the linear order
case is an example
i mean that's all added in the
externalization it's not really part of
language
i'm the only reason you use linear
orders
because your articulatory system
requires that
can't produce structures in fact if you
use sine
they use somewhat different outputs you
can do things simultaneously
so what but these are all about the
sensory motor system which is not part
of language
uh from an evolutionary point of view it
was there
millions of years before language ever
appeared
and it hasn't been affected by language
so
uh the internal systems
you can't prove it yet but i think work
is
converging towards indicating
that the internal systems are probably
uniform
or very close to it well if that's the
case
then the language of thought produced by
each language is essentially the same
so it's a broader human
a human specific language of thought
now jerry fodor wants something broader
than that he wants a system which will
integrate what comes out of language
with what comes from the visual system
but you're pretty close to that when you
have the
internal system and you understand the
concepts that are
entered into so the concept round for
example which applies
to this even though i what i would i
see on my retina some strange kind of
lips
so the question is is there really
anything beyond this
it's not very clear to me so maybe the
language of thought is just what's
coming
out of our linguistic
system now if you look at the history
that's
kind of a traditional view so fun
humboldt for example
simply identified thought language
others
didn't do quite that right but regarded
language as just you know audible
thought
that's basically the tradition i think
there's
probably something to it something that
we acquired probably
200 000 years ago or not not much longer
right
seems to be so i mean we now have
genomic evidence
that shows that uh humans homo sapiens
that began to separate at least
150 000 years ago which is not
very long after uh you know homo sapiens
anatomically modern humans appeared and
as far as anybody knows they all have
the same language faculty
interestingly slightly different
externalizations
you know rini hoy birds dutch linguist
that's a very interesting article and
send it to you if you like in which he
uh
he showed pretty convincingly that the
first groups that separated the sun
people in
africa uh are old and only
the length of these speakers the
languages that use clicks
to lever click systems so it
suggests that the externalization
developed
after the split the internal systems
were already in place
it's a pretty hard argument to make
because
there's also evidence that
externalization is
immediate the evidence comes from
two infants who have
deaf deaf children whose parents from
speaking
parents who just are
say play together group of cousins play
together
but they've never they have no
linguistic input
especially because the parents are
indoctrinated in
the oralist tradition which says you're
not allowed to make gestures
parents walk around like this which is
totally insane but
it's a strong tradition people don't do
it anymore but they did it
sometimes so there are cases of small
groups of kids
like a group of cousins let's say who
play together
have no linguistic input they develop
their own sign language
but it's externalized now
as far as we know there has been no
evolution
of the language faculty for a couple
hundred thousand years
so these kids are presumably the same as
the ones
hundred two hundred thousand years ago
that they're externalizing right away
which means their ancestors presumably
were as well
now it could be that this is related to
the fact that they're in a society
where they just see people interacting
even if they don't know how they're
doing it and maybe that
stimulates
the process you can't know this is one
of the cases where you could
carry out experiments except you're not
allowed
so you can imagine lots of experiments
that tell you quite a lot
