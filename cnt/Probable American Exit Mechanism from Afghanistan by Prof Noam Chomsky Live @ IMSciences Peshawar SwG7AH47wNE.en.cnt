professor Chomsky welcome to I'm
sciences
my name is marcin Khan and I am the head
of this institution
I'm sciences the mid-sized business
school of Pakistan we and we are based
in KPK which is the province very close
to Afghanistan where we are located we
are about half an hour of driving time
from the border with Afghanistan we
would like to welcome you and thank you
also for giving the time for this
session today I have with me here my
students faculty members some of our
board members and some of Vice
Chancellors previous chancellors they're
all very eager to listen to you the
topic we thought we would discuss with
you and hear your viewpoint is how would
the Americans extricate themselves from
this imbroglio in Afghanistan when we
were trying to arrange this session at
that time it was the American view was
that they will leave Afghanistan and
leave just a handful of soldiers for the
embassy protection but in last couple of
weeks as you know President Obama's
administration has changed their
decision and they are thinking of
keeping nine to ten thousand of their
forces here so it in a sense means that
their policy has again failed and you
are an expert in this area among other
areas questions we had already forwarded
to you but those questions I think some
of them has already changed the scenario
so we would like to hear from you and
then from my audience there will be
questions to you but first we would like
to hear your opening remarks please
well there's no doubt that the policies
have been a total failure the some of
the reasons are well known they were
reviewed in some detail and very
persuasively and a important book by
Anand Gopal there - ago and those what
he discovered and reviewed is just
continuing the American forces and the
native forces generally hardly know what
they're doing they're being used by one
or another world over to settle settle
their own grievances and interests it's
led to the spread of lawless destructive
system which is just expanding the
Taliban of course we're exploiting it
and appear to be stronger than ever
until the basic sources of the conflicts
are dealt with which have to do with the
rights of various groups including
crucially the Pashtun population which
has been marginalized there's just going
to be no settlement there it cannot be
settled by force and violence the use of
force for the last fourteen years has
spread jihadi terror from a tiny corner
of earth back Afghanistan Pakistan at
the large parts of the world from West
Africa to South Asia and Southeast Asia
and
led to the development of really
monstrous forces like gold Islamic state
and the more the region is struck by
sledgehammers of violence without
attention to the social economic and
political problems the needs and
concerns and the tribal areas and
elsewhere I think it's just going to be
more and more disaster there's no sign
of any significant improvement small
sectors here and there but not much
totally in commensurate with the huge
efforts that have been poured in which
have mostly had harmful effects so
there's I see no alternative
to move internal to Afghanistan and the
tribal areas in Pakistan towards some
kind of reconciliation and accommodation
of local forces Outsiders are so far
have been quite harmful and that's been
true for a long time and they show no
signs of having constructive policies
that would help in a better direction
think tanks do you think that think
tanks that you have in the US
administration supporting it aren't they
able to guide the administration how to
get out of this situation and how to
improve the situation here because as
you see it has expanded to other areas
other countries as well the answer to
that is unfortunately in the historical
record of the preceding years
as we can see we can all see before our
eyes
whatever if the think tanks have had
some kind of an impact it has not
translated into constructive policies
that are improving the situation on the
contrary the policies keep being
repeated with the same negative
consequences and there are people who've
had proposals like Akbar Achmed for
example but as far as I know these are
not being considered ok I have lived in
the Anniston for about three and a half
years and when I left Afghanistan in
2008 there was some ray of hope because
somehow in that madness there were
certain things which were falling in
place but I was there only last month
and I tell you that there was a complete
lack of trust and lack of hope amongst
the people there is a large number of
educated people who are fleeing the
country they are going to India they're
going to Europe they're going to Iran a
large number of people are going to Iran
because they believe that with the
partial ease of sanctions on Iran they
could go into Iran and then from there
Turkey and all that so the situation as
it looks today people are of the view
that either it is going to be the
Taliban or it is going to be the ISIS
who are going to take over and everybody
is on the run
unfortunately that's correct there have
been in the past periods when there were
rays of hope that was actually true even
there during the Najib Razak brief
period before the West allowed the
extremist groups of the John Dean to
destroy whatever possibilities there
were paving the way for the Taliban and
since then yes occasionally there have
been a few rays of hope but they've been
dimmed which just tells us that the
basic policies are seriously misguided
and that there has to be a shift in
direction which will I think simply have
to come from accommodation that of local
forces paying attention to their
concerns and interests without the
imposition of a lawless brutal reign of
the either violent warlords or Taliban
or the worst possible would be if Isis
sets up a kind of a base there I don't
actually expect that but it could happen
which would be the absolute worst
outcome and I think those are the
directions in which we're going exactly
as you described and there was a period
also at the end of the last periods of
the Russian occupation when educated
people did have some kind of options but
that soon end
professor my name is Ruth fella and I
have had the pleasure of being abducted
by Taliban for a year and I was spent a
year with them so I was just simply like
I would just simply like to ask a
question which is not directly related
to the topic but when the Russians left
of mana Stan I think the whole world
including Pakistan abandoned Afghanistan
and the Mujahideen which took were V
which which actually led to the Exeter
for the Russians now was it planed
actually that way because Afghanistan
was just left in the lurch and the
Taliban actually are basically turned
Mujahideen so did anybody actually
realized that at that time so I didn't
understand the question could you repeat
it I understood that you were captured
by the Taliban for a year yes yes and
what was what was I didn't understand
the question well the question actually
is that when the Russians left
Afghanistan yeah Afghanistan they was
abandoned was my the world abandoned
exactly when the Russians withdrew their
aid - not even the United States did not
withdraw aid to the extremist elements
of the Mujahideen yes terror that was so
extreme that when the Taliban suddenly
came there many people awful than what
was there and then they established the
regime of
regression and violence it's possible
that they could have been overthrown
from within that certainly opinion
anti-taliban activists within within
Afghanistan we don't know but finally
came the war and the invasion and that
just well you're quite right abandoning
Afghanistan at that time was it to the
people who were gonna destroy it was a
terrible mistake it's not crying well
there is something else also which is
connected to this thing is it that the
West actually is trying to impose
democracy is try is imposed to the West
the West the West
of course everyone talks about democracy
even Stalin talked about democracy but
if you sort of know whether they're
trying to impose democracy you look at
policies so the west meaning I say take
France and Africa where they supported
the most vicious brutal dictators and
undermine popular forces in their region
so that they can maintain control
British exactly the same in the post
Second World War era the United States
has been the most important country of
the West by a large margin and its
record has been to undermine democracy
repeatedly in fact this is well
established in scholarly study
even the studies by the most strong by
the strongest advocates of what's called
democracy promotion like take a look at
the literature of the the main works
scholarly work on what's called
democracy promotion has been done by a a
scholar political figure Thomas
Carruthers who was head of the Carnegie
Endowment for peace long democracy and
he was he's basically a Reaganite he was
in the Reagan State Department working
on democracy promotion and he's done
extensive studies of u.s. democracy
promotion policies in primarily in Latin
America but elsewhere as well and he
draws a very clear conclusion which is
pretty obvious from anybody's been
watching it he says these policies are
what he calls schizophrenic meaning
there's talk about democracy but action
to undermine it in Latin America the
area where the US has by far the most
influence he pointed out that there had
been moved to democracy in the southern
cone the southern part of the hemisphere
where the United States had least
influence and the US has tried to impede
them but they went on anyway as he moved
to regions closer to US influence
Central America and the Caribbean there
have been many fewer steps towards
democratization there under US control
and he says the reason is that the
United States has supported democracy
that wants to maintain top-down forms of
rule in the hands of elite elements who
are susceptible to US influence and
control now he's not a left-wing critic
he's coming
the Reaganite pro-democracy promotion
efforts but he's a serious scholar and
he observes what's happening and the
same is true in the Middle East and
elsewhere
take a look at democracy promotion in
Iraq when the u.s. invaded Iraq there
was no it was virtually no talk about
democracy promotion a few words on the
side of routine words that leaders use
all the time the single question single
question as George Bush and Tony Blair
kept repeating was erect wrecks weapons
of mass destruction that was the single
question right okay
turns out the single question at the
wrong answer answer was discovered all
of a sudden it turned out that the
reason for the u.s. british invasion was
to promote democracy arrest
they were polled about 1% of iraqis of
course in the West the educated classes
the media immediately jumped on the band
you got into this French French birthday
here place of French influence so with
the friendship strongly supported The
Dictator kept supporting him literally
even after he'd been driven out of the
country
finally
when he was in the primary with us as I
say even Stalin but serious person will
pay no attention to the rhetoric of
leaders their action and the reasons for
opposition to democracy are pretty clear
democratic forces will the democratic
development will tend to empower popular
forces who follow policies
us in there simply take a look for good
reasons as well States which is
democratic in the United States about
mainstream political science that about
seventy percent of the population the
lowest seventy percent on the income
scale or simply unrepresented their
attitudes and opinions have no
detectable effect as you move up the
scale influence very policies formulated
very far from state credit right but the
outcome of social and economic forces is
to produce and that's in the interest
this coming coming back to Afghanistan
professor Chomsky there is a wide held
view that the way the present government
is structured with the president which
is a constitutional position and with a
chief executive with a non
constitutional title the government is
weak and it is in a total disarray how
do we expect a weak government and a
very confused government to resolve
massive issue political and security
issue in Afghanistan
leads to talk about the outsiders or the
powers from outside how can the
Americans or the West expect the present
arrangement to deliver because there is
a very huge contradiction Abdullah
Abdullah he he believes that if Ashraf
Ghani strengthens or he that would
amount to his political death so so
nothing is really happening out there
the orders from the top never reach the
the lower echelons of the government and
people have losing faith in the ability
of the present government to deliver at
you know at any state the answer I think
is self-evident there's no way for a
government structure like that to
deliver the end result is where people
live what they see what's around them is
lawlessness corruption from that nothing
to almost nothing to trust in the
government governmental structures that
we saw that in Kunduz recently but
elsewhere as well
this kind of structure certainly cannot
function oh the only hope that I can see
is things like the there's a very
interesting mostly youth young peace
movement in Afghanistan among young
people if it can extend and develop I
think it offers hope from the ground
popular movements developing can if they
get outside support offer some rays of
hope for accommodation locally for
introducing more responsive lawful
authorities and maybe ultimately it can
affect the general governmental
structure but it's not I don't it's not
going to come from Western initiative or
from the top where people have their own
interests I should say Pakistan has had
a very ugly role in all of this for a
long time that's a separate story
professor many of gone believes that the
Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan is
acting as Pakistan proxies what is your
opinion on the indigenous roots of the
Taliban insurgency and what would
hypothetically what would happen if
Pakistan severed its relation with
Taliban in Afghanistan Pakistan is
wedded to a policy which is
self-destructive and is going to harm
anyone in the region the policy is
trying to confront India with militarily
at a level of some sort of to maintain
some sort of military balance with India
that's impossible
the country kind of developed cannot
deal with its own problems until it
makes serious moves towards
reconciliation with India this is two
directions India two has to move but
that the primary concern for Pakistan
and I think for India ought to be to
reduce limit resolve the india-pakistan
conflict to demilitarize it to move
towards a settlement in Kashmir to begin
to dismantle the extremely dangerous
nuclear weapon systems and to move as
much as they can towards putting an end
to the
confrontation and hostility which is
poisoning the whole region as long as
Pakistani policy is guided by this
belief that they strategic doctrine that
they have to maintain control of
Afghanistan as a weapon against India
it's gonna be a disaster and it's a
disaster for Pakistan Pakistan is a
country who has plenty of internal
problems I you know him better than I do
I don't have to run through them they're
enormous and that they just cannot be
confronted when the government and state
policy is directed towards a hopeless
self-destructive confrontation with
India which will never achieve anything
except undermining destroying Pakistan
so I think that's got to be item number
one for a packet for Pakistanis and if
they can make some progress on that and
that of course requires Indian
cooperation as well same problem at the
other side then maybe Pakistan can
withdraw from its extremely harmful
activities in Afghanistan including its
complex support for Taliban and other
groups
Chomsky my question is about the
structure of power in Afghanistan since
the invasion of Afghanistan back in 2001
by the Western forces the emphasis has
been more to support the northern allies
certain group of ethnicity the per tune
have been completely alienated thus
creating chaos in Afghanistan what do
you say about that obvious from the
first from the very beginning that
supporting the Northern Alliance was
going to exacerbate already existing
ethnic and tribal conflicts and that the
Pashtun population would be bitter
resentful and supportive of efforts to
overcome the regime which to them which
is just what's happened yes that's quite
true something similar happened in Iraq
the Iraqi society was very weak already
it had virtually been destroyed by the
vicious sanctions of the 1990s which
were literally almost genocide of the
administrators of the sanctions
distinguished international diplomats
Denis Halliday Mullen sponeck both of
them resigned in protest because they
regarded this sanctions as in their
words genocide 'el and they also pointed
out pretty plausibly I think that the
sanctions were destroying the civilian
society strengthening the dictator and
possibly saving him from being
overthrown from within as has happened
to a whole string of dictators anyway
the society was it had been an advanced
society was quite weak semi shattered
then came the invasion the invasion was
like a sledgehammer hitting a fragile
system that's going to cause all kinds
of problems but in addition the u.s. in
Vader's instituted a sectarian system
which hadn't existed before they
instituted sectarian divisions that
along with the violence and brutality in
the invasion
pretty soon led inflamed a sectarian
conflict which hadn't existed before
Shiites and Sonny and Iraq we're living
together sometimes they didn't know who
was who you know it was but the the
sledgehammer did incite this conflict
and now it's tearing Iraq to shreds it's
tearing all regions shreds and something
similar happened exactly as you
described in Afghanistan there were
confrontations and conflicts they became
worse as a result of the policies of the
invaders and in particular the kind of
policies that as I mentioned Anand Gopal
in particular spelled out in such detail
the use of West Americans mainly
American troops as weapons by one
gangster against another gangster and
the troops had no idea what they were
doing you know they were told with this
guy is $40 on go kill him that turned
out he was somebody supporting the
United States who was hated by some
other gangster that's happened over and
over again of course that's what happens
when you move into a society that you
understand about which you understand
absolutely nothing and try to impose
solutions by force the chances that
anything decent could come out of that
are miniscule and it's in Italy that's
why respected people like up the lock
for example bitterly condemned the
invasion and before he was killed and
argued that it was
undermining the efforts of anti-taliban
afghan afghans to overthrow the Taliban
from within that there were similar
things in Iraq that I think there's much
merit in those views and in what you
describe what you're described is
unfortunately all too accurate
professor I'm assuming my question is
going to be the last question so I'm
gonna take this liberty to ask you about
something that has been bothering me for
some time ever since I've read your book
your voice has been a voice of dissent
for the law against the American
imperialism and that too for about four
or five decades if not more
I was just wondering how have you
managed this and so far without being
obstructed by so many u.s.
administrations how is it that you can
be so vocal against the policies and
against the implementation of those
policies in the United States there's
plenty of things wrong with the United
States happens to be a very free society
the capacity of the government to
repress is very limited by comparative
standard freedom speech is protected and
beyond any country that I know of there
were kind of reasons for this but the
fact is plain and in fact it goes well
beyond what you probably know like
during the 1960's the Vietnam War I was
in and out of jail came very close to a
long jail sentence for supporting
resistance activities and it wasn't just
me it was a group of numbered quite a
few people you know
huge number but the number we were
mostly employed in a laboratory at MIT
where I am which was a hundred percent
supported by the three armed services
and we were quite openly and publicly
involved in resistance against the war
uh we were not repressed I mean of
course by the government yes obviously
we were asking for it but not by the
institution well that's what it's like
to be in a free society again plenty of
things wrong with the United States lots
of things to criticize but there also
some good things and they haven't been
given as a gift
they've been won by long hard popular
struggle these rights did not exist in
the past they were won by struggle they
got to be maintained all the time
they're always under attack but
nevertheless can be done and it can be
done elsewhere two conditions here in
the past had been extremely arc I've
seen it as a child and in later years
but it's gotten better because of the
struggles of plenty of people to expand
freedom and rights and that's progress
throughout history now you got rid of
slavery that that you get degree of
women women's rights civil civil rights
of freedom speech democratic rights it's
a constant struggle workers right
constant struggle it goes back and
regresses sometimes but overall there's
a kind of a trajectory towards progress
and I think that could be true and
highly conflicted regions like yours as
well with enormous difficulty I am not
underestimated vastly harder than it is
for me here
professor Chomsky I've been given a
chance to ask another question first of
all I'm really grateful that you gave us
a chance in this part of the world to
interact with you my question partially
builds on the previous question
especially that we come from a society
which is not that free by relative
standards for me personally yourself and
people like Professor Norman Finkelstein
who had the chance to interact at
previous opportunities people who have
used academia or the academic discourse
as a great outlet for the passion you
have about political causes that lacks a
lot in this part of the world how my
question is how can we as academics and
academic institutions encourage our
students and the youth to take up this
path and maybe have a stronger say on
the academic platform and push the
causes which we are passionate about
through these means instead of others
many of which are not that good
many of some of which are good in ways
so how can we encourage our students and
how would you encourage students in in
parts of the world like ours thank you
no magic case there are no special
methods or if there are people's kept
them secret the only way to proceed is
by what is second nature to activists
educational efforts reaching out to
people understanding their concerns
encouraging them to think for themselves
moves towards organization where it's
possible picking up whatever kinds of
activism are appropriate the
circumstances it's a constant red
continued struggle I'm gonna take my
friend Norman think
who you mentioned and is has had an
enormous impact I in helping to change
opinion in the United States on the
primary issue that he's been concerned
with Israel Palestine which means very
much marginalized he's is he's written
scholarly work he's given lots of talks
he tries to reach out to any group he
can and over time there's been in effect
I mean I can just tell you from my own
experience until about maybe fifteen
years ago 20 years ago when I gave talks
on Israel Palestine I literally had to
have police protection even at my own
University right here arm city police
insisted on being there my police would
insist on walk me back to my car because
of threats the issue was so tense and
unpopular even on University campuses
that you literally had to have police
protection to talk about it meetings
were broken up near violence often you
know airport security at the University
meetings last ten or fifteen years has
changed enormous Lee by now their norms
crowds a lot of interests Palestinian
rights are one of the main topics on
campus and it's due to the constant slow
dedicated efforts of people like Norman
Norman Finkelstein few others I've been
involved as well and there's just no
other way it was the same on the Vietnam
War when I began giving talks about the
Vietnam War in 1961 I was literally
giving talks in the living rooms of
friends or in a church with maybe four
people there tremendous hostility of the
in Boston which is a quite a liberal
City
first demonstrations against the war
1965 were violently broken up violently
disrupted and broken up a bitter attacks
in the newspapers and so on finally
after a lot of effort a quite
substantial anti-war movement developed
which had a significant impact that's
the same on every other issue that's the
only way just have to keep struggling
ahead and sometimes you can make
progress but the methods are we all know
the methods are education organization
whatever activism is appropriate to
circumstances there's no general answers
whatever it's been that plenty of
historical examples plenty of experience
professor I would like to take a comment
from you on the american extension of
troops on the ground till in afghanistan
till 2017 i would like to know if is it
was it a long time planned planned i can
say a policy of the u.s. of the u.s. or
is it because of the direct involvement
of the Russians in Syria in the fight
against Isis and the other jihadis are
would like to know that was it
a long thought process of the US policy
or hazard taken place because of the
Russian involvement in of in in the
Mideast and maybe the Americans are
thinking that they are going to put
troops pit sometime near in Afghanistan
so I would just like to know how can you
comment on this sir please they're just
trying to put out small fires wherever
they
show up in Afghanistan I don't think it
had anything to do with the Russians
it's that the situation is just totally
out of control they thought they had
hoped that the Afghan army that they'd
worked on would somehow be able to
impose order obviously can't the same is
true in Iraq
I mean Iraq at what happened in Mosul
and Ramadi was just astonishing there's
an Iraqi army of 350,000 men heavily
armed trained by the United States for
years and Iraq had had in the past a
very efficient army you know not a nice
country a lot of things wrong with it
but the army was an efficient
institution take a look at the iraq-iran
war so here's ten years of training by
the United States heavy arms through our
50,000 men as soon as a couple of
jihadis showed up in trucks they ran
away leaving their weapons behind the
generals ran first and the troops ran
after them that was the result of years
and years and billions and billions of
dollars of expenditures the pretty much
the same has happened in Afghanistan you
cannot construct something efficient and
functioning out of a rotten structure
that it has to come from below from
people's actual participation and I
think in Afghanistan the u.s. is just
flailing has no policies Syria is a more
intricate case and bear in mind that the
Russian troops the Russian intervention
was to a certain extent instigated by a
u.s. shipment of advanced armaments
actually that there was actually a
article in The Washington Post the
National Press just a couple of weeks
ago where the headline was something
like
did the United States draw Russia into
Syria and what it described is how the
CIA sending advanced a tow missiles and
he thanked wire-guided tow missiles to
jihadi groups that the state supports
had he had had such a harsh effect on
the Syrian army destroying many tanks
and so on that maybe that's the reason
why the Russians intervened US policy in
Syria is totally incoherent it claims to
be opposed to Isis it's also opposed to
all the forces that are opposing Isis
it's supposed to the Assad government
it's opposed to the jihadi groups but
it's supporting them the illness or
affront the forum's they're hardly
distinguishable from Isis it's mostly a
turf battle on this rough front which is
the main one is supported by Turkey US
ally supported by Qatar and Saudi Arabia
US allies the US as opposed to them the
Kurds of the main ground force fighting
Isis of their main element ek Kay's on
the US terrorist list I mean just can't
put all of this together into any kind
of coherent policy I don't think there
is one and there's no indication of any
long-term policy just trying to patch
things up here and there wherever you
can it's a fading imperialism and that's
the way fading the imperialism behave
Britishers will free us
professor Chomsky thank you very much
for many of us here this is I think the
first opportunity that we've had to talk
to someone and listen to someone who's
written so many books and your stature
and an opinion that everyone respects in
the world we would like to thank you we
are honored and we hope that sometime
again we'll be able to connect with you
and learn more from you so thank you
very much and have a very nice day
