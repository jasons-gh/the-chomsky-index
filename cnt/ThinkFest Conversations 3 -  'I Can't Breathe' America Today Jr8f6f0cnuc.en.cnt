hello everyone this is madame safety and
I have with me tonight professor Noam
Chomsky professor Chomsky doesn't need
any introduction but I need to introduce
this series of think Fest conversations
to you again the first conversation was
with William Dalrymple the second one
was with Anatole even and now I have the
privilege of talking to professor
Chomsky I just want to give you a brief
introduction to Professor Chomsky also
although he doesn't need any
introductions but still for the sake of
young people who are not terribly
familiar with his life and his devotion
and dedication to public service as
possibly the world's leading public
intellectual of our times professor
Chomsky is a linguist and the
philosopher but that is how is known in
academic circles but in progressive
intellectual and political circles he is
the towering voice on the subject of
politics ideology power foreign policy
American hegemony and so on and so forth
things that shape the modern world he
has over a hundred books to his credit
can you believe it
over a hundred books and he has over two
dozen 180 degrees from across the globe
from Howard in America Cambridge
University in the UK Calcutta far away
and so on and so forth of course he's an
alumni of MIT so without further ado let
me get straight to the
question-and-answer session with
Professor Chomsky Noam it's good to see
you again after a long time yes I
remember visit very well yes a lot of
people will not know because Noam
Chomsky and his wife Carol at that time
came to Pakistan in 2002 to give a
series of lectures here in Lahore and
our invitation the invitation of the
Daily Times which I was editing at that
time and I can tell you one thing
we advertised it and many of us were not
sure how well lorries were acquainted
with professor Chomsky's works but in
the end we had a hall that was what was
meant to accommodate a thousand people
and in the end we had to accommodate
over two thousand people and we had to
put people at the gates to stop people
from gate-crashing that was the sort of
interest No aroused at that time and
that is in 2002 so you can well imagine
it's been many years since he was in law
ha and I was just asking him what sort
of memories he carries of those days a
few days that he spent him law was a
very enlightening visit especially that
lovely evening at your home thank you
well I must tell you that lorries
remember you with great fondness when
people found out that we were going to
be talking to you tonight a lot of them
sent in questions a lot of young people
sent in a lot of questions and I'm
afraid that we will not be able to ask
all those questions of you because we
have only 45 minutes or so but I will
try and summarize many of them and in
the hope that we can put them all
together in terms of a coherence okay so
the first question that I have on my
agenda is the question a lot of people
are asking and I think you have answered
it in different interviews but I think
for a Pakistani audiences it would be
great for you to tell us once again
President Bush talked about the arrival
of a pandemic the possibility or the
threat of a pandemic there was like 10
years ago President Obama talked about
it
Bill Gates has been talking about it and
yet when it does happen it seems America
and the rest of the world are totally
unprepared for it how do you explain
that well this very simple reason
President George HW Bush the first Bush
back in 1990 established a scientific
review board for the
for the president president scientific
advisory council Pisac soon as Obama
came into office he meet with one of his
first acts was to call the committee
together discuss crucial issues with
them and then he requested right away
that they prepare a study on how to be
how to act in the case of a pandemic
coming it was understood that a pandemic
was very likely after the SARS epidemic
in 2003 coronavirus epidemic was
contained but scientists knew that it
was very likely that a another and more
severe one would come they knew how to
prepare for it they had started working
on vaccines we can talk later about why
that didn't proceed but anyway they
began so Obama did call on his act to
provide a program for dealing with an
eventual pandemic and a few weeks later
they came up with a program government
began to implement it there were
preparations in place well in January
2017 President Trump took office
first things he did within the first few
days was dismantle the entire system
throw it out I also began eliminating
the scientific advisory council this is
a he's trying to turn the country into
one that you will recognize Pakistan a
country that has no interest in science
he wants the government to eliminate
science one of his current infectees the
whole scientific advisory apparatus says
that pretty much been dismantled he's
following the advice of his one of his
favorite figures rush limbaugh to whom
he gave the Presidential Medal of Honour
radio television personality who reaches
tens of millions of people and he's the
main source of information for
Republicans along with Fox News and
according to Limbaugh there are four
corners of deceit in the world one of
them is academia the other is government
the other is media and the last is
science they exist on the basis of
deceit cannot pay any attention to them
so that's one of the hallmarks of the
administration Trump went on to defund
the Center for Disease Control and other
health-related components of the
government now the u.s. did have
programs in which scientists were
working in China with Chinese scientists
to try to identify potential
coronaviruses
the deep in caves where their bats and
so on
Trump eliminated the programs in 2017 US
intelligence warned the government that
there was a potential
pandemic coming they were dismissed when
the pandemic finally came the United
States was uniquely unprepared to deal
with him that's what happens when you
throw a science out the window when you
change policy to have one goal enriching
the wealthy and strengthening private
power and throw out everything else
that's what happens now of course you
can't blame this entirely on Trump there
are deeper problems the deeper the
deeper problem is capitalism it's a
capitalist crisis we should recognize
that but in 2003 as I said scientists
were warning the world another virus is
coming maybe a worse one
well it's not enough to have the
knowledge somebody has to do something
about it
who could it be well the obvious
candidate is the drug companies they
have all the resources a huge profits
the World Trade Organization agreements
give them enormous monopolies patent
rights if profits coming out of the
years but they can't do it because they
follow capitalist logic which is you do
what's profitable and it's not
profitable to prepare for a catastrophe
that will come down the road well
there's an alternative government
actually government does most of the
research for vaccines and and drugs
anyway then hands it over to private
companies government has plenty of
resources outstanding laboratories but
they can't do it because of something
called neoliberalism now you may recall
when President Reagan Margaret Thatcher
came into office 40 years ago there
slogan was government is the problem not
the solution that means decisions have
to be transferred from government which
is partially accountable to the
population into the hands of private
tyrannies corporations which are totally
unaccountable to the population that's
there is no alternative as Thatcher put
it so the government is L so therefore
nobody can do it so there was no
preparation on the part of any of the
governments that were subjected to the
neoliberal plague and it is a plague
it's been very harmful to people all
over the world very beneficial to the
designers riches have wealth is
concentrated to an extraordinary degree
the corporations are more powerful than
ever
financial institutions which are mostly
predatory and harmful to the economy
have almost taken over the economy it's
been a general disaster leads to crisis
after crisis the 2008 crisis caused by
financial institutions was pretty
serious
they were bailed out they assumed that
whatever they do because they don't want
government tell people but it has to be
there to help them that's happening
again right now as we speak of the
government US government has produced an
enormous stimulus several trillion
dollars most of us being fed the bank's
not the banks to decide to do with what
they want you can guess what they're
doing now the Treasury is pouring huge
amounts of money into buying stocks and
bonds to keep the stock market ROI
benefits rich Investor's and management
it does almost nothing for the economy
they're not putting the money into the
pockets of people into developing
infrastructure into improving education
in health the things that could actually
grow the economy the difference
it's a neoliberal Society runs for the
benefit of private wealth and corporate
mostly financial power so yes there's
disaster after disaster another pandemic
is sure to come scientists are warning
about it right now worse than this one
yep but professor Jones had a meal
Dober of 2019 there was something
happening in Washington DC I think it
was event 2002 zero one where a lot of
people came and did simulation exercise
about what would happen in the event of
a pandemic and there are a lot of
conspiracy theories going around that
there was some knowledge about something
was about to happen in certain circles
relation exercise the simulation if you
remember to 0 1 2019
there was a major simulation October
2000 1990 yes yes it was a simulation of
a return
right it was they ran through what could
happen what should you do about it
US government totally ignored it totally
in fact European too but this was so
close to an event was about to happen so
there are a lot of conspiracy theories
about it do you buy any of that or do
you think this was just something that
was in the pipeline and they came and
they discussed and they never came to
any conclusions in terms of how to
advise various comments because under
neoliberal rules you pay no attention to
what benefits people you pay no
attention to governments you labor to
put power in the hands of private wealth
and private enterprises the corporate
system that is the goal of policy you
can see it all over that take the United
States which is in the lead by now wages
have stagnated for 40 years
the real wages of American workers are
about what they were 40 years ago
meanwhile wealth has concentrated to an
extraordinary event degree 0.1% not 1%
0.1% of the population has 20% of the
wealth a majority of the population
lived from paycheck to paycheck nothing
extra in case something happens it
affects the hospital system so the
hospital system like everything has to
be run on a business model the business
model means no spare capacity if you're
producing an automobile you have an
assembly line you don't want to have
spare of capacity that wastes money so
for profit you just use the minimum
that's required well you can get away
with it in producing automobiles you
can't get away with it in the whole
system of the health system if you don't
have if anything
slightly goes wrong it's a disaster no
extra beds the nerd nurses no spares no
diagnostic capacity everything collapses
that's on top of the fact that the
United States is almost alone in the
world in having a privatized health care
system there is no government national
health care
it's a highly inefficient system about
twice the expenses of comparable
countries some of the worst outcomes
the world's leading medical journal The
Lancet in England recently had a review
of it said it concluded that the system
wastes about half a trillion dollars a
year and about 70 thousand extra deaths
now that's what happens when you have a
business run privatized system aiming
for profit not health now actually the
United States does have a universal
health care system it's called emergency
rooms if you can drag yourself to an
emergency room and the law requires that
they take care of you it's the most
expensive savage cruel system of
universal health care anywhere but is
exactly in accord with neoliberal
principles
wherever they apply you have one or
another form of this kind of savagery
professors domsky you say that President
Trump is all about me Capital m capital
E I mean that's interesting and what
does me stand for because in April of
this year there was a Pew Research study
that said that nearly eighty three
percent of Republicans thought that he
was handling the Cova crisis rather well
I mean this is in April as late as April
what is it about the Republican Party
p.m. President Trump
and his ideology that the support for
background you have to see what happened
when the pandemic struck by mid January
China Chinese scientists had identified
the virus sequence the genome given the
information to the World Health
Organization the entire world
if I roll adjusts all over the world
knew exactly what was happening
some countries reacted countries that
where the government has some concern
for their citizens so the countries of
East Asia Oceania New Zealand Australia
they reacted at once they now have the
pandemic pretty much under control New
Zealand has no cases Taiwan South Korea
almost none Europe waited they didn't
pay much attention to these Asians and
finally they began to act in one or
another way the better organized
societies like Germany in Norway it
pretty much under control the United
Kingdom not very well the United States
did nothing US intelligence was banging
on the doors of the White House trying
to get President Trump to pay attention
he didn't care and he just looks at his
TV ratings and the stock market finally
in March two months later he had already
been responsible for killing tens of
thousands of Americans and finally he
began to pay some attention since then
has been total chaos though you have to
understand that Trump is that people
call him fascist I don't think that's
the right term
he's like a tin-pot dictator of a small
country yes things just has
total power in his hands has to run
everything if anybody crosses him throw
him out so a couple of weeks ago for
example the scientist who's at the head
of vaccine production made some comments
about Trump's quack medicines it was
fired a few days ago one senator the
first Republican senator to dare to say
something
they said Murkowski of Alaska said she
was uncomfortable with some of the
things Trump was doing he launched into
a huge attack on her said he's going to
destroy her nobody can say that say
anything okay this is a small-time
dictator malignant a psychopath destroy
anything for his own benefit and for the
benefit of those who works for private
wealth and corporate power but yet
exactly as you say 83% of Republicans
say he's doing a good job on the
pandemic if you want to know why you
have to look at the where Republicans
get their information from it's been
studied three sources one of them is Fox
News which is an echo chamber of the
government the other is Rush Limbaugh
who I already talked about the third is
Breitbart news started by Steve Bannon
another echo of the government okay it's
like living in a totalitarian state
where all you hear is government
propaganda that's what you hear what are
you supposed to believe that furthermore
media I just come back to the question
of the media but there's another
question that comes to mind because the
media is not just about covert the media
is also about what happens subsequently
or what has happened recently the
so-called race riot has become something
much bigger than that so 50 years you'd
have you had race riots but this was
the unprecedented no but people have
anticipated this nobody did and it is
now cut across regions race ethnicity
class color everything it's just
happened all of a sudden things have
come together and sparked off something
that is now leading to all sorts of
manifestations of oak in terms of what
the future brings people were depressed
about Kuwait how it would affect the
world and now after this there is a lot
of hope that perhaps there is
possibility of change for good because
of the forces of progressivism that have
now come together and are challenging
American hegemony and western new
liberal economics and market forces and
so on so now how do you attribute what
what do you think is led to this however
all these people come together at this
particular moment and explode it
it's a moment that's certainly true we
were talking about Republicans not
people the Republicans are a minority
party in the United States they're based
the the only reason they win elections
is because of the highly regressive
American political system which does so
low
look because of the way it's set up no
they could talk about the details but
there's a major constitutional crisis
coming up in the United States because
of this the there are very positive
developments now let's take the reaction
to the George Floyd murder there's an
enormous reaction all over the country
completely unprecedented there's been
nothing like there have been reactions
to police murders before but they were
localized in the place where it happened
so in Los Angeles 30 years ago they may
recall the Rodney King black man
practically beaten to death by police
there were riots for a week 60 people
killed called in federal troops but it
was in Los Angeles no there's another
since there's been nothing like this all
over the country people are aroused
enormous crowds solidarity black and
white even support from the highest
military command the former Chiefs of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff top of the
military have expressed support for the
protesters all of this is completely
without precedent and there's widespread
concern all over that this neoliberal
system has to be overthrown and changed
even in the most extraordinary places so
the leading Business Journal in the
world is the Financial Times of London
Business Journal had an editorial saying
we have to have radical changes their
word in the socio-economic system this
is a disaster there's plenty of force
for it but it has to be organized those
who created the system or heard hard at
work to make sure that it remains even
even in a harsh
form with more surveillance more control
they're working on it right now I can
give you details a Trump for example
right during the pandemic is using the
opportunity to continue to expand a
deregulation of fossil fuels and
emissions so make sure that the
industries that are destroying the world
or even more free to do it he's trying
to make these destruction of the
regulatory apparatus permanent quietly
while nobody's looking
it's a mentioned what they're doing with
the bailout all efforts to ensure that
the system remains and if people don't
get organized to stop it that's what'll
happen so yes any of energy any
enthusiasm has to be organized I mean is
it true I mean would it be true to say
that in your 91 years old do you now see
that your long struggle of activism and
of other people like yourself and in
recent times Bernie Sanders who's I I
mean I I think he's had a role to play
in raising consciousness in the new
generation professor Chomsky my question
is do you think Bernie Sanders his
campaign for a more progressive
capitalism or progressive America do you
think that is contributed in some way to
raising the consciousness of the people
who came out on the streets of rocks
costs and race and ethnicity and color
because there's been a lot of support
for him in America and there's a lot of
support from him in the rest of the
world too that's the sort of leader
America needs and now you've teamed up
with him to set up a new organization
called progressive International which
you intend to launch in September of
this year so how do you see things
playing out
well the Sanders campaign was an
enormous success it brought together
many activists
herbs that already existed created new
ones he broke with a hundred years of
American political history by coming
very close to winning an election with
no support from private wealth no
support from the corporate sector no
support from the media just popular
support that hasn't happened for over a
hundred years it's tremendous effect and
the activism that he helped inspire has
actually driven the Democratic Party
farther to the left and it's ever been
since the Roosevelt years literally
Sanders along with the Yanis varoufakis
in Europe who organized the m25 that's a
transnational Europe organization
working to salvage what is valuable in
the European Union and to overcome it's
very serious flaws so of our focus and
Sanders combined to initiate a
progressive international they had their
first formal opening about a week ago of
their first meeting will be in Iceland
in September in Iceland because the
prime minister of Iceland ism is at one
of the directors of the Progressive
International initiative springing
invoices from not only Europe in the
United States but all over the global
self it has the possibility to be a
major organizing central force for the
vast number of people around the world
who recognize that we have to escape
from the stranglehold of the neoliberal
assault on the population now we have to
go deeper and dismantle the
list roots of the crisis that we're
facing and we should recognize we're
talking about the pandemic that's
serious but let's be realistic we will
overcome the pandemic that serious cost
because of people like Trump very
serious cost but it'll be overcome we're
not going to overcome the melting of the
Arctic ice sheets the melting of the
glaciers at the Himalayas
the processes which in another 50 years
according to the best scientific
analyses will render much of the
habitable world unlivable which happens
to include South Asia South Asia is
facing an extraordinary crisis if things
continue on their present course in
another maybe 50 years that much of the
region will be literally unlivable the
water supplies will be there already
depleted they'll be much more severely
depleted in the in Pakistan
nuclear-armed countries will be
struggling with each other to try to
obtain what little water remains this is
a prescription for Cataclysm not just as
a stir total Cataclysm within another
generation or two and what's being done
about this not much that's naughty it's
barely even being discussed incidentally
if I mayn't it yet you gonna wave him
you're supposed to famously said that
the left or progressive people don't
vote for people they would against
people am I to take that to mean that in
the presidential election coming up you
would expect progressive leftist people
to vote for Joe Biden because they don't
want to vote the
you'd expect them to but unfortunately
there's a very irrational strain in
parts of the lift it's not new it's been
around for a long time very
self-destructive strain if we don't get
everything we want we're gonna quit okay
so many of the young supporters of
Sanders were hoping that he would win
the nomination came very close but
didn't win it was a great success an
enormous success but not a total success
so now they're forming a movement called
the never Biden a movement saying we're
not gonna vote for bud which if you know
arithmetic means weren't gonna vote for
Trump you take a vote away from the
opposition same as giving a hook to the
other candidate but to try to get people
to understand this is very hard and it's
not new I can remember during the
Vietnam War the Vietnamese were pleading
with Americans not to get involved in
violent protests because they understood
that violent protests simply build up
support for the more reactionary of
repressive violent forces in the United
States but a lot of young kids wanted to
show how angry they were so they'd break
windows and attack stores you know put
bombs and university premises and so on
exactly the means to strengthen support
for the war was very difficult to talk
them out of it we can go back to my
childhood since you mentioned my age my
childhood is the 1930s I can remember
very well when the German Communist
Party under Stalin's orders refused to
cooperate with Social Democrats to stop
Hitler that undermined the labor
movement opened the way for Hitler to
take over their slogan was they're all
social fascists anyway so we don't care
which women win that brought us Hitler
and all that this is not new it's a it's
a disease that Happ comes up over and
over you have to try to control it you
have to pay it
I mean activists should understand that
there's two kinds of activism there's
one kind that makes you feel good is
another kind that actually does good and
they're different may make you feel good
not to vote for a corporate liberal but
you're in fact voting for the worst
malignancy you can imagine you have to
think through that it's like being
against science if you refuse to think
you're gonna have lead to disaster you
can one of my favorite slogans from my
childhood
is a fascist general from one of
Franco's favored generals in 1936 they
said in Spanish Abajo
la Intelligencia viva la muerte down
with intelligence viva death so was his
slogan
okay we're seeing pieces of it red in
Pakistan as we'll know yes I have two
more questions one is of course this
question of neoliberalism and you talked
about the three challenges that the
globe faces the world faces you talk
about climate change you talk about the
nuclear the possibility of nuclear war
and then you talk about the possibility
that neoliberal authoritarianism might
sweep the world now given the current
situation when people are actually
hoping that the new liberals can be
turned back how mystic argue that
damn now we even succeed they are trying
very hard to come back the same groups
that created the situation we're now in
or struggling to ensure that it returns
in an even harsher form they are
relentless they don't stop I've given a
few examples there are many others and
they will succeed unless there is a
strong counter force and if you look at
the people of the world there is a
certainly a basis for a strong counter
force which will overthrow the savagery
move on to a much better world but it
has to be organized and active and
dedicated and realistic has to pay
attention to the facts so take Pakistan
and India Pakistanis and Indians have to
face the fact that unless they come
together in solidarity end the crazy
arms production turned to the problem of
making South Asia survivable survivable
it's not going to survive in 50 or more
years on our present course they have to
dedicate themselves to that put aside
the corals about where this line is
where that line is turned to the best
scientific knowledge and understanding
gained a realistic picture of the world
and where it's going and work together
to put end the crazy dedication to
creating more means to destroy one
another put an end to that and work on
trying to ensure that people in South
Asia will have water to drink will have
life livable lives will be out of the
miserable slums in which they are will
have a chance for
decent life will deal with the enormous
problems of heating the globe which can
be done but it's not not we don't have
much time to do it put an end to nuclear
weapons which will just destroy us all
of that can be done I understand your
Center yes I understand your sentiments
but you know next door to Pakistan we
have a new liberal authoritarian ruler
and this whole notion and if I want to
breathe well the Palestinians are not
able to breathe the Canaries are not
able to breathe and yet we see some
signs of hope after what ask or after
what we've seen recently in America
energy in terms of globalizing it
protests against such policies now are
you hopeful are you really sincerely
hopeful that you know rhetoric aside we
may be able to make some headway in
achieving some of these objectives in
the post corolla world
there's a famous there's a slogan that
antonio gramsci made famous when he was
in Mussolini's prisons the slogan was
pessimism of the intellect optimism of
the will you should be realistic but you
should recognize that there are
opportunities and those are the ones you
have to grasp it doesn't matter how
hopeful you feel there are opportunities
and you have two choices you can decide
it's all over I'm gonna be pessimistic
it's not worth it you can help ensure
that the worst will happen or you can
grasp the opportunities that exist
dedicate yourself to them maybe it'll be
a better world it's not much
you know we've fought we've heard about
martial law in the United States I mean
this is unheard of we've been led to
believe that
the greatest democracy in the world and
now we hear hello Marshall Oh I mean
those are terms we hear in our part of
the world and now we hear of martial law
in the United States is there any chance
you think that President Trump in order
to win his election might resort also
the creation of some sort of militia or
something like that well it's it's
interesting that there has been concern
about that for some time now the concern
is public in mainstream places even
highly respected analysts so just a few
days ago one of the most highly
respected political analysts man with
long service in the CIA as a political
analyst working mostly in third-world
countries he may have been in Pakistan
Robert Baer made it talked over CNN main
television and he said that if he were a
fire an intelligence officer working in
the United States he would think it's on
the verge of martial law and
dictatorship he says it's an amazing
fact democracy's function not so much on
the basis of law on the basis of trust
so take British democracy oldest in the
world
the Britain has a constitution it's
about ten words long the government has
functioned for since the 17th century on
the basis of trust and good faith it's
assumed that people in government will
be trustworthy
not just mafia criminals that they'll be
cooperative they'll be supportive of one
another no more or less have the welfare
of the country at heart
that's eroding in Britain but it's
lasted for 350 years same in the United
States there happens to be a
constitution but the Constitution
doesn't prevent the government the
executive from saying I'm declaring
Martial Law everybody else get out we're
running the country with our militias
it's legal
nobody ever conceived of it is happening
because the government functioned as a
Democratic Society there were plenty of
bad things that Richard Nixon did bad
things but nothing like this the
malignancy in the White House now is
utterly without precedent
the president doesn't care about
anything anything except himself and his
need to placate his rich supporters he
knows that he can get away with his
antics as long as the very rich and the
corporate sector tolerate him if they
don't tolerate him anymore he's out so
therefore his entire legislative program
everything we go through it point by
point is designed to enrich the very
wealthy and to enhance corporate power
it's the tax scam the deregulation the
opposition to cloak denial of global
warming all of it
[Music]
the people stop him will others in the
government stop it
the Republican Party has disintegrated
this happened before Trump he made it
worse there are no longer report lumetri
party and if you look at international
comparisons they ranked alongside the
parties in Europe with neo-fascist
origins and they are tough they are
totally intimidated by the president
some of the things that happens you may
not have even observed them are hard to
believe like in the executive branch of
the government
there are inspector generals for every
department people whose responsibility
is to ensure that the department runs
honestly without corruption without
violation of law the Trump has created a
huge swamp of corruption unprecedented
in the government what did he just do he
purged all the inspector generals
through them alone and like any petty
dictator he went out of his way to
insult the senior Republican senator who
was in who had set them up Charles
Grassley 89 year old senator highly
respected in the Republican Party
trumped purposely insulted him said get
lost I'm throwing out your life's work
well the inspector generals not one
Republican raised a peep about it they
are totally totally cowardly group of
gangsters who are in his pocket afraid
to do anything the executive branch
he has eliminated everyone in the
executive branch who right might raise a
voice there is no one there but
sycophant
it's not fascism it's a petty dictator
in a small third-world than X colony
that's what he's turning the United
States in professor Chomsky what is
happening to American democracy then
he's turning it into a
pillbot dictatorship can American
democracy withstand Donald Trump is it
going to mean that if Trump wins in this
election are we then to assume that that
is the end of American democracy as we
know it we'll say there's a sharp
conflict I'm sure you've seen that the
top military command military command
there are conservatives there right wing
a lot of from the deep south the top
military command the last the two former
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
the four-star general who was Trump's
defense secretary who he kicked out of
the the the general general Allen who
was in charge of forces in Central and
South Asia Afghanistan and running all
the forces top general just came in on
all of them came out attacking the
president denouncing him some of them
supporting the protesters the Pentagon
Trump had sent federal troops to
Washington the Pentagon overruled him
with through the troops without even
consulting it there's a real crisis
brewing we don't know where they'll go
there's been nothing like this in the
history of the United States or England
the two Mockridge just moving away
slightly from America to the global
stage president Trump has alienated even
is European allies by is unilateralism
in trade and in politics and for example
in the g7 meeting that is supposed to be
held at least in the near future
the German Chancellor's refuse to attend
and he's gone and started to invite
Russia to it as a guest although Russia
is not a member of the g7 so now I mean
given this situation China and Russia
are getting together to combat American
hegemony interesting play over there the
Europeans are keen to work with the
Chinese isn't Trump going to end up
isolating America and in that sense is
that going to signal the decline of
American hegemony there's a lot of talk
about that and there has been for twenty
or thirty years it's a mistake American
hegemony is overwhelming you see it in
its true the Trump is isolating the
United States that means that people in
Europe dislike hate fear the United
States but the crucial word is fear
Europe is afraid to step on Trump's toes
if he issues an edict Europe follows it
when we see this all over taking Renn
now there was a negotiations which led
to a very successful agreement to
eliminate any possible threat if there
is a threat I don't think there is one
but if there if you think there's a
threat of nuclear weapons from the run
and it was eliminated by the treaty
Trump is a wrecker he's someone who
wants has no idea how to build anything
he wants to be important so therefore
you wreck things if you have no ideas
about what to do and you won't change
your Rick okay so he therefore
dismantled the entire Iran treaty and
imposed very harsh sanctions on Iran
when the United States imposes sanctions
everyone has to obey they are third
party sanctions No
and Europe doesn't listen like them it
opposes the Iran sanctions it opposes
the breaking down of the deal did it do
anything no it observes the sanctions if
it doesn't observe the sanctions it gets
thrown out of the international
financial system which is controlled
from New York
of course Europe could go in an
independent direction but they're afraid
to do it they don't want to stand up
against the Godfather now that's
happening all over the world take Israel
Palestine Trump came out with what he
calls the deal of the century in
Palestine if any other country had done
that China or Germany that people would
have left that wouldn't have even paid
attention when Trump comes out with it
it's the law that's what we were if if
what we can do with it this is enormous
power the United States military power
at a totally overwhelms everything in
the world and it's far more
sophisticated and Trump is expanding it
enormous Lee risking war because he
doesn't care about war if there's a
nuclear war that destroys everything
have no concern to him he's a sociopath
concerned with his short-term gain but
that means the United States is a very
frightening country and just in terms of
control of wills but people analysts
point out that the US share of gross
domestic product GDP is declining but
what they don't look at is something
more important what share of global
wealth is in the hands of us-based
corporations
turns out 50% there's a very good
political economist in Hong Kong
Sean stars from Genji stars than the
main work on this
half the wealth of the world is in the
hands of us-based multinationals way
ahead of China way ahead of Europe
almost every sector US corporations are
in the lead so as long as the wealth is
there the military power is there a
maniac like Trump can do pretty much
what he wants
as long as the American people allow him
so the question is I remember we're
talking about democracies that have been
around for 350 years in the case of
Britain 250 years in the case of the
United States they are facing a crisis
that has never arisen in these hundreds
of years there's something like it in
Britain too with Boris Johnson not quite
as bad these are globally these are
enormous ly serious matters now let's
talk a little bit about alienating
Europe in the chaos of the trunk White
House you can perceive a geostrategic
clan it's there and it's being
implemented the idea is to construct a
reactionary international of the
harshest most brutal states in the world
controlled by the white house in the
Middle East that means the Gulf
dictatorships the family dictatorship to
the Gulf Egypt under the LCC
dictatorship the horriston Egypt history
Israel moving very far to the right now
the central part of this reactionary
system go over to India Modi's India is
a perfect candidate don't have to
describe what's happening so he'll be
part of it now move on to Europe Hungary
under Orban who's turning it into a
private dictatorship that people like
Mario salvini in Italy
very powerful loves to see people
Africans dying in the Mediterranean
fleeing from countries that have been
devastated by Europe for centuries as a
collection of such people in such
government's he's forging them together
into a reactionary international the
progressive international that you
brought up properly is a counter to this
and the question is which will prevail
on the global scene so a lot of things
are happening that are very important
the most important we should never
forget is the roasting of the earth that
is going to destroy us especially South
Asia which is the prime target the main
target South Asia is going to disappear
unless this is terminated and quickly
the second most important thing is
nuclear war trump has torn apart
destroyed the entire arms control regime
which provided some degree of protection
he's virtually pleading with Russia to
develop new weapons of mass destruction
that can destroy everything he's doing
it himself and doing it very
ostentatiously so that others will
imitate it if this can't if these things
continue nothing else matters nothing
and there's time to stop them
not a lot she coming to the close of
this interview two questions the first
is of course you pose the problem in
this in this manner that it's autocratic
regimes and neoliberal markets versus
voices for national reconstruction of
society that's how you pose the future
to access that we have but you also then
say somewhere I think I've read that you
say that the general population doesn't
know what's happening and it doesn't
know that it doesn't know well part of
the population yes 40 and it's I mean if
there were time there interesting
demographic
facts behind this I really don't have
time to go into them but if you look at
the United States up until the Second
World War the United States was not was
the richest country in the world by far
but it was intellectually kind of a
backwater there were exceptions but if
you wanted to study physics he went to
Germany he wanted to be a writer you
went to Paris no the into the cultural
centers of the world were Europe the
United States was kind of a backwater
there were exceptions but that's pretty
much what it was well the war changed
all of it everything moved to the United
States but only in part part of the
United States became part of the unlike
the world of the Enlightenment part of
it stayed where it was a rural Christian
evangelical traditional America stayed
where it was okay that's the base of the
Republican Party along with the affluent
the affluent are always part of the
Republican Party it works for them but
there's a voting base remember that 25%
of the American population is
evangelical Christian people who think
that Christ is coming very soon in their
lifetime a trumpet
he's a very good politician he keeps
throwing them gifts so the dull support
him totally the rural you take a look at
the pandemic it's the first the pandemic
hit most most harshly in heavily settled
areas urban areas in the you go to the
rural areas where people are more
scattered it didn't hit quite that hard
at first it's now spreading now but not
before so you take a farmer in Wyoming
he looks around and he doesn't see any
sick people
says it's something in an urban area
where they have all these blacks and
Hispanics these disease people so all
support Trump and Trump is playing with
it he's a skilled politician he's a
skilled demagogue sociopath but a
demagogue and he's using he's trying to
create a kind of race and culture war in
which he'll be able to maintain the
reactionary voting base while serving
the rich and powerful and destroying
everything in his path will it succeed
we don't know I talked about as I said
even the highest military officials are
deeply concerned about this will much of
the rest of the population is can they
get together to stop it
we don't know remember this is without
precedent in 350 years of Western
democracy 350 years in Britain 250 years
in the United States never happened
before so will it and of course it's
happening at a time of huge crisis for
the entire human species the global
warming's want to attack everybody
nuclear war will destroy everybody we're
living in a extraordinary moment of
human history the crisis of a kind that
have never arisen in entire human
history threats to democracy which
haven't prison in hundreds of years all
coming together at the same time that we
have an unprecedented the pandemic
raging very difficult moments we have to
be clear-headed rational think carefully
ask what can be done to deal with them
there's no time to waste and I'm very
sorry but I have another interview
coming I have one last comment required
for me we know that the u.s. is in
trouble in deep trouble and you say it
so is the rest of world
the US is in deep trouble but then asked
to explain now where do we go from here
and you quoted to have said and I'd like
you to just explain what you mean you're
quoted you have said it depends on the
peasants with the pitchforks that's
right what do you mean by that
that's a an image that's constantly used
to mean that the people are rising up
and won't accept oppression any further
that's the peasants with the pitchforks
the corporate sector is afraid of it if
you look at the the last conference in
Davos you know where the every January
the rich and powerful get together at a
fancy ski resort in Switzerland and they
congratulate each other and how
wonderful they are and go skiing and
have parties and so on this year was
different you go back to the Davos
conference they were there but they were
worried they were concerned that the
peasants are coming with their
pitchforks one of the main theme of the
conference was statements when we said
yes we've made a lot of mistakes we've
harmed you we've done the wrong things
but now we understand we're gonna be
much better we're not gonna make those
mistakes we're gonna work for you you
can put your trust in us so go back home
and be quiet because we've got things
under control they're afraid of what is
called reputational risks that means the
peasants with their fynch Forks and if
the peasants with their pitchforks keep
coming you can change in the world
excellent that's a very hopeful note
professor thank you very much
I've enjoyed this enormous Lee I hope
all other all the other people who've
tuned in every also enjoyed it it's been
a long time and I would have invited you
to come to Pakistan again if your health
permits it would be an honor to host you
again professor and once again thank you
very much for taking this time out I
think you enjoyed it very much thank you
I hope and I've tried to ask all the
questions that I thought were relevant
obviously in 45 minutes or an hour you
can't really ask every question there
were some questions that were still
pending but he had to go and we don't
really want to edit this interview in
any way so there it is and until the
next thing first session good back
you
