thank you for the warm welcome I'd like
to talk about very serious problems that
we're facing right here at home but for
a little perspective I would like to
start with some very important events
that are taking place right now far away
in an area of the world where the United
States has been intensely involved for a
long time and surely will continue to be
right at this moment there are massive
demonstrations taking place in Egypt
mostly young people many thousands of
people in the streets nuh facing police
brutality protesting the terror and
venality of the dictatorship which the
US strongly supports this is the first
of the anticipated spill overs from
what's been going on in Tunisia in the
past days a very impressive democratic
movement in Apple II i'm quoting in a
police state with little freedom of
expression or association and serious
human rights problems ruled by a
dictator whose family is hated by the
population for the corruption and the
brutality of the family regime well as
perhaps you know I'm quoting the US
ambassador in a secret cable that was
released by WikiLeaks shortly after the
cable arrived in Washington the
government provided substantial military
aid to the Tunisian dictatorship that
the Ambassador described that was to
Nazir was one of five
foreign beneficiaries of that grant of
aid Israel routinely and two other
Middle Eastern dictatorships along with
Tunisia Egypt and Jordan and the fifth
was columbia the country that has long
held the prize for the worst human
rights record in the hemisphere and has
been the leading recipient of US
military aid throughout this whole
period in the hemisphere a correlation
that's generalizes unfortunately well
there's a guiding principle in this and
many other cases it was articulated
clearly a couple of days ago by Marwan
washer he's a Carnegie Endowment Middle
East specialist former high official of
their Jordanian government he's reacting
to what was happening to dision he says
the traditional argument put forward in
and out of the Arab world is that
there's nothing wrong everything is
under control he's quite correct and the
argument generalizes far beyond the Arab
world it generalizes to the domestic
scene in the United States as well right
now in fact if the population is
sufficiently passive and obedient
everything's fine doesn't matter what
else is happening the guiding principle
is that the powerful should try to gain
their ends by any feasible means
sporting harsh dictatorships in the
current Middle East case and that's fine
one can ignore the popular will as long
as the populations kept under control
and the patterns quite general and very
significant for us in a number of ways
1 i've mentioned namely the guiding
principle applies right here to us so
obviously significant for us and it has
indeed throughout American history I'll
return to that another reason is that
this guiding principle this contempt for
the population as long as there are
under control and the reliance on
dictatorships is a very direct and
serious security threat to us it's a
root cause of the terror that Washington
is theoretically seeking to combat but
in reality is consistently stimulating
by pursuing this guiding principle
incidentally that's also at the root of
the huge military budget of the u.s.
about the same as the rest of the world
combined strangling the economy half of
the famous deficit the other half of the
famous deficit which mr. Obama will be
talking about in the State of the Union
message and I'm sure won't mention the
other half of the deficit is the totally
dysfunctional privatized health care
system about twice the per capita costs
of any other of comparable countries
some of the worst outcomes if we had a
health system of the kind that
comparable countries have there would be
no deficit and probably there would
indeed be a surplus well going back to
the root cause of terror you'll recall
I'm sure after nine eleven the President
Bush declared that they committed the
terrorist crimes because they hate our
freedoms
shortly after that a major Pentagon
study group the defense Science Board
avout reacted to President Bush's
comment in a report like others who know
anything about the history and the
current circumstances of the region they
concluded i'm quoting them that Muslims
do not hate our freedom quoting Bush but
rather they hate our policies when
American public diplomacy talks about
bringing democracy to Islamic societies
this is seen as no more than
self-serving hypocrisy these views
incidentally are quite conventional
among specialists at least who also
understand that these US policies are a
gift to the extremists among the jihadis
general consensus on this is formulated
clearly by David gardeners Middle East
correspondent of the world's leading
business daily the Financial Times many
years of experience in the region books
and so on he says so long as the jihadis
can rely on the United States to stand
by its Arab allies such as the house of
soda and President Mubarak of Egypt then
the bin Laden franchise franchises
monstrous bet that it can foment a class
of civilizations may be evil but is not
wholly mad if we continue to connive in
the survival of tyranny we bet the
onward march of the jihadis for whom
Western policy is their most
consistently reliable ally that same
observation was made by the michael
Scheuer who for many years was in charge
of tracking bin Laden for these
I a that he concludes that the United
States of America remains bin Laden's
only indispensable ally and that remains
true Obama is a very strong supporter of
the houses so then the Egyptian dictator
who's now under siege in Cairo and
Alexandria the insights are by no means
new this is all old hat in 1958
President Eisenhower in internal
discussion since Declassified he
consulted with his staff on what he
called the campaign of hatred against us
in the Arab world and not among the
government's who are mostly supportive
but among the people that was pretty
striking in 1958 because just shortly
before Eisenhower had intervened to
force Israel France and England out of
the third out of the Sinai which they
had conquered back to the aggression but
instead of gratitude there was a
campaign of hatred about the same time
the National Security Council Planning
body released a report in which they
explained the campaign of hatred they
said the report says that there's a
perception in the Arab world that the
United States supports harsh and brutal
dictatorships and blocks democracy and
development because we want to make sure
we control the their energy resources
and it went on to say that the
perception is pretty accurate and
furthermore that's what we should be
doing the following the guiding
principle that as long as the
populations controlled by the dictators
everything's fine the
right after 911 at the Wall Street
Journal to its credit did a poll among
wealthy Muslims kind of people that
cares about that people know directors
of multinational corporations wealthy
professionals people deeply embedded in
the us-run system in the region they
wanted to know what they thought about
the 911 attack reactions were pretty
much what the National Security Council
described in 1958 they said that there's
anger in the region about us support for
the dictators for us blocking democracy
and development and by 2001 there were
more specific complaints one of them was
about the murderous sanctions on Iraq
which murdered literally hundreds of
thousands of people strengthened Saddam
Hussein and forced the population to
rely on him for survival probably saved
him from the fate of other dictators we
support that didn't get much of a triple
here but in the region people notice
when hundreds of thousands of people are
slaughtered by brutal and harsh sanction
regime us of course that and the other
thing by then not in 1958 was a u.s.
support for Israeli occupation and
terror and violence well that's after
nine eleven among wealthy Arabs you can
imagine what the reaction would have
been if they've done a broader pull the
same was true of the Iraq war the Iraq
were you should remember was undertaken
with the expectation that it was going
to increase terror that's the
expectation from intelligence agencies
including the CIA and more material has
come out recently from the Chilcot
hearings in England England's actually
carrying out
investigation of the build-up to the war
which were not and the counterpart to
the CIA the released information that
the British government was aware and the
CIA was aware that the attack was likely
to increase terror French intelligence
others said the same thing as did many
specialists and it happened in fact more
than was expected terror the year after
the invasion of Iraq went up by a factor
of seven using US government statistics
that's quite a sharp rise even more than
was anticipated actually is a dramatic
illustration of that that's taking place
right now of the doctrine that wash our
doctrine that as long as the populations
under control everything that's fine
yeah I'm sure he's been reading about
WikiLeaks the big exciting revelation
the one that got all the headlines was
that the Arabs support our policy
towards Iran well maybe true or not but
notice what they were referring to they
were referring to the Arab dictators the
Arab dictators they claimed support our
policy and that's the way the press
covered it and that's the way commentary
was a lot of self adulation about the
fact that we're supported by the Arabs
well as it happens just a couple of
weeks before that the Brookings
Institute major institution in
washington had released the poll taken
by leading us polling agency which has
been conducting polls in the arab world
for many years
