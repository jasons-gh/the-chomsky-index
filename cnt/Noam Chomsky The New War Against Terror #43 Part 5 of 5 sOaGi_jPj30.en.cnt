I'd now like to introduce the
co-producers of the CD where it's been
listening to 175 progress drive and they
also produced hard-knock radio on KPFA
which is the Pacific Air Station at
Berkeley Anita Johnson who three words

and mine and weight and sevens got
insula flow and beauty come on up
[Applause]
so finita like to thank everybody for
coming out tonight
this project has been quite an
experience I I know that uh folks are
getting a little bit antsy and I know
Elliot's got some things to say so I
know we want to keep it a little bit
short but the commentaries of Mumia that
are on the CD were gathered from a lot
of his friends and family who kept his
tapes in the in the first weeks of his
incarceration and nobody quite knew what
he was good what was going to happen and
it took a lot to get a lot of those
tapes into his studio and there are some
priceless things on the CD Mumia
interviewing Bob Marley Mamiya
interviewing Hugh Masekela Mumia on NPR
reporting on Jimmy Carter's campaign
when NPR and all things considered all
things considered on deny that he was
even a part of what they were doing and
for me one of the most magical things on
the album is on a full-throated laughs
from Lumia it was when I heard him
laughing it made when we had a human for
me I mean I've heard about Mamiya being
you know a black panther I've heard
about mommy as being a journalist and in
that moment of hearing him laugh out
loud like that it really brought home to
me that he's a human being he's a man
he's a husband he's a son he's the
father and I think that it I was you
know in for you to to get a hold of the
CD for that regional public feeds go to
to help them out and that's really all I
wanted to say obviously he's wailing and
I'm gonna need it right I said
everything well and I said in the
introduction I heard a lot about you
know people not knowing about Mumia the
problem is not if you don't know about
them but you refused to know okay and
that's where the problem starts and
especially right now in the time of
diversion with all the chaos and
everything that's happening right here
in the United States of America we must
keep focus we must be focused and
understand that the cause can't be
forgotten people like me Abu Jamal even
systems like Assata Shakur exiled in
Cuba we must keep focused and steadfast
and that's when you know my whole thing
is not I don't speak I do a little bit
of poetry but my main mine thought is
activism like this and it's trying to
get a message out and it's really
important just to pick it up and just
learn where you possibly be where you
can and coming together like this and
playing salsa you know and I you know
Stephanie it's really important to
forget and connect with the right people
you know what you know also share with
those that don't know you don't look
down on them just take the time just you
know break it down as simple very simple
and I'm free me
[Applause]
thank you so much I need I'm waiting
designed all the way down it's really
special that you could be here with us
tonight

debris has benefited area
ladies and gentlemen I did you Elliot
Grossman well I have a question for
everybody here and a question I'd like
to ask judge yon the federal judge who
is hearing mamiya's case and that I'd
like to ask judge Danby who's the state
of Pennsylvania judge he was also
hearing the case in the state court and
I like to ask the governor of
Pennsylvania the new governor since the
old governor has now taken over the
office of homeland terrorism and the
question is why is the Mumia abu-jamal
still in prison on death row
why is Mumia jamal still not free the
man who did it has confessed the man who
did it has said the Mamiya had nothing
to do with this but Mamiya remains in
prison we have filed this confession
when we first came into the case and i
should say i am one of a team of four
attorneys who have taken over the
representation of Mumia abu-jamal
as of may the 4th of this year the other
attorneys are marlene Camus from Chicago
and Nick Brown is a British barrister in
London and J Michael Farrell who is a
local Philadelphia attorney when we took
over this case because Mamiya fired his
previous attorneys because little by
little it began to come together that
his previous attorneys had sold him down
the river which I will talk about in a
little while he fired them and he hired
us to take over his case when we came
into the case I made of fourth we filed
the written confession signed by Arnold
Beverly back in June of 1999 and we also
filed the lie detector test that Arnold
everly took and passed showing that he
was telling the truth and we filed also
for the first time
you see in the original trial since
Mamiya was denied the right to represent
himself and the trial just turned into a
farce and the judge threw a mound of
half of his trial for trying to insist
on his right to defend himself
Mamiya never had the chance to testify
when they finally said okay now you can
testify he declined to do so because the
entire trial was a farce the previous
attorneys representing Mamiya Leonard
wineglass and Daniel Williams told
Mamiya not to testify in 1995 during the
state post-conviction proceedings even
though he was ready and willing to
testify mamiya's brother William cook
who was there at the scene when it all
came down and the whole incident started
when the police officer stopped the car
being driven by William cook was ready
to testify in 1995 to say what actually
happened and to testify that Mamiya was
not involved in any way in the shooting
of the police officer but mamiya's
previous attorneys told him not to
testify and he didn't testify so when we
came into the case we also filed for the
first time mamiya's own account his
written statement under penalty of
perjury his testimony as to what
happened that night and his brother
William cook testimony in two
declarations one that William cook
excitons back in June of 1999 the same
time that Arnold Beverly signed his
confession and another more detailed
declaration by William cook that we had
obtained and basically Arnold Everly's
explained that he was hired by the
Philadelphia Police Department itself
which is to say corrupt elements in the
Philadelphia Police Department working
with organized crime
because on Beverly as a professional
killer he's a hit man that's how that's
his occupation and he and accomplice
were hired to kill Faulkner because the
police in Philadelphia in that time
period had a racket going where they
were basically selling protections to
all the people involved in illegal
activity and
City Philadelphia and getting their cut
the same time this was going on there
were three independent FBI
investigations of corruption in the
Philadelphia Police Department which
eventually resulted in 30 police
officers including the assistant Chief
of Police being indicted and convicted
including the police captain who oversaw
the entire Central City area where the
murder of Faulkner took place and the
head of homicide for the Philadelphia
Police Department was an unindicted
co-conspirator in in those prosecutions
now what really happened that night
and what Mamiya would have testified to
is if he'd ever had the opportunity to
which he's finally been given the
opportunity to was that Mamiya was in
his cab he was parked on 13th Street
north of Locust Street in front of an
after-hours Club at four o'clock in the
morning because when the clubs get out
so he was waiting to pick up passengers
but this is the spot where people were
coming out of the bars and there are a
lot of potential clients there to pick
up if you are a cab driver he heard
gunfire he got out of his cab to see
what was going on and what he saw was he
saw his brother standing down on Locust
Street looking dazed and he ran toward
his brother and the next thing he knew
he got shot and he went down and the
next thing he knew after that he woke up
and there a whole crowd of policemen
around him kicking the shit out of him
and that is what happened now we know
from Arnold Beverly side of the story
what actually was going on there now the
present situation in the man's case is
we now have clear and convincing
evidence that he did not do it and his
innocent the district attorney's office
takes the position that guess what it's
too late according to them there are
legal technicalities that say there's a
deadline to prove that you're innocent
and Mumia is too late according to them
and therefore they don't care that he's
innocent and they've told the federal
judge and they've told the state judge
that they shouldn't care either and they
should just execute him regardless
because he's too late
now does this make any sense whatsoever
obviously no it doesn't is this the law
we don't think it is but if it is the
law then any legal system that holds
that as a basic principle obviously
deserves no respect and should clearly
be overthrown and destroyed and replaced
with the just legal Scripture now we
have just filed another declaration
under penalty of perjury in both the
federal and the state court from a court
reporter named Terry Maher a Carter when
we were in Philadelphia on August the
17th which was our first appearance in
the state court
we received a telephone call from this
woman saying she wanted to do whatever
she could to help
Mumia and she wanted to talk to us but
she had important information that we
had to hear and Marlene came ish and I
made arrangements to speak with her and
she came forward and she told us that
during the time of mamiya's original
trial back in 1982 she was working in
the courthouse as a court reporter and
she happened to be going through the
antechambers of the court was kind of a
little office there and she overheard a
conversation between judge sable who is
the judge of mamiya's trial and was the
judge in 1995 when they had the
post-conviction hearing now we always
knew the judge table was a racist dog
and we always knew that there is no way
that anyone who was black or Mexican or
any other minority could possibly get a
fair trial in front of Judge table and
we always knew the Mamiya did not get a
fair
in front of judge disabled but we didn't
have direct evidence to prove that he
was the racist dog that we know that he
is but what Terry Mayer Carter came
forward and told us was that when she
was in the antique chambers of the court
she overheard judge Sabo speaking to
someone else during like a break in the
trial and overheard him say the
following I'm going to apologize to you
for having to use the word that I
removed from my vocabulary when I came
to consciousness about what it means to
be wife and live in racist white America
but after you use that word in order to
convey to you the full form of what went
on in the court in Pennsylvania at that
time but what she overheard judge Sabo
say in reference to Mumia abu-jamal was
the following yeah and I'm going to help
them fry the nigger that is what judge
Sabo said this is a man who supposedly
was administering justice to Mumia
abu-jamal
during his trial this is a man who
supposedly was evaluating in 1995
whether Mumia abu-jamal
constitutional rights have been violated
this exposes even more than anything
that had previously been put forward
what it is to receive a quote fair trial
if you are black and racist why it's
America the case of Mumia abu-jamal
is the case which should
if everyone here and everyone around the
country and the world is concerned with
the case will come forward and do
everything that we can do to get the
word out as to what's actually happening
here and what a horror this case is this
is the case that should destroy the
death penalty in the United States
because this case strips bear every
single illusion in this critical system
and fully exposes what a mockery of
justice it is now what's happened to
Mamiya is there is not a single
constitutional right that anyone is
supposed to have that has not been
totally destroyed eviscerated spat upon
and shadow pawns in the case of them the
evolution model first of all the man is
innocent he didn't do it we got the
proof of that now when he went to trial
it became very clear to him early on
that his court-appointed attorney
Anthony Jackson did not have the
backbone to stand up to the powers that
be in Philadelphia and give him the
defense that he needed to win the case
so Mamiya decided that the only thing he
could do was to take over his
representation himself and be his own
lawyer represent himself and in the
early pre-trial stages of the trial he
was allowed to do that which is a
constitutional right and he was involved
in the jury selection phase and at the
beginning of the trial you get to
cross-examine basically each of the
potential jurors to find out whether
they could be a fair juror or not and
you get to excuse a certain number of
them and since of a meal with a
professional journalist and one of his
greatest skills is interviewing people
he was doing a great job during the jury
selection and the prosecution had to get
rid of a number of potential jurors as
they said they liked them you know so
much they could see any possible way
that they could vote for his execution
or convicted so the judge judge Sabo
decided and the prosecutor decided
they'd better get Mamiya out of this
role of representing himself because it
looked
maybe they were going to lose this case
so the judge decided mommy was taking
too long some of the jurors were afraid
of Mamiya supposedly which is alive and
took the jury selection out of his hands
wouldn't let him do it anymore
had his court-appointed attorney do you
know the incompetent job that continues
when the trial was about to begin
Mia asked for a microphone which is a
very soft-spoken man he wanted the jury
to be able to hear him judge Sabo
refused to give him the microphone and
at that point
Mumia insisted on a point that he's been
asking for over and over again which was
he wanted a friend of his a very close
personal friend of his John Africa who
is not an attorney to be able to sit
with him in court at the counsel table
and advise him and help him when he was
defending himself and let me explain to
me one of the first times I went to
prison to to talk with him about his
case why he wanted John Africa John
Africa was the founder and the leader of
the move organization in Philadelphia
and the reason Mamiya wanted him wasn't
because of the philosophy of John Africa
or the politics of John Africa or the
politics of the move organization it was
because when Mamiya was a journalist in
Philadelphia he actually covered the
trial when the government put John
Africa on trial with other people from
the move organization and it framed them
up on all these terrorism and weapons
charges and they were facing like 300
years in prison John Africa refused to
have an attorney some of the other
people had attorneys and he took over
the defense and John and Rico was this
incredible charismatic charismatic man
he would go into court every day they
brought him down from New York because
they were afraid to have him in
Philadelphia and they'd have him in
shackles the whole way they'd bring him
in he was on a hunger staff for about a
month but he didn't like being shackled
and they wanted to force-feed and so he
would do 300 push-ups in the courtroom
at the beginning of the court session to
show the judge he didn't have to be
fourth bed and before the trial would
begin each morning go over the process
puts hands on his shoulders and go
you're going to lose you're going to
lose then when the trial would begin and
the witnesses will be testifying John
Africa would kick back in his seat and
he to sleep through the trial but he was
listening the whole time and during the
break there was another person in the
move organization with him who could not
read or write but who had a photographic
memory and John Africa would tell him
what questions to ask to the witnesses
and he would memorize the question and
without notes he would cross examine all
the witnesses then the other thing that
happened during the trial was that John
Africa insisted that there would be no
objection at all that the prosecution
could put in all the evidence they
wanted he wanted everybody to hear
everything and they had these videos
these had these tapes because they were
surveilling the move out and they had
tapes that they wanted to play if things
that people said John advocate said it's
fine but you got to play all the tapes
so they had to play an entire week of 24
hours a day listening people and move
house getting up in the morning going to
PAP bathroom going peepee you know
washing the dishes walking the dogs
cleaning the house and etcetera then
when it came time to give the final
speeches to the jury John Africa woke up
gave this incredible speech to the jury
it was so silent in the quarter you
could hear a pin drop he didn't talk
about the evidence against them at all
what he talked about was how the
prosecution symbolized the forces of
death and destruction that were
destroying our society and destroying
the lives of the people on the jury and
destroying the environment and you had a
jury of white middle class suburban
jurors who's like your perfect hanging
jury and no one could believe that John
Africa was doing this and Mamiya himself
thought this is incredible but they're
going to get convicted they're going to
go away for 300 years
and when the jury came back the verdict
was not guilty on all counts
so mamiya's said I want John Africa
to help me but if I have John Africa I
like to win this trial and the judge
himself during a meeting and chambers
between the judge and the
court-appointed attorney Anthony Jackson
and the prosecutor the judge said you
know if I gave him John Africa
I know there'd be cross-examination and
they talked about all the problems it
could happen so in any case the end
result was that Mamiya was railroaded
his trial he got convicted he got the
death sentence they used against them in
his trial political speeches he had made
when he was 14 years old in the Black
Panther Party in Philadelphia they used
that as a reason to tell the jury that
they should execute him in 1995 there
was a post-conviction proceeding and I
don't want to take the time to go
through the entire litany but let me
just give you one little piece we've got
one piece of the puzzle with Arnold
Beverly there's another piece of the
puzzle with somebody named Kenny Freeman
Kenny Freeman was also involved in the
killing of officer Faulkner Kenny
Freeman's involvement was hidden by the
prosecution in the original trial
mamiya's own attorney in the original
trial could have cross-examined and
brought it out and won the trial right
then and there just with Kenny Freeman
not even getting into the Arnold Beverly
part and didn't do it
the appeals lawyer who used to be the
boss for Anthony Jackson when he was
becoming an attorney never brought up
the fact that this hadn't happened
and Leonard wineglass and Daniel
Williams the previous attorneys from
Emil who we replaced also suppress this
evidence so who is Kenny Freeman well
let me explain it this way the key
witness against Mamiya at his trial was
a prostitute named Cynthia white cynthia
white testified according to her that
she actually saw amia shoot Faulkner to
death now Cynthia white had testified
several weeks before at the trial of
mamiya's brother William cook they put
him up on trial of minor misdemeanor
charges of
using an officer because see what had
happened was that officer Faulkner
stopped the car that Billy Cook was
driving and at some point during this
you know incident Faulkner was shot Mamu
was shot and then Mamiya was prosecuted
for the killing of Faulkner and Billy
cooks trial
Cynthia white testified there was a
passenger in Billy cooks car and the
passenger got out of the car now this is
very significant because in mamiya's
trial she never said anything about a
passenger and the same prosecutor who
prosecuted Billy cooked prosecuted with
me and specifically asked her no one
else was there besides Mumia and his
brother fielding an officer Fokker isn't
that right and she goes that's right and
that was a lie the prosecutor had her
lie but the prosecutors whole theory
against Mamiya at his trial was that
only three people were there when it
happened Faulkner Billy cook and Mamiya
Billy had nothing to do with it
the only person who could possibly have
killed Faulkner was Lamia but all that
they had to prove to throw out that
theory and win the trial in the original
trial was that there was someone else
there who could have done the killing
that someone else was a passenger and
Billy cooks a car and that's someone
else's name kenny freeman and
approximately June of 99 or May of 99
the same time Arnold Beverly signed his
confession really cook sign a written
statement saying that Freeman had
confessed to him after the incident that
he was involved in the shooting that
there was a plot to kill Faulkner that
night that Freeman had a gun and
participated in the shooting
now Freeman curiously enough was found
dead the day after the Philadelphia
police bombed the move house he was
handcuffed he was stark naked found in a
vacant lot shot up with drugs at a
parent suicide
all that mamiya's attorney had to do in
the original trial was to prove up
kenneth freeman being there just get up
there in front of Cynthia white and say
now isn't it true that you testify in a
billy cooks trial that there was a
passenger yes no she says no let me read
your testimony to the jury from the
previous trial the passenger got out
having done bad all that he had to do
then was put on Billy Cook and ask him
well who is the passenger in your car
kenny Freeman
but Kenny Freeman on the witness stand
isn't it true that you shot officer
Faulkner yes no I refuse to answer this
amendment whatever it is not guilty but
that wasn't done and it's very clear
that there's something very wrong that's
been going on in the case of Lamia from
the very beginning that they're very
powerful and very ruthless people behind
the murders of police officer Faulkner
and whoever it is who's obviously still
around someplace
responsible for that killing wanted to
make sure that there was a fall guy for
it and the trail would never lead back
to them later wine glass the previous
attorney from amia received a death
threat from Kenny Freeman's brother who
told him this anything comes out about
Kenny in this case you are dead meat and
nothing about Kenny ever came out and
when I was Beverly came forward in June
of 99 and signed his confession they
just stuck it in their pockets and they
never brought it forward now that we
have found this evidence and we put it
forward to the court they're using
against us the prosecution and the
judges the a EPA the anti-terrorism and
effective death penalty Act that was
passed by Congress when Clinton was
president
now which cleanse a Democrat signed into
law now that law should be called the
state terrorism and defective death
penalty Act because that's what it is so
the other question is why is this going
because the ruling class in this country
needs to have a death penalty to use as
a weapon of terror against the working
class in this country against the black
community against the Mexican community
against the Arab community certainly
against the immigrant communities and
against the left and any progressive
movement in this country we have a
history of murdering political
dissidents in this country the Sacco and
Vanzetti case Italian anarchists in the
1920s the Rosenberg case in the 1950s
the so-called Adam spies it was almost
the Angela Davis case in the 1960s when
they framed her up for being involved in
the incident at San Quentin when George
Jackson was killed and the San Quentin
six were put on trial and she was
fortunately because of the political
mobilization around her kids able to win
her case and be acquitted and that's
what we need around the case of Mamiya I
wish Ahmad was we need your support we
need political support because we
understand that in America though with a
Kay it's not sufficient to win the case
in the courtroom this case needs to be
won in the streets in the factories in
the workplaces with a mobilization of
the working class in this country now
the Longshoremen's Union has shown the
way last year there was a 24 hours
strike by longshoremen and warehouse men
up and down the entire west coast in
Canada demanding not higher wages not
shorter hours demanding a new trial from
amia abu-jamal
and that is what we need we need to
mobilize we need to get the word out and
we need to rouse the workers in this
country to use the power that they have
to make sure that Mumia is freeze thank
you
[Applause]
so if there's any questions anyone would
like to ask I'd be happy to answer them
or try to answer them what a nice
escalators when you fall away ok what
the situation is is this basically when
we came into the case the case was in
federal court in the United States
District Court in Philadelphia which is
the trial court on a petition for habeas
corpus which is basically saying that
mamiya's constitutional rights were
violated and his conviction should be
thrown out we came into court we filed
all this evidence which we talked about
and then we realized that because of the
AEDPA we needed to take the new evidence
down into state court and give a state
court a chance to look at it so we wrote
a 275 page document we filed it in state
court put all the evidence there and DA
is immediately said it's too late you
can hear it so we're in a battle in
state court now as to whether the judge
is even going to hear it at the same
time we're in a battle in federal court
having asked the judge for the chance to
take the deposition of Arnold Beverly
because before the Mafia and the
Philadelphia please kill him we want to
get his semen under oath with the
prosecutor they're being able to
cross-examine just like in court so the
evidence is established and they can't
refuse to acknowledge it so in a battle
over that and a battle to get a hearing
in either one of the courts we're not
waiting for everything we're doing
everything we can to put additional
evidence into the record and to focus
all the pressure we possibly can on the
courts to actually give us a hearing let
Arnold Beverly come into the courtroom
get on the witness stand testify under
oath as to what really happened the
district attorney can ask him any
question you want now let's get at the
truth of this matter and let's get
Mamiya out of there so what we need is
for people to spread the information
about what's really happening here to
break through the media blockade because
we're getting almost no coverage of this
on television or radio where you
coverage in Philadelphia in the
newspapers and on the radio there but
there's very little coverage of also
have a consciousness of feeling guilt
and the capacity to do good and for 20
years he's had to live with the fact
that not only did he stand over another
men looking straight in the eyes and
shoot him to death but another man is
going to die because of his ass and he's
decided to come forward and take
responsibility now the question that I
would ask is given an Arnold Beverly
regards to what he's done in the past is
willing to do this the brother is
willing to come forward and take
responsibility why aren't people asking
when Senator John Kerry's won't come for
and take responsibility for murdering
those 11 Vietnamese women and children
and old people that he committed when he
was a war criminal in Vietnam next
question

with anyone after the event and thank
you very much for coming and I want to
express our gratitude not only on the
part of the legal team but from a me
also for your support it really means a
lot to Mamiya isolated there at 175
progress drive on death row to know that
people like yourselves are here
supporting him and doing whatever you
can to get him out because we know if
any of us we're there Mamiya would be
out here doing the same thing thank you

to thank Frank Sosa for for offering at
the home for this very important event
for our brother Mamiya I hope you've

of artists are in the house so we want
to give them a big thing and we're going
to start off with a chat from our TV our
new studio data we're celebrating
tonight we're celebrating life and
freedom and all these wonderful things
and the new CD is called 175 progress
Drive and for me that just kind of like
captures the as the essence of like
Americanism because like see later this
is BA get as death row and high
maximum-security prison in the middle of
the suburbs right in the middle of like
white Ville and they they house all our
brown breath brothers and sisters there
and then they call the streets they
build it on progress dry
so anyway this was part of the course
she's going to open with a story of whom
on the average Amalia I'm the father
school the first time I heard he a
wonderful years later repair it was the
first time I fully understood one a man
faced government was silver tape and
putting him to death
Maria the only African political
prisoner on death row being an
inflammatory rhetoric what he said was
so clean so true and I had to stop
everything and concentrate on his
message
Lamia Avila journalist husband's father
he is brilliant
he has been worthy to say what needs to
be saved in a crib most vividly his
language distance and his intelligence
remind me of one name el-hajj Malik
today otherwise known as Mowgli Mumia
abu-jamal in the language to carry on
malkos traditions and the tradition of
so many of our freedom fighters who have
lived their lives for the field allow
people see as I celebrated Mowgli's
birthday
I couldn't stop thinking about me I
couldn't stop thinking about the moon
twisting over 15 years or nestled in the
main strong committee and beautiful
Lamia
political activist revolutionary and
human and follow faithfully in Malcolm's
footsteps we can feel malcolm energy
working through a mere we can feel
luminous energy carrying on Malcolm's
registry if nothing extra life today I
know he will be fighting
life is not or alive today I know he
will be fighting to free all political
prisoners in the name of Malcolm X I
make a special appeal to you systems and
learning to fight tooth and nail to save
or me right into shame from the grip of
inner presence as you earn our
forefathers and for money I urge you to
honor our living here when you honor the
names of nocturnal Harriet Tubman and
Malcolm X I urge you to under the name
of Geronimo be data so we have a quarry
Mutulu Shakur and Nia a group general I
do not to forget not to betray our
living here if we're all in trouble we
are ignoring our own if we betray our
little history and we are be training
ourselves we could not save luckily but
we can save Malia we can take in and we
must save him because we love ever and
we need our brother to help us fight for
freedom free Mumia abu-jamal
free all political prisons where Karen
on our tradition to fear
