thank you so much professor Chomsky for
giving me this opportunity to interview
you let me get to the point about the
issue we will discuss today which will
be very much related to what happened in
Thailand and the first issue I'd like to
rest for our conversation is instead of
the monarchy in Thai politics it is a
tradition of wisdom that the monarchy
has become a kind of anomaly right and
in for many people especially for a
while from where you come from in the
United State but I think this the
discourse of the monarchy becoming an
anomaly only valid is really valid to
attest to a certain extent in Southeast
Asia but because at least there's four
countries or six years to have different
kind of monarchy Thailand Cambodia Pune
and also Malaysia we come to also
understanding that the reason that
monarchy is in these four countries
still survived into the modern period
mainly because of these kind of
traditional political values and also
manipulation of the political elite
including the ability to resist
modernity now I would like to ask you
this question of how what is your
perception in regards to the position of
the monarchy today harmonica could fit
in with the modern world whether
monarchy can be compatible with
democracy well that is a problem that
has been faced by the developed
societies the Western societies for
several centuries and of course a formal
monarchy still remains in many Western
countries England Spain Sweden the
countries that have moved substantially
into the modern world and the monarchy
plays some role mostly ceremonial though
it's still that kind of act so for
example the in there there have been
times when in the Western countries the
king their queen actually
in recent years actually intervened in
the political system but it's unusual
the move that has been made over the
centuries is for the royalty to remain
as a kind of a symbol of tradition
connection to the past and so on but
with less and less of a active role in
the workings of the society not none you
can see it right now in England for
example where there's a very live issue
as to whether the it's being debated
right now in Parliament as to whether
the planned visit of President Trump
would be a insult to the Queen it's
considered significant in fact the major
newspapers in England actually have
correspondence called royal
correspondents who just deal with
affairs of the monarchy so now there's a
marriage coming up of a woman who's
partially black and that's raising young
changes in the British royal system all
of this is very much a live part of life
in England saimin Spain's and elsewhere
but the move and it came up in the
United States at the time of
Independence 1780s should the when the
Constitution was established should the
president have the characteristics of
royalty and in fact it was not a clear
decision if George Washington who was
elected president happened to be
extremely respected if he had called for
the attributes of royalty probably the
United States would have a semi monarch
achill system fortunately I think he was
a modest man and he didn't want any of
those appurtenances of royalty whereas
them all refused reelection and so on so
the country moved
to become a secular non-royal
democracy without not just the king but
no Earl's or Lords or any status symbols
of that kind which was unique at the
time and is still somewhat unusual but I
would hope that over time Thailand would
move in the same direction and the same
with the other Asian monarchies well you
use a number of terms here which I find
very interesting first he said more or
less modern monarchies still maintain
its ceremonial role secondly used to use
this additive of fortunately that United
State never turn out to be like
basically Great Britain now I would like
to take you back to Thailand this time
specifically I should comment that in
the United States although there is no
formal royalty the sentiment among
elements of the population somewhat
emulate royalty so for example Ronald
Reagan for example who was not
incidentally a particularly popular
president if you look at opinion polls
but after his death he was turned into a
kind of a demigod by an enormous
propaganda campaign the Reagan legacy
and you can read comments by respected
intellectuals so for example the URI
University Stanford the Hoover
Institution has published monographs in
which they described they they described
Reagan as a I think the phrase was a
warm and friendly ghost hovering over us
and protecting us now that's that's
attitudes towards royalty and so there's
something and in fact when you know
Princess Diana visited the United States
she was treated as a royal visitor you
know so the attitudes and the sentiments
are sometimes there
in dangerous ways even though the formal
structures are not there okay well I
respect that also a paperweight for a
good discussion for the next issue as I
said that it would be more specifically
about Thailand now King Bhumibol had
rain for seventy years everyone in the
region I think in in a larger will know
up his authority and also magical rain
and the king point but he passed away
last year in October and because the big
big because of his continued
intervention in Thai politics to the
point that the position of the time
monarchy the rocktron time monarchy
could also mean the stability of Thai
politics now that he has gone people in
Thailand begin to worry about the new
reign it's happened that his son is
lacking in moral authority and because
of that many people also argued that the
court 2014 in Thailand was staged
in order that the mid the military in
particular would be able to take control
to our succession because they fear
obtain new and popular King okay that is
one point second point is that is still
very much difficult in Thailand to
discuss policy discussion are key in
politic openly I'm sure that you come
across this the less much as still oh no
not many country in the world to have
this law and which protect any any
critical comment against the monarchy
and could put you in jail for up to
seventy seventy to eighty years
something like that so now this become
an obstacle to Thailand's democracy and
also human rights what would be your
message to the Thai public at large when
they look up to their monarchy and also
with this existent of obviously absurd
law still ongoing in Thailand well my
own feeling not just with regard to
Thailand but quite generally is that
generation of leaders is a dangerous and
threatening characteristic of a society
it's true if you venerate the monarch in
Thailand it's true if
at the Hoover Institution at Stanford
they describe Regan as a spirit hovering
over us like a warm and friendly ghost
those are very it's true if you say Heil
Hitler
any veneration of authority and
subordination to external Authority that
carries dangerous implications and I
think society should find ways to
extricate themselves from these
conditions of subordination and
domination and move in their own ways
each Society has its own way towards
establishing true equality and free
participation of citizens and affairs of
life and of state it's a long slow
process hasn't really been achieved
anywhere but they're part of the general
tendency of centuries of modern history
has been in that direction and in in
general it's a healthy direction in my
opinion and the there are periods of
regression but impediments should be
substantially overcome after the monarch
himself can play a role pretty much the
way George Washington just by refusing
by putting aside the aspects of the
office that require subordination and
veneration and the public can do it in
some ways Thailand of course has unique
problems it's not just the monarchy I
don't have to tell you a Thailand has
been subjected to military dictatorships
far back feeble and others the United
States regrettably has supported the
dictatorship strongly even supported the
Thai dictatorship that had aligned with
Japanese imperialists during the Second
World War during the Indochina Wars the
United States was strongly supporting
the dictatorships because of it wanted
type or
dissipation crucial type participation
in the Salton Indochina Air Bases troops
and so on that's and that's an ugly
record from I can't give advice to the
Thai they have to work this out for
themselves but from the point of view of
the US citizen I think the u.s. role has
been quite harmful to Thailand at the
potential tide democracy revival
as an advocate of a freedom of space
yourself what is your opinion on this
draconian law in Thailand call as
Majesta law is basically prevent you
from from criticizing the monarchy no
well the what's called sometimes
sovereign immunity you cannot condemn
the state with words it's a very
regressive doctrine should not exist but
we should bear in mind that eliminating
it is not easy even in the Western world
I think the United States the United
States is probably my opinion maybe
first in the world in protection of
freedom of speech but the Supreme Court
struck down this doctrine sovereign
immunity only in 1964
that's pretty reason it was in the
context of the civil rights movement the
racist sheriff in Alabama charged Martin
Luther King and the civil rights
movement with libel because they had
attacked the state with words and at
that point the Supreme Court struck down
the doctrine that's the United States
England still has similar doctrines
others do and they're rarely used but
the doctrine itself is surely
unacceptable nothing in the social or
political system or cultural system
should be beyond the possibility of
critical discussion but to overcome this
has been a long harsh hard struggle even
in the most in the countries where the
struggle is most advanced worth bearing
in mind so it's a long road to travel
but it's one that should be traveled
move dr. D to D co-op the ministry you
said before that Thailand has been under
mishiro for I mean everyone in them
since we abolish absent muna
19:32 right now talent is still under
mr. Kaufman since the coordinated school
was a 2014 and Helen still holds this
record in Southeast Asia or having the
most coup in the region up to this state
I lost cow we have 21 22 coos not
destined this is not something that I'm
proud of
looking around Indonesia has been has
been able to to withdraw military from
politics and has become more less
democratic in the past decade Korea also
is another good example of the military
you know preventing self from getting
involved too much in politics looking at
looking at Tyler and I'm a bit
pessimistic you have any idea aware of
how we move ahead what would be what
what we must do in order to ensure the D
politicization of the military or in
other words to ensure that the optometry
would not take its advantage you know
and and then interfere in politics well
I think the other countries that you
mentioned provide models of what has to
be done and in fact Thailand itself has
followed the same path occasionally then
there's been regression but so take
South Korea South Korea had quite a
brutal dictatorship the park
dictatorship there was a bitter
democracy struggle in the 1980s which
finally overthrew the dictatorship took
a lot of courage commitment and the as
always these successes are not a hundred
percent other forms of authority were
introduced which still have to be
overcome Indonesia the military
dictatorship
came into power 1965 with a horrendous
massacre hundreds of thousands of people
were slaughtered the New York Times that
described that is a staggering mass
slaughter then the Suharto government
had compiled one of the most vicious and
ugly human rights records in the world
invaded East Timor carried out one of
the one actions were closest to genocide
in the modern world
all of this incidentally with the strong
backing of the United States and its
allies who are guilty and responsible
for these crimes and atrocities and it's
not faced here which is a severe moral
crisis in the West still not faced but
finally Indonesia with a uprising
student a lot of student leads and
others did overthrow the dictatorship
and has begun a move towards the
confronting to a limited extent only
limited so far the crimes of the past
and moving towards the degree of
functioning democracy and if you look at
the other countries you see the same
thing popular struggles and organization
do sometimes successfully overthrow
harsh dictatorships go back to the
history of the West to find exactly the
same thing these are the lessons of
history
it's never easy but it's it can be done
with courage and dedication often
step-by-step sometimes
substantial changes
let's talk about your younger generation
position ski many people have hope for
our own new generation especially with
the coming of the social media that the
social media has become a new platform
for younger to express what they think
in in in a more free way since the state
can do little to prevent them from
saying something on social media but I
also noticed as well that maybe young
there's also a dark side of younger
generation to whether they whether if
you think that they're active but
whether they are Lily politically active
a lot of them come across as being too
conservative even though they are from
younger generation in Highland who you
know we have new people younger people
but but they seem to agree with what the
particularly say how can we explain this
phenomenon of younger generation but at
the same time they could be so
conservative and this was was also
linked to your support to our student
back in Thailand when he want to defy
tradition and look what happened to him
well these are again not unusual
phenomena if you look over the history
of uprisings that have led to
significant progressive social change
it's very often young people who were in
the forefront the often students part of
the reason for that is that students at
universities are at a period of their
lives when they are probably most free
they've left parental control they have
not yet entered into the burden of
maintaining a family of putting food on
the table and so on so they have that's
what the university should be a period
of exploration free inquiry
searching new ideas and so on and
sometimes that has led to political
activism which has had a significant
civilizing effect on the society
sometimes it leads to passivity
frittering away your time doing
something to enjoy yourself and
accepting accepting the norms and
demands of the traditional authority
what to try to explain it is impossible
it's trying to explain why human beings
who have opportunities make choices one
way or another that's beyond explanation
we can't even explain why a person
decides to lift this finger you know
these are some of the mysteries about
human beings that we don't understand
but we see both things happening over
time so that they say the United States
the 1950s young people were very passive
obedient quiet 1960s they were leading a
social and cultural revolution which did
in fact civilized society to try to
explain what you can talk about factors
that entered into it in retrospect but
there was certainly nothing predictable
well I think we seem to cover more
Lester the key issue facing Thailand
especially in talking about the two key
institution here one is the monarchy and
one is the military and their role and
the impact caused on Thai society at
large and also a younger generation when
you last last quick one given all this
information and also that the problem
talents the scene what hard should we
expect to learn in ten years from now in
your own view well we should expect or
what we should hope for those are two
different things
they became wait with what you hopeful
what should be hopeful and what you
offer what I would hope for is a
dedicated effort to confront the
regressive elements of the society to
build on the positive and constructive
features of the society which we did not
discuss much but very much exist and to
try to move towards a more just and free
social and political community can be
done
where we talk about what we
shuto for Thailand what then what should
we expect from Thailand well what we
hope for and what we expect are not the
same thing what we expect we really
can't say these are matters of will and
choice it's up to time the people of
Thailand to make the decision as to what
will happen and their hands can't
predict it what we should hope for is a
continuation of efforts that have
existed throughout the years to struggle
to create a more just and free society
overcoming the regressive elements of
Thai society and culture building on the
positive and constructive elements which
certainly exist we have not discussed
them much but they're definitely they're
out of this could come a much better
future if people make the decision and
it's in their hands to grasp the
opportunities that are available to them
to face the often difficult impediments
often repression that comes with it and
to work towards a better more just and
free world
mr. song Chomsky thank you so much for
