good evening everyone and thank you so
much on behalf of professor Chomsky
myself for that really warm and generous
welcome and thank you so much as well to
Professor Chomsky for agreeing to
participate in this evening's event I
was here actually two years ago or so
from my prior book with Professor
Chomsky and what I said at the time was
that writing a book is a really solitary
process you sit there and write it and
you struggle with it and the only people
who are reading it are your editors who
are constantly telling you how awful it
is to justify the changes that they want
to do that you're fighting again and you
really have no idea how people are going
to react and and you can't wait to get
it out into the world and what I said
two years ago is that there really is no
greater honor than writing a book and
then having the opportunity to discuss
it with one of your premier intellectual
heroes really one of the most fearless
and accomplished public intellectuals on
the planet and I certainly continue to
think that and it's a huge honor to
and it's funny it's particularly
generous of him to be here because as he
knows before or as Edward Snowden sort
of wormed his way into my existence I
happen to be working on a book about the
way in which the establishment media
constricts the range of acceptable
political discourse and was writing a
book about how he had been treated in by
the US media as a window into
understanding those dynamics so he sort
of got bumped by Edward Snowden when
when somebody comes to you and says hey
I'd like to give you tens of thousands
of top-secret documents from the most
secretive agency of the world's most
powerful government you tend to put your
current projects on hold so I did but I
hope to return to that I want to just
talk a little bit about the reason I
wrote the book because there's a lot of
obvious component parts that that are
worth discussing I think but I think
it's a good idea to step back and talk
about the impetus behind the book
because as I said writing a book is a
really grueling process especially when
you're trying to report on stories and
do a variety of other things and you
need good reasons to do it and I spend a
good amount of time thinking about
whether I wanted to do it and whether
there was a sufficient reason to do it
and there are some general reasons why
it made sense on it for one ever since I
got these documents I felt a very
cumbersome obligation to my source who
unraveled his existence to bring this
information to the public and to
galvanize a debate around the world and
also to the material and to the public
which had a right to not only see it but
to understand it and interact with it
and writing a book is a unique
opportunity to reach people who don't
spend their time reading newspapers or
following debates you can go around the
world and talk about the importance of
privacy in the Menace of a secret
surveillance state and really help
catalyze the debate even further and I
thought I have the obligation to do that
and the other part about writing a book
is that when you're reporting on and
writing on something every single day
you're focused on the immediate story
before you and it's hard to understand
some of the underlying implication
when you write a book you're sort of
forced to take steps back in and look at
how these issues connect with one
another and what some of the underlying
themes are the sort of context or the
reporting that you've been doing and I
think I had an opportunity to do that
with this book and it was really
fulfilling and helpful to me and I hope
will inform the debate on in a lot of
ways but a really significant reason why
I decided to write the book is because
so much has been said over the last year
about Edward Snowden about the reporting
that we did about the documents that we
have about the way in which we disclose
them so much of which has been
completely untrue and I really wanted to
take the opportunity to present the
definitive set of events as I saw them
to sort of as a corrective and you know
one of the things if you're somebody who
enjoys bashing the American media and I
am somebody who enjoys that immensely
you know it comes as no surprise that in
in the abstract you recognize that the
American media all the time disseminate
while they false claims I mean that
doesn't surprise I'm sure anybody in
this room you sort of see it from a
distance you know that they're they're
making falsehoods and and deceiving
people and and that's something that we
abstractly understand but when you're
actually at the center of one of the
stories and you know firsthand what
actually happened your appreciation for
their eagerness and capacity to mislead
substantially increases it has really
been I don't know maybe I was a little
bit naive I don't think so but it has
been a remarkable experience to watch
the extent to which people in public
life you have significant platforms just
routinely and without the slightest
thought spout all kinds of blatant
falsehoods you know I was I remember
when when I was in Hong Kong after we
unveiled Snowden's identity for the
first time there was this consensus that
arose among certain members of the media
in the political class that this was
clearly a spying operation run out of
Beijing that Snowden was almost
certainly a Chinese spy there were weeks
people who are saying this and then once
the Chinese government told him you know
what you have to leave and he flew to
Russia
on his way to Ecuador and got trapped in
Moscow by the US government revoking his
passport and bullying the Cubans into
rescinding their guarantee of safe
passage on his way to Ecuador those very
same people who had been saying just two
weeks earlier that he were was clearly a
Chinese by suddenly switched on a dime
and started saying obviously he this is
an operation run by Vladimir Putin and I
guarantee you tomorrow if he like flew
to I don't know like Lima these same
people would say oh he's obviously a
Peruvian agent engaged in an espionage
operation they'll just say whatever they
need to say to demonize him and there
was even a Wall Street Journal op-ed
several days ago saying we know for
certain that this was either a Chinese
espionage operation a Russian espionage
operation or possibly a joint
sino-russian plot and and it's really
been just remarkable how seriously all
of that has been taken despite the fact
that there's zero evidence to support
any of it and enormous mountains of
evidence that negate it
similarly there was this two-week period
after we really after we revealed
Snowden that was incredible
when I was in Hong Kong I really wasn't
paying attention to the extremely
important musings of people like David
Brooks and David Ignatius and Bob Shafer
and Jeffrey Toobin because I was a
little bit busy but I did go back and
the course I'm writing this book to look
at what the discourse was and the
immediate aftermath of Snowden's
unveiling and I was really amazed
because I've been pretty scornful of the
notion that there's this active plotting
among journalists and media outlets to
coordinate their their storyline I
generally think that they don't need to
plot they're just sort of appendages of
a certain culture and it just kind of
comes naturally the way they all embrace
each other's conventional wisdom but
within 24 to 48 hours literally after we
first introduced Edward Snowden to the
world
there was this immediate consensus among
all of these media elites that they were
completely capable of
taking this person that they had never
heard of before and didn't know the
first thing about and like diagnosing
him by clinically diagnosing him like
psychologically assessing his
pathologies and they all somehow settled
on this incredibly coordinated script
that he was a Fame seeking narcissist
this is I mean if you google it you'll
find this phrase over and over and over
again that this was the the mental
imbalance that led him to do what he did
it was obviously not any genuine
dissatisfaction with the US government
or what it was doing because how could
any sane person possibly be dissatisfied
with the US government there must be a
mental condition that led him to do what
he did and that was the one they settled
on and it didn't just amaze me how
coordinated it was like where did they
all get that how did they where did that
come from that that fame-seeking
narcissist theme I really want to know
but what really struck me about it was
the very first conversation that I ever
had with Edward Snowden ever online
before I knew who he was what he said to
me was I want to do this and I'm going
to give you these documents and when I
give them to you
I am adamant about the fact that I want
to identify myself as the source for
these disclosures and I want to come
forward and explain to the world why I
did what I did and he said the reason is
that I feel I owed the world on a duty
to explain the motives and rationale
behind what I did and not to allow other
people to be falsely accused and I'm
proud of the choice that I made so I
want to stand up and take responsibility
for it and
and then he said once I do that once I
make that public statement I'm going to
just disappear from Mediasite because he
knew that the objective of the national
security state and its apologists and
defenders would be to try and shift the
focus away from the substance of the
revelations away from the fact that they
were engaged in the largest and most
pervasive system of suspicionless
surveillance ever created in human
history and talk about his mental
afflictions and why he was where he was
and how he missed his girlfriend and
what he did to her and all of that and
and so he wanted to just disappear from
sight and prevent them from doing that
you know there's this fascinating
history of how things are done to
whistleblowers you know my one of my
childhood heroes politically was Daniel
Ellsberg and I've gotten to become
friends with him he's a colleague of
mine and I talked to him about this
before because I never used to be able
to understand why in response to the
leaking of the Pentagon Papers the
response of the Nixon administration was
to break into the office of his
psychiatrist in the hope of obtaining
his psycho sexual secrets it never made
any sense to me like it seemed like the
ultimate non sequitur like oh look we
have documents showing that the US
government has been systematically lying
to the American people for years about
the Vietnam War and the response would
be well Daniel Ellsberg is a swinger
like I never quite understood why they
thought that would be effective and I
asked him about that and what he said is
you're thinking about this way too
rationally that once you sufficiently
demonize a person on a level that makes
people uncomfortable though everybody
will want to avoid not just that person
but all of the fruits of their work and
the message that they're delivering it's
an incredibly effective means of
excluding somebody from decent company
and making everything that they say
instantly dismiss for that reason you
saw the same thing done to Julian
Assange and Chelsea Manning and anybody
who has delivered in a comfortable
message and so Snowden was determined
not to let that happen
and so literally four months after we
revealed his identity I got telephone
calls on a daily basis literally on a
daily basis
from all of the very shining American TV
personalities the actors who play the
role of journalists on TV
pleading with me to arrange for them to
get an interview with him that they
could put on prime-time television he
could have spent months and months and
months on every single major world
television network
spouting and talking and pontificating
and become the most famous person in the
world and yet he has steadfastly refused
in fact to date he has never given an
interview to an American television
network precisely because he was
completely uninterested in Fame in fact
he wanted to avoid it so that the focus
could remain on the substance and that
is the person that all of our brilliant
media pundits accused of being motivated
by Fame and being a narcissist you can't
find a person to whom that description
applies less I want to talk to you about
the the the idea that the disclosures
have helped the terrorists and been
treasonous and all of those cliches that
I'm sure you're already very familiar
with and the thing that makes me amazed
about the extent to which this is voiced
and you know I'm not a book tour so I've
done I don't know countless interviews
with all kinds of establishment media
outlets and I don't think there has been
a single interview I've done that didn't
include some kind of question along the
lines of like they put their very
serious somber faces on to signal that
this is important and they say mr.
Greenwald general Keith Alexander the
longtime chief of the NSA said in an
interview last week that he is certain
that people will lose their lives as a
result of these disclosures innocent
people will be killed as a result of
what you have revealed does that keep
you up at night the the prospect that
your reporting will result in other
people's deaths and what makes that so
amazing to me isn't just that the these
officials are allowed to make these
claims and have the media go forth and
amplify them without the slightest
expectation that there will be any
evidence presented at all that any of
that is true right I mean that's not
really remarkable anymore the idea that
media officials mindlessly amplify
whatever government officials tell them
without expecting any evidence to
support it that's the reason why we have
the media debacle leading up to the Iraq
war that's not what surprises me what
surprises me is the fact that there is
no awareness that
virtually every single case over the
last 50 years where there have been
whistleblowers who come forward or
unauthorized disclosures that's what
media figures call it unauthorized
disclosure of meaning reporting things
that the government didn't give you
permission to report in every single one
of those cases the same exact script is
immediately and reflexively read from
and it continuously is proven to be
false over and over and over again and
there's never any hesitation or thought
of well maybe because they've said this
every single time there's a story and it
always turns out to be true that we
oughta treat it with a tad of skepticism
there's just a kind of immediate
reflexive reaction that it ought to be
taken seriously because they wear medals
on their chest and so a big part of
writing this book is to detail just how
capable of and devoted to deceit and
public lying these same officials are
and the hope that their pronouncements
will be treated much more skeptically in
the future so I just want to talk about
a couple of other brief points in terms
of the the falsity of the public
discourse that I was hoping to correct
and one of them is about the way in
which we've reported these documents and
the intentions that Edward Snowden had
when he gave them to us we have been
criticized very predictably and very
inconsequential II from what I will call
just for lack of a better term the right
which is you know primarily Democrats
who voices some critique that our
disclosures are going to help the
terrorists and result in the deaths of
innocent people and all of that I was on
c-span two days ago
and every time the host said and now
we're going to go to the Democrat line I
knew I was about to be called a traitor
it was like completely reliable so you
know that's the critique from the right
and there's a much more interesting and
I think reasonable and even more valid
critique that for again wants of a
better term alcohol from the left that
has also been critical of how we've done
the reporting that has said actually you
haven't released too much you've
actually released too little and we
think you should just take these
documents and put them all online or you
should release them a lot more
aggressively or a lot more quickly you
have all these documents and
release only a small percentage and so I
wanted to make clear exactly what
happened so that there's no confusion
about how the story have evolved and the
reasons why and when that is that when
Edward Snowden came to us he had a very
very clear and determined understanding
of how he wanted these documents to be
reported he didn't want all of the
documents uploaded to the Internet if he
wanted that obviously he didn't need me
to do it he's extremely capable much
more so than I am of doing that had he
wanted that to happen he could have just
done it himself or he could have given
it to other groups and asked that they
do it or he could have given it to me
and asked that I do it that isn't what
happened he was inspired by prior
whistleblowers like Chelsea Manning and
WikiLeaks and Thomas Drake and others
and wanted to learn from the ways in
which they had been effectively attacked
and the importance of their revelations
diluted and undermined and he was
determined not to let the debate be all
about why is there this reckless
indiscriminate disclosures even though
that wasn't the case for any of those
prior instances that was the attack that
was made and so he said I want you to go
very carefully through each of these
documents and to report them
journalistically one by one meaning
explain to the public exactly what these
documents are do reporting to make them
even clearer and let each story breathe
so that people can react and debate and
let this story unfold and that we can
say credibly that we're releasing these
documents in a manner that's systematic
so that they couldn't demonize the
disclosures and that was a framework to
which I agreed when I took the documents
which for me ends the debate even if I
didn't think that was the right approach
I would never violate my agreement to
him no matter who doesn't like it but I
also think it was the right thing to do
and the evidence I think that vindicates
that strategy is the fact that I've been
writing about surveillance for eight
years and it's a very hard thing to get
people to pay attention to or care about
they think it's remote they think it's
abstract it can be complicated and yet
here we are a year later and interest in
this topic is more sustained and more
intense than it was back in June when we
first started revealing the stories
there are incredible reform movements
around the world people's changing their
how they think not just the
about surveillance of privacy but about
the role of the United States and the
dangers of investing their own
government with power to be exercised in
secret and the proper role of journalism
visa be the state I think these issues
have been debated in a more serious way
and in a more intense way around the
world for a longer period of time than
almost any other story that I've seen
and I think that really vindicates the
strategy that he insisted upon and that
we agreed to undertake and whatever else
is true that strategy is not what has
been depicted it is the opposite of a
reckless and indiscriminate strategy it
is a very strategically precise strategy
of trying to make sure that the debate
proceeds constructively by choosing the
documents to release in a way of the
public can best understand which i think
is the duty of an activist and the duty
of a journalist as well last point I
want to make and then I will turn it
over to Professor Chomsky is there is a
much more important point to me to the
Edward Snowden story into telling it
than just correcting the record and
clearing up all those misconceptions and
that is that for me there is an
extraordinarily valuable lesson to learn
from everything that has happened here I
have been going around talking about all
sorts of issues relating to war on
terror basis and fundamental defects in
the American criminal justice system and
all of these other kinds of issues and
invariably the question that everybody
asks is well what can I do about it and
embedded in that question oftentimes is
a sense of defeatism the idea that these
forces are so formidable that I don't
really feel as though as outraged as I
may get that I have within me the
capacity to do anything about them and I
know professor Chomsky has talked about
that question and that mindset a lot
before and said he really only hears it
in the United States or in the West and
and not typically in other countries
where they feel like they have an outlet
and know what to do which is take it
upon themselves to change it but the
reason I think there's such a valuable
lesson here is that whatever else you
think about Edward Snowden when I met
him he was 29 years old he was raised in
a lower middle class to middle class
environment by a father who was in the
Coast Guard for 30 years he has no
family connections he had no power no
person
she was as ordinary as it gets
completely obscured no support
institutionally in any way he was just
an ordinary individual who through
nothing more than an act of conscience
acting more or less alone literally
change the world and the lesson for me
that profoundly influenced how I think
and how I get everything from that point
forward and what I think probably for
the rest of my life is really clear to
me which is that no matter who you are
and no matter how inadequate you think
you are when we raid against these very
powerful forces we all have within us
the ability when we summon the proper
will and really make the choice to do so
in defense of the things that we say we
believe to affect not minor but radical
and fundamental change in the world and
I think the decision and choice that he
made should be the permanent antidote to
that kind of defeatism and I wanted to
convey that lesson in writing the book
and and going around and talking about
it and and I hope I did so thanks very
much and
I think I quite agree with you what he
achieved does drive home that lesson
which is one that we should really be
familiar with almost every significant
change that's ever happened was sparked
by often isolated individuals that were
willing to take a stand on something so
it takes a the modern civil rights
movement civil rights movement goes back
centuries but it really took off in the
modern period around 1960 and if you
just look at the incidents that were
involved it very much underscores with
Glenna saying so in 1960 in Greensboro
North Carolina a couple of black
students decided to sit-in at a
Woolworth's lunch counter and asked to
be served of course they were
immediately arrested and brutalized set
off could have in the end of it except
the next day more students came pretty
soon you had the formation of the
Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee you had Freedom Riders going
through the South really risking their
lives it was not it was not easy
beaten attacked killed some northerners
came down number of them were murdered
finally you had legislative changes
which were partial victories but
nevertheless significant victories and I
think this is true in every case I know
when they take one of a very different
kind in agenda in 1975 the Indonesian
government invaded the former Portuguese
colony of East Timor nearby mainly
because they wanted to gain control of
the oil of the region the invasion was
murderous it led to virtual
genocide probably killed core third of
the population the u.s. strongly
supported it from the very beginning so
it Britain so other allies that mainly
because Indonesia is a rich prize a lot
of resources a lot of investments make a
lot of profit from it are very
significant and strategically there were
about three or four people I could name
who some of them students who dropped
out of school devoted their lives to
trying to organize on this topic
their names of like Snowden you don't
nobody knows their names practically
nobody except those who were involved
they don't want to be known but they
succeeded over in bringing other people
to become involved a lot of the speaking
that I did was organized by them of
testimony at the General Assembly was
organized by them the spread of the
countries finally in 1979 1999 September
1999 twenty four five years after this
genocidal assault a Bill Clinton
president said a couple of words he
informed the Indonesian generals that
the game's over they have to destroy
prior to that they were saying they'd
never withdraw this was their territory
they did next it they got a word from
the White House they instantly withdraw
a few people were responsible for this
let's go to the media coverage the media
knew all about this for 25 years there
was extensive reporting in Australia
there were a kind of leaks take a look
at the record virtually nothing and then
look what happened when a Clinton
declared it over the reporting wasn't
look this shows that you guys are
incredible criminals you were
responsible for what happened all these
years
the response was magnificent act of
humanitarian intervention because
Clinton intervened stopped the crimes of
the Indonesian army withdrew that
allowed a UN peacekeeping force to enter
a wonderful tribute to humanitarian
intervention art we magnificent this
happens over and over again when you
were talking about the sino-soviet
conspiracy what came to my mind is an
interesting case of it this wonderful
book that I'd heard you're looking read
if you haven't by old friend of mine Jim
Peck his very good China scholar the
books called Washington's China that
what he did was go through the records
of the Declassified records of the
National Security Council you know for
the entire period up to what had been
released when he wrote the book and
presented their account of what the
Chinese put with their analysis of
China's role in the world
there was a conclusion that was
consistent through all the accounts
China's a terrible threat but what
changed over the years is the reasons
when China was more or less friendly to
Russia or look that way China is a
terrible threat because it's puppet of
Moscow when China was proclaimed war
with Russia a couple of years later chad
is a terrible threat because the
russians are kind of more or less
moderate in the chinese or extreme and
no matter what the facts were you always
got the same conclusion the most
interesting case and one that you really
people really ought to be taught in
elementary school is what happened with
regard to Indochina in the late 19th
that come to the late 1940s of the US
was kind of ambivalent about which
third-world movements to destroy and
which ones to support there were
conflicting goals the u.s. was not had
objections to traditional European
imperialism because it kept out US
interest so they wanted it dismantled on
the other hand third-world nationalist
movements are even more of a threat so
various choices were made in the case of
Indochina in the late 1940s the u.s. is
more or less supported to the Viet Minh
towards the Vietnamese independence
movement it had fought with the US
during war fought against the Japanese
and so on
around 1950 of the government US
government decided to support the French
in their effort to reconquer Indochina
at that point orders went out to the
intelligence agencies to prove that Ho
Chi Minh was a puppet of China or Russia
or the sino-soviet conspiracy anything
would do you know very much like what
you described and for a couple of years
they worked on it and there's also
pretty interesting
they finally felt like the final reports
couple years later where that very
strange but Hanoi seems to be the only
place in the region where there's no
context with China or Russia well the
conclusion that was drawn by the wise
men in the State Department Dean Acheson
so on is that proves our point they are
such a loyal puppet of picker choice
taking pay paying as it was called the
Moscow conspiracy that they don't even
have to give them orders and well you
take a look at the reporting over the
years
it follows whatever the conclusion is
religiously and it's the same way on
just about every issue you can think of
I'm just kind of an interesting case in
with in the case of the Iraq war as you
man
nd when when George Bush and his gang
decided they were going to invade Iraq
they spread all kind of stories about
you know mushroom cloud over New York
and so on and so forth immediate coadley
reported no occasional questions not
much just solid from be to approval the
reason for the war if you look back was
a single question
that's what bush and Blair repeated over
and over there's a single question will
Saddam Hussein put an end to his
programs of development of nuclear
weapons that was a single question well
as you remember after a couple of years
of investigation the single question got
the wrong answer there never had been
hanging there hadn't been any such
programs with an interesting exception
apart from the ones that the u.s.
supported what you won't see reported is
that George Bush number one was such a
ton Reagan were such enthusiastic
supporters of Saddam Hussein that it
when the war with Iran was over of a
bush was then president he actually
invited Iraqi nuclear engineers to come
to the United States for advanced
training in nuclear weapons production
well that's not the final thing to
report anyhow after you know as tenure
has been no no programs what happened
the story changed it wasn't nuclear
weapons that was not the reason why we
had her we entered because of our love
of democracy this was part of our
democracy promotion project and in fact
if you look back in November 2003 which
gave a well advertised speech National
Endowment for democracy in Washington or
rating about our love of democracy and
that's why we had to invade Iraq to
bring democracy to the directing people
and so on take a look at the journalism
like
turn on a dime of course there were some
things they didn't repent a
public-opinion kind of more or less
follows not entirely though there were
international polls asking people what
they thought about the US democracy
promotion program and one place they
asked them was in Iraq I think about 1%
of the population took it seriously they
had a little experience with it
that goes on right to the present we
have a democracy promotion program in
the Middle East that's why we supported
the Arab Spring and Burpo's and
dictators and so on there are
international polls asking people if I
think about this in the Arab world as
maybe 5% think maybe it's serious almost
everybody regards it as total nonsense
can you get that reported here known in
fact the things that can't be reported
are pretty spectacular last December for
example there was a poll International
fold top folding agencies Gallup in the
United States their counterpart in
England and asking various questions one
of the questions that was asked was
which country in the world is the
greatest threat to world peace guess
what the United States was so far in the
lead nobody was even close
way below was Pakistan and that was
inflated because of the Indian vote a
rat no but that's right and so I had a
friend to a database check there was one
report on it in the United States in a
Murdoch Journal right-wing Murdoch
Journal New York Post they recorded it
and said this is very interesting it
shows how crazy the world
[Applause]
what I think I I think it's redundant to
say there should read the book but I
really do it does bring this home in a
very remarkable way also it brings home
some other lessons which when did
mention but I think are worth stressing
it's common discourse if you you know
he's studied in political science or
international relations read the press
governments are committed to security
that's their major goal they're
committed to security against their
enemies there's a couple of things that
are not asked security for whom and who
are the enemies well it turns out that
one of the major enemies is you one of
the major enemies of every government is
its own population they are dangerous we
got to know everything about them that
we can we have to control them we have
to make sure they don't get out of hand
every power system believes this
certainly governments do and this is
demonstrated with spectacular clarity
and the especially especially in the
book which brings it together you know I
mean I'd read the reports when they came
out but reading it together in the book
over you see it much more dramatically
second point is whose security are they
concerned with is it security the
population will certainly not in fact
after the plan in the book reports the
spectacular lion Obama you know he comes
and you're hot officials about how this
this operation is protecting us from I
think the first claim was 54 terrorist
attacks were foiled and then it went
down to about the dozen thirst attacks
from file and finally there was a
government commission
which was appointed to investigate how
many terrorist attacks were foiled they
had access to high-level security
internal documents all the best sources
they did find something one one person
had sent eight thousand dollars to
Somalia that's what this massive
operation of control of everything you
do is about well that tells you whose
security is being good example whose
security is being protected it's the
security of state power from its enemy
and one of the main enemies is the
population occasionally a ray of light
comes through on this tribute to Harvard
I'll quote the professor of the science
of Government at Harvard I always liked
that table there's professor the science
of Government at Harvard Samuel
Huntington back in 1981 he pointed out
that I forget his exact word something
like this that power has to operate in
the dark when exposed to sunlight it
wilts and evaporates and then he went on
the same time to say that ever since the
Truman Doctrine 1947 it's been necessary
to try to convince the American people
that we're defending them from the
Russians of course we're not other goals
but that's we have to convince them and
that requires the power operate in the
dark that's the reason for secrecy this
all this demonstrates it clearly you can
find it just by searching through
declassified documents if you go through
that boring occasionally illuminating
activity you find that genuine security
is always never an issue what is the
main issue is making sure that power can
operate in the dark for its own reasons
support for state power and support for
private power one of the striking things
that emerge from the Snowden revelations
when emphasized in his book is the
extent to which economic espionage is at
the core of these massive operations and
not just the United States
like for example Canada big mining
country uses these techniques to try to
find out what's happening in the British
in the Brazilian mining and energy the
industry's us doesn't say trading
partners and so on you have to expose
everything for the benefit of the forces
that really matter which are not the
population the population has to be
controlled subdued a frightened misled
and these are among the lessons that I
think come out with a dramatic clarity
from the revelations and particularly
from the book which put together a great
so thank you so much for that
so what we want to do is have a Q&A
session and I'm not sure I think they
told you what the format was what the
instructions are I wasn't part of that
so I don't know I guess people just line
up in this middle aisle here and then
we'll just take them one by one for as
long as we can
I was very acrobatic
professor Chomsky given that American
power only seems constrained by two
things the first being that which is
required to avoid a revolution and
second is technological capability for
abuses and excesses and I'm not even
sure first frankly I'd like to know what
your thoughts are on where the
surveillance state is proceeding because
it's as I said it seems to be simply
limited by the technological capability
to exploit the population and to spy on
it and so with there may be a time when
we look back on today and I admire the
amount of freedoms that we had given
that constraint particularly the
development with the Obama
administration having essentially
normalized
the procedures of the Bush
administration Obama
I never frankly had much had many
expectations for Obama and wrote about
him critically before the first
primaries but he has surprised me on one
thing about you his attack on civil
liberties because I really don't see the
point of this and it's a the attack on
the Fourth Amendment which of course is
a devastating attack on the Fourth
Amendment any reasonable reading of it
but it goes well beyond also to mention
two other cases which are not that
well-known one of them is a case to look
it up its holder Bernie General V
humanitarian law project its case for
our party Obama administration against
humanitarian law project but Supreme
Court Court justify has validated the
Obama position of the Obama position to
get humanitarian law project was a legal
aid group it was giving legal advice to
a group that's on the government's
carers list
the government's terrorist list
incidentally is an abomination it should
not be tolerated in a free society you
can be on the terrorist list if the
government the president says I don't
like you then you're on the terrorist
list and if you take a look at who was
on the terrorist list it's pretty
remarkable so for example Nelson Mandela
was on the terrorist list until a couple
of years ago because the Reagan
administration had determined that he is
one of the more notorious terrorists in
the world on the other hand Saddam
Hussein was taken off the terrorist list
in 1982 because the Reagan
administration wanted to provide him
with aid for his attack on Iraq so he
was off the terrorists list the whole
idea that his grotesque it is never
questioned with putting that aside
they gave legal advice to a group on the
terrorist list that was described by the
Obama administration within the legal
proceedings as material assistance to
terrorism okay material assistance used
to mean you get a car is the Garner's
okay now it means you given legal advice
and if we read colloquy you know the
discussion in the court it could extend
as far as having an interview with Hasan
Nasrallah head of Hezbollah which of it
anything that gives any credibility to
people they call terrorists is material
assistance there's another one being
NDAA which is sort of similar that's the
National Defense budget for the military
it has a provision in it which allows
the military to hold people permanently
without shark to became them permanently
without charge primarily they're talking
about foreign citizens but it has a
provision that in principle makes it
open to American citizens there is a
court case initiated by Chris Hedges
against this provision
and one of the plaintiffs but wasn't
very happy about it frankly because the
case is concentrated on American
citizens and the kind of tacit
assumption is if you want to pick up
somebody who isn't an American citizen
and hold him indefinitely without charge
apparently that's that's okay
we shouldn't be conceding that but
anyway the case went through it at the
district level the if one the plaintiffs
won that but then the government
immediately appealed higher levels it's
been sustained and it extends the notion
of material assistance to terrorism to
substantial aid to terrorism
whatever that means like talking to them
for example that this is over the
Supreme Court will be ratified and what
does Obama care out of pressing home and
attack on civil liberties that goes well
beyond anything you can even get a
political gain out of and so one thing
about the administration that's really
surprising and you're quite right every
one of these things sets a standard
which the next president can go beyond
doesn't have to but it tends to work
that way and we accept it if we don't do
what Snowden Glenn Greenwald and other
people are doing and really struggle
against it
that we are complicit in the further
erosion of the liberties that we have
enough what for you people for for four
years I can rest safely now knowing that
we're all on we've all provided material
support to terrorists
hi thank you both for your work so mr.
Greenwald one of the things that has
stood out about this Snowden saga is its
international scope they're traveling to
Hong Kong to Russia correct me if I'm
wrong but it seems Lee you are no longer
you are not based in the United States
and people have become exiled over this
over the affairs with WikiLeaks they are
no longer welcome in their own countries
within endeavors like first look media
how are you stepping outside of national
boundaries in order to more effectively
report on these kinds of issues that can
a lien 8 use so intensely if you are
embedded in a national culture that's a
great question
I think one of the most overlooked
aspects of the story has been exactly
what you just raised which is that the
story really is global in nature the
first story that I really concentrated
on after I started writing about
politics in 2005 was the revelation
about NSA eavesdropping on Americans
without the warrants required by the
criminal law and that story involved
companies like Verizon and Sprint and
AT&T which are overwhelmingly domestic
and it involved only the communication
of American citizens and was exclusively
a domestic controversy and what made
this story so explosive not in the
United States only but globally was the
fact that the Internet is a global means
of communication you can't invade it and
segregate the impact only to certain
countries you invade the internet it
means that you're invading
communications internationally and
beyond that the companies that are
implicated who have eagerly participated
with the NSA for all sorts of reasons
such as Facebook and Google and Skype
and Microsoft and and Yahoo are the
means that hundreds of millions of
people not in the United States but
around the world use as their primary
means of communication and then beyond
that there was this incredible
international scope to the story it
wasn't just me working outside of the
country but my close collaborator and
partner Laura Poitras who worked from
Berlin because as a filmmaker she had
been long afraid to be in the United
States
because she thought that her film would
be subpoenaed the stories that we did we
purposely partnered with media outlets
in every country around the world so
that the people most affected by the
revelations would have their own media
outlets reporting on it with journalists
in those countries who knew them best to
maximize the impact internationally and
you know when I go around the United
States sometimes people say well what
really has changed what are the big
significant reforms and outcomes and
usually that question is confined
domestically and there are lots of
changes in the United States and I think
there are a lot more to come as more
reporting unfolds and the like but the
real changes have been I think in terms
of the dynamics internationally you know
this is there's so many things that have
happened in the story that some really
significant ones get overlooked but one
of my favorite events that has happened
happened way back in June of 2013 when
the United States for two weeks after we
unveiled Snowden in Hong Kong was
demanding with increasing levels of
aggression that the government in Hong
Kong turned Snowden over to them in
order for them to arrest him and bring
him back to the United States and rather
than comply which is what everyone in
the American media thought they would do
to the point they were mocking Snowden
for his choice of Hong Kong which was a
stupid choice they said because of
course Hong Kong is going to obey the
dictate of the United States instead the
government of Hong Kong said we like to
put you on this plane and have you go
wherever you want and then the day they
did that and if you haven't seen it
please go look at it when you get home
because it's the funniest thing ever
they issued this statement saying the
United States government has submitted a
request to the government of Hong Kong
to detain Edward Snowden and turn him
over
unfortunately the documents of the
United States government submitted were
filled out improperly and we therefore
have no choice but to let him go and
then the last paragraph said it began
with the word meanwhile we have recently
learned that the United States
government is invading the
communications of our civilian
infrastructure Zoar research facilities
around universities and we think an
investigation is warranted and the
reason that was so significant aside
from how hilarious it is is that it's
signaled that there was going to be this
change of tenor in how the United States
was Percy
and after that happened country after
country government after government
publicly defied the US and a really
brazen an unapologetic way unlike what
almost never happens and you saw Russia
do it when they granted him asylum and
refused to turn him over when he was in
the airport and he saw latin-american
countries like Venezuela and Nicaragua
and Bolivia all formally offer him
asylum and you saw Ecuador publicly
argue for his Asylum and then you saw
Brazil which has always had this sort of
complex of being subservient to the
United States because it's been
dominated through all kinds of colonial
and imperialist policies not only
canceled the state visit the first that
they honored the Brazilian president
within 40 years but then the president
of Brazil Dilma Rousseff whose
conversations were themselves targeted
and invaded as we reported in Brazil
went to the UN and vehemently denounced
the United States and very harsh terms
of human rights and privacy while
President Obama lurked angrily out in
the hallway and Germany has done the
same thing at his damaged international
relations it has changed the way that
people think about the United States all
over the world and when you start
changing consciousness and not just
consciousness about how people think
about surveillance or privacy but about
how they think about their own
governments power and the role of the
United States and a whole variety of
other issues fundamental change will
emerge and it will emerge quickly and
probably in ways that we can't even
anticipate and I think the most exciting
part of the story is exactly what you
asked about which is the international
scope really the global scope of how the
story has played out
I agree wall visit Chomsky uh if there
is a theme to your book ethnicity I'm
sorry
oh if there is a theme to your book
which I just finished reading is that
for me was growth knowing when you
laptop get installing for your house and
that tell you your resolution to how
hard you was going to tackle the issues
even harder to learning how to install a
program a computer program for hacking
purposes or for you know communicating
on so for me the team notebook was
really close to personal growth and I
think that's what I see for the last
year and I guess my question is what has
this last year taught you personally and
for professor Chomsky real quick it was
really hard to find a book of you in
Spanish and it took me like a month I
will be honored if you could please sign
for me that you could sign the book for
me that I would be what you designed
about yeah I think we're gonna both be
around a little bit after all the sign
so you know just as far as the question
you ask I mean I talked a lot about the
primary lesson that I feel like I
learned from from being able to observe
Edward Snowden but you know I also and
then I've obviously learned you know
specific kinds of information such as
how to encrypt my communications which
is proven to be very important and you
know that's one of the things the
importance of which shouldn't be
underestimated is if we all start
encrypting our communications it makes
them possible for the NSA or close to
impossible for them to invade our
communications that's something we can
do to empower ourselves now that we know
how much our privacy is being
compromised but there is another really
crucial lesson that you know I think I
learned which is you know Laura and I
have talked about this a lot which is
once we realize the fearlessness that
drove Edward Snowden's choice we felt an
obligation to have our work be driven by
the same spirit of fearlessness and once
we started doing that other people with
whom we were working including a very
large media institution that has all the
same impediments and concerns which is
the Guardian actually began being
infected by that same sort of spirit and
did actually give me an enormous support
to
work the story as aggressively as I
thought it should be reported and then
huge numbers of people around the world
that I hear from all the time journalism
students and other kinds of people who
thought they were going to go work for
tech companies and have decided not to
or journalist students who say I now
understand that the purpose of
journalism is to keep people in power in
check there's this massive ripple effect
and I do think that this phrase courage
is contagious
it's probably something that if somebody
said to me five years ago or two years
ago I would have sort of abstractly
agreed with it's now something that is a
statement of principle that I know is
true on a really visceral level and it
can happen really quickly and the ways
in which you can impact other people's
thought process and choices is virtually
limitless if if you act with passion and
fearlessness okay mr. Greenwald
professor Chomsky if you would those
comment on the various roles of the
other various professions of a
journalist and an academic in the world
today in light of their the freedom the
effectiveness and the limitations of
both roles for example I would imagine
being a journalist it would be limited
by what the public finds interesting you
know some of the less than savory
characteristics of media and then as an
academic I would imagine you would be
limited by feeling obligated to help
students navigate through a system that
is not like entirely of beneficial and
that the government itself considers its
primary threat to be the people of the
country itself I'll start with that you
know I have always resisted pretty
vigorously any kind of label that feels
self-limiting it's one of the reasons
why I resist ideological labels because
it sort of announces in advance that
you're supposed to have a certain belief
system regardless of how you engage on
an issue and where your rationality
takes you and the same is true of this
these roles like okay there was a debate
early on about whether or not I was a
activist or a journalist as though they
were mutually exclusive and I actually
found the debate really confusing
because I absolutely consider myself to
be both and I don't think they distract
from one another in any way I think they
fuel themselves I think journalists who
don't have a sense of activism meaning a
desire to have what they're doing have
positive effects in the world are
practicing this really impotent neutered
Solich dead-end boring form of the
practice that has actually killed it
and I need it not only corrupted but
really just boring and uninteresting and
so I think that if you whatever you do
in in your job or in your life if you
think that there are limits on what that
role entails intrinsically just ignore
them violate those rules and and do the
things that you want that you think can
help you transcend those limits I mean
he is a professor but he's way more than
that right and so I think that that's
kind of what I was saying before was
that you know I think we all have it
within ourselves to have this profound
effect on the world and the question is
finding how what is in yourself and
creating your own rules to maximize it
not let it be limited it's sound
question it questions I have dreams of
my mind interesting comment by George or
will which isn't as well-known as it
should be he his book Animal Farm
everybody's read probably in elementary
school he had an introduction to Animal
Farm which very few people read if one
reason wasn't published was found 30
years later efforts death in the
introduction the book of course is a
bitter cetera critique of the
totalitarian enemy and in the
introduction he addressed some social
people of England free England and he
says you shouldn't feel too
self-righteous when you read this
because in England under freedom
unpopular idea
can be suppressed without the use of
force and he doesn't go into the reasons
very much but one line is relevant to
your question he says one of the reasons
is because a good education if you have
a good education to go into the best
schools Oxford Cambridge you have
internalized the understanding that
there are certain things it just
wouldn't do to say and I think students
should be liberated from that internal
internalized indoctrination what how
they decided to navigate through the
perils of their lives
yes that's difficult and you know I
wouldn't feel that I'd have any reason
to give them advice about it but they
should at least gain the understanding
of it not only of the nature of the
system of indoctrination and control the
kind of things going stalking about but
also the internal fact that you have
been trained since childhood to have it
instilled into you so you don't ask the
questions you don't think about it
that's a form of entrapment and the
attack on personal integrity that is
very extreme in some ways you could say
worse than torture and people it'll be
liberated from
it just doesn't know we have time for
just one more question and then we will
begin the book signing thank you for a
remarkable fearless work mr. green voted
I have actually two quick questions for
you one is how do you choose the order
in which to release the documents and
also the second one is can you elaborate
a little bit on whether and how the
American government has targeted you as
a person and especially in last year I
guess so we better understand you know
what what have what happens Thanks yeah
you know the way that we choose to
release the document is a pretty simple
formula which is that we go through them
continuously and have been going through
them continuously for the past 11 months
as soon as we find something that we
think is significant and interesting and
newsworthy we work as hard as we can as
fast as we can to get it ready to be
published it is a frustrating process
because if you're going to publish
top-secret documents the position of the
US government is is that you're
committing a felony even if you are
working within a media organization and
nobody's going to do that without going
through a vetting process of editors and
lawyers and it has been a little bit
irritating to try and get this done more
quickly because there are always lots of
impediments but you know war and I and
lots of other journalists have both been
working literally 15 hours a day seven
days a week for 11 months on nothing but
this archive and there still are a lot
of other stories that are left to be
done including some huge ones not
because I'm purposely saving them but
because the reporting is really
difficult if you're going to report for
example on who exactly the US government
has targeted in terms of surveillance
and you want to name those people so you
can illustrate the kinds of abuses that
are taking place you want to make sure
that you're not injuring people's
reputations or harming them against
their will and you want to make sure
that you're extremely careful and
certain about the things that you're
saying and these things take time which
is in you know I know frustrating for
people out there waiting for stories and
also for me but it's a necessary part of
the process as far as being targeted you
know I mean it really is true and it's
not just false humility I mean
journalists all over the world
who do good journalism almost by
definition get targeted in all sorts of
ways and and usually they work in
obscurity as opposed to great visibility
and and the ways in which they're
targeted are much worse than anything
I've endured journalists go to war and
get killed I was on a panel once with
this Brazilian journalist who uncovered
massive corruption in the local police
force where he lived and a totally
obscure and anonymous way he
investigated this police force for two
years he got death threat he got
Rockstone through his window he got
beaten up his wife left him because she
felt like he was subjecting their
children to danger and he just continued
I would never have known his name had I
not been on this panel with him it got
the entire police force fired and new
police officers put in and that happens
all over the world all the time to
journalists I really have had a newfound
respect for the ability of journalism to
achieve positive change when it's done
correctly but of course I mean the the
the intention of the US government from
its continuous public statements at the
highest levels of the Obama
administration that what I specifically
was doing and the work I was doing was
criminal was a felony constituted
selling documents was something I ought
to be arrested for was a very deliberate
strategy to create this climate of fear
around the journalism that was taking
place so that every time we went to
publish a document we were supposed to
think is this the thing that's going to
push me over the line and make them
arrest me I had lawyers who usually can
get Eric Holder on the phone in two
seconds who got no information every
time they tried to find out whether
Laura and I would be arrested when we
returned to the US because they
deliberately wanted us to remain in this
state of uncertainty obviously detaining
my partner halfway across the world
while I was back in Brazil and locking
him in a room for 11 hours under a
terrorism law and then announcing that
there was a criminal investigation
against him under this terrorism statute
or marching into the Guardians newsroom
and demanding while agents of the
government oversaw that they destroyed
their computers was all very thuggish
attempts to do the same thing and so
there was genuine concern you take those
things seriously if you're at all
rational that the journalism could
subject you to serious danger but the
thing that we valid from the very
beginning is that under no circumstances
would it ever deter us from publishing a
single document and honestly if anything
it just absolutely involved me to work
harder because when they show their
thuggish face it makes you realize how
much more important than you thought
before transparency is and you know we
finally came back just on principle
because we weren't going to be kept out
of our own country for completely
invalid reasons of intimidation but they
often as professor Chomsky was just
saying there are lots of ways to
intimidate people and caused people to
censor their own rights without overt
shows of force and this climate of fear
even talking openly about imprisoning
journalists having graphics on the CNN
screen like I saw multiple times should
Glenn Greenwald be prosecuted where a
little panel of pundits debates that
it's all intended to make journalists
think really carefully before they do
this kind of reporting okay great thank
you everyone very much
