in the American media they were
available they were in the Israeli media
and Europe standard scholarly sources
and so on but they didn't appear if you
look at the map you can understand
exactly why the settlement was
completely unacceptable to the
Palestinians it broke the West Bank into
effectively for virtually separated
Canton's north central and southern with
a little part of East Jerusalem the
center of Palestinian commercial and
industrial and cultural life separated
from the three virtually a few
connections but difficult ones and that
program has that's a settlement program
that was conscious continued rapidly
under Clinton and Barack it's continuing
even more under Sharon and Bush and it
is undermining the possibility of a
meaningful political settlement if you
ask what the future ought to be in my
opinion here I happen to agree with
about two-thirds of the population of
the United States according to polls and
almost the entire world there has to be
preliminary preliminary settlement on
approximately the international border
is the pre June 67 border with some
adjustments because of changes since but
mutual adjustments actually Clinton's
chief negotiator Robert now I discussed
this in foreign affairs the main
establishment Journal and he said what
makes sense I think that there have to
be effectively one-to-one land swaps
which would be the basis for at least a
political settlement that would lay the
basis for an end to violence integration
of a peaceful integration of Israel into
the region as its leading industrial and
financial center but just part of it
without for the conflict if that stage
can be reached and there is an
overwhelming international consensus on
that and strong popular support in the
United States the US has been blocking
that for 25 years it's part of the
illusions that are talked about and that
title of that book if we can get to that
stage
then the further questions you're
raising that come up how about there
will be serious problems of
democratization both in Israel and in
the new Palestinian state my own feeling
remains pretty conservative it's what it
was 40 60 years ago that the long term
so I don't think it makes much sense to
break that territory into two parts if
you know the area at all or have
traveled there you can see it's awfully
artificial and harmful in the longer
term I think there should be moved
towards some kind of federal structure
ultimately as relations
let's hope improve among the people and
nationalist sentiments are subside and
hatred subside moves towards closer
integration as circumstances prevent
weird about the halfway point with our
end up with Noam Chomsky he has a
professor at MIT and Cambridge here's a
look at the outside of his office
building where he works and eventually
you'll see where his office is inside
how much time do you spend there usually
three full days a week about what days
well for some reason like classes for
many years have been on Thursdays so
Thursday's classes Tuesdays and Fridays
appointments interviews other things how
many classes a year are different
courses a year do you teach
well technically I've been retired for
the last couple years but this year I
had two courses at MIT and one a half
course that another University State
University of New York how much he's
speaking I can't even remember almost
constantly I mean do you have you gone
the road a lot still quite a lot either
I arranged that timing so that I can be
on the road obviously fun days when I
don't have commitments at work
fair amount to want it take a number of
calls if you don't mind make some notes
here so we can hear some voices of
people that are watching and we'll go
through a couple of these here and then
we'll come back to you and have you wrap
up some of the comments on their calls
New York City next go ahead please yes I
dr. Tomsky a couple of things and I'll
try to make this quick but a couple of
challenges that you pointed out the
United States being the only superpower
and having a much larger role and
responsibility in the global community
some of the changes that need to happen
and going back to the earlier colors
points on service socialistic philosophy
I mean good for the all is the way I
would look at that it seems almost
opposed the the foundation of the United
States being more of a capitalistic
system where it is profit driven and
maybe I'm drawing two big of assumptions
but it seems like we're more on a
plutocracy than democracy and a lot of
the the people who are in a position
make those changes
on behalf of the United States also have
special interests in their ears from the
industrial society or that's permanent
propagating a lot of the Industrial
feudalism as you've mentioned and
they're buying also creating some of the
the frustration the antagonism in
resentment against the United States
resulting in terrorism as I've seen it
so how do you see something like this
changing when you've got sort of a
disinterested public or a public that's
kind of being kept out of the whole
process and about to be even more so
with further media consolidations I was
just curious to hear your thoughts on
that
we got a Fall River Massachusetts what
your question in comment yeah suppose a
Chomsky that already answered my
question this seems to me you're really
holding Israel to a double standard you
say nothing of the fact that no Jews can
live in Saudi Arabia or Jordan but you
you hold Israel to such a standard and
also Jewish people cannot visit the
Temple Mount and but when the Jews
control over just areas they're supposed
to make it available to everybody so uh
could you address that why do you hold
Israel to a double standard
thanks Denver Colorado what do you have
to say today yes III just wanted to
thank you very much for having Noam
Chomsky on the show this is a great
honor and one of the most important
writers in history but I just want to
present a hypothesis and I would like
him to a to address us do you think the
the recent cherone move to refer to the
old words as people say and see what
appears to be all roads leading to
Tehran far as military action do you
think the deep on Tostan you'll see
you'll see that point I'm making do you
think the ban to stone model prevailed
in Israel and you think this wasn't is
this a an effort to sort of neutralize
the Arab opposition because I think it
appears to me that the inevitable move
for military action is will be against
Iran probably within the next year or so
one last one and then we'll come back to
dr. Chomsky we go to Palo Alto
California good morning professor
Chomsky our I guess it's afternoon where
you are yeah I have a couple questions
about 9-1-1 terrorists the terrorists
somehow prevented the US Air Force jet
fighters from being scrambled in the
normal ten minutes and they caused the
delay of 75 minutes for the jet fighters
to be sent up and they hit the Pentagon
with a guided missile because if if it
had been one of those airliners there
would have been about a hundred thousand
pounds of aluminum out on the lawn there
and that could not possibly have
vaporized the way the government said it
did and somehow the terrorists arranged
those cell phone calls and that's been
shown by experiment to be impossible and
somehow those terrorists put explosives
in the World Trade Center buildings
because Columbia University seismographs
showed pulses that could only have been
caused by explosives at the beginning of
the fall of each of those buildings not
as they were actually falling now all of
these things you can read them for
example at the cosmic penguin
komm that has links to 55 different
websites containing information about
the facts alright so thanks there's a
lot there
yeah maybe you can summarize some of it
okay maybe the easiest ways to go
backwards okay yeah well the last caller
raised made a number of technical
observations which I completely
incompetent to comment on I have no idea
whether there were seismographs that
showed that they were explosives in the
building and frankly I'm extremely
skeptical the fact that a lot of
material appears on internet sites is
not very compelling the Internet is a
very valuable instrument you can learn
all sorts of things from it but anybody
can put anything they like on the
internet that's part of its value and
you have to evaluate the information I
haven't checked any of the technical
issues that you've discussed so I can't
comment on them but I should say that I
have extreme skepticism about them on
Sharan I ran the caller right before
Sauron the O word namely occupied
territories actually the word he used is
conquered territories which is pretty
strong and accurate the and the road to
Tehran and the efforts to neutralize the
Arab world here I think we have to be
extremely we have to look closely the
Sharan plan and the bush plan as far as
we have any information about them is
simply a continuation of the Bantustan
ization process and if you read the
Israeli press which has excellent
reporters like Amira Hass and you don't
leave you write about this all the time
what they're describing and what you see
if you go to the West Bank is just
breaking it up into Canton's I mean the
separation wall which is going from
north to south has already encircled a
palestinian town calcula and is
virtually destroying it it was just
announced that it's going to go to the
- settlements to the east Arielle and
Amano ale there's a story in the New
York Times today about the settlement of
Itamar which is even to the east of that
whether that'll be included in the
separation wall or not we don't know but
it's a salient which was in the Clinton
Barack plan that basically cuts the
northern sector from the rest there is
just no doubt that the separation wall
or some equivalent will include the vast
settlement and infrastructure programs
to the east of Jerusalem extending
almost to Jericho which cuts it again
Munoz city is a growing city there mala
do meme which was established primarily
in the Clinton Barack period pretty much
with the purpose of bisecting the West
Bank and it's got infrastructure
connections to Israel which essentially
break up the Palestinian territories
that plan as far as we know George
Bush's vision as he calls it as far as
we know anything about it is simply it
is a kind of program which is called a
bantha stone ization program in israel
for good reasons would you say that word
again
Bantu Stan ization I mean it stands for
that reference to the South African
programs of the early 1960s of setting
up black homelands which were called
Panthers dens
transguy was the first there were
several others they were never
recognized by anyone but their idea was
to set up black states under black
leadership surrounded by white areas and
it was one of the most grotesque efforts
of the apartheid regime and its worst
period that's been regarded as a model
by Israeli planners pretty openly and
it's discussed in those terms criticized
in those terms usually but it's not
unreasonable I mean it's a canonization
program setting up Canton's which have
some connection but not much and are
basically unviable
is that an effort to neutralize the Arab
world I think your suspicion is correct
but it's certainly not going to work if
it's anything like that program
as for Iran being the next step it's
certainly being set up weather and
there's unfortunately the United States
is creating a self-fulfilling prophecy I
mean it's very likely that the war in
Iraq will inspire Iran to develop
weapons of mass destruction in fact
that's been predicted by intelligence
agencies and analysts all over the world
including the United States that this
plan the national security strategy the
plan to crush by force any potential
challenge to u.s. domination is
virtually demanding that potential
adversaries create some kind of a
deterrent and the only kind of a
deterrent they have to a state with
overwhelming power is either terror
which is a deterrent or weapons of mass
destruction or as in the case of North
Korea massed artillery aimed at the soul
and at American forces there which are a
deterrent to attack on North Korea but
you know when you when you announce your
intention to rule the world by force and
to crush any potential challenge you're
virtually you know demanding that
potential adversaries do something about
it and Iran might move on to develop
weapons of mass destruction which will
then be used as a pretext for an attack
however I personally don't think there's
going to be an attack on Iran the reason
is that Iran is not like Iraq Iraq was
defenseless completely defenseless and
that was known and that was a
prerequisite for an invasion Iran is not
defenseless I mean it doesn't begin to
compare with the United States and power
but it's not defenseless in the sense
that Iraq was and for that reason I
suspect an attack is not likely on the
other hand subversion is not at all
unlikely and according to some American
academic specialists who have written on
the topic
there have been effort there are
underway efforts to stir up subversive
activities and it was stimulating Iran's
a complicated country stimulating some
nationalist elements like Azeri
in the north to build up breakaway
movements it's reported I can't verify
it by academic specialists that good
part of the israeli air force over 10%
is permanently stationed in eastern
turkey presumably at american bases
there and is flying regular
reconnaissance over at the iranian
border probably either for surveillance
or intimidation whether this is
happening or not I don't know it's
reported from credible sources and I
think something like that is considered
is much more likely than a direct attack
but and this is contrary to the wishes
of the countries of the region and the
countries of the world who have been
trying correctly to support reformist
tendencies in Iran
these efforts undermine them and to
step-by-step integrate Iran back into
the international system on healthy
terms there are strong reformist
tendencies they fight they have plenty
of barriers but they should be supported
not undermine so that what you described
could be the planning we don't know you
know we don't have we don't have access
to internal plans but what is the
information available suggests something
like that as to Israel and a double
standard I don't quite agree I as I
mentioned I'd be just as strong just as
strongly opposed to the so-called
Islamic Republic's of which there are a
number which are not states of their
citizens but but are dedicated in
principle to Islamic rule and some like
Saudi Arabia are horrendous it's one of
the reasons whether then strongly
opposed to us strong us support for
repressive and brutal states like Saudi
Arabia for many years when Eisenhower
and his staff were talking about the
campaign of hatred back in 1958 this was
they were referring to us support for
states like that oppressive states that
have all sorts of horrible legislation
including what you mentioned and should
and are opposed to democracy and
development in the u.s. shouldn't be
supporting it's part of the reason for
opposition the US policies throughout
the region so I don't agree that that's
a double standard the first question is
a complicated one what kind of a country
is this well you know that's for its
people that decide the take say the
existence of corporations that's a major
part of our society we're a largely
corporate run society where did
corporations come from none of
corporations we're not corporations were
given the rights of persons about a
century ago by courts and lawyers not by
legislation that's a sharp blow against
the classical liberal principles that
the country was established not I mean
Adam Smith or James Madison would have
turned over in their grave at the idea
that an abstract entity like a
corporation is given rights of persons
persons of flesh and blood like freedom
of speech and freedom of search and
seizure and so on these are the legal
these are collectivist legal fictions as
they're sometimes described in the legal
literature
they're basically tyrannies controlled
from top to bottom now they they there's
the idea that they should have rights of
persons from a classical liberal point
of view the view of the founding fathers
it's just outlandish they now have
rights far beyond persons so the recent
trade agreements so-called trade
agreements that really trade agreements
they grant corporations rights that go
far beyond persons of flesh and blood
General Motors for example can go to
Mexico and demand national treatment
meaning to be treated like a Mexican
business but a Mexican of flesh and
blood can't go to New York or San
Francisco and demand national treatment
you wouldn't get very far this is a
complete reversal on a sharp attack
against the liberal principles the
capitalist principles on which the
country was founded what about the
political system the political system is
really what political science is
sometimes called a polyarchy not a
democracy that is a system of elite
decision and public gratification that's
what go back earlier in the discussion
that's what people like Lippmann Bernays
and others were talking about and has
good constitutional sources if you look
at the debate and James Madison it was
the main framer of the Constitution his
view explicit and the discussions of the
Constitutional Convention is that power
as he put it should be in the hands of
the wealth of the nation the more
capable set of men the people who have
sympathy with the rights of property
meaning property owners and he argued
strongly against democracy he gave the
model of England which is of course what
they were thinking about he said in
England if the population really had the
vote the majority of the population
would vote for a better distribution of
the wealth of the society at that time
that meant land in other words the they
would vote for what nowadays we would
call agrarian reform to give keep break
up the concentration of land and give it
to people who needed it and Madison
concluded that's intolerable we can't
accept them so therefore we can't accept
the system in which the population will
in fact have a direct say in
social and economic policy and affairs
of state the population should be
fragmented and power should be in the
hands of the wealthy who basically are
concerned with property rights well
that's not the position of the
population of the United States and over
the centuries there have been many
struggles about this it's a large part
of American history is struggles about
these issues what the country is founded
on and what it should be should be the
matter for the people to decide you
pointed out the questioner correctly
that it's the the population seems I
think the word you use was disinterested
I don't really believe that I think the
population feels helpless they feel
there's not much I can do about it
in fact attitude studies show that the
there's a measure called helplessness
can we do anything about what's
happening now that's been going up in
recent years I think it reached its peak
the last time it was studied about the
year 2000 and people do feel helpless
they feel that the government is not
doing anything for them so for example
in the last presidential elections 2000
right before the election so no Florida
shenanigans and so on about 75% of the
population didn't take the election very
seriously regarded it as some kind of
game involving rich contributors and
party bosses and the public relations
industry which crafts candidates to say
things that maybe will pick up votes but
that don't let you know where they stand
on issues issue identification was
extremely low in the 2000 election most
people couldn't tell where the
candidates stood on most issues and it's
not because they're stupid or
incompetent that's because the election
is crafted that way yeah you're supposed
to vote on what are called qualities not
issues part of the reason for that is
that on major issues popular opinion and
they lead opinion happened to be sharply
divided and those issues just don't come
up in elections and I think at some
level the population much of the
population is quite aware of this and is
I don't think it's lack of interest I
think it's a feeling of lack of ability
to do much about it but that is exactly
but if we want to improve the situation
in the country and I think we should you
know that's the opportunity for
activists organizers people who want to
empower people and enable them to do
things and it certainly can be done we
do have a legacy of freedom it hasn't
been a gift it's the result of struggle
it was one we can use that legacy of
freedom if we like or we can abandon it
but those are choices for noam chomsky
farmington michigan thank you for the
opportunity i think you answered the
part of my question regarding Iran and I
had a follow-up with Bush administration
increasing the rhetoric and being the
drama war against Iran I wanted to know
your opinion on US policy on Iran and
what can we run do to confront in one
hand oppressive regime at home and in
another hand the possible US invasion of
Iran Thanks yeah that's under the the
situation in Iran is extremely difficult
within Iran the it's pretty clear that
substantial majority of the population
wants to pursue the reform measures
which will undermine the power of the a
clerical autocracy and the set up of the
country who makes that hard legislation
can be passed a reformist legislation
but then it has to be ratified
by the clerical authorities and of
course they always turn it down so they
veto all the reforms legislation and
they've got force behind them they have
military force paramilitary and military
force so the population is facing a
difficult internal situation now that
situation we can help the reformist
movements or we can hinder them
we're hindering them by threatening
invasion that simply gives credibility
to a more authoritarian and harsh and
brutal elements the country is under
threat of attack that's you know that's
what's going to happen we see it right
here the way the Bush administration has
used the threat of terror which is real
to impose authoritarian measures and to
control the population in ways which are
unacceptable and the same is happening
in Iran of course efforts from the
outside to help the two through
diplomacy through commercial relations
through trade and so on to integrate
Iran into the region in the world that
can only that's the best thing we can do
to help the the progressive reformist
elements in ever had which do want to
turn it into a more free and democratic
society we can't solve the problems for
them but we can improve the conditions
under which they can deal with their own
problems and it's not gonna be easy for
them they're facing harsh internal
constraints not an hour to go on
in-depth with Noam Chomsky's Spokane
Washington hello hello German on first
dr. Chomsky I would like to thank you so
much for elucidating all the problems of
political arenas around the world I mean
in contrary to a speech you gave one one
denied I saw a community center I'm an
international affairs student and
economics major and I'm a senior and so
there are a lot of international friends
made just said I very much as we're
sitting in your opinions early on in
a gentleman called from the military and
and he stated on don't you feel that the
country should protect its population
and his waters as well as its economy
and we said yes over monitor speeches
for that sounds in the background well
the speeches are given I am a little
curious one in stating that yes you feel
that a country's economy should be
protected you are inherently stating
that yes
we should send the military to enforce
the rules of a corporation and the
corporation of course now and
unfortunately in this country being seen
as an empty actually having as you said
more rights than an individual you are
saying that it's okay alright yeah well
in that case I was speaking not very
clearly I understood the question to
mean should we protect it does a country
have a right to protect itself from
attack okay so if someone attacks from
abroad to say you know destroy American
agriculture and Industry do we does the
country have a right to defend itself
yeah I think it does but you're maybe I
spoke badly but you're interpreting what
I said as meaning do we have a right to
send the military abroad to enforce the
domination of us-based corporations no
of course that's not defending the
economy in the sense that I had in mind
so I think I'm an agreement with your
point if I understand that some more
books some of the 98 books you've
published in your life here's Noam
Chomsky pirates and emperors old and new
international terrorism in the real
world new edition what year was this
originally put out the first one which
was just pirates and emperors was 1986
right in the middle of the reagan-bush
war on terror as they called it remember
that the war on terror was read Eclair
done September 11th not declared first
one was twenty years earlier and it was
just reissued with new essays bringing
it up to date since 1986 here's another
one
foreword by Edward Sayid fateful
triangle updated edition
the United States Israel and the
Palestinians now that was written in
1983 right after the Israeli invasion of
Lebanon and I was updated in 1999 with a
number of essays and articles about the
intervening period there's a little
younger Noam Chomsky understanding power
the indispensable Chomsky what year did
this come out that was I was really
surprised that I didn't know that that
material existed it's mostly from
transcripts of lengthy discussions and
either interchanges if I recall from
about 10 years ago actually this
particular version is 2002 what was
published there yeah but I think most of
the material in it is from the earlier
period the two editors that Peter
Mitchell and John shrift all did a
fantastic job of how they did it of
finding the discussion and transcripts
material putting them together they also
put on the put on the internet there are
no footnotes in the book they put the
footnotes on the internet and they it's
really their footnote they have
elaborate sources backgrounds extensive
material it's a terrific reference I you
said what
Norton Virginia go ahead please consider
it a great honor to be able to speak
with dr. Johnston I'm so impressed by
what I've just heard that I have a
difficult formulating my question what I
wanted to ask about is in his capacity
as a linguist does he think do you think
dr. Chomsky that a lot of the repression
and abuses of power that we're seeing
going on and terrorism included his fear
of Goddess energy and do you know that
goddess or the female goddess energy God
isn't it oh I see
in regard to the guy a high positive
yeah well first of all as a linguist
that actually nothing to say about this
there's no professional special
knowledge that bears on your question
tell you the honest truth I don't really
have any say about it I've interested in
knowing what you think not there since
we had obviously thought about it go
ahead and landing on there I appreciate
it thank you c-span
mr. Chomsky thank you for being on the
show and doing your best to be a great
American what what the founders were in
Hayek's words and constitutional
liberties what Hayek thought he was was
an old Whig as opposed to the modified
Whig that showed up in 1830s which was a
part of the manufacturing of a new sense
of what we were but in your book about
rethinking Camelot I to be a patriot
rather than a court dissident I think
you have to look to the actual documents
the proof of the senior Bush complicity
in the CIA's assassination of President
Kennedy and to suggest that there was no
change when we went back to Federal
Reserve notes from Kennedy's us notes as
well as the 58,000 who subsequently died
in the Roman colony of Indochina trying
to preserve the interests of the 5%
Catholics who owned 95 percent of wealth
is denying a thread in the tapestry of
history that the Jews and the Gentiles
had founded this country knew about that
was embodied in Jefferson's letter to
Samuel Kercheval identifying the real
Antichrist as this engine for enslaving
mankind which is exactly who the
corporations that you apparently rail
against now represent around the world I
mean this is the oil industry is Roman
Catholic Cheney and Rockefeller merely
their hired help and the Bush family
funded Hitler that's a put him on the
front of Time Magazine's Man of the Year
and you I understand your reticence to
speak to the facts but when we know we
can send up a human crying go after Bush
for his complicity by the FBI documents
kitchens document of November 22nd 1963
which you can get new Hoover's document
which Bush denies but
places in the CIA a week later as well
as the court case hunt versus Liberty
Lobby that the jury determined the CIA
in fact committed the crime I think a
person of your stature has an obligation
to the country particularly your age
none of us got here alive to call a
spade a spade and say what's true if
we're gonna be a righteous land and the
land that all of our ancestors believe
this country should be well I agree we
should call a spade a spade and say what
we think is true in the book most of
what you talked about I don't know
anything about it won't comment on but
the specific thing that you did raised
my book rethinking Camelot I wrote it
because there had just been the the
State Department had just released
extensive documentation about the early
1960s a period which I'm very much
interested in in connection with Vietnam
it supplemented the mass of information
that was already available from the
Pentagon Papers and many other sources
when the Pentagon Papers came out that
was an unusually rich source because
that was not declassified material it
was material that was not intended to
reach the public so it's kind of like
capturing some countries archives so
that was unusually rich material I would
was involved in in at some extent and
the wrote about it right away that's
this book for reasons of state that was
mentioned is mostly about the Pentagon
Papers the new book every thinking
Camelot was about this included the
subsequent documentation in my view I'm
telling calling a spade a spade the way
I see it the documentation which is
unusually rich that demonstrates as
close to conclusively as he can come in
matters of history which is always
uncertain but demonstrates very
persuasively that John F Kennedy was a
hawk on Vietnam he wanted to get the
troops out but so did everyone but only
after victory he made that very clear
and explicit there is no indication in
the documentary record that I can find
that he had any intention other than
that and there is furthermore no
indication of any significant change
after the assassination the policy
continued on course same people
directing it as under the Kennedy as
under Kennedy pretty much the same
people pursuing the same programs as
conditions changed their tactics changed
but there's no reason that I know of to
believe that he would have done any
differently and the same on other issues
I'm the assassination was a crime and an
atrocity but the idea that there was any
kind of high-level conspiracy behind it
seems to me extremely unlikely on the
basis of any evidence I can discover and
I've looked pretty hard Mount Laurel New
Jersey good afternoon it's a pleasure to
talk to you professor Chomsky I agree
with most of what you've said in the
past and in this program as well I have
three observations to make that I've
collected over the last few months
particularly after watching the media
circus with regard the Iraq war and what
happened unfortunately after the 9-1-1
incidents firstly my general feeling is
that more and more Americans are being
deluded into thinking that they're our
saviors of the world democracy you know
it's a feeling it's a prevalent feeling
which is propagated by the media as you
said before it's just like how Britain
used to say for India you know there's
like we are the people we are giving the
right kind of things to these people
these poor people living in their misery
and in the Superstition we are the ones
who are like teaching in the art of
survival in this new civilized world you
know it's like that kind of an attitude
the second thing is one would probably
think that after the nine one one after
the grievous misfortune which happened
there would be some humility and some
understanding and some feeling among the
public to understand the causes of what
why these things have happened
and you know they also try to understand
the sheer feeling of indignity which is
felt by people from different parts of
the world but unfortunately the public
is becoming more and more paranoid and
deeply mistrustful of people from other
races within their own country because
of what happened in nine-one-one and the
third thing is that as far as people
like you are concerned you are one of
the few people with the voice of reason
which appear from time to time in
different media to undo the propaganda
by the
mainstream media but several times such
voices like yours are hijacked by other
people like radicals or rock stars or
movie stars and things like that so it
all seems to undermine the credibility
of the cause that we are trying to
portray before America there's what is
right there should people really be
thinking you know well those are and
good questions they can each take one
hour's discussion the on the first
Americans being deluded by the media we
have just seen a spectacular example of
that the which has been discussed around
the world I should say on September the
campaign began about you know the from
beat of war about invading Iraq and at
the same time the gut there was a
massive government media propaganda
assault charging or at least insinuating
that Iraq was an imminent threat to the
security of the United States and even
that that Saddam Hussein was involved in
al-qaeda style terrorism that he was
behind there may be involved in 9/11 and
planning future atrocities that's been
and that had an effect I've checked the
polls very quickly majority the
population did come to believe that Iraq
is a direct threat to us security the
u.s. was alone in the world in believing
that Saddam Hussein was a threat
I mean he's hated all over the place and
rightly but not regarded as dangerous so
the countries that he invaded Iran and
queit you know despised him happy to see
him drawn and quartered but they didn't
fear him I mean they know perfectly well
that Iraq was the weakest state in the
region it had been virtually disarmed
its military expenditures were about a
third of quoits which is ten percent of
its population in fact they had been
moving to try to reintegrate Iraq into
the general regional system though the
despise Saddam it's only in the United
States
that people thought he was a threat to
their security and that was government
media propaganda the connection was with
of with terror was completely fabricated
and it was so effective that in Bush's
Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier speech
he was able to say without fear of
ridicule that the victory in Iraq was a
victory in the war on terror I was quite
the contrary if anything it increased
the threat of terror by increasing
recruitment for terrorist groups as
predicted by the intelligence agencies
again that's spectacular propaganda as
can the connection with 9/11 is so such
a fantasy that it's hard to discuss you
will find that Intelligence Agency or
serious strategic analysts in the world
that gives any credibility to that but
over the months from the beginning of
the propaganda campaign a large part of
the population by now probably a
majority actually came to believe it so
yeah there's plenty of delusion your
point about Britain and India is very
pertinent I suspect you're Indian and
it's it's pretty much and the u.s. is
not inventing this it's following
closely the model of other and Furio
powers so when a Britain crushed India
India was one of the major commercial
industrial centres of the world back in
the 18th century after two centuries of
British rule that had become an
impoverished mostly agricultural society
the it wasn't until after Britain was
expelled that in the renewed its course
of development and indeed after Britain
was expelled that there were no more
famines up through the whole British
period there were massive famines but
Britain did disregard itself and in fact
many British still regard themselves as
benefactors civilize errs who were going
to India to
you know help the Nate the poor natives
buy some of the leading British
intellectuals very you know some of the
most honorable people in modern
intellectual history people like John
Stuart Mill wrote the most outrageous
nonsense about British benevolence in
India and how it had was there to save
the barbarians and so on and so forth so
you know the under the Continental
powers if you take a look or even worse
so yes this is an old story and the u.s.
is following a very familiar but
extremely ugly path and in this kind of
self delusion as the as for the feeling
among the public after 9/11 it's very
hard to judge public sentiment so at
least my impression is different from
yours it seems to me that 9/11 was a
kind of a wake-up call for a lot of
people the United States is a very
insular society
