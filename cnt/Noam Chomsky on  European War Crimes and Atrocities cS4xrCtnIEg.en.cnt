I was thrown a diamond reporting on the
many questions raised by Noam Chomsky in
his life's work but we got a chance to
address some of the issues raised there
with Chomsky himself he's in Ireland as
the guest of honesty international this
morning we sat down with him for the
only television interview of his visit
your visit comes at a time when there's
great debate in Ireland about our role
in the war in Iraq the situation there
right now
last night you were asked about the
Irish government's decision to allow us
planes and forces to stop at Shannon you
said if this is true this is
participation of what Nuremberg called
the supreme international crime are you
saying that the Irish government are
guilty of war crimes well if I quoted at
the Nuremberg trial justice Jackson the
chief counsel who was very eloquent
about the fact that the crimes we are
now - which for which we are now
sentencing the present accused our
general crimes if we are ever guilty of
them we must be subjected to the same
judgment and he was very clear and
properly eloquent about that it's not
that far from the next step which is
that Bertier heard on that basis is a
war criminal it's for you to decide if
you participial this was her opinion
well my opinion is that of the Nuremberg
Tribunal that invasion of another
country is in their words the supreme
international crime which encompasses
within it all of the evil that follows
my question is if a person house those
forces to travel through our country our
jurisdiction that relative participation
you have to decide to what extent
participations that make the person the
tisha to approve that decision for war
criminal
ask yourself the same question take the
time when the Russians were invading
Afghanistan your conclusion knowing what
you know at this stage just consider the
analogy suppose the Russians went take
the 80s when the Russians were invading
Afghanistan geography isn't right but
suppose that they had been sending their
military forces through Shannon not to
land there and then go on to invade
Afghanistan would that have been
participation in the invasion of
Afghanistan do you think you can make
the conclusion yourself can you tell us
what you think is
right I mean it's not even my conclusion
it's just like two and two equals four
or as the artisan is a welcomed it well
what is exactly a war criminal is an
open question well as well as it is
participation in a in a major crime you
Nuremberg obviously this definition
given there but the Irish government
quote the UN resolution passed again
last November which says that all
countries should support the Iraqi
people in their pursuit of peace
stability security democracy China
prosperity and say the use of China by
the u.s. is part of that effort well
that's up to the Iraqi people of whom
the vast majority want the occupation
forces to leave the British defense
ministry just carried out a poll which
is was leaked to the British press which
found the 82 percent want the occupation
forces you'd leave immediately or as
soon as governments formed the one
percent think that they're improving
security the government has to look to
international law there's this UN
resolution has nothing about the
legitimacy of the war it said exactly
what you said it's as much my ordinary
but Seaforth stability peace security
democracy and prosperity and security
peace democracy and prosperity doesn't
mean fighting the war
it means observing the will of the
victims first the issue here is whether
or not the Irish government is right to
allow US troops going we're assuming to
try and create security that's what
you're assuming but that's like saying
the Russians were trying to secure
security and and peace in Afghanistan
which indeed they were but that didn't
mean that one should have better
workaround can I ask about this issue of
rendition which is the transport of
prisoners as part of a secret network
within the war on terror but the
Americans the are many flight scores of
flights of London and Irish airports
which were linked to this rendition
program or one way or the other the
American government says emphatically no
prisoners were harmed those flights it
would be an amazingly open egregious lie
from one ally to another wouldn't it if
they were actually transporting
do you think they're capable above lie I
mean this is there any question of it of
course governments lie all the time
this government has lied repeatedly and
continues to and it really doesn't
matter whether there are prisoners on it
suppose the planes are refueled at
Chanin and then carry prisoners for
what's called rendition rendition is
just a fancy word which means torture
okay so suppose that planes are landing
being refueled then being sent on to the
to abet torture well then the right
people have to ask themselves do we want
to participate in torture did the only
moral course now is to stop these planes
even landing each other look plant
anything involved in rendition is such a
grotesque crime the even touching it at
a distance is shameful you could come
away from your work reading it and say
to yourself there is no other source of
suffering and evil in the world but the
government of the United States
no one couldn't come away with that
because what I constantly say is exactly
what I said here the United States is
acting in the way power systems act now
there have been many others in history
the United States happens to be in a
unique position of overwhelming power
and it acts the way other powerful
states do but you have great words for
the US and many people would agree with
you but when you trace a line on the map
let's say from North Korea to China to
Burma to Iran to Syria to Zimbabwe you
don't have a lot of withering words for
the people there in those countries that
are denying the human rights oh there's
a euro for example just take my dealings
with them just international they
include for example giving a televised
interview in London about prisoners in
Syria I've condemned crimes in Algeria
especially Frances involvement in them
currently and in fact they're throughout
the world in fact I was so hated by the
Kremlin that they literally killed my
entire professional field I wasn't
allowed in Eastern Europe but my entire
professional field was killed for about
30 years because of its association with
me they
know who their enemies are now here
people pretend they know is there ever a
value or a case or a situation that
requires military intervention by one
country in the affairs of another yes
there are there are mechanisms for it
the United Nations Charter provides
mechanisms for it there is a quote I
read from 1999 where it seems you say
that a standard argument is that we have
to do something we could not stand by as
atrocities continue that's never true
one choice always is to follow the
Hippocratic principle first do no harm
if you can think of no way to adhere to
that principle then do nothing
well that's trivial I mean just as it is
for a doctor if it which is what it was
for if the only thing you can think of
is harming the patient then you do
nothing but let's take a case on a very
distressing case in Rwanda people knew
that there was about to be a massacre it
was in progress Hutu militia had
murdered 800,000 people do nothing
because there certainly would have been
a militant event of Haji Baba follow the
logic of it if if intervening in Rwanda
would have caused harm then it's better
not to do it if intervening in Rwanda
would have been helpful then yes you do
it but it's just trivial if you do not
anything there would have been to be
many people killed to save the greater
good but the question is the balance of
effect same with a doctor if a doctor
gives you an inoculation it's going to
hurt okay but that's not what they have
it Hippocratic oath doesn't say don't
give an inoculation
it says if what you're going to do is
going to cause harm more harm than good
then don't do it that's the crucial
thing more harm but that's exactly what
the epic ratico thism exactly what I
quoted if the only thing you can think
of doing is making things worse then
don't do it so essentially what you're
saying is that sometimes the morally
reprehensible wrong thing is not to
intervene militarily sometimes if
military intervention would be
beneficial yes of course
and it was in the case of Rwanda it's
not clear that military intervention was
needed a small military force might very
well
prevented these events incidentally we
like to look at it in 1994 but I was
writing about that in 1979 there's an
issue in Kosovo very interesting that's
amazing and trusting this man ski but
that because the conventional wisdom is
that there was in prospect developing
possibly genocide certainly ethnic
cleansing certainly atrocities certainly
massacres happening the NATO bombed and
the Serbs stopped their campaign against
the other you say your crimes only
happened after re you're you're right
you're right that is the conventional
story and as a total fabrication
we have immense evidence about this two
huge State Department compilations of
documents trying to justify the bombing
a British parliamentary inquiry which
went into a reprisal I don't say but I
don't say they say the overwhelming
evidence documentation up to the sky all
says the same thing and you say that's
the fact well since that's the entire
Western documentation it's not the what
Qatar wasn't presentation for example
the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe went back did a
verification of what actually happened
its conclusion was that the Serb
campaign against a albania's was a well
rehearsed strategy there intend to apply
mass killing as an instrument of terror
coercion or punishment against kosovo
albanians was already in evidence in
1998 the year before the bomb they
didn't say that what they said is they
had more sorry they had they said they
had contingency plans to carry out
atrocities if they were under attack if
you look at the newspapers from the time
clearly people like Mary Robinson who
was our four hours president or saying
there were massacres there needed to be
an investigation there needed to be
action this was before it already what
we know what she was saying what she was
saying and we have the OSCE record
entire record thick record what it says
is Kosovo is an ugly place there were
lots of those evidence of killing in
progress on of a campaign I'll tell you
how much there was from the British
government the American government the
see the kayvyun that monitors and so on
they said in the preceding year there
were about 2,000 people killed according
to the British government
most of them killed by KLA guerrillas
there were no changes up until the
withdrawal of the monitors by the West
then came the bombing the bombing led to
massive atrocities which were
anticipated but lastly can you use
certain examples there were statements
slightly overdrawn critics will say
purposely but not this one this way that
you tend sometimes to search for the
facts that suit your thesis if you don't
give an example I'll be glad to listen
well but in this case I just I don't
know because I don't let a mind-reader
but is that something that you feel you
do sometimes if I say so last night what
I said is here I'm saying a strong
statement purposely overdrawn because I
want you to challenge it to question it
what I'm saying now is not what I meant
but I made it clear that I'm slightly
over drawing this so that you will
challenge it and you'll find that it's
basically correct in this case I am
simply reviewing the conclusions of the
US State Department the British
parliamentary inquiry
the OSCE KVM monitors if you want the
details look at what I've written about
it goes all through is often a network
just like the overdraw no bill you're
mistaking last night I said once I am
now making a statement which is going to
be slightly overdrawn because I want you
to challenge it so I'm asking you to
challenge if you challenge it you'll
find it's essentially correct and it's a
crucial conclusion I'm not saying that
in this case I'm saying I am precisely
reviewing the conclusions of the State
Department the British parliamentary
inquiry
the OSCE KDM monitors NATO all led to
the same conclusions your critics will
say that there is never any real
midpoint in the way you characterize
people places or issues that there's
always a villain or a hero there's
always a Democrat or a tyrant is there a
middle ground in world yes that's
exactly same that's exactly what I
thought
about all the time I mean people who
don't like to hear the facts and don't
like the conclusions have a reflexive
response you're always blaming America
you're doing this
that's just evasion of the fact that
some people say you know it's all black
and white this gray there's nuance in
the sense what I say all the time
yes everything's great the Russian
invasion of Afghanistan was great
anything the Japanese bombing of Pearl
Harbor was great everything's great but
nevertheless we draw conclusions and we
specifically ought to draw the
conclusions about ourselves when we're
involved in criminal acts even though
there are always shades of gray we
should face it not suppress it Kosovo's
case in point these days some difference
happened I mean last night for example
of people queuing to get into your
lecture your books fly off the shelves
in many ways dissent has entered the
mainstream very certainly in Western
Europe no quite the contrary
it's exactly like as in the United
States I mean if I get a talk in central
Illinois Idaho border or whatever it may
be the thousands of people will come
there will it be in the mainstream media
no there's still no danger of Noam
Chomsky becoming the mainstream I
wouldn't call it a danger I'd be happy
to be mainstreamed but the powerful
institutions that do not enjoy being
criticized
it's nothing surprising about that I
mean in the United States an Oregon
Western Europe a very high degree of
freedom has been one one not granted one
and that means that you're relatively
free from the kind of repression that
takes place in most of the world but you
are not going to be welcomed by those
whose power you're trying to undermine
finally there is a dangerous in there
that Noam Chomsky becomes almost what
they call a Rorschach test I think in
psychology whereby it means something
visceral to both sides of people that
your ideas get lost in this very loud
and very bitter debate about you know
quotes and and things do you ever fear
that possibly in that in I'm it just
happened in the last half hour when you
repeated what indeed had said that I had
never seen you say it's a gray
they always blame America and so on
those are natural defensive reactions on
the part of people who do not want to
hear the truth about themselves yes of
course that happens that was Noam
Chomsky speaking to us
