well maybe I can just give a taste to my
own personal experience i've been at MIT
where I still AM for 65 years when I got
here it was a very quiet passive campus
all white males well-dressed the
differential doing their homework and so
on it remained that way right through
the most of the 1960s through all the
campus turmoil there were some people
involved but not much there was faculty
peace and justice activity not much in
the part of students in fact the campus
was so passive that in 1968 when the
Johnson Lyndon Johnson administration
was beginning to try to try to slowly
pull out of the Vietnam War they had a
idea that they would sort of make peace
with the students so they decided to
send around the worst possible choice
the former Harvard dean George Bundy who
they thought would not know how to talk
to students and he would come to camp
this is we don't make friends and they
started off by picking very safe
campuses MIT was the second on the list
but they made a mistake turned out
they'd been a couple students had been
actively organizing on campus and when
Bundy showed up he was surrounded by
angry masses of students demanding that
he explain and justify the terrible
things he'd been involved in and that
essentially ended that effort by that
time literally a handful of students had
succeeded in substantially organizing
the campus on a whole variety of issues
that were very much alive the Vietnam
War racism
the beginnings of the women's movement
were just starting taking off then with
the pen in fact within a couple of years
MIT became probably the most active in
radical campus on in the country and it
without going to the details that had a
major change a major impact on the
culture of the community for the first
time that began to be serious discussion
of the questions of the ethical elements
in technological development all goes
right to the present in fact just a few
minutes ago I was on a reddit style
interchange with students on a whole
variety of questions they were bringing
up about both kinds of issues this would
have been utterly unthinkable back in
the early 1960s and similar things have
been happening on all campuses is that a
big effect it's changed the culture
strange the society others if you look
over the developments in recent years
there's been severe retrogression on
economic and political issues
considerable progress on cultural and
social issues so the class nature of the
society and its basic institutions have
not only not changed they've gotten
worse but in other specs there's been a
major changes and it matters attitudes
towards women's rights and other civil
rights opposition of aggression concern
of the environment those are all major
things that have changed and student
activism has been critical all the way
through and continue to be and there's a
reason for that not just here
historically students typically are at a
period of their lives when they're more
free than at any other time they're out
of parental control they're not yet
burdened by the needs of trying to put
food on the table in a
very repressive environment often and
they're free to explore to create to
invent to act and to organize and it's
been over and over through the years
student activism has been extremely
significant than initiating and
galvanizing major changes it's any
reason for that to change
