well you both sketched up a bad side of
history to such an extent that I would
imagine somebody early into a movement
coming in a midpoint into our movement
quite easily would feel dispirited
not only happy to fight to abolish
prisons but we have to fight to abolish
the Israeli occupation us it realism
with such an enormous past how have you
been able to sustain your commitment
through your political career maybe
Angela you could start you know so many
people that you have walked with have
transformed their views have given up
have shed a new skin maybe how does one
make the commitment fighting against
something that in the in the present and
near future appears to be so fast
the people I consider my community they
are persistent you know maybe some
people work in different ways than
before but I think one maintains a
commitment through constant inspiration
by what Mark did I say what I visited
Palestine last last year I was impressed
not only by the horrendous repression
but by the joy of the children and by a
commitment to continue the struggle for
freedom under the the most impossible
circumstances so and and I always say
that it's never been a question from
whether I would continue this work
because I don't know how
what about you you know given the
political classes filled with lunatics
and then whatever we seem to do do three
four million people give what march on
the streets against the war in iraq but
they're insane
you know they don't seem to even see us
why do we bother the war in iraq was bad
enough but it was nothing like the word
in south vietnam that didn't come close
on the kinds of things that John Kennedy
was doing they could even dream of doing
direct Kennedy was carrying out
saturation bombing he was driving people
into concentration camps ultimately
millions he was carrying out chemical
warfare to destroy the food and crops
and livestock and there was no purpose
in fact nobody even knew that you know
he tried a match to have I did give
talks about it but they were talks and
somebody living room there maybe in a
church with three people
notice care when the erect work came
along was huge for this it's the first
Imperial invasion in history where there
was a massive protest before it was even
officially launched which it was
underway but but before was officially
launched it was huge purpose and that
very much restricted what was done bad
nothing but would have been a lot of
work and that's an improvement
and in fact in my view of ins are the
kind of minority viewing of the US
actually won the war in Vietnam in terms
of its major goals to discuss it if you
want but in Iraq was a flat-out defeat
the war aims were completely none of
them were met
they were finally stated it toward the
end when it became obvious with the
scale of defeat was and you can see
right now on what's going on well okay
that's the change and in fact that's
what I can like unity it does look them
now as if there's a huge number of
problems to face to just go back a few
years there were all these problems plus
a lot more
I'm unless been achieved over the past
eight the period we're talking about
50 years that plenty of the problems are
gone there new ones coming up the deal
with crime but I think the credit
partial effect that there is it's a line
of Martin Luther King's pointed out the
theme-park of history is long but it
bends towards justice building on what
you just said do you think it's the
effectiveness of the Iraqi resistance
the effectiveness of at least the you
know the people on the street in the
United States that is move the strategy
in Iran towards the strangulation the
secret strangulation of that country
rather than an open from Bartlett partly
that but there are other things that are
happening was we got to be ran the
illustrate very well how the imperial
system of control the domination works
regulars were sitting places like
cambridge madness so for example i don't
know how many you know probably not very
many and it's not your fault because
they do report but same depth with
regard to Iran that's regard
in the left in the United States that's
you know the greatest threat to world
peace if you listen to the last
presidential debate you know big topic
for its threat to world peace breast and
so on so that raises a couple questions
who thinks that turns out to be a
Western upset the world wouldn't think
that the Arab world doesn't think that
they regard the United States in
Israel's greatest
the sentence as a Western obsession a
second question that's interesting is
what exactly is the threat will we
actually have an authoritative answer
it's given by the Pentagon and US
intelligence the threat is deterrence
Iran might develop means to deter the
resort to force by the United States and
its clients thank you
and that's it teller if we want to if
you all in the world can't accept
deterrence but the third and most
interesting question is if you believe
there's a threat what can you do about
it
well one way is to torture the people of
Iran with aluminum and others and other
ways the pond is a simpler way move
towards establishing a nuclear weapons
free zone in the region okay that
happens to be supported by essentially
the entire world it's blocked by the
United States that just again a couple
weeks ago didn't get reported and if you
really fanatic it could find it there
was supposed to be a conference this
month in Finland to carry forward the
plans to move towards the nuclear
weapons-free zone
the Israel refused to attend Iran in
early November said it would attempt
within days President Obama canceled the
conference
so it's not going to take place well
that's a simple way to move towards
settling whatever problem England thinks
there is if there was a massive protest
massive popular movement it could have
taken place but there can't be a massive
popular movement nobody knows about okay
and here it's kind of amazing but the
intellectual classes in the West and the
media have been almost virtually a
hundred percent obedient in silencing
all of this you want to find it ever
about it but it's not easy now that's a
major achievement of domination control
you couldn't get that kind of obedience
in a totalitarian state and it's
voluntary you know nobody's being has a
gun to their head and then we think for
worse not to do it it's just
internalized you know you don't talk
about things like that if you went at a
good education you know all of us had
you know that you don't talk about
things like that it's just part of your
nature it's kind of like knowing that
they are taking away our jobs and there
are money in there so but it's nothing
to talk about
you know they went to Bahrain
she went to buddy do you want some kind
of milkshake or something like that in a
protest movement for democracy buddy but
you can ask you must face everything is
there is some frame where the wisdom you
suffer isin this pressure but what's
rarely understood is the issue is not
posturing its eastern Saudi Arabia
Eastern Saudi Arabia which is right next
to puckering is where most of the oil is
it's mostly she is and there's terror in
the west over the geographical
historical fact if you look at the
concentration the hydrocarbon reserves
it's right around the northern part of
the Persian Gulf its
eastern Saudi Arabia southern Iraq
southwestern Iran most mostly Shiite if
there was ever that Shiite Alliance it
would control a substantial part of the
world's a little well
you can't allow it and uprisings by red
hot rain that might flow rate across the
causeway in fact has gone across the
causeway where there's plenty of fun for
depression that's serious those are
major issues true democracy in Saudi
Arabia
you know voluntary silences come let's
talk about Gaza and Israel
I mean enter you in 1973 were at what
was it the world youth festival with
Yasser Arafat
then you went to the West Bank was it
not Gaza the West Bank a few years ago
two years ago you were in the West Bank
part of it is the fact that the
Palestinian cause has been there on a
map for a very long time
and you know we're only talking about
eleven million people you know there are
more people in my hometown
forty million then the Palestinians
around the world
so the question Balin is silencing I
wonder if you could share with us try to
help us understand why the United States
tails Israel or whatever their
relationship is why does the United
States to take this position that it
cannot humanize the Palestinian we
cannot humanize the open-air prison of
Gaza and at the same time we have to as
they say stand with our ally what is
this about do people often ask I'm at a
loss why is there this kind of so-called
I know what you call it tail wags the
dog dog likes it him it seems to me that
the point that none was making about the
voluntary
silence around Iran and other places
that business certainly applied to
Israel over the last decades I don't
think most people in this country
understand what is going on spoken about
the similarities for example between the
Jim Crow era of segregation and the
segregation that exists say the highways
on which only Israeli settlers can drive
in occupied Palestine when I've spoken
about this to black audiences many
people say well why didn't anyone ever
tell us about this because if we had
known we would have been drawn towards
the country solidarity yet that actually
helped to bolster the black freedom
movement in the 60s and 70s so I'm not
saying that it's only a question of a
lack of information but if the
information is not there
then how do you build a solid area to
movement and then of course there's the
issue of the
the Zionist lobby that literally forces
people into silence as I mentioned I
just came back from the world Social
Forum free Palestine
and as I understand it originally the
funding for that conference was supposed
to be four million dollars but it was
reduced to two hundred thousand dollars
so that vast numbers of people who had a
plan to attend and hummus plane tickets
especially from Palestine were not abie
to attend and this is in brazil right
this is the way this is working in
Brazil it was interesting night I spoke
in a small town in Brazil last week and
whatever it was
that our conference that took place on
Black Consciousness Day and Christmas
honors which is in my ear near from
Salvador and when I mentioned Israeli
Apartheid
people the most enthusiastic response
this is really interesting you know here
at this university very young University
five years old for a university based on
affirmative action it's what they call
the first black University in Brazil
because 80% of them of the students
there are black Kouga and they were most
excited about what is going on about
Palestine Solidarity and help us with
that how is it that a part of the world
where 11 million people roughly have
been dislocated from you know their
lands how is that becomes such a
touchstone that in various locations you
know there is this organic sense of
solidarity help us understand that on
the one side I agree it's a lack of
information about the specificity but
this has become a touchstone what is
that about
boys are so they are here whether you
wish is donor
probably the longest military occupation
at least in modern history
that's it's pretty brutal is just in
Gaza a couple of weeks ago in fact and
it's my pleasure
I mean it's so harsh through little
occupation everything that Israel is
doing it's doing because we live up to
the United States actually spars the
u.s. allows not an inch who are there
for the obvious reasons that are right
now for example is front pages are
talking about settlement programs in
what's called the e1 for every Israel's
been that's a very important so all the
settlements are totally illegal everyone
even the government the leading legal
authorities in Israel agree with this
course illegal it's in violation of
Geneva Conventions and violation of
explicit Security Council orders and
this is illegal to get but they want to
extend the settlement in a way which
will complete the bisection of the West
Bank
now these programs were developed
primarily at Clinton incidentally the
settlement of the mall that they mean
the settlement to the east every
American president up until Obama has
prevented them from settling the e1
corridor every single one they've been
morning sell it for 25 years every time
they try the American president
sorry you can't do this and when the
u.s. lays its foot down
that's does it work that's the way the
world works
Obama it's the first one that failed to
do it why is he filled with what we're
pushing him to you know why keep going
on the difference between now and a
couple of years ago here whose enormous
Amin up until a few years ago I'm having
many thoughts of right about this for 50
years up until a few years ago I
literally had that police protection
even in my own University just to give
it time but now it's the biggest issue
on campus if you daughter dances engaged
they can't get a hospital question well
that's what the u.s. is kind of off the
specs and legislation so they're
interesting I think they're pretty
comfortable that complex but one simple
question is how much just ask yourselves
how much do the Palestinians contribute
to us power and how much was Israel
contribute to us power okay
it's infinite if you don't contribute to
us power and standing right by the most
elementary principles of
in fact the postman is have a negative
negative right
not only do they have no wealth no power
no support the month will fade like the
oil dictators stayed on and so on
but there have a negative effect
sequence they stir up just leaves or
Brazil and even more so in the Arab
world what's looting the racist phrase
Arab Street you know we don't talk about
the what the Arab Street people there on
the Arab Street this is a big issue and
that can threaten the dictatorships that
the u.s. support so they have negative
right on em in Israel is a rich powerful
country it's it's got a very advanced
military system
frankly links to the United States very
tightly linked to the US like the drums
that are not that are part of us we have
that are Obama's global assassination
campaign but maybe the technology was
pioneered in Israel but if you read
WikiLeaks exposure one of them listed
places in the world that are of extreme
strategic significance
one of them is an industrial complex
very upset - the Raphael industrial
complex advanced military it's not only
their relations are so close that from
corporations actually moved its
management offices to the United space
we get closer to funding so there's
close links in military industry and
intelligence in just high-tech
investment not a big corporations like
Intel and the sphere and so on
under strategic significance which we go
into but there also other factors which
shouldn't be overlooked but there are
cultural factors which I think are
pretty significant it's not a big secret
the United States's throughout its
history it's been off the spectrum and
religious extremism you know like more
than half like sixty percent of
Republicans I think the world was
created a couple thousand years ago yes
time countries since any country of the
world
like this before but furthermore
Christian shamanism which is innately
phenomenon to to respect 184th Jewish
times respected written in the 19th
century the worked out how a declaration
fame was a Christian Zionist that
Woodrow Wilson at the Bible every day
the Bible says was done said that the
Jews have to go back to Kozma okay you
know high officials in the Roosevelt
administration who were saying that if
the Jews go back to Palestine it will be
the greatest event in world history on
top of that is a huge evangelical
population enormous do they have a
further story know if you know this
about others I won't go into it but it
requires the the Jews go back to
Palestine there's a huge war the war has
killed the you know the save souls right
that's tens of millions of people in the
United States
enormous there are big supporters of the
very strongly in Semitic with all the
Jews right go to hell too and there's
another factor which is never despair
they discussed what I think is quite
important you take a look at the
countries that are strongly supportive
of Israel the strongest ones are the
United States Canada in Australia what
these four countries have in common
their settler colonial society
you don't remove in society you
exterminate genetics and that must be a
good thing as we did it's not as not a
good thing we'll say it's kind of a kind
of thing difficulty so there's a natural
instinctive abstain because there's a
big conflict inside the labor
strategic issues that goes back to 1967
the US relations with Israel that's
currently was established and said
before that it wasn't anything like this
history but after what happened in 1967
is that Israel performed a great service
to the United States it's smashed
secular Arab nationalism and supported
extreme Islamic fundamentalist exactly
what happened Arabia the United States
Britain before it was the oil was there
being threatened to by secular
nationalism based in a strategic visuals
of that problem that's when that
everything changed
really important to bring some of these
issues into the prison evolutionary time
the prison abolitionist movement that I
know many of you are here this evening
in the supporting organizations like
critical resistance were planning for
the evolution of prison so so what
happens with me Radha that frame and we
think about Israel not only in relation
to the many of Prisons in which it homes
Palestinian political prisoners but also
in the use of the carceral technology
throughout the society evolutionist we
should also be opposed to open-air
prison visit West Bank would persuade
one that one is inside visit especially
near the wall
so what happens in this industrial
almost isolated from other Israel helped
to address that isolation and integrate
that one of the reasons why the u.s. is
able to support Israel with absolute
impunity is because there there are very
few of movements that will make
themselves visibly I've seen and heard
in solidarity with Palestine so what
would we do
the question of creating movements
because you know that's another problem
is that we always say we should make
mass movements and then people dedicate
their lives trying to build it and we
wait for the break please I mean
building a movement is borrowing like a
moon waiting for the breakthrough and
it's coming
and burrowed in moon we're going to get
a question from the Boston area youth
organizing project
like the Occupy general assembly
I think I'm gonna pivot a little to
basic questions of human decency so as
soon as they get which is actually a
very difficult thing for people to wrap
their heads around the question of human
decency how that we give link you know
in a passive state and yet believe that
we live with the American Dream you know
somehow we've lost the plot of human
decency
so question we're gonna jump to the
Pitons question real quick oh sorry
hello my father my name is Carla trio's
I'm a part of Austin area youth
organization project and my question is
my question is how do you see schools
resembling prisons and how do we
transport them
resembling prisons and how do you
transform them to a legend one of you
tell us how do you see schools
resembling prisons and how do you
transform them well they're all over
this country and poor communities
especially communities of color over the
last two decades schools have come
increasingly to resemble prisons with a
focus that is often much more on
discipline than on on learning in a
sense you can say that the schools that
so many of our young people attend our
finishing schools directing people to
juvenile facilities and then the
trajectory trajectory is school juvenile
facility adult prison and when we talk
about abolishing the prisons we can't
see that task as being in isolation from
all of the other related institutions if
we if we want to abolish prisons then we
and in a sense we're going to have to
abolish schools and the way they
currently reproduce
acknowledging drug and as as many of us
have said for such a long time if
schools were really doing their job that
is to say teaching young people how to
imagine the future and teaching kids how
to appreciate learning and not just for
what it can bring them in the future and
not just as a commodity not just for the
money that they would be able to make
when they get their degree but but but
but rather at four of the way in which
it never mother used to always say
education broadens your horizon and she
said that to me over and over and over
again and later I really understood what
she meant at the time because I was no
longer just satisfied with being living
in Birmingham Alabama and when I did a
lot of them a lot of things
what a lot of places but the point is
for kids who do not have the ability to
imagine themselves as adults and who
often think that they will die before
their 21st birthday the schools are
actually encouraging this they are
producing this I wouldn't exactly call
it nihilism but I would call it the
senses this this collective depression
and if we're going to abolish prisons we
definitely have to radically transform
you talked about busing that you almost
made it out to be like a project in
gender to their people
away from each other you know when you
mentioned the busing crisis in Boston
can you elaborate a little more not only
on the busing issue but on the
structural leap like it century early
21st century schooling and what's
happening to it the person was another
goodwill by nice people class-based
attitudes were so profound that I think
it's what they were doing but so take
Boston right here it's difficult what's
aggressive the busing system was
organized by a main liberal judges you
know Harbor trustees okay nice guy but
it was designed so that it simply
brought together poor communities in
urban Boston so yes black kids went from
Roxbury to South Boston the way around
within two to the affluent suburbs and
in the affluence over if they'd go into
the inner city and if they try to do
that that would have been such a you
know a political family didn't start the
end result was to antagonize the people
who were involved in the busing first of
all it was they didn't want and then to
be in our community and also because
they had seen if a rich guys on the
suburbs are free from this it couldn't
have made a worse proposal and I got it
all over the country nobody there's a
lot of spaces by the early through the
seventies of the busing programs which
were well-intentioned innocents were one
of the main factors in driving the white
working class part of the right but to
the point that they're now a Republican
base and oppressed Clinton's right as
far as the schools are concerned at
night I think it's somewhat more new
ones I think schools can be oppressive
and they can undermine independence and
creativity or they can be liberating and
sometimes it's both I think if you think
through your own experiences most of you
you look at the school experience which
is which are of both types there are
teachers who really work hard to inspire
independent thought creativity searching
for things and so on there are other
who force you into a bowl now they're
controlled by a supervisory system
teachers want to have limited
independence no matter how dedicated
they are for one thing this with this
the this is enormous disparities in
school funding so in the United States
the schools are funded mainly by
property taxes well you know wealth is
so segregated that if you're in the
affluent suburbs you get will funded
schools if you're in the inner-city you
get in funding schools and the best
teacher in the world from able to do
much if kids come to school you know not
have any breakfast than their fathers in
jail so on and so forth it's it already
starts in a way which the best teacher
in the world becomes very little but
also there are programs this is another
part of the backlash since the seventies
to reinstitute to institute a kind of a
disciplinary controlling system in the
schools so last decade it's been pull
the No Child Left Behind race to the top
whatever name that's given its teach to
test those of you who are teachers have
been through
that teach the tests is which guaranteed
money that nobody learns anything but
they're not interested in school
spirits just looking around I suspect
most of you have not three good schools
anyone who's made it to a good school
has an experience which you've had to
take and it's a man and something you
didn't share it all about I didn't know
didn't sure what happened but you you
know we're obedient types that so we got
to go to schools so we stayed things and
you know it will
a week later forgot about the subject
would that's the way it works but
teaching has and it also doubles
creativity and interest there's the kind
of thing that Angela was talking about
but it's even true saying the sciences
actually this interesting work on this a
lot of criticism from the scientific
organizations which American Association
for the Advancement of science about how
science teaching has been redesigned so
as to impose memorization of things that
people don't understand and to undermine
the search for discovery so you memorize
the periodic table you know the enzymes
that do something
and you don't understand the point of
doing it there are other programs and
this goes all the way from kindergarten
to graduate school which are quite the
opposite
so for example one of the programs which
recently discussed in the main science
journal was a kindergartner program that
were the children were given a dish and
the dish had items in it
pebbles shell sees a bunch of other
things and they had a text to figure out
which ones of the scenes first thing
they did is had what they call the
scientific conference the kids set
around try to figure out ways in which
you could determine what the seeds and
they had some suggestions that drive
them and other ones the teachers kind of
guiding you know but letting the kids
Explorer finally they figured out which
ones the seeds were did experiments
mature at that point each child was
given a microscope a magnifying glass
and that the teacher broke the seeds
open and they looked inside to see what
made it through that's exciting that's
where you learned why it's interesting
to understand something about the
village in relation to your critique of
bustling how would you have proposed
desegregating the school city everyone
children
good idea it was just implemented as bad
as possible I bring the kids from South
Coast in our collection we reproduce the
work of this retributive justice system
in our relations with one another
so there's that level then of course I
said that there there are very
interesting experiments that are
happening in schools for example around
transformative justice restorative
justice how do you teach children how to
resolve their conflicts by talking to
one another
my sister works with the organization
which is called restorative justice but
for you the experiences particularly
when they're dealing with elementary
schools that the children very quickly
get it they get it so quickly that touch
I was telling a story about this one kid
who was not back to the school because
he got into a fight somewhere in the
community and the kid says we can't find
it our school and we can't even find in
our community
but it's interesting to hear how the
children learned how to talk to one
another and how to resolve their
differences in circles so bringing other
people into the conversation rather than
assuming that the only way you can
resolve that is the fire so and I think
that we have to you know we have to
build on in all the important work
that's been done by reckon you know
truth and reconciliation of processes
yeah and to reflect on the way in which
we perpetuate those impulses in our
relations to one another the last
question is from the Roxbury
environmental empowerment project
initiative history in the Freedom Riders
activists with money initiative is from
the unit and it got the ended up being
mass movement is like that so I think
the advice that's
you're able to do and there's plenty of
I'm in the position environmental ring I
mean you know you're facing the worst
problem that the human species is
patients history literally that we are
now marching towards a precipice and
we're going to fall also and it would be
basically destruction of species it's
never happen in human history before and
we're marching right order
eyes open with the presidential
candidates that presented invades both
the Republican Party program didn't even
have anything to say anything about
syllable warming democratic party
program and a couple of the three those
presidential candidates were euphoric
about the fact that we can move towards
a hundred years of energy independence
by using more fossil fuels read the
Maine and Haley electoral newspapers New
York Times
big story on the melting of the Arctic
ice the first half of stories if we're
testes are going to come and so on
second half and story says fantastic
opportunity opens up the region for mine
really trying to stop our indigenous
relations there in the lead and the
countries were their majority of the
plurality actually at once the forest to
institute constitutional rights for
nature and insistence on Ecuador for
example they this program to try to get
funded by the rich countries to keep the
oil in the ground instead of growing
that way well you know unless we can get
the sensibility of First Nations or
indigenous people around for whether
they call themselves ability to possess
ten three young people you're the ones
that want to pay the price you're going
to see the world and which global
temperatures won over the people two
degrees centigrade this was the tipping
point and very close to my pillow very
soon that's going to be the world in
which you and your children on the limit
so you better do about
well I totally know historically the
other people have always been the ones
to give leadership to revolutionary
creative imaginative struggles and it
seems to me that the Dulles well I don't
know what I would use the term it does
because I think a lot of young people
are pretty adult
the older people who are the most
effective are the ones who understand
the importance of an egalitarian
intergenerational
you aren't marginalized as the youth you
know what I'm talking about the spark
without which movements cannot occur and
so like no I guess I could say we are
counting on you and we are counting on
you to lead us toward these medical
futures about which we know has became
out of the ceiling
thank you
thank you
