how do you explain the absence of that
American issues the electron brains in
the US well there's no general point
which subsumes this in fact it's
understood on what's called Super
Tuesday februari 5th today when there
are 20 20 diners take a look back at the
wall street journal from Super Tuesday
pivot table to the front page of the
Internet there's a big story in covering
half the front page where the headline
is something like this it says issues
received in 08 campaign voters prefer
character it will sort of true not
entirely but issues didn't receive
because they're ever there on type this
kind of a principle of American
electoral campaigns where you keep
issues to the side that's a good reason
for that we know that on major issues
domestic and international both
political parties are welded the right
of the population so therefore it's very
key issues out of the race so issues
didn't exactly proceed they never there
and we don't know that voters prefer
character what we know is that's what
party manager
PR representatives pretending yes my
choice for character are American voters
different kind of livings there they
seem to care about issues I think
position central that's the same with if
we were for the kinds of popular
organization and that made participation
process sale at Union the Latin America
is not an issue just like nothing else
isn't is Iran an issue is Iraq an injury
I mean it's not an issue because
innocent people mention it but the
candidates on all the futures are well
to the right of the population they have
to do research for cigarette next big
possible major comes complete with
endless atrocity Republic has opinions
by about 3 1 the public thinks that we
should drop all threats against arrest
and enter into diplomacy and normal
relations actually the public thinks the
same thing about Cuba polls the end
about three decades ago the large
majority of public thinks we would enter
in normal relations with Cuba one same
with Iran drop the threads enter into
normalization large majority
seventy-five percent sequence pie for
the Polaroids think that Iran should
have all the rights of any sign of the
non-proliferation treaty being nuclear
energy but not nuclear weapons okay we
read in the press here that Iran is
defying the world on uranium the bridge
one Santa fridge that's true the funny
sense of world it's the non-aligned
countries which are a large majority of
the world figures we support your ends
right to uranium enrichment that are not
part of the world the American
population supports but there are part
of the world either what's the world is
political elites in Washington that's
the world in parallel depend in fact
available candidates they insist on
maintaining threads and they insist that
dropping its number history rights as a
precondition for any further discussion
so they separate themselves from the
American people over the rest of the
world a large majority of the population
here in about 75% are in favor of
establishing at the glitter weapons free
zone in the Middle East including around
really forces deployed build so on
though probably very few people know
that that's the Iranian position for
several years they have been proposing
the nuclear weapons-free zone in the
Middle East well they have the support
of the large majority of Americans who
for that but the people are answering
those polls don't know anything that I'm
telling you unless they've carried out
an individual research project their
part is under the popular movement to be
and incidentally the US and Britain are
committed to that where they won't admit
when they tried to construct the thin
legal basis for the invasion of Iraq the
resort was to humans very Council
resolution 687 look up he wasn't written
claim that your act wasn't leading up to
it consistent that they eliminate
the mass destruction I'm done but
there's another particle of 687 which
says that have to establish a nuclear
weapons for his own in Middle East they
find a candidate saying intellectus
something conceal the candidates are so
far to the length of the population that
the issues can't even imagine well
thanks for lettin are the kinds of
developments in Latin America that
described as tank dimensions so yes
issues are out of the campaign and the
wall street journal is correct except
they said they receded they didn't
receive news over there and that's
pretty characteristic for American
relations candidates are sold they're
marketed quite public relations firms
protect the same firms that market
commodities and just as advertising is
designed to undermine markets it's also
designed to undermine democracy know
that and then take a course on economics
though a feature that markets are based
on informed consumers making rational
choices have you ever looked at
elevator and is it trying to create an
informed consumer making a rational
choice on the honor of comfort that's
trying to construct a poorly informed
uninformed consumers will make
irrational choices every hat is of the
same with candidates who sell a
candidate you don't want to inform
consumers making for collectors making
rational choices what you want is people
paying attention to what's growth
character qualities personalities a nice
guy not issues sort of dangerous I'm not
going around we have many insightful
questions from a very insightful
audience but i think we are running out
of time and I would like to thank you
very much for having guys here and have
been treating oh yeah good to see you
again you know so dramatic sorry
