while this may seem obvious because
you've touched on at a time and time
again why is it that the US media
appears to completely lap up the
propaganda while appearing to not do any
sort of objective journalism which is
what every single journalists student
has you know study to do what in the
world is going on well for one thing I
think I'm in the US media are just as
good as any others if I had one
newspaper in the world to read I
couldn't really I pick the New York
Times doesn't you know I don't love it
as you know and the reporters themselves
not so much in the case of Israel but in
many cases are courageous honest you
know they report what's before their
eyes objective if you like but very
typically consistently within a
framework of interpretation that's
subordinated to state corporate
propaganda it's unconscious and it's
true of the intellectual community
generally I mean I weathers are right
about the media is because easier to
study the New York Times systematically
then say to study academic scholarship
systematically that's a huge effort
beyond my resources but it's basically
the same you know there aren't many
differences and it's the same in the
general educated population we can be
there is an assumption that the u.s.
cannot do anything wrong it can make
mistakes but can't do anything wrong
individuals may do things wrong like
there may be a bad apple here and there
but we can't do anything wrong as a
people so it takes a the invasion of
Iraq Barack Obama is praised even by the
left for what's called his principled
opposition to the Iraq war what was his
principled opposition basically we can't
get away with it he says it was a
strategic blunder okay you go back to
Providence when the Russians were in
baiting Afghanistan there are plenty of
people saying it's a strategic blunder
we don't call that principled opposition
to the war after Stalingrad there were
plenty of Nazi generals who say look was
a strategic blunder open a two front war
are they principled opponents of the
Nazis I mean the very idea that this is
called principled opposition is a very
interesting insight into our own
intellectual and moral culture it's
totally unprincipled it's based on
nothing except cost to us and maybe
there's a couple of words about you know
I don't like civilian casualties but
it's very hard to find any principled
opposition in the culture in the
intellectual culture generally that's
also true of things that go way back
that they say take the vietnam war isn't
you know reams of material on that but
try to find a principal criticism of it
in the mainstream if you look at the
literature of say diplomatic history
today or anything that goes way back you
find two positions there the hawks who
say with more force we could have won
and they're the doves who say it was a
lost cause which was a mistake they take
take Arthur Schlesinger this leading
American historian Kennedy advisor one
of the most outspoken does it did become
his strong supporter of the war under
Kennedy to the extent that he paid any
attention to it at all effective paid
almost no attention to it even though
Kennedy did directly attack South
Vietnam and carried out many atrocities
but if you look in schlesinger's
journals which just appeared almost
day-to-day record of everything he did
there isn't even a mention of Vietnam
until the Johnson years there's a lot
about swimming pools and who jumped in
naked and that sort of thing but nothing
about Vietnam but by you know 1966-67 he
was like others becoming critical the
war and he wrote a book which is
considered one of the important
criticisms of the war it's called bitter
heritage it was very explicit yeah
hidden he described his controversy with
his friend Joseph alsip major journalist
it was a strong supporter of the war and
slesinger said something like this she
said we all pray that mr. Alsup is right
and that with more force you know the
surge of the day we will be able to win
victory in a land of wreck and ruin with
everything destroyed and so on and so
forth that's what we all pray but it
probably won't work and then he said if
mr. Alsup is right and we do win victory
in this devastated land we will all be
praising the wisdom and statesmanship of
the American government there wasn't
ironic he meant it you know and yes
that's the attitude of liberal does
that's why when US casualties decline in
Iraq you know people say well you know
maybe it really was a success okay
killed a million people drove millions
out of the country destroyed the society
left it as a total ruin ok but not too
many American casualties and the big
problem is they're not doing what we say
you know they're not all there is mass
nonviolent resistance in Iraq actually a
major triumph of nonviolent resistance
has compelled the invaders to back down
from there at least in words you know if
they live up to it from their major
goals okay but who describes things that
way you know where can you find a
principle criticism and this is not a
critique of the press because the press
are reflecting the educated culture
they're reflecting the mentality of
Harvard MIT
so on that's the culture from which they
come and I think v reporting is very
accurate in fact a large part of what
I've written is actually defense of the
press for its professionalism and
objectivity you may know the book that
Edward Herrmann and I wrote called
manufacturing consent it's about the
media there's a lot of condemnation of
the book but nobody looks at it that's
this material not allowed to look at
doesn't keep the party line but a large
part of it if anybody wants to look at
it is a detailed analysis of media
coverage after that of the Tet Offensive
Tet Offensive is crucially important
event and after the Tet Offensive
Freedom House you know great defender of
freedom published two thick volumes
denouncing the press for their lack of
patriotism because they didn't report
the Tet Offensive in a manner glorifying
the United States sufficiently you know
straight out of Stalinist Russia that's
freedom house two volumes one of
commentary one of documents and they
claimed the vitamin Terry you know
condemned the press for being on the
side of the Viet Cong and hating America
and all the usual stuff then there was
the volume of kind of documents that
supposed to back it up well you know I
carried out the heinous act of actually
reading the documents the volume of
documents completely refuted everything
that they said in the volume of
commentary line by line if you want
details look at the book we went through
it and we concluded that contrary to the
Freedom House Stalinist style attack the
press was very courageous competent
accurate people described what they said
but entirely within the framework of us
doctrine you know us propaganda so like
everything we're everything we're trying
to do is write a noble
but you know we just had to destroy half
the place because what the choice was
choice that we have but it described
accurately now it's interesting that the
media hated that defense of their
objectivity and professionalism that
would much rather be portrayed the way
Freedom House portrayed them and it's
Stalinist style attack as traitors you
know challenging Authority and so on and
so forth they like that what they don't
like is you're doing your job very
competently and courageously but you're
completely subservient to propaganda and
the party line nobody likes that so that
part of the book can't be read but yeah
I think it's generally true and I think
those are the reasons I mean there are
other reasons to like the media after
all our big corporations you know
selling a product audiences other
corporations that truly has an effect
and so on
