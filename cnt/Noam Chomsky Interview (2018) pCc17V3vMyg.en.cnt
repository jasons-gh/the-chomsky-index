professor Chomsky what is the fate of an
honest intellectual there's a history
goes back 2500 years back to the origins
of recorded history classical Greece the
biblical records so go back to Greece
there was a man who was accused of
corrupting the youth of Athens by asking
certain questions his fate was to be
killed with poison given the hemlock in
the biblical record which is partly
accurate partly not there were critical
intellectuals the word that's used for
them this prophets that's a dubious
translation of obscure Hebrew phrase
what it actually what they were if you
look at what they were saying
where was critics they criticized the
acts of the evil kings they gave
geopolitical analysis warned that the
policies were from lead to disaster
for help too it was north and so on and
that's what today we call dissident
intellectuals and what happened to them
they were imprisoned driven into the
desert to maligned the worst of the
kings they had condemned the prophet
Elijah as a hater of Israel because he
was condemning the actually evil kings
of the origin of the notion and America
and Israel and so on and it goes the
same way throughout history so going up
to modern times the term intellectual
and apparent sense is was really not
used before the late 19th century came
into use at the time of the Dreyfus
trial in France and the Dreyfus arts
animals all the others who supported
Dreyfus condemned in the state the
military they were critical
intellectuals they were bitter they
condemned
the mainstream of the intellectual
classes Zola himself had to flee France
for some for his life that's the
treatment of distantly after that came
the first world war was very striking
with a lot of commentary on it now it's
the same thinner it's a huge discussion
one of the most interesting thing is the
reaction of intellectuals on every side
the intellectual class is lined up
passionately in support of their own
state in Germany it was a manifesto of
93 leading intellectuals instructing the
civilized world that Germany was
defending great cultural legacy of
Goethe Beethoven and so on in the world
who joined the Western
there were critics there
Bertrand Russell in England Rosa
Luxemburg probably in Germany Eugene
Debs in the United States they were in
jail
that's intellectual what is the price
that you have personally paid as an
intellectual for criticizing the actions
of your own community the United States
is a pretty free society these days and
people with the degree of privilege are
not subject to it's not like Turkey
today were you thrown in jail if you say
something the president doesn't like
so it's vilification marginalization
pronunciation actually there were
penalties but they were self induced was
involved extensively in civil
disobedience and resistance came pretty
close to a long jail sentence but I
can't call that repression

first a handful of advisors then the
Marines finally an army of half a
million that was the Vietnam War it was
an undeclared war a war without
frontlines or clear and generous the
United States invaded South attack South
Vietnam
certainly no later than 1962 that's when
John F Kennedy sent the US Air Force to
start bombing South Vietnamese villages
authorized the use of napalm a sent
American forces into combat situations
and so on that's an invasion okay then
the invasion built up into a huge attack
on all of Indochina all right that's now
about 31 years I'm waiting to find some
Freight one phrase in the American press
one now and I asking for a lot one
phrase and a whole mainstream press that
refers to such an event as the US
invasion of South Vietnam I can't find
it what you find is uniformly the
American defense of South Vietnam may be
unwise against terrorists supported from
the outside word by word paraphrase of
what the edge of Europe open I know
people Norman Finkelstein
he he faced certain consequences he
wasn't able to get tenure in his
university and why was a special case
first but that was a rotten case for a
special one Norman Finkelstein exposed
the dishonesty the criminality of
Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz
who went berserk and tried any way he
could think of to destroy singles to the
point I go through the details but it
was their services jihad to try to
protect himself he knew that he could
not answer single stocks criticisms so
the waving picked was to try to
vilification denunciation massive
efforts to better
yes so that happened it's a rocking case
but it is I have no intention whatsoever
on getting involved in an ad hominem
debate with mr. Shue it Dershowitz I'm
interested in the facts I was asked to
come in and discuss his new book I went
home purchased one copy in fact I
purchased two copies I read the book
very carefully I did with what someone
serious does with a book I read the text
I went through the footnotes I went
through it very carefully and there's
only one conclusion one can reach having
read the book and this is a scholarly
judgment it's not an ad hominem attack
mr. dersh was has concocted a fraud in
fact mr. Dershowitz has concocted a
fraud which amazingly in large parts he
plagiarized from another fraud I found
that pretty shocking found shocking
coming from a Harvard professor I find
it shocking coming from any professor
premodern means not having similar
the basic values of the Enlightenment
that sense and that's a large part of
the Western world take the United States
leader of the free world the most
powerful state in human history
supposedly to begin freedom
Tech say global warming and one of the
maybe the major problem defendants have
ever faced that it's hard to convince
people in the United States it's a real
problem
reason the 40% of the population thinks
it can't be a problem 40% because Jesus
is coming in a few decades is that
prerunner no it's a culturally
conservative Society pre-modern and many
of its weighted their respect
take your it takes a Austria and Germany
two countries did she books on memories
from the nineteen thirties in Austria
and the UH Nazi Party is likely to take
the participants in Germany ultra-right
nationalist party with neo-fascist
tendencies is winning is defeating the
mainstream American Authority and local
elections is that pre-modern was not
Susan Fremont depends what you mean by
modern if you mean
but not having assimilated the
fundamental values that were brought
forth during the Enlightenment and since
much of the world is premotor in fact
take a phenomenon this it's taking place
right at this moment there's a
conference in Morocco you know the top
22 conference it's an effort
international effort to put some teeth
and the global warming agreements what's
happening at 5:22 is that the values and
hopes of civilization are being upheld
by China by China a harsh authoritarian
state is in the lead and trying to
mobilize support to deal with this
massive problem the United States the
leader of the free world is at the end
of the line trying to draw the Train
backwards
it's an astonishing until not so long
ago liberal socialist and Marxist
theoreticians assumed that conflicts
involving ethnicity were a phenomenon of
pre-modern society and that such
conflicts would progressively fade away
who I have we as a society being able to
overcome the futility of engaging in
ethnic conflicts the uselessness so I
haven't be able to overcome that just
don't understand we
not totally I mean there has been
progress that takes a Europe the first
centuries new Europe was the most savage
place in the world the Europeans are
just slurring one another in the 30
Years War of the 17th century maybe a
third of the population of Germany was
wiped out there was another 30 Years War
in the 20th century from 1914 to 1945
total horror story to tell you what
happened in Europe the rest of the world
now since 1945 there haven't been any
major wars in Europe is that because
we're more civilized well that's because
it was understood that the next time you
have a war you're finished humans have
created the capacity to destroy
themselves everything else and we've
come very close to blowing everything up
many many cases were terminal nuclear
war was extremely close and the threat
is in fact increasing now that was
it's official Israel is a state
exclusively for Jews that's the essence
of the controversial nation-state bill
passed by the Knesset on Thursday after
hours of heated debate the measure
became law by a vote of 60 to 255 with
two abstentions three years the language
of the bill divided political opinion
between the ruling parties and the
opposition Arab members of the Knesset
say the law legalizes discrimination
this is a bill from a government that is
an enemy to Palestinians it's the most
dangerous measure it's a law from a
racist government against Palestinian
rights and it creates an apartheid
regime
it turns Israel into a fascist state why
is dangerous recognizing country as a
Muslim state or Buddhist state or a
Jewish state or a Christian state why
why is that dangerous why should people
if you believe in democracy States their
states of their citizens not some
privileged sector of the citizens so if
the United States were called a white
state that would be outrageous
similarly through called the Christian
State similarly if Pakistan is an
Islamic state that's the same or of
Israel's called Jewish state that's
saying that our society recognizes two
categories of citizens the privileged
category and the others that why there's
the most elementary principles of the
Democratic good freedom we thought I
should say if these designations are
just symbolic maybe it doesn't matter so
for example in the United States if the
official day of rest is Sunday instead
of Thursday okay no big deal okay with
revell conflicts and separatist complex
being waged in various parts of the
globe
do you believe what role can federalism
play in destabilizing these conflicts
betterly yep
great achievements of post-war Europe
now under threat incidentally is a slow
move towards a kind of federalism
so the Schengen Agreement which permits
free passage among the countries of
Europe is a step towards more tolerant
civiles it's a kind of federalism it has
positive and negative aspect because of
the ways in to implement because of the
way it was integrated into the euro zone
which is something separate from the EU
it has led to a situation where
sovereignty has passed from populations
to the bureaucracy in Brussels with the
German banks hanging over their
shoulders that's where the basic
decisions are made
doesn't matter who people elect for for
the wrong governments the major
decisions are where we have
and that's lit to streamers in justify
person it's taking self-destructive
heads but then resent that's
understandable that's part of the
background for the writer for the rise
of these ultra-right parties which
appealed to the population on the
grounds that they no longer control
their own destiny if the pen wins in
France but she might she might very well
implement fredison
referendum this bull threats out of
European Union which would destroy it
now we're back to Europe of competing
nationalities
how has the concept of genocide become
as you state politically polarized and
why is it wrong to why the dangerous to
politicize the concept of genocide well
Jenna said it had a meaning in the early
stages I mean it's not a matter of the
definition but the way it was understood
that genocide meant what the Nazis did
the Jews for example that was genocide
by now the term is used so broadly that
people even talk about committing
genocide against five people or a
massacre somewhere with couple hundred
peoples of called genocide and in fact
it's used in a very restricted way so we
use the term genocide to refer to
atrocities committed by someone else
not everyone so it's not genocide let's
take a real case the state clinton's
sanction clinton and blair sanctions on
Iraq that actually was called genocide
by the
distinguished international diplomats
who administered the oil-for-food
program the so called humanitarian
aspect of the sanctions Denis Holliday
who resigned in protest because he said
their genocide much fun spawning the
fall again resigned in protest on the
grounds that these are about the
genocide from spawning in fact published
a detailed book about it called another
kind of war they did condemn these
sanctions as genocide but what was the
result
try to find a copy it's one spawners
book try to find a reference to it try
to find a review that's right find
anything but this is wiped out of
Western commentary last time I looked
there was not a single review in the
United States the only review of an
England I think was in that countenance
party the names genocide in particular
come into being against a background of
the 20th century and mass slaughter of
the 20th century and particularly the
Holocaust and against that background
Lampkin convinced that the international
community in particularly states in the
international community have an
obligation to intervene when there is
genocide he's successful in getting the
international community to adopt a
resolution on this then follows the
politics around genocide and the
politics around genocide is when is the
slaughter of civilians a genocide or not
which particular slaughter is going to
be named
genocide and which one is not going to
be named genocide so if you look at the
last ten years and take some examples of
mass slaughter for example the mass
slaughter in Iraq which is in terms of
numbers at least no less than what is
going on in Sudan
the mass slaughter in Congo which in
terms of numbers is probably ten times
what happened what has been happening in
Darfur but none of these have been named
as genocide only the slaughter in Darfur
has been named as genocide so there is
obviously a politics around this naming
and that's the politics that I was
interested in and what do you think what
do you think this politics is well I
think that what's happening is that
genocide is being instrumentalized
by the biggest power on the earth today
which is the United States it is being
instrumentalized
in a way that mass slaughters which
implicate its adversaries are being
named as genocide and those which
implicate its friends or its proxies are
not being named as genocide and that is
not what limpkin had in mind so what
needs to be done to reverse the
political polarization of the concept of
genocide can it be still used in it can
be used if we are willing to become
civilized to recognize that crimes are
crimes whether they commit them or we
commit them that we could for example
listen to Justice Robert Jackson
injunction to the he was a chief
prosecutor at Nuremberg he spoke to the
tribunal and said yeah we have to
recognize that rods are crimes whether
they commit them or we commit them we
are handing these defendants he said a
poisoned chalice and if we sit from it
we must be subject to the same
conditions if not the whole trial is a
farce
does that apply
when Britain and the United States
invaded Iraq it's a textbook example of
aggression with absolutely no
justification textbook example of what
the Nuremberg Tribunal called
the supreme international crime which
differs from other walk war crimes in
that it includes all of the evil that
follows
for example the rise of Isis the death
of millions of people that was all of
that just can you find it any commentary
in the United States even calling this a
crime Obama is greatly admired on the
left because he said it was a blunder
that just like German generals after
Stalingrad who said the two-front war
was a blunder which was shouldn't lock
down him
first but that's as far as you can go
the head of Human Rights Watch Kenneth
Roth when this is specifically brought
to his attention can only go as far as
saying it was a mistake it was a mistake
when the Nazis committed aggression when
the Russians invaded Afghanistan was a
mistake loyal communists but we cannot
rise to the level of civilization even
the head of Human Rights Watch and the
leading left liberal Journal of
intellectuals in the West the review
Obama Danny can't say that we committed
a crime can't say that that most we make
mistakes go back to justice Jackson
anybody listen to his words that take it
the worst rival to the Bushnell bust
we're here were strong man it's people
killed four countries through genders
destroyed all that people still dying
from the chemical warfare that was
initiated by the John F Kennedy that
expanded is it a mistake is it a crime
is it would give me responsible
right now the administration has
sponsored many more it would be a war
that Obama made a passionate speech with
his elevated rhetoric about what
happened to even did talk about crimes
talk about the crimes that were
committed against American veterans who
were not treated probably what about the
Vietnamese let's take Jimmy Carter
Human Rights prisoner right after the
war had been forgotten 1977 he was asked
in a press conference do we owe any debt
to Vietnam
he said we owe them no debt because the
destruction was mutual
1977 Human Rights President was there a
comment if you like
that just passes until we rise to a
minimal level of civilization we can use
the term objection individuals like John
Mearsheimer and Kenneth waltz Joseph and
I have all defined what they consider to
be power in international relations
you've criticized power structures and
power systems but I would like to know
what do you consider to power in the
field of international relations
straightforward power is the ability to
issue orders which others have to follow
to the extent that you can do that yet
power the orders don't have to be
durable they can be actions so if you
can invade Iraq worst join us xx sent
the 21st century and you get no century
for or no reaction that's power in the
aftermath of conflicts to what extent
are truth and reconciliation commissions
a viable form of achieving justice and
accountability I simply make sense in
many situation
so for example take city South Africa
there were horrible crimes committed
under apartheid but to try to punish
people for those crimes would have torn
the society to shreds undermine any hope
of progress and development so a
decision was made by the ante which i
think is understandable to avoid direct
punishment and to settle for a Truth and
Reconciliation Commission to expose the
nature of what happened to at least
amount of understood sins done and
Central America same in Brazil same in
East Timor to East Timor which was if
the term genocide has any meaning what
Indonesia did in East Timor with the
backing of the United States Britain
whether
as close to genocide anything teamwork
funded amazingly 1xindependent should
they care deaths
should they try to carry out war crimes
trials against Indonesia Australia
United States others or should they try
to mend the fences with Indonesia and
maybe settle for a Truth and
Reconciliation Commission I think the
latter which is in fact what they're
doing they have to live in the world
right let's take where we happen to be
sitting right now the native population
suffered than the migrant crisis of an
incredible time not the kind that we
talked about the migrant crisis where
the immigrants come in with the
intention of exterminating and expelling
the population and that it's not what we
call a crisis but that's what happened
here there are remnants of the people
who used to live here they have a
reservation and gave God and should they
Institute war crimes trials against
wouldn't make a lot of sense it would
make a lot of sense to bring out
understanding of what happened to call
for reparations and so on but not work
for our struggles just means nothing in
these circumstances is it genocide in
the population of this territory of the
United States time the colonists arrived
was nobody knows for sure maybe 10 15
something like that
but in 1900 it was when there was a
census it was about this the Western
Hemisphere that maybe 80 million people
when Columbus arrived pretty soon about
90% of them I think there's an anarchist
in the long term you believe that
centralized political power ought to be
eliminated and turned out to the local
level so what role if any would
federalism play in your long term vision
of anarchism general Marcos pictures at
least within the tradition associate
myself with or clad in federalism but
they assumed they were based on the
notion of voluntary association so there
should be self-determination in all
institutional's
institutions and structures of life but
voluntary associations could extend to
regions countries internationally that's
kind of federalism supporters from below
that makes good sense complex world
