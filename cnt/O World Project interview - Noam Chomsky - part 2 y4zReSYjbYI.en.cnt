Oh familiar face hi dr. Chomsky thank
you thank you for doing this would you
buy that Latin finally connect yes thank
you thank you so much but you might
tilting your on your screen down a bit I
could just hear your chin is cut out
there cool that that's perfect thank you
so much okay I'm sure you get this all
the time but it's an honor to speak with
you you know your I'll get started right
away I know your your your views on the
state of the world today and of humanity
are well documented it seems we're on a
friendly self-destructive path I'd like
to know what you think how change is
actually going to happen in the world
there's only one way that change has
ever happened with very rare exceptions
but overwhelmingly in the past changes
taking place when people what we call
ordinary people began to mobilize and
engage dedicated themselves to a
struggle bullets from everything you can
think of can start with a few people to
take the anti-nuclear movement in
England CMV started with small number
you ended up with a huge movement the
civil rights movement in the United
States scattered individuals many people
really dedicated themselves with courage
and intensity couple of black kids
sitting in a lunch counter North
Carolina Freedom Riders North himself
recently had a huge men's movement the
women's movement which is had a very
significant effect on modern culture and
society that began small
consciousness-raising groups going on
with the demands and pressures finally
achieved something and the
the different from the modern the great
modern achievement of European society
it's now being dismantled by the
Brussels bureaucrats and the banks the
modern welfare state largely through
labor activism over many years oh and
like what about changes there's just no
other way same here would you say
there's a conscious and concerted effort
to prevent that from happening of course
power systems never say thank you we're
coming up or about though everything
they can to retard it and prevent it and
that simply requires more engagement it
seems like conflict is at the core of
all the problems with humanity both as
are as individually and as a species
collectively what do you think is at the
core of that conflict of each individual
first of all there's also plenty of
cooperation there is for sure there are
conflicts when there are different
interests different interests and
concerns and you can try to adjudicate
them sensibly or you can approach them
aggressively and that'll lead to
conflict take any case you like takes a
problems in Ukraine right now I'm there
are paths forward the imagine towards
peaceful reconciliation negotiations and
taking in there are plainly different
interests and concerns you can think of
ways in which they could be accommodated
of one possibilities to pursue them the
alternative possibility is to try to
exacerbate them say by sending
delegations to call for greater for
rejecting the concerns of the others and
demand and solely your own rights
sending missile defense so called
missile defense east in Europe on our
side expanding the
of efforts to incorporate Ukraine into a
Western system realizing that that's of
course severe they're not realizing
you're not caring but severe security
threat to the United States to Russia
and on the other side of say kooten were
to give direct the military support to
secessionists and the eastern Ukraine
which apparently is not doing that would
exacerbate detentions though there are
always alternatives as you can follow we
know that but I'd like to edit to your
philosophical side here you know I speak
with a lot of for this project I'm
speaking with spiritual leaders a lot of
the top scientists in the world a lot of
some politicians and for people from
every perspective and they all seem to
have their own answer to what is wrong
and what the solution is and and it just
seems to me that that that as long as
there is a conflict and in turn would
you say as long as there's an internal
conflict in the human organism that that
will always reflect itself onto the
world any person you may my children
everyone else is complex enough so that
we have internal conflicts and we try to
resolve them that's pretty much the same
as before you can you can tear yourself
apart or you can try to find a
constructive way forward I don't think
there's any deep philosophical or
spiritual issue here some people are all
quite familiar with well you'll explain
like the spiritual aspect or suggest
that that the answers must come with
from within first that you must examine
yourself and and and once you have a
center once you have a core value I mean
you must have a core value that that
really reflects in everything you say
and do I don't have a Corvette you I
don't think anyone else does either we
have many values of Greater and Lesser
significance and sometimes we find pick
and flick with each other so for example
the freedom speech is a very
I value I think you preserve but it does
run into conflicts for example to you
provide freedom speech to people who are
trying to destroy the world let's say
right that's a serious question and they
exist so for example the major corporate
second major sectors of corporate power
in the United States are working
overtime to try to ensure that their
profits in the short term book will be
maximized by convincing people that
either there is no global warming or
through his humans have nothing to do
with it well there quarter in fact
announcing a kind of a death knell hood
species should therefore in speech be a
guaranteed to Chris a conflict of values
I think good but and can't argue that
there's no conflict of value and that
happens all the time people are not
simple enough to have a single core
value we have many concerns many values
many of them we owe to assess decide
that they're really not valid always
good to look into the mirror to make
sure try to see if what you're doing is
sensible and justified question your own
reflexive judgments you're on
commitments that always make sense but
you can't be paralyzed by you have to
make decisions in life constantly on
matters small and large well you seem
very measured and very balanced and
you're obviously in the center of many
world storms with all the things that
you've said you must get a lot of flack
how do you what do you do internally to
remain centered and and reasonable or is
it just your natural predilection this
plenty of inner turmoil talk people
close to me they'll know about it but I
think it makes sense to try to suppress
it and
attempt at least make every attempt to
address criticism hysteria shrieking
invective whatever may be in there's
plenty of it to try to see if you can
find in a points that are serious enough
so that discussion and constructive
engagement as possible often there are
sometimes there's not in which you just
have to dismiss it was there a pivotal
moment in your life that put you on this
path that that that made you see the
world the way that you see it today or
was that in an eight and an eight thing
for you I mean it's an aid for all of us
the question is what stimulates it and
brings it forward but so for example
concern for the fate of other sympathy
is it's been historically cold is
probably just in an egg property adam
smith david hume other great figures and
took that for granted and I think you're
probably right but it doesn't always
manifest itself we will have our own
experiences and our own choices and
decisions far as I'm concerned it's from
early childhood I grew up during the
Depression plenty of suffering see it
very close by other were there was the
rising threat of fascism dark cloud over
Europe frightening and even to a child
watching it and this thing's shaped of
perspective on the way of thinking about
the world do you get a sense of being an
historical figure in the world do you
get a sense of of that that you have a
purpose that you have a purpose in that
you are fulfilling it to some to some
degree all right many purposes and to
some degree I think they're being
fulfilled of the respect not so there
are many causes that I've devoted an
enormous effort to the cell
that they were totally hopeless
sometimes they were totally hopeless
sometimes they actually succeeded so it
takes a one of them one in 1975
Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese
colony of East Timor violent act of
aggression worded by the United States
Britain other free powers now they
carried out a gin literally genocide or
virtually tennis Idol assault on the
population may be wiped out Porter
Porter of them or more other words one
of a small group of people who were
devoting considerable effort to try to
bring public attention to this to try to
bring about policy change to try to save
the remnants of in this incredibly poor
backward society and come on to me it
seemed impossible but we kept at it and
through a lot of efforts not mine any
others I finally did succeed in
pressuring the American government call
it all in September 1979 I haven't ever
be sure this causes aren't necessarily
those so look in your in your lifetime
you've seen a lot of change a lot of
dramatic societal change for the wrong
date night 0 for 20 guys here man but
you you've seen a lot of change over
your lifetime and you've been been
actively impassioned with it what have
you seen how has humanity progressed
over that time from your point of view
in quite a lot of progress so we take
where i'm now sitting i'm in my office
at MIT University where I've been since
nineteen fifty-five when I came the
political science department was openly
funded by the CIA what'm secret through
the 1960s they were engaged the
department
an apartment was engaged in
counterinsurgency work and South Vietnam
villas with his end students to the
advisor person Solman of course it was
all under the rubric of a Peace Research
Institute is the age or well of course
there were closed seminar secret
seminars away discovered when I was
occasionally divided the speaking 10
that would be impossible now as a result
of Student Activity mainly the late
sixties it was late it came small number
of students I could name of Korea they
succeeded in changing the environment at
the University to the extent that by
1969 that were the first serious efforts
institute why whole university to
consider the question which is really
not been publicly rating where is before
about uses of technology and uses of
science and their legitimacy in fact it
got to the point that a a day was the
classes were suspended for a day to deal
with this issue and then it continued
and it's over time change the atmosphere
the University substantially and has
changed in other words so when I came
here in 1955 if you walked in the halls
you saw the white males well-dressed
quiet differential faculty with jackets
and ties made sweetie I thought as well
that was like 50 walk down the hall now
F women maybe 30 40 presentment are
these casual dress casual relations
informal interchange interaction of all
kinds of also then they used to be what
you see a the booths and that's real
kind of activism and so on and so forth
well that's a big change and it didn't
just happen here happened across the
country in fact across the world to a
large extent
that's significant and we can continue I
take what I was mostly engaged in in the
1960s and continue to be opposition to
aggression violent aggression worst
crime in the early 60s it was almost
impossible to arouse any concern over
the US invasion of south vietnam later
all of Indochina just to give you an
illustration as late as october 1965
when the small and heavy war movement
tried to join an international day of
protest that was called and have a
demonstration in the Boston Common Sarah
Boston I park place for demonstration
that was October 1965 South Vietnam
crackle destroyed hundreds thousands
American troops works at North we could
we tried to have the demonstration but
it was worth enough physically broken up
I was supposed to be one speaker of your
word we were saved from real physical
attack by by state troopers of the
liberal newspaper denounced the
demonstration of dare you criticize is
the holy state and so on Boston's a
livable city maybe the most liberal
sitting in the country March 1966 was
the second international day for this we
realized it couldn't have a public
demonstration as sorts of issue so we
tried to arrange in a church church was
attacked and canned tomatoes my wife
mustard in nineteen sixty five or so
took Eric we had two little girls took
them to she took them to women's
demonstration in Concord Menace the
traditional seat of us masochism there
were women and children uh just standing
not saying much they were attacked that
was the early 60s couple years later
that a huge anymore
which we know that a big impact on
ending the war you read the Pentagon
Papers they terminate in early nineteen
sixty-eight right after the Tet
Offensive in January 68 the government
was thinking of sending lots more troops
but the military was opposed they said
they would need them for civil disorder
control in the United States more troops
in that affected the end result was
horrendous but it affected come up to
2000 2003 march two thousand three the
US and britain invaded iraq the worst
crime of the 21st century another major
crime of aggression very horrifying
consequences but it was the first time
in the history of Western imperialism
that there was massive protest even
before the day the world was officially
launched and you know a lot of people
feel it didn't have an effect went on
anyway it is agree with that Bush layer
their associates never even green of
carrying out the measures that John F
Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson used without
a second thought in the early 1960s well
let's change in attitude well it's not
pure progress by any means lot of
regression but over time I think it's
we've become more civilized countries in
many book it's ironic that we're
standing on the precipice of destruction
of the species to some extent I mean it
seems that it seems paradoxical that
that well on one hand people are more
open and more willing to accept new
liberal ideas that were that there's an
counter force that seems to be just as
powerful how do you explain the polarity
using or there are interests that do not
want to give up their power and their
profit in the United States most
important country very major sectors
of private enterprise so-called private
enterprise state-supported private
enterprise the energy corporations of
American Chamber of Commerce which is
named business lobby are quite openly no
secret quite openly proclaiming that
they are carrying out large-scale
propaganda campaigns or call it
propaganda PR campaigns to try to
convince the public that either there's
no global warming just climate always
changes and so on or else units have
nothing to it why because they're being
threatened their profits are being
thread I mean these are corporations
it's been you know billions of dollars
in new exploration trying to exploit new
sources of the fossil fuels that are
about to destroy us and in fact if you
look at the scientific evidence there's
pretty strong consensus that unless most
of them do well majority stay in the
ground but a human life in any
recognizable forms do so sure these
conflicts are there and they reflect the
moral calculus of Anglo American
capitalism profits tomorrow outweigh far
outweigh the fader Rancho that's and met
and those who accept that moral calculus
yes we'll use the power that they have
which is enormous to try to drive us all
over the press you know I know you've
got much time and as one question I
really want to get in you know you're
obviously a very eloquent and
intelligent man and them if you had if
you had the ability to make a public
service announcement to humanity what
would you say to humanity what would you
say say tip to people right now what I
would say is all the problems in the
world and there are plenty of them that
are to the cast a shadow over everything
unless they're solved nothing else is
going to matter I'm not no matter how
serious it was a one is environmental
catastrophe the other
is the threat of nuclear war which is
very real it's a miracle that we've
escaped since 1945 let the record it's
just shy unless these two problems I did
I can recall a statement of Bertrand
Russell's pictures right over there
looking at me around nineteen sixty I
guess he was asked why he was spending
his time marching in streets testing
nuclear weapons when he could have been
developing his philosophical and
scientific views and making a lasting
contribution to civilization and his
answer was something like if I don't
march in the street there isn't going
anywhere around who appreciate and that
we're it's now a more severe situation
so the message people the world I think
should be take a look at faces your
grandchildren or imagine with them do
you want them to have a decent existence
or don't you care that's a choice
awesome awesome thank you I think I
don't have much time I've got can ask
you a personal question how are you
dealing with old age holding all these e
five is old well I'm sure that some
things aren't working as well as I used
to and and just the sense of mortality
do you get your sense of mortality as
you as you get older when I was about
ten years old I used to have horrifying
thoughts about how awful it would be I
mainly because if I die it would mean
that this spark of consciousness
disappeared and how do I even though
that the rest of the world continues to
exist that used to really trouble me
around that age and as they got a little
over and in terms with it doesn't bother
me anymore so how did you resolve that
just by recognizing that it's that's the
dust and that's the way we're world
that's the way life works so you have no
no sense at all of not I will see an
afterlife because that sounds too
religious but you have no sense of what
happens to your energy after
your physical body dies do you have any
idea about that the spirit if you bury
that body he composes introduce more
life and what about spirit do you
believe in that there is a spirit that
there was a noam chomsky spirit that
that upon the physical death that that
spirit is intact in some form oh this is
for every person there's some kind of
legacy that you leave on the impact of
what you've done for example to go back
a couple of minutes did you care for
your grandchildren enough to do
something to retard disaster that'll
live on positive or negative so what
would you like your legacy to be I'd
like it to be there several domains this
that's my main intellectual interests
are professional work which is pretty
exciting nothing could be carried
forward in ways which will give us quite
a lot of insight into the kind of
creatures human beings are I'd like to
see that pursued maybe I'm on the right
path maybe the wrong path for whatever
it is like to see that it to a be
carried forward for significantly but in
the human domain eat the main of human
life it's basically we've been talking
about to whatever extent there's a
positive impact in securing decent human
life saving people's lives and ensuring
that they have assessments the rights
that every person should have to the
tiny extent that can contribute to that
but that the legacy include you know
somebody might mentioned I was speaking
with you today someone asked me I asked
them could you give their question that
you particularly wanted me to ask and he
mentioned that dumb is there a question
that hasn't been asked of you that you
would like to answer that should have
been asked of you I mean you seem to
have an opinion on everything and you
have a view and you've considered a lot
of things is there something that hasn't
been asked as much as it should be done
one question there's a nest as much
it should be is why throughout my life
have I delayed so long in becoming
engaged in things of immense
significance and I can give you a case
after case please do was a wife that
white white well they take the Vietnam
War which consumed my energies in the
1960s in fact that was just about to go
for a long prison sentence probably
ended by the Tet Offensive but at the
time to become involved I begin involved
seriously the early sixties time to
become involved with ten years earlier
takes a environmental issues the time to
become involved at the very latest was
the early 7th I do very much until last
10 or 15 years and you mention case
after case is that because you're really
self-absorbed in your in your career or
our was it you're just unaware these
issues are our woods a mixture of
personal efficiencies lack of knowledge
interesting Boone something else what
kind of things were all familiar with
what keeps us from doing the things at
some level we know we do and you feel
like now you're doing everything you
should be doing or you feel that your no
questions could be asked now ya gotta go
ya ok well thank you thank you very much
truly it's a pleasure to speak with you
baby buggy finally / yes make you
you
