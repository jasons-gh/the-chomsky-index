one or two more question does this okay
I I just like to pick up on your last
comment on social revolution and I'd
like to know what what you mean one by a
social revolution and what it would take
and I have another question actually my
original question which is what do you
think of me in postman's book amusing
ourselves to death and she argues that
the media and the mass special
television has reduced Americans ability
to think rationally because of the way
that the information is given to them
other words he's arguing that before
rapid report the media really became
very rapid with commercials and
everything people read more and were it
more able to tie their thoughts together
I think let's start and secondly and I
think there's a lot to it Neil postman
says remember I started off by saying I
was going to talk about the elite media
the agenda-setting media I mean roughly
speaking you know this is an
oversimplification but as a first
approximation we want to distinguish two
categories of citizens we want to
distinguish what's sometimes called the
political class from the rest the
political class is the upper middle
class educated articulate politically
active went to the good colleges they're
going to be able to participate in
management whether it's corporate
management or state management or
ideological management and I clued in
that things like teaching and so on
that's one sector small sector of the
population then there's the rest of
those slobs out there who are just
supposed to be turning screws and that
sort of thing now that's that's as a
start that's not the whole story it's
more differentiated in that but that's a
start now they're treated differently in
the media the first group they're
treated differently in schools and
studied in fact for the slobs you know
the eighty percent or whatever
are the main thing for them is to divert
them to get them to watch National
Football League and to worry about you
know mother with child with six heads or
whatever you pick up in the you know and
the thing that you pick up on the
supermarket stands and so on orte you
know look at astrology or get involved
in you know fundamentalist stuff or
something real just get them away you
know get them away from things that
matter and for that it's important to
reduce their capacity to think because
they're just supposed to follow orders
basically now you have to remember it's
not very far back that there was a live
working class culture in the united
states and i miss Goldman they're just
about old enough to remember the most
educated people I ever met in my life
were Jewish working-class people in New
York in the 1930s Muslim never went to
school you know but they read they went
to concerts at arguments to pay this
rather than most of everything I know
some of them never got past fourth grade
I mean less indoctrination but that
there but it was a live on growing you
know working class culture took a long
time to destroy it in other countries it
still hasn't been destroyed the United
States is more advanced so let's say in
England like when I go to last time I
was in England couple months ago I gave
a talk here when I get a talk on these
topics either in university or a church
or something like that in England one
was in a town hall the other was in a
guild hall well that's you know union
hall no that's how did a question the
concept doesn't exist the reason is that
England still has the residue of a
working-class movement until the 1960s
it had a very lively working-class press
Daily Press which more people read and
read the alief press and was well good
good serious news papers presented a
different conception of the world day
after day after day different values
different conception of the right that
people have to the product of their own
labor to their right to participate and
what happens in the world
national affairs everything just a
different value system different
morality different interpretation well
thats a come to market forces basically
market forces and i talked about before
and in the united states have a long
time ago in other european countries
they're kind of more backward it will
take them while longer to reach the US
system of sort of equal it ization one
political party no you know structured
media to prevent the scent that's more
sophisticated so so so but but and what
you're saying I what person is saying
what you're saying I think it's very
right I mean a large part of the media
are in fact directed to that but don't
forget that the managers have to
understand things now the people who are
running the corporations have to know
how to make more or less rational
decisions and the people who are running
the state have to know how to serve the
interests of the people with private
power you need the people who are
experts in kissinger since we know how
to articulate the consensus of a
powerful and serve their interests and
and the the people who are writing the
editorials have to sort of understand
things and the journalists have to do it
it's also now they have to do within a
particular framework you don't want to
think too much you know you want them to
think within fix downs but they've got
to be able to think and there's real
contradictions there incidentally you
see the contradictions in the university
is very strikingly so for example in the
natural sciences is extremely hard to be
dishonest and uncreated i mean you've
got nature out there keeping you on us
you know you can make do a false
experiment but something's going to
catch you up in no time because nature
is out there you're right a pulse book
about the French Revolution you can do
forever you know not nobody's going to
stop you until ideological changes take
place you can tell these fabrications
about modern contemporary history and as
long as power is on your side it doesn't
matter because as long as power is on
your side it's the illusions that are
real and the reality that's irrelevant
it's actually true as long as power is
under so you don't have nature out there
keeping you honest
and you see a difference I mean you just
see a difference in the intellectual
culture you know and but but the point
is in the kind of ideological side of
the culture in other humanities and
Social Sciences and so on you still have
to be able to think at the same time you
have to be able to not think because we
think too much you come up the wrong
idea so as a delicate line that has to
be drawn and it's a tricky one to keep
you know universities and schools and so
on have the problems with it and the
universities due to their be the
newspapers due to the point is their
conflicting values you know there's the
value that says you better tell the
truth for one thing because you've got
some professional integrity and for
another thing because people in power
have to understand the real world on the
other hand there's the pressure it says
you better not tell the truth because
then you're going to see things wrong
way you're going to undermine illusions
and so on and so forth and those are
real conflicts and you can play on you
know within limits you can play on so I
think he's right but only about part of
the media and I happen to be talking
about the other part primarily so what
we're saying is kind of complementary as
for a social revolution that's not you
can't give a pat answer to that but you
know Park 12 minutes not just another
talk but a lot of talk the question is
what kind of what do we think is a just
society now the United States has
founded on a principle the one that is
expressed by the founding fathers the
people who own the country or a
government they said it straight out
because those were nice open honest days
we don't say it we just have it built
into everything those who own the
country auto governor that's sort of
what happens you where were you come
from ask who your congressional
representative is they take the House of
Representatives which is the most
representative part of the government
and ask yourself who your representative
is and the chances are you're going and
ask what that representative is going to
do if
less likely she is voted out of office
which is very rare event since we
basically have a one-party system with
no replacement but suppose it happens
what are they going to do is that person
going to become a truck driver grocery
store clerk or you know a farm laborer
assembly line worker or something like
that chances are no chances are that
person is going to go back to work in a
corporate law office or some managerial
position or somewhere else in the state
system or something like that maybe a
professor at university or something but
one of the tiny narrow elite professions
and that means that's who they're
representing now that was a live issue
in the 18th century very live issue that
was a live issue in the years after the
American Revolution and take a look back
at the struggles at the time of the
Articles of Confederation and federalism
and so on and those were some of the
issues that were being taught about
question was are people going to be
represented by people like themselves or
are they going to be represented by the
gentry the aristocrats the rich and so
on well the Federalist one you can
despite their electoral defeat they
basically one people were represented by
the rich same thing happened in the
English revolution of the 17th century
effect it happens in every revolution
you know you take a look at any
revolution you want you'll find
conflicts among these lease then you've
got you this mass of a population once
you get rid of all of them no they
usually lose and one or the other of the
elite groups takes power they can call
themselves Bolsheviks there's some other
things but one or another if they'll eat
steaks power and the general population
the kind of radical Democrats usually
lose they may not lose everything like
they make some games but they don't gain
the right to be represented by people
like themselves to have direct
participation to eliminate the very
notion of coercion and power they don't
so far in history that gained that and
that's what a social revolution would be
I think it would be realizing the actual
ideals of the
enlightenment than a veal early
revolutionary period meaning that the
very idea of people being forced to rent
themselves in order to survive is
obscene you know not as bad as being
forced to sell yourself to survive but
it's not all that different that was
understood a century or two ago I think
can be understood again the idea that
you have to you have to that the role of
a person in a political system is to
ratify decisions made by others that's
unacceptable in a real democracy the
idea that you have to select among the
men or class of people who own the
country or their representatives in
order and that's what a political
participation means i would think that
should be unacceptable in a political
system and changing all of those things
would be a social revolution it would
mean taking control over the fundamental
decisions of the society whether their
decisions over production or
distribution or consumption or
governance or whatever and making them
aesthetically popular in popular
groupings whether they're in the
workplace or the community or other
arrangements and so on now you know
exactly how that should look like well
you know there it becomes not so simple
but I tease me those are the directions
in which a radical democratic revolution
would move and it's not something
particularly novel this means
reconstructing ideals which always show
up in popular struggles and I've been
doing it for centuries
one more
I'm sorry I just wanted to ask this is
first of all by state I want to explain
this is the first time I've ever heard
you speaking so am I thinking like a
little bit naive or facil but a lot of
the basic examples and discussions that
you've talked about tonight of our sort
of a big version big mature
sophisticated and quite important
version of saying that you know Santa
Claus doesn't exist and you know faith
is no good and intellect is and
rationale is good and what I was
wondering was of course you see
intellect and rationale is beyond faith
or something out there reality is
outside of what we're living in and it
just seems to me this I just I just
wonder what your agenda is because
although you deny you think that
basically the right to exercise power by
States outside of their national
boundaries it seems to me it's
legitimate and yet you're saying that
the method of sort of pacifying the
domestic population is not but what I'm
wondering then is is your agenda than
merely to sort of expand the number of
people inside the inside the government
or inside the country rather we can
participate in that decision-making
process of exercising power in other
words are you by speaking about these
sorts of things talking about if we have
a government here that is ruled by
people who own something in the country
are you claiming then that you have a
right to claim a piece of intellectual
property which gives people in this room
or as well who gained intellectual
property a right to have extra to
exercise influence within that
government as it projects is pawel
overseas sure Enders should stay through
that isn't think
so unfeasible people do something about
it now as far as the agenda is concerned
well you know it's starts narrow and it
goes up the narrowest point I'm I
wouldn't bother doing this unless I
thought unless I meant what I said what
I said is I urge you to look at the
facts and see if this sketch is right or
something else is right so that's what
I'd like to do I'd like to convince
people try to figure out what's going on
that's the lowest thing start just urge
people to figure out what's going on I
tell you what I think is going on I
don't own any intellectual property
incidentally anybody else can say what
they think is going on in the kind of
society I'd like to see and like for
example the reason I repeat that I urge
you to check the documents as I'm not
even trying to persuade you just like
when I teach a graduate course I'm not
trying to persuade the students and
that's maybe what you do in a theology
course or something if you're teaching a
graduate course in the sciences you're
not trying to persuade your students
place if you're any good you know what
you're up to you're trying to get them
to be able to figure out what's going on
and you know perfectly well you're
probably wrong because you've always
been wrong in the past and so every
other science has been wrong in the past
so you're trying to get them to figure
out what's going on and correct your
errors and do it better and so on same
here i mean i i'm not trying to persuade
you that this is right but i want to get
you to think of it convince you that
it's worth thinking about figure out
what's right if you do i think you're
going to find something like what i said
but maybe not so that's the lowest
concern second concern is that after you
figure out what's right you're going to
want to do something about it and there
are a lot of things that can be done
just been talking about that I think
there are a lot of people suffering in
the world here and elsewhere you've been
talking a few of those problems plenty
of others many of the people who are
suffering or suffering because of us now
there's a lot of things we can't do much
about like somebody raised the question
of Lebanon frankly I said I have no
we can do about it maybe somebody else
pose but I don't there are things
happening in many places I don't think
we can do much about some things we can
do a lot about because we're primarily
responsible so for example the the lack
of the failure of a diplomatic
settlement in the Middle East we are
primarily responsible for that I think
that's what I think you want to discover
if you check the record and if that's
the case a lot of people are suffering
from that in fact the world may blow up
because of it very threatening situation
quite apart from the local victims if
that's in fact the case there's a lot
that we can do about it and I'd like to
see people do it same with regard to
Central America which I mentioned you
know where there's hundreds of thousands
of people than slaughter down there in
this last decade that's because if you
and me nut Mars no we let it happen and
we don't have to they can do something
about it there are other things where
it's less easy to do it as for your
general principle I don't agree that
states have a right to exert force
across their borders I really want to
grieve it and furthermore say if the
word conservative which in my view is an
honorable word if it hadn't lost its
meaning entirely and been turned into
its opposite like peace process we would
recognize that to be a very conservative
position in fact that's part of the
supreme law of the land estates if
you're a law-abiding person you just
think we have a reasonably good system
of laws you agree that it's a war crime
kind of thing for which people were
hanged at Nuremberg for a state to
exercise force beyond its boundaries
deference kinda surprising that people
think that's legitimate I'm just Hitler
legitimate that's what that's what the
Nazis were tried for for exerting force
beyond their boundaries it was a post
hope decisions it could claim it's
fraudulent and in fact it a lot of
fakery about it but the principles which
are enshrined in the UN Charter which is
a valid treaty and therefore the supreme
law of the land are very clear about
this now they leave some margin of the
day
they're quite clear they specify the
cases where states they begin by
accepting the international system well
I think that's a transit or existing
order being approved but let's begin by
accepting then it says in that system
states are not permitted to use force or
even the threat of force and I infer
mitad use the threat of force and the
only exception to that zone two
exceptions to that one is if authorized
by the UN Security Council felt like you
can send peacekeeping troops to Libya
and the other is in the case of the
armed attack when you're directly
attacked like somebody crosses the
border and begins attacking you then you
can use force up till the point where
the Security Council acts that's it
anything else is illegal kind of crime
for which we hang people at Nuremberg
with lots of noble rhetoric about how
the principles apply to us too it's a
conservative position to say we ought to
obey our own laws and to say blandly
states have a right to exert force
international affairs is to say a
Nuremberg draws along wrong in principle
perfectly okay for Hitler and the
Japanese to do what they do mistake
thick and then I don't agree with it you
know there's a lot wrong with the
international system in international
law but those things are right and I
think we ought to try to live up to me
we could play a constructive role in
world affairs in theory and if we could
stop lead get our boots off people from
next then we could start talking about
how to do that but to exert force or to
carry out embargoes and that kind of
stuff that's just flatly wrong in fact
there's a World Court decision which the
United States rejects because we're a
law of state demanding that we stop the
illegal the unlawful use of force kind
of interesting that nobody cares about
that because we take for granted that
we're a law
state but I don't think we should
