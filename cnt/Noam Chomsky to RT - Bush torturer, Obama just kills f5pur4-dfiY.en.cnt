our team sitting down with
world-renowned scholar linguist author
and MIT professor Noam Chomsky professor
Chomsky thank you very much for taking
time to speak with our team it's glad to
be with you
the first issue ever to speak with you
about is the recent clashes that have
taken place on Wall Street between
Americans who are turning out to
demonstrate and police officers from
what I read you recently sent a message
to support the activists of this group
called occupy wall street you've called
them courageous and honorable can you
talk to me about your take on Occupy
Wall Street well you know Wall Street is
just a shorthand for the financial
institutions the banks are bigger and
richer than before that corporate
profits are reaching record levels and
for much of and unemployment stays about
the level of the Great Depression real
unemployment these people are saying oh
let's blame the culture and the
institution is behind them so fiscal
policies like taxation rules of
corporate governance deregulation and so
on it does set in motion a vicious cycle
which is getting worse and worse in New
York so walk down the streets you can
see it a very serious poverty on the
other hand phenomenal wealth right side
by side very much like a third world
country so what you see if you go to
sub-saharan Africa no meanwhile
infrastructures collapsing and schools
are collapsing and all of that increases
the it keeps the cycle going and in fact
rising well it's about time for some
protest what may be new in the coming
year for the 2012 election is that many
including yourself have speculated and
assume that the campaign spending for
the u.s. election in 2012 will exceed 1
billion dollars for you do Kennedy that
is a massive where does that come from
well you know basically a lot of it
comes from financial institutions in
fact if you look at the 2008 election
what's one Obama what
gave him the election was primarily
financial institution contributions they
preferred him to McKinney they expected
to be paid back and they were and the
next one will be even worse instantly
that's only a part of it in
parliamentary systems including our own
up until maybe 20 years ago positions of
influence in a functioning part of a
parliamentary system let's say care of a
committee comes from principle at least
from experience senior the legislative
contributions and so on that's gone now
they're brought if you want to become
chair of a committee in the House or the
Senate
you have to pay off the party you have
to pay for it where do you get the money
to pay for it
same pockets you don't so provides even
more influence to the already
overwhelming influence of concentrated
capital so it's harder and harder to
distinguish between the elected
officials and economic concentration it
never was easy to distinguish I should
say this is not something novel but now
it's a reaching extreme level what's
left of America's democratic system if
this is the process that has been
cemented in place and what is really
left if from every angle there's these
really just take a look at public
opinion they'll tell you about 2/3 of
the public thinks of the entire Congress
ought to be thrown out it's gonna happen
no but it means that the system isn't
working and the public knows it
the popularity of the favorability
rating for Congress is in single digits
president not much higher and the same
runs across all other institutions it's
a very widespread sense that everything
is going wrong that tells you the
democratic system is just not
functioning no in fact I don't want to
suggest that this is totally new so you
go back a century then you can still
predict throughout all this period
pretty well
the outcome of elections by campaign
funding but there are degrees and now
it's gotten extreme the levels to which
the u.s. is departed from other
capitalist societies are pretty
remarkable you released a book recently
called 9/11 was there an alternative
focusing on the u.s. assassination of
Osama bin Laden and the continuity you
say between George W Bush and Barack
Obama the killing of Osama bin Laden is
an interesting case it was done in such
a way as to infuriate the Pakistanis
which is extremely dangerous it's the
most dangerous country in the world and
go into it they have a professional army
committed to the sovereignty of Pakistan
Pakistanis were already overwhelmingly
anti-american this shoots it through the
stratosphere the army is bitterly angry
not only at the invasion of the country
and the murder of someone on their soil
but also that they're being pressured
forced to take part in an American war
in Afghanistan some of the actually
conservative military analysts who wrote
about the bin Laden assassination I
quoted some of them pointed out quite
accurately that there's shift between
Bush's policies and Obama's on this bush
Bush's policy was to kidnap people
whatever you thought about them that
take them to Guantanamo or Bagram or
some other torture chamber and they'll
try to extract some information out of
them we know what that was like
I don't describe it Obama's policy is
just to kill him they're killing them
all over the world
no that's a targeted assassination
campaigns you know even kidnapping and
torture I'm just kill him and the bin
Laden assassination was a case in point
it's hard to remember but there used to
be a system of justice in the West which
said that a person is
that until he's proven guilty up until
then he's a suspect he's innocent until
proven guilty
well that's gone now you just kill him
if you think they're guilty so he was
apprehended no resistance he was alone
with his wife of a defense nothing
highly trained commandos could certainly
have apprehended him they didn't they
were under orders to murder him and then
tossed his body into the ocean acts that
are almost designed in such a way as to
increase anger and hatred throughout the
Muslim world in fact among anybody who's
got their eyes open you talk about the
Obama administration and how the u.s.
actions right now could be infuriating
the Muslim world the Arab world the
Obama administration has supported the
Tunisians has supported the Egyptians
has supported the Libyans in the
so-called Arab Spring the Palestinians
have officially submitted an application
for UN membership at statehood the u.s.
says that they will cast the veto
against it if they have to because they
believe that direct negotiation should
take place between Palestine and Israel
before there's an independent Palestine
well first of all I have to make a
qualification of the United States and
its Western Allies did not support the
Egyptian and Tunisian revolutions they
opposed them they stayed back the dicta
then in Tunisia was mostly France it's
their colony fixed colony needed was the
United States and Britain they supported
the dictators until the last minute and
when the army turned against them and it
was no longer possible to support them
then they say okay when democracy is
wonderful and then they moved to try to
ensure that the regime's would stay
pretty much as they were incites a very
old pattern but putting that aside it's
true that the United States announced
that it would cast a veto for about 35
years of the United States and Israel
have been rejecting a political
settlement that are supported by
virtually the entire world the Arab
League the Organization of Islamic
states which includes Iran Hamas support
to almost no relevant party disagrees
with it except that the United States
and Israel won't let it happen how about
the fact that Egypt right now and Turkey
have really sever their relations with
Israel see that's an effect of the Arab
Spring what that what's happened there
are changes in the world what's
happening is Israel's getting Harmer
isolated meaning the u.s. is getting
four more isolated for example a couple
months ago there was a meeting of the
the oligarchs people have pretty much
owned the economy and they warned the
government that they better accept
something like this resolution because
there's a otherwise Israel will be as
they put it South African eyes even more
isolated you know boycotts refusal to
load ships and so on and our economy
will collapse now it's interesting that
Israel's reacting pretty much the way
South Africa dude and if you look back
at the history by about 1960 but we have
the records so South African Foreign
Minister called in the American
ambassador described this to him and
said we don't really care as long as you
back us because you're the one vote that
matters and that's how it worked out
right through the nineteen eighty by the
1980s UN embargo UN embargo corporations
were pulling out sanctions all over
boycotts they were doing flying the
Reagan administration was backing them
and as long as the US was supporting him
nothing happened then the u.s. withdrew
support almost instantly apartheid
collapse so you're saying it's in
Israel's best interest and possibly the
u.s. to allow this Palestinian UN
membership say look I thought for 35
years that consent is time stories now
that has been for almost 40 years
there's a choice between security and
expansion very clear choice now Israel
is like other states it's preferring it
hackers since the early seventies
had a choice between security and
expansion can have peace but not with
expansion into the territories which
incidentally is recognized to be
criminal by everyone including Israel
they can get away with it as long as the
most powerful state in the world backs
them and as long as Europe goes along
the Europe is remarkably cowardly they
not like this but they don't like to
step on the toenails of the masters so
they go along so you notice the quartet
has backed the United States they picked
Tony Blair you know I don't have to
comment on him but they might as well
take George Bush to bring the message
and do what the United States tells you
stop this nonsense about statehood and
go back to negotiations that's where we
now stand it's up to the people in the
advanced industrial countries to compel
their governments to go along with the
world professor Chomsky thank you very
much for your time yeah
