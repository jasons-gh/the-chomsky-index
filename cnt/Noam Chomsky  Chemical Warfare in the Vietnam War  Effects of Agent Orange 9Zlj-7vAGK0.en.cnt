ladies and gentlemen welcome to the new
housing works store that opened in april
Lisa / dong the manager and her staff
did a great job making room for us all
I'm dick hughes i'm dick hughes i'm the
loose cannon one of the people who
thought up this conspiracy to get us all
together to think about Agent Orange and
to do something about it those two great
books they were published by seven story
press the first book originally came out
in 1989 it was by Fred Wilcox of course
and it was about the impact Agent Orange
had on American veterans the second book
which just is new scorched earth is
about the Vietnamese and the impact on
Vietnam so we owe seven stories press
who does so many books that nobody else
would do and Housing Works and a few
loose cannons all our thanks this is an
important event to make a breakthrough
on a horrible tragedy of many decades
agent orange which still persists if you
have ideas about doing something when
you see the books please do it after
colloquy with our guests we will have a
QA please wait until you get a
microphone in hand we all want to hear
your question we all want to hear your
answer thank you so much for coming and
it gives me great pleasure to enter to
introduce two very special people Noam
Chomsky who most of you know and others
will come to know has been telling truth
to power without rhetoric and just the
facts ma'am just the facts old dragnet
fan for decades and is still doing it
and Fred Wilcox who has been out in the
vineyards writing these two books
feeling the pain of knowing people
directly affected by Agent Orange
and seeing them pass away or if they
survive to suffer terribly so I'm going
to leave it now to our two guests and
then your questions thank you for coming
I hope you can all hear and when you
step out of here please try to do
something about people suffering from a
jernard thank you well hello thank you
for all coming out this afternoon on
this beautiful afternoon my name is Fred
Wilcox dick hughes as done magnificent
incredible work he's helped people who
suffer from Agent Orange and he's
arranged this whole thing with his
family they've worked very very hard so
I want to express my appreciation for
them I want to express my appreciation
for my family who's here my children my
friends from Ithaca and professor Noam
Chomsky who's taken out of his busy
schedule to come here it's wonderful
thank you know very much
I I would just like to talk a little bit
briefly and then I'll turn it over to
know about what I've been trying to do
for about the last 30 years and that is
tell people about what I consider to be
there are many many tragedies many
historical to have any tragedies in the
world but this is a great tragedy and
let me just begin by saying that three
million Vietnamese people are suffering
from the effects of chemical warfare
that is the deformation campaign that
the United States government waged in
Vietnam for at least 10 years 3 million
adults and 500,000 children so one of
the things I'd like to do today is
really dedicate this whole thing the
whole meeting today to the children to
the Vietnamese children to the children
of us vets Korean vets New Zealand vets
Australian vets all of these people who
have fathered or women who have given
birth to seriously deformed children
legless children blind children
seriously retarded children all the same
result as a result of having been
exposed to something called tcd dioxin
which was the contaminating Agent Orange
and so I really don't think you can
overestimate this tragedy I don't think
you can exaggerate it I have never tried
to exaggerate the tragedy because it's
not necessary it's ongoing it's a
tragedy that just doesn't seem to have
any end that is to say if you go to
Vietnam today one of the things that
really frightens the Vietnamese people
is that they're seeing the third and
fourth and sometimes fifth generation of
Agent Orange children so a lot of people
will say well that war ended you know it
ended in 1975 why I've been asked this
why do you keep talking about it why do
you keep writing about it why do you
keep obsessing over it if that's what
you want to say and I said because it
hasn't ended it hasn't ended for the
children it hasn't ended for the
Vietnamese people it has intended for
American vets who are reaching about the
age of late 50s and early 60s our vets
and dying and many many people don't
know about this so i guess my goal has
been and continues to be to tell as many
people as possible about this ongoing
and credible tragedy that is a direct
result of chemical warfare noam did
well just to I mean as all of you know
most of you know this is the 50th
anniversary all most of the day in fact
of some very significant decisions that
were made in Washington Kennedy
administration John F Kennedy and his
advisors basically decided in November
1961 to sharply escalate the war in
South Vietnam which have been going on
for some time and to essentially turn it
into a US invasion of south vietnam at
that meeting Kennedy those meetings
Kennedy authorized the US Air Force to
start bombing South Vietnam pretty soon
they were apparently bombing a carrying
out about a third of the missions under
South Vietnamese markings but didn't
fool anybody except those who wanted to
be fooled authorized napalm and what
we're discussing here are authorized
what ought to be called chemical warfare
defoliation it was cool the bombing then
as you all know expanded led to half a
million American troops invading the
south the bombing been within a couple
of years by 1966-67 the leading one
leading specialists on Vietnam the
military historian Vietnamese scholar
Bernard full in his last writing before
he was killed in combat wrote that he
thought that Vietnam might not survive
as a cultural and historical entity
under the impact of the most severe
bombing a severe attack ever launched to
get an air against an area that size it
went on
not only at South Vietnam and North
Vietnam at least where nobody was
looking the area around Hanoi was
somewhat spared because there were a lot
of II's there foreign embassies but the
south of southern part of North Vietnam
was turned into a moonscape South
Vietnam itself may never recover the
bombing extended the northern northern
Laos which had nothing to do with the
war in Vietnam it was mainly because a
lot of Air Force planes were idle during
bombing pauses I don't him to do here
they virtually destroyed a wood amounted
to a virtually Stone Age society
primitive society and northern Laos
littered with unexploded ordnance people
still dying people that were living very
living in caves for to several years
trying to survive I interviewed a lot of
them back around nineteen seventy then
it expanded to Cambodia which was
actually the most intense bombing in
history following Henry Kissinger's
immortal phrase anything that anything
that flies against anything that moves
those were the orders handed down by
Kissinger from his boss to the Air Force
and the bombing at a brief period just a
couple of years we now know reached the
level of all allied bombing in the
Pacific region the entire Pacific region
during World War two including the two
atom bombs all on a remote hasn't poor
peasant society a lot of consequences to
that and very ugly ones but it
finally more or less ended but it didn't
end as Fred and pointed out the effects
of the chemical warfare continued and
will continue the soon turned in very
quickly turned into crop destruction
major war crimes Fred can tell you a lot
more about this than i can so i won't go
on with it just add one more word about
it there are serious consequences to not
paying attention to what we've done in
the past one of them's is moral if we're
incapable of facing up to our own
history where we're in trouble morally a
serious problem but it's also quite
practical because if you don't face up
to it you continue doing it and in fact
that's happening now people are dying
right now from american chemical warfare
one of the many things i've done over
the years is a number of visits to
southern Colombia to isolated endangered
peasant villages sometimes when I go
down it's too dangerous even to go to
the countryside so they bring people
into the local town to give testimonies
about what's happening to them these are
people have been subjected to some of
the worst terror anywhere the Columbia
now has displaced probably this I think
the second largest displaced persons
population of the world in the caster
Afghanistan millions of people driven
off their lands these are isolated poor
villages last time i went about a year
ago you drive driving with the truck
given to us by the Ombudsman's office of
the region travels around almost
impassable road
I go along the road there's a tiny
clearing on the side stop and go out
there's just a row of simple crosses
that's a place where not long before a
bus had been stopped by paramilitaries
worked very closely for the military and
everybody and it was shot that's life
but the worst part of life in many ways
is the chemical warfare we call we don't
call it the foliation now we call it the
fumigation fumigation but same thing
it's lethal substances sprayed from the
skies I suppose mostly contractors by
now and you see them the effects are
striking I'm first with the stroy
destroys the crops not not just opium
destroys everything it poisons the land
there are people being a coffee farmers
not easy these days but there are people
have managed to kind of develop a niche
market for organic high quality organic
coffee that they can sell in Germany and
so on that's finished because the Lance
poison you can't grow anything more
people with horrible scars all over
their arms children dying you know the
kind of things you see in Vietnam and
that's today just in the last couple of
years according to the attorney
general's office about 140,000 people
have been killed by the paramilitaries
in the military and there are other
things too but this is going on before
our eyes we regard it as our right to
carry out pardon sorry
sort of said that earlier we regard it
as I are right it's not questioned to
carry out Stillwater I don't know if I
can manage anything latter an altered we
regard it as our right we don't question
it to carry out chemical warfare in
another country because they're
producing something that our government
doesn't like actually the president of
Bolivia asked a pertinent question how
would we feel if they were to carry out
chemical warfare in North Carolina and
Kentucky to destroy a crop that's far
more lethal than cocaine in fact just
took a look at the death tolls well it's
our right it's not there right this goes
on before our eyes and part of the
reason is a failure to pay attention to
similar atrocities in the past and this
is not the end by any means just
yesterday I got a letter from an
ex-marine who fought in Iraq and he was
known him for some years he was a part
of the military force that invaded the
fallujah in november two thousand four i
was a horrible massacre it's kind of
like forever nature actually except
worse in many respects one of the
respects in which it's worse is the kind
of weaponry they used there have been
studies now by epidemiologists and other
scientists in the Fallujah area and it
turns out that the level of radiation
persistent radiation in that area is
actually higher than Hiroshima the
letter he sent me yesterday he's this
young man after he got out has been
devoting his life to trying to
compensate for that
those horrors this was a scientific
article that just appeared studying hair
samples of people there and the hair
samples have extremely high evidence of
radiation poisoning and it again has the
usual effect the same kind you described
and you know could be permanent and
unless we face up to these things that's
going to continue there's no barrier to
it except internally to the United
States nobody else can do anything about
it these are two examples and you can
add others and American veteran suffer
from it too also the effects of heavy
metals probably depleted uranium others
that's has plenty of effects on American
veterans who exposed but of course as
always the major lethal effects are on
the victims and as fred said this can go
on indefinitely even when the war's
technically over and even more so when
we carry out similar operations
elsewhere as we're doing right now thank
you no I just like to say a couple of
things real fast and then open it up to
questions and that is I really like the
way you brought it to now because people
sometimes don't ask me why do you talk
about something that happened so long
ago the last spray mission in Vietnam
was nineteen seventy we left there
theoretically at least in 1975 the
reason why I keep talking about this is
because there's a cancer epidemic in
this country many other parts of the
world and the cancer epidemic is
directly related to the toxic chemicals
in our air food and water supply I have
four children i'm sure a lot of you have
children i have grandchildren I do not
want my children or anybody's children
to develop cancer I don't want to watch
them lose their hair and die slowly and
painfully beautiful children from cancer
that could be prevented it's not a
matter of waiting for the next 50 years
until we come up with a pill or
treatment for cancer it's a matter of
cleaning up our environment and stopping
the companies that poison Vietnam and
poison Cambodia and other
parts in Colombia other parts of the
world for profit they do it / profit
they do it for money they claim that
they were doing it well in the name of
patriotism they were they poisoned
Vietnam they were destroying the
mangrove for us because they were really
doing their patriotic duty no they were
doing it to make money they made Agent
Orange they sold it to the government
they knew what was in it they knew it
was poison and they didn't tell the
government so one of the things that I
hope I could accomplish through this
book scorched earth is to say look it's
time to clean up the world environment
it's time to clean up our environment it
isn't about something that happened 20
years ago 30 years ago 40 years ago it's
something about what's happening right
now and that is that we're all being
exposed to these toxic chemicals and
we're all at risk and so the tragedy in
Vietnam is the tragedy here and in
Europe and many other places and it's a
tragedy that I believe that we can all
get together and do something to prevent
and people are always asking what should
you do well I would say one thing you
could do it be to call Dow Chemical in
Montana and say we know we know what you
did in Vietnam we know what you're doing
here and we want you to stop it stop
lying stop saying for example that
there's no evidence that Agent Orange
causes cancer and human beings the world
scientific community knows that isn't
true the world scientific community is
then all the studies necessary they know
that dioxin is tarz carcinogenic they
know that we all know that so with that
I just I would like to just open the
florida to questions and comments and
whatever you want to say I'd like to
hear which everybody has to say thank
you for it we on
okay Canadian so we are going to have
questions and answers and wait till they
get the mic there but I wanted to let
you know we have several books up here
to buy Fred which are ten dollars a
piece bottom price and he will sign them
for you we have one of gnomes books 911
after 911 and then there's also Philip
Jones griffis book photography book
which is on basic sale for twenty
dollars a gorgeous photography book so
it's hard to beat those prices here's
the mic that Lisa will get over to you
ask your question and let's see if we
can get as many in as we can and Lee so
here's one yes thank you for your
commentary but I was just thinking as I
listened because i have recently found
out about the matter of fracking which
is what i'm going to talk about and I
was thinking now in hearing your
commentary that perhaps if the people in
these countries in the victims that you
mentioned were seeking revenge they
would say we have found a way of doing
ourselves in because as a friend of mine
said and if you're not familiar with
fracking i'll mention it in a minute
fracking is not spelled frac k.i.n.g it
spelled sui CI de because with what
we're doing and it's already shown up in
places like Pennsylvania we can wipe out
the water supply and that's not
something you can replace repeat that's
not something you can replace many
people live in the city don't understand
that there's 13 inches of topsoil and
the water supply that stand between us
and what oblivion for those of you who
don't know what fracking is they're
about to have some hearings in the
Delaware Water Gap and that's happening
October the 21st they're trying to get
people on buses if you want
find out about that see me later date
the problem is the problem is that
people are unaware of where they stand
and if you have any comment on the
subject of fracking I think the idea
that it's suicide is really on the
button
thank you an honor to be here with both
of you no one particular hero of mine
for 30 years thank you to so Fred you
implied if unless I'm wrong and to at
the end of your talk that the government
was unaware of the consequences of
seriousness of agent orange or did I
misunderstand what you said and if so
when did they find out the government
well that's been a controversy ever
since people start talking about this as
far as i know the chemical companies did
not tell particularly the military
commanders in Vietnam what they knew
about the effects of dioxin on
laboratory animals and in 1965 but this
is a memo that was in waiting for an
army to die Dow Chemical said I'm
quoting dioxin is potentially deadly to
human beings now I do not believe that
these Monsanto and the rest of these
wonderful corporations making lots of
profit from set went to the United
States government the military or
anybody else and said well we're going
to sell you this but we want you to know
that it's potentially deadly to human
beings that your troops our troops and
the Vietnamese people and the rest are
going to be exposed to something that
the chemical companies insists they did
tell someone but exactly who that
someone might have been I don't know and
I don't think they did I don't believe
it I haven't I haven't uncovered any
information to the that effect yeah I
think there's a I can add a word there's
is a concept that applies here and in
many other cases it's called intentional
ignorance so yes you can choose to be
ignorant of something which you do know
about and that applies all over the
place there's no way the government
couldn't have known this well it just
doesn't make sense in terms of the
profit system you know I mean these
companies are they telling us the gas
companies telling people what's in the
fracking in the water no they're not
human perspective tracking when energy
corporation supplies you with oil do
they put in a notice saying we're
helping destroy the world no but you
know it and they know it and if we don't
pay attention it's intentional ignorance
for
are we on can you hear sort of
so first of all thank you so much from
from Ithaca professor Chomsky you've
been a role model for me for so long and
I think you know when I first learned
about your work you know we had
something called the language
acquisition device and and I'm wondering
you know what what the what the plan for
the communication acquisition goodbye
device is because i think you know we
have language and we use it you know
like you said for intentional omission
you know the note that says we're
killing ourselves quickly or slowly is
not included in in any of our packaging
right now so how do we you know globally
or locally communicate that to each
other and and how do we unite from today
on you know how do we help how do we do
this well it's particularly significant
in the United States you may have seen
an article in The New York Times I think
maybe yesterday which reported what's
been an open secret for a long time that
the United States has simply off the
planet on this issue just about every
country in some fashion or another is
trying to do something about the very
serious problem of environmental of
global warming and environmental
catastrophe now they're doing it in
different ways we should be perhaps a
shame to the fact that the country
that's in the lead on this is the
poorest country in South America Bolivia
they've gone to the extent of a passing
legislation that nature has rights and
we have to observe the rights of nature
well you know sophisticated Westerners
can laugh about this but the laughs last
laughs going to be on us the poorest
country in South America is taking the
international lead other countries are
doing various things we're not only not
taking the lead as we should but we're
dragging it down the United States is
alone in
tearing apart and restricting the very
limited devices that have been available
to do something about the problem that's
pretty striking to look at Congress know
and see that Congress is trying to
dismantle a legislation and institutions
which were instituted by the person who
is in fact our last liberal president
richard nixon that's not a joke
incidentally not saying i like him but
if you take a look at the legislation
yeah so they're tearing apart the epa
they're trying to restrict the other
limited environmental restrictions and
while the whole world is haltingly
moving forwards we're racing backwards
and what the united states does is of
course of enormous significance this is
far and away the richest most powerful
country in history if we don't take the
lead nothing much it's going to happen
and if we're pulling the train backwards
it's going to be bad news so here's
where the problem is and there are a lot
of reasons for it this is the only
country that I know of at least where
major centers of power are carrying out
quite openly they tell us carrying out
the large-scale propaganda programs to
convince the population but it's all a
liberal hoax the American the Chamber of
Commerce the biggest business
organization American Petroleum
Institute and others have made it quite
public that they're carrying out these
programs well you know they've got a lot
of people confused if take a look at the
way the media handle it it it's kind of
a he says she says things like on one
side you've got you know 99 percent of
serious scientists on the other half
and you have a gym in ho or somebody
else and we've got to sort of work it
out for ourselves well you know
individuals can't work it out for
themselves and there's a kind of a
background of distrust for reason and
science which is itself very lethal I
mean you shouldn't worship science they
could make mistakes and to work on awful
things but still it makes sense to study
things seriously and carefully and it's
a serious cultural and institutional
problem here which has to be dealt with
in a sort of a fundamental way so how do
we communicate it I mean study a
language can't tell you anything about
that but people have to be out there
trying to get others to understand
what's really happening to our society
it do you want your grandchildren to
have a decent world to live in or is it
better for the petroleum companies to
make more profit today and they'll have
an environment in which you can't
survive those are real choices fracking
is a case in point on the fracking is
actually a dual problem one problem is
what this speaker over here mentioned
there's a short district problems they
have destroying water resources and land
and so on but that's the longer term
problem of increasing the use of fossil
fuels no matter how you get them which
is it's going to have a lethal effect on
human society in fact all living things
yes I just want to thank mr. Chomsky
were coming and I just really wanted to
talk about South American countries how
the economy is being affected and how
long the dictatorships were planned out
in the United States and sent over there
so that they can distribute democracy in
a way so in a way it's all part of the
conspiracy so they can control sub
America
but I want to talk about them what do
you think about the International
International Monetary Fund is it a
fraud to control the economy of a
southern American countries this is I
didn't get the last part is it a fraud
he certainly not a fraud that's perfect
yeah is it a scam once it is Pam the
international monetary fund its scale a
scam scam no it's not a scam I mean they
only do the work they in fact they're
basically an offshoot of the US Treasury
I mean it's not literally true but the
US Treasury has an enormous amount of
control in what they do and there are
the same programs that are kind of
turning the United States into a sort of
a third world society are applied much
more forcefully in weaker countries and
having terrible effects so the
International Monetary Fund has over the
past several decades been pressing very
hard the so-called neoliberal programs
which have been a social and economic
disaster almost everywhere now not for
everyone so it takes a gift which is
right on the front pages a part of the
source of the uprising and Egypt's went
on for a long time but peaking is
because of the disastrous effects of IMF
structural adjustment programs which
have increased growth but kind of the
way they do here with wealth going into
very few pockets and most of the
population suffering and that's been
true in place after place I mean Latin
America went as long as accepting these
programs that went through several
decades of sharp decline economic
decline it's now cast out the programs
and is there's a lot of
quite successful growth we see the same
thing here we've been through it I mean
it's not as rigid here as it is in poor
countries but of course the wealthy
protect themselves but it's part of the
Ritz part of the reason why over the
past essentially 30 years the US has
become has been in a kind of a vicious
cycle of sharp concentration of wealth
really in one-tenth of one percent of
the population that's hedge fund
managers and CEOs and so on who don't do
anything constructive for the society in
fact they probably harm but or the
economy but again enormous wealth and
with that comes political power and that
makes it possible to accelerate the
cycle so we have the situation in which
we are with in the richest country in
the world with you know 30 years of
pretty much stagnation or decline and
incomes for the majority of the
population while a small tiny group is
getting fabulously wealthy and the
country is seriously declining so but
now I should say and about the IMF that
more than the other global institutions
they've become begun to recognize this
in fact it's kind of striking that the
IMF chief economists have have been
criticizing Europe for carrying out the
kind of policies that they've advocated
your absurd a recession and it's
carrying out austerity policies which is
the worst possible thing to do in a
recession and the IMF is actually
counsel them not to do that and to turn
towards trying to stimulate the economy
which we should be doing too so it's not
a pretty story but you know they're not
just devils and they're coming out of a
a background tradition which is rooted
right here mostly in economic planning
and economic policies which have had
pretty ugly consequences over decades
the countries that have been casting
them aside and pulling themselves out of
it or sometimes beginning to prosper
that's one of the reasons why Latin
America has had a substantial
improvements over the past decade I also
moves towards independence that's
significant but it's not a scam but
anythings I like to say before any more
questions if you haven't been down to
Wall Street the Occupy Wall Street
please go down and say hi to me it's
really inspiring I was down there the
other day and what wonderful people and
I think we should all just support them
in every way we can hello well I think
you had a better wait for ever wish for
Mike yeah so I have a question left out
we have to get the mics yeah / hell yeah
okay the ways that we continue to fight
our Wars have pretty devastating effects
for the countries that we are fighting
with or occupying as well as on you know
members the military that are coming
home so I'm wondering if you can speak a
bit about what lessons we should take
away from what you know about the
struggle for justice with agent orange
both for the members of the military and
people in Vietnam and what lessons can
we take away from that for those of us
that want to make sure that there is
justice for those that are returning and
are sick in so many different ways or
for the people that are suffering in all
the nations that we are fighting with
well I think that's an important
question because one of the things
problems with talking about agent orange
Vietnam veterans is people somehow
assume that that's new it's the first
time that we've ever mistreated veterans
we've ever ignored them we've ever
failed to take to take them seriously
when they're complaining about their
ailments and it isn't that's part of
American history we send people off to
war
pounding the drums waving the flags and
then when we come my own they come home
we say oh I don't recognize you i really
don't know you so to just say as some
people have well it's too bad about the
vietnam veterans they got hurt we didn't
help them we did it but we're doing a
better job my own argument is and i come
from a working-class poor family people
join the military you have to join the
military because it's a job and because
it's a way of getting out of poverty but
on the other hand I wouldn't encourage
anybody to join the military until the
military decides to treat people with
respect and decency after they come home
from the killing guns hello I'm very
sorry but professor Chomsky has an
appointment that he's almost already a
little bit late for at Columbia and we
have to get him up there I was going to
mention that the books that are here for
sale we donated them the housing works
so any books that you purchase even at
this low price all the proceeds will go
to housing works so we're serving two
purposes and if you can afford to do it
we would much appreciate it our
apologies for those who didn't get their
questions in I thank you so much for
coming out and our thanks again to Noam
Chomsky and Fred Wilcox
