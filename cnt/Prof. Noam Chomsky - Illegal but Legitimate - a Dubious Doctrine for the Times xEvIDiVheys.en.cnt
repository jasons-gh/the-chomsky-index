good evening as principal of the
University of Edinburgh it is my
privilege to welcome you special welcome
to our rector welcome to guests welcome
to guests who are participating via the
Internet
and of course a warm welcome to students
and my colleagues this skippered lecture
is devoted to the memory of Professor
Edward Saeed and our Gifford lecturer
who so nicely welcomed is Professor Noam
Chomsky he is of course famous for his
works on linguistics and when I was
younger I would have worked too as one
at one of my heroes also and he's also
known as a leading public intellectual
dealing with very important ethical and
political issues it's extremely fitting
that he speak in the Givet series and
historically speakers have included
William James Albert Schweitzer Arnold
Toynbee and various people who one would
certainly label in the important public
intellectual camp and given the topic
it's especially fitting that he give
this Gifford lecture devoted to the
memory of Professor Saeed
well I received the invitation with
mixed emotions was naturally gratified
but it was under the shadow of the
absence of an old and the close friend
Edward Sade who as you know fought a
long and courageous struggle with
incurable cancer but succumbed before he
was able to deliver lectures here which
is an immeasurable loss to you to
everyone
anywhere who cares about freedom and
justice and intellectual and cultural
achievement but I'm happy at least to be
able to speak in his memory turn to the
topic by comparative and historical
standards we are all fortunate to enjoy
great freedom freedom plainly offers
opportunity opportunity confers
responsibility responsibility to use the
freedom that one enjoys wisely honestly
and humanely we also happen to live in
centers of enormous power accordingly
our decisions as to how to face our
responsibilities are sure to have
far-reaching consequences I want to
concentrate on one case primarily a case
that everyone agrees is of enormous
significance reaching quite literally to
issues of human survival that's the
question of resort to force in
international affairs how its legitimacy
has been understood over time how it is
today as you know the hideous crimes of
the 20th century led to dedicated
Hertz in 1945 to save humans from the
curse of war and the word save is no
exaggeration surely since it became
clear in 1945 that the likelihood of
ultimate doom is well beyond what any
rational person would be willing to
tolerate actually the phrase ultimate
doom is not mine I'm borrowing it from
two prominent strategic analysts writing
in the Journal of the American Academy
of Arts and Sciences not given to
hyperbole they conclude that
Washington's current military programs
and aggressive stance quoting them carry
an appreciable risk of ultimate doom and
they express the hope that the threat
that the US administration is posing to
the world and to the American people
will be countered by a coalition of
peace-loving nations led by China we've
come to a pretty pass when such thoughts
are expressed at the heart of the
establishment and what that implies
about the state of American democracy is
no less shocking and threatening and you
may consider leave it to you to consider
what the judgments imply about Britain
which was not expected to lead the
coalition well in considering their
reasons - the reasons that led them to
these conclusions good place to start is
with an event that actually took place
after their article appeared but is
typical last November at the United
Nations Commission Committee on
disarmament it's basically the General
Assembly which voted to support a treaty
to ban production of fissile material
for
nuclear weapons the vote was 147 to 1
there were 2 abstentions the one you can
guess the two abstentions were Israel
which is reflexive and Britain which
explained its abstention on the grounds
I'm quoting the British ambassador on
grounds that the resolution had divided
the international community at a time at
a time when progress should be a prime
objective that divided it a hundred and
forty seven to one so obviously actually
we gained some insight into the ranking
of survival of the species on the list
of priorities that not only by the vote
but by the publicity it received
unfortunately it's only one of many
illustrative examples the efforts to end
the curse of war led to a consensus on
the principles that should guide state
action the United Nations Charter the
consensus and subsequent declarations
and treaties the consensus was
reiterated last December by high-level
UN panel which included the National
Security Adviser for George Bush the
first it was reiterated again by Kofi
Annan a couple of days ago the panel
reiterated the conclusions of the United
Nations Charter that force can be
deployed only when authorized by the
Security Council or under Article 51
famous article 51 in defence against
armed attack until the Security Council
acts article 51 is generally interpreted
to allow the use of force
when quoting the necessity for action is
instant overwhelming and leaving no
choice of means and no moment of
deliberation
it's the classic wording of Daniel
Webster case involving Britain any any
other resort the force is a war crime
in fact the supreme international crime
differing from other war crimes in that
it contains within it the accumulated
evil of the whole the words of the
Nuremberg Tribunal the December 2004
panel concluded that article 51 should
be neither rewritten or reinterpreted
the panel then adds a comment directed
to Western intellectuals it says for
those impatient with such a response the
answer must be that in a world full of
perceived potential threats the risk to
the global order and the norm of
non-intervention on which it continues
to be based is simply too great for the
legality of unilateral preventive action
as distinct from collectively endorsed
action to be accepted allowing one to so
act is to allow all that final sentence
proposes a principle that is the
foundation of international law and of
every moral code that merits even the
slightest attention the principle of
universality that is we apply to
ourselves the same standards we do to
others if not more stringent ones but
that principle is flatly rejected by the
political leadership of the most
powerful states and also by the dominant
moral and political culture of the
educated elites within them again
raising the prospects of ultimate doom
the discussion of the article 51 in the
UN panel last December was as I
mentioned addressed the Western
intellectuals in fact it was a direct
response to many years of enthusiastic
support by Western intellectuals for
intervention that they determined to be
legitimate
even if illegal and it therefore takes
on unusual significance even apart from
the fact that it reaffirms the stand of
the world outside of what the West calls
the international community namely
itself the for example the declaration
of the South Summit in the year 2000
former non-aligned movement surely with
the recent NATO bombing of Serbia in
mind it's the highest level meeting ever
of the former non-aligned countries now
accounting for 80 percent of the world's
population the declaration rejects what
it calls the so-called right of
humanitarian intervention which it
perceives to be traditional imperialism
and a new guise it also provided a
detailed and quite sophisticated
analysis of neoliberal globalization it
was ignored
apart from scattered derision and in in
Britain in fact tantrums when it was
mentioned interesting ones the forceful
rejection of the post-war consensus and
elite Western circles took place in the
final years of the last millennium
across the spectrum of articulate
opinion there was enthusiastic
celebration of what was called a
normative revolution in world affairs
these are all quotes with a claim for
the idealistic new world bent on ending
inhumanity which had entered a noble
phase of its foreign
see with a saintly globe for the first
time in history a state is dedicated to
principles and values acting from
altruism and moral fervor alone as the
leader of the self-declared enlightened
States
hence free to resort to force for which
it's what its leaders determined to be
right and that's a very small sample
from an extraordinary deluge I've drawn
only from the most respected liberal
voices internationally after several
years of such flights of self adulation
which probably have no historical
precedent of the bombing - its own
return the these end of the millennium
declarations do reflect a large range of
a leaked perceptions in fact something
close to unanimity but not those of the
general public so in the United States
large majority of the public very large
majority continues to take the position
that states are entitled to use force
only if I'm now quoting the public
opinion studies only if there is strong
evidence that the country is in imminent
danger of being attacked that is an
overwhelming majority of the public
rejects the bipartisan consensus on
pre-emptive war rejects the Western
intellectual consensus and agrees with
the much-maligned South Summit and the
recent UN panel the legitimate
legitimacy of the use of force is not
the only issue on which American public
opinion diverges very sharply from elite
political culture to take another
current example which also raises issues
of survival it's commonly reported that
the United States refused to join the
Kyoto treaty a month ago that's true
only if the phrase United States
excluded
it's population that is it's true only
if we dismiss democracy with total
contempt the population overwhelmingly
supported ratification of the treaty in
fact so enthusiastically that a majority
of bush voters believed that he agreed
with them that the US should join
because it's a genomicist thing to do
very large majorities also believe that
the United States should accept the
jurisdiction of the International
Criminal Court and the World Court
should rely on the United Nations to
take the lead in international crises
including issues of security
reconstruction and political transition
in Iraq that's been true since April
2003 a majority even believe that the
United States should abandon the
Security Council veto and accept
majority rule and the same is true on
many other issues large majorities
believe that the United States should
rely on diplomatic and economic measures
more than military ones in the so-called
war on terror and overwhelming
majorities as in the past favor
increased government spending on health
care education and other social spending
all of this is in sharp opposition to
public policy and pretty much to elite
intellectual consensus studies revealing
these facts were released by the most
prestigious institutions that monitor
public opinion shortly before the
November 2004 presidential elections
plainly these results are of critical
importance to functioning democracy the
studies reveal that both political
parties are far to the right of the
population on many of the most crucial
issues they barely received any mention
none in the national press the
observations unfortunately generalize
and they lend further weight to the
judgment of the
strategic analysts who I quoted at the
outset that the world's most powerful
state is facing a serious Democratic
deficit to use a term we apply to others
these conclusions are reinforced by
studies of public opinion taken by the
same major or institutions that were
taken shortly after the federal budget
was announced a few weeks ago the public
calls for sharp cuts in military
spending along with sharply increased
social spending it's education medical
research job training conservation
renewable energy increased spending for
the United Nations and for economic and
humanitarian aid and reversal of bush's
tax cuts for the wealthy a government
policy is dramatically the opposite in
every respect there is rightly good deal
of international concern about the
consequences of the rapidly expanding
twin deficits the trade deficit and the
budget deficit closely related to those
two is a third deficit the growing
Democratic deficit which is very little
discussed because it's welcomed by
wealth and power which expend
substantial efforts to try to turn the
country into a failed state to adopt a
fashionable notion a state that has
formal democratic institutions but with
the public largely removed from policy
choices and implementation and that is a
very serious threat much more so than in
a small country somewhere this is after
all the world's most powerful state the
provisions of the United Nations Charter
were spelled out further in particular
at the Nuremberg Tribunal Tokyo
judgments were far more severe although
the principles that they enunciated were
significant both of the tribunals were
very deeply flawed
the same by the most elementary moral
standards they were both founded on the
rejection explicit rejection of the
principle of universality to bring the
defeated war criminals to justice it was
necessary to devise definitions of war
crime and crime against humanity how
this was done was explained by Telford
Taylor the chief counsel for the
prosecution distinguished international
lawyer and historian in brief the
operative definition of crime was crime
that you carried out but we did not and
as Taylor explained so urban bombing of
urban civilian concentrations was not a
crime because the Allies did more than
the Germans as Taylor explains his words
to punish the foe especially the
vanquished foe for conduct in which the
enforcing nation has engaged would be so
grossly inequitable as to discredit the
laws themselves which is correct but the
operative definition of crime also
discredits the laws themselves every
subsequent tribunal is discredited by
the same deep moral flaw the current
Yugoslavia general as an example a group
of international lawyers requested the
tribunal to investigate NATO crimes that
were recorded by the major international
human rights organizations including
admissions by the NATO command the
prosecutors rejected the request without
investigation it's in violation of the
statutes of the tribunal stating that
they accept NATO assurances of good
faith
Yugoslavia did proceed to bring charges
to the World Court
invoking the Genocide Convention the
United States excused itself from the
proceedings on the grounds that when
Washington finally signed the Genocide
Convention after 40 years
it added a reservation excluding itself
from charges and the court correctly
accepted this argument after the flurry
of anger fury over the reject the
publication of the Justice Department
memoranda which effectively authorized
torture the Dean of the Yale Law School
Harold Koh made a wrote an indignant
article in which he said this is almost
as if the government was claiming the
right to commit genocide he failed to
add that the government does a court
itself that right and has done so since
it finally signed the Genocide
Convention much the same happened in the
case brought by Nicaragua against the
United States 20 years ago a core part
of nicaragua's case which was presented
by a distinguished Harvard Law Professor
was rejected by the court on the grounds
that in accepting world court
jurisdiction in 1946 the United States
had entered a reservation excluding
itself from prosecution under
multilateral treaties in particular
excluding itself from the supreme crime
of aggression in 1946 was of course a
Liberal Democratic administration just
as the u.s. decision to exclude itself
from the world court proceedings brought
by Yugoslavia was under the Clinton
administration the court accepted this
in the case of the Nicaragua case and it
therefore restricted its deliberations
to customary international law
bilateral u.s. Nicaragua Treaty even on
these very narrow grounds the court
charged Washington with what it called
unlawful use of force which in lay terms
is international terrorism ordered it to
terminate the crimes and pay substantial
reparations which would go far beyond
paying off the huge debt that's
strangling Nicaragua the court was
dismissed as a hostile forum to quote
the New York Times editors reflecting
the prevailing view of the United States
then vetoed two Security Council
resolutions affirming the court judgment
with Britain politely abstaining and it
proceeded to escalate the attack the
targeted country was devastated thinking
further into misery after the u.s. took
over again in 1990 by now 60 percent of
children under 2 suffer severe
malnutrition and probable brain damage
while much of the population survives on
remittances that's a radical change from
20 years earlier when Washington was
panicked by reports from UNICEF the
World Bank and other international
agencies about what they called
Nicaragua's remarkable achievements that
were laying a solid foundation for
long-term socio-economic development
while the country enjoyed one of the
most dramatic improvements in child
survival in the developing world no
problems about that now and if there was
anyone who actually fit the category of
conservative if there was such a
category of people they would have a
very easy way to deal with the fact that
60% of the children under 2 are
suffering probable brain damage namely
by paying their debts simple
conservative principle but that's beyond
unthinkable compassionate conservatives
want to go beyond that if they existed
but they're much more interested in
making political capital over the fact
that a woman in a vegetative state
shouldn't be allowed to die in dignity
the significance of matters like these
in Washington Western culture generally
is revealed by the recent appointment of
John Negroponte II to the new position
of Director of intelligence
he was the ambassador to Honduras
running the world's largest CIA station
not because Honduras is of any
importance but because he was
supervising the international terrorist
war for which Washington was condemned
by the International Court of Justice
and the Security Council absent the veto
he also part of his job was to deny
regularly gruesome state crimes in
Honduras so that the military aid could
continue to flow for international
terrorism when the inter-american Court
tried Honduras an indeed convicted under
oath for these crimes they requested
that negroponte II testify but the
Reagan and Bush number-one
administration's refused to allow him to
appear there has been virtually no
reaction to the appointment of a leading
international terrorist to the top
counterterrorism position in the world
at the very same time the heroine of the
popular struggle that overthrew the
murderous thug Somoza
was denied a visa to teach at the
Harvard Divinity School as a terrorist
also eliciting little reaction or will
would not have known whether to laugh or
to weep rejection of the principle of
universality is understandable just
consider the consequences if we were
willing to
even admit the possibility of attending
to elementary moral principles
it really is unthinkable if the United
States and its allies are granted the
right of what's called anticipatory
self-defense against terror in accord
with the elite consensus then a fortiori
cuba nicaragua host of others have long
been entitled to carry out terrorist
acts within the united states because
there is no doubt of its involvement in
very serious terrorist attacks against
them extensively documented in
impeccable sources classified US
government documents and so on and in
the case of nicaragua even condemned by
the world court and the Security Council
absent the veto again and surely Iran
would be entitled to do so today in the
face of very serious threats the
conclusions are of course utterly
outrageous and advocated by no one and
there are still more still more
outrageous conclusions no one for
example would argue that Japan exercised
the legitimate right of anticipatory
self-defense when it bombed military
bases in the US colonies of Hawaii and
the Philippines even though the Japanese
knew that b-17 Flying Fortresses were
coming off the Boeing production line
and they were surely familiar with the
public discussions in the United States
explaining how these planes could be
used to incinerate depends wooden cities
in a war of extermination flying from
Hawaiian and Philippine bases to burn
out the industrial heart of the Empire
with fire bombing attacks on the teeming
bamboo antiques as Air Force general
Chenault recommended in 1940 that's a
far more powerful justification for
anticipatory self-defense than anything
by bush and Blair and their associates
so it's wise not to consider not even to
even imagine entertaining the most
elementary of moral principles
Washington's unilateral right to force
was articulated publicly by the Bush
administration and the national security
strategy of September 2002 breaking no
new ground however writing in foreign
affairs the main establishment journal
even before the 2000 election
Condoleezza Rice condemned what she
called the reflexive appeal to notions
of international law and norms and the
belief that the support of many states
or even better of institutions like the
United Nations is essential to the
legitimate exercise of power by the
United States that is the usual
exception prevails this extremist
position has long been completely
conventional I'll just keep to the
liberal end of the spectrum for a few
illustrations the elder statesman and
Kennedy advisor Dean Acheson informed
the American Society of international
law in 1963 that his words no legal
issue arises when the United States
responds to a challenge to its power
position and prestige by terror in this
case he was speaking shortly after the
Cuban Missile Crisis which had brought
the world to the brink of nuclear war a
few months earlier we only learned
recently how close it was an important
part of the background to this virtual
annihilation of the species important
part of it was the was Kennedy's
campaign to bring the terrors of the
earth to Cuba phrases historian and
Kennedy advisor Arthur Schlesinger
in his biography of Robert Kennedy who
was assigned responsibility for bringing
the terrors of the earth to Cuba and the
campaign of international terrorism was
in fact no slight matter and escalated
in later years still keeping to the
liberal side of the spectrum the Clinton
doctrine was that the United States will
if it chooses resort quoting again
resort to unilateral use of military
power to defend vital interests such as
ensuring uninhibited access to key
markets energy supplies and strategic
resources without even the pretext that
bush and Blair devised taken literally
the Clinton doctrine is much more
expansive than with his national
security strategy which aroused the
enormous fear and concern around the
world and elicited very harsh criticism
at once even within the foreign policy
establishment in the United States the
more expansive Clinton doctrine contrast
was barely noticed the international
affairs literature makes the difference
clearer as explained by Clinton's
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
although writing in foreign affairs she
pointed out that with regard to the Bush
Doctrine that every president has such a
doctrine in his back pocket
but it is simply foolish to smash people
in the face with it and to implement it
in a manner that will infuriate even
allies a little tact is useful in other
words so it's not good form to declare
that there is no United Nations when the
United States leads the United Nations
will follow when it suits our interest
to do so we will do so when it does not
suit our interests we will not or
perhaps it is good form the author of
the words I quoted was just appointed
and that US ambassador to the United
Nations John Bolton
the attitudes on use of force of the
elite consensus receive a an instructive
expression in the scholarly literature
we one of the leading American
Historians Yale University professor
John Lewis Gaddis published the first
book scholarly book that goes into the
historical roots of the Bush
administration so-called pre-emptive war
doctrine which he basically supports
with the usual provisos about style and
tactics
Gaddis traces the doctrine to one of his
intellectual heroes the great grand
strategist John Quincy Adams referring
specifically to the justifications that
Adams provided for Andrew Jackson's
conquest of Florida and what's called
the first Seminole War in 1818 Adams
argues that the war was justified in
self-defense
Gatiss agrees in goddess's version after
britain sacked washington in 1814 u.s.
leaders recognized that expansion is the
path to security that's the leading
motif expansion as the path to security
and therefore conquered Florida a
doctrine now expanded to the whole world
by Bush and Gaddis concludes that when
Bush warned quoting him that Americans
must be ready for pre-emptive action
when necessary to defend their Liberty
and defend our lives
he was echoing an old tradition rather
than establishing a new one
reiterating principles that presidents
from Adams to Woodrow Wilson would all
have understood very well all of Bush's
predecessor Gatiss explains recognized
that America's security was threatened
by what he calls failed States dangerous
power vacuums that the US should
to guarantee its own security from
Florida in 1818 to Iraq in 2003 caddis
is a good historian he cites the right
historical sources primarily historian
William Earl weeks did the major
scholarly work on the Seminole Wars but
Gattis omits what they say and so let me
fill in a few of the details which are
not uninformative weeks describes in
lurid detail this is mostly quotes know
at Jackson's exhibition of murder and
plunder in the first Seminole War which
was just another phase of his project of
removing or eliminating Native Americans
from the southeast which had been
underway long before the sacking of
Washington in 1814 which was totally
irrelevant Florida was a problem both
because it had not yet been incorporated
into what the founding fathers called
the expanding American Empire and
because it was a haven for Indians and
runaway slaves fleeing either the wrath
of Jackson or slavery there was in fact
an Indian attack which Jackson and Adams
used as a pretext namely after US forces
drove a band of Seminoles off their
lands killing several of them and
burning their village to the ground they
retaliated by attacking a military
supply boat and seizing the opportunity
Jackson embarked on a campaign of terror
devastation and intimidation destroying
villages and sources of food and a
calculated effort to inflict starvation
on the tribes who sought refuge from his
wrath and the swamps and so matters
continued leading to a famous state
paper in which Adams endorsed Jackson's
unprovoked aggression to establish in
Florida the Dominion of this Republic
upon the odious basis of violence and
bloodshed
these words of the Spanish ambassador
are a painfully precise description
week's rights Adams had consciously
distorted dissembled lied about the
goals and conduct of American foreign
policy to both Congress and the public
weeks continues grossly violating his
proclaimed moral principles implicitly
defending Indian Removal slavery and the
use of military force without
congressional approval
Adams recognized what weeks called the
absurdity of his explanations but in
Adams own arms his own words he felt
that it is better to err on the side of
vigor than on the side of weakness to
speak in ways clearer than truth as Dean
Acheson was to express the same
sentiment in the earlier in the early
post-war years the account Adams gave
weeks right stands as a monumental
distortion of the causes and conduct of
Jackson's conquest of Florida reminding
historians not to search for truth in
official explanations of events the
crimes of Jackson and Adams proved but a
prelude to a second war of extermination
against the Seminoles in which the
remnants either fled to the west to
enjoy the same fate later or were killed
or forced to take refuge in the dense
swamps of Florida all of this is
remembered in American culture by the
fact that the Seminoles are now the
mascot of leading the football team wins
the football championship
weaks stresses the important point that
by endorsing Jackson's crimes Adams
shifted the power to make war from
Congress to the executive in violation
of the Constitution the principle
remains in force not troubling strict
constructionists
weeks points out that Adams also
established on quoting and the
presidential rhetoric of Empire designed
to MUP to mobilize at
Marshall public and congressional
support for its policies durable and
essential aspect of American diplomacy
inherited and elaborated by successive
generations of American statesmen but
fundamentally unchanged over time the
rhetorical framework he points out rests
on three pillars the assumption of the
unique moral virtue of the United States
the assertion of its mission to redeem
the world by spreading its professed
ideals and the American Way of life and
the faith in the nation's divinely
ordained destiny the theological
framework reduces policy decision policy
issues to a choice between good and evil
thus undercuts reasoned debate and thins
off the dred threat of democracy critics
can be accused of anti-american and
Americanism which is an interesting
concept borrowed from the lexicon of
totalitarianism the issue of defense
against Britain the only potential enemy
didn't arise the British Minister Castle
ray was so eager to cement
anglo-american relations that he even
overlooked Jackson's murder of two
innocent British citizens which Adams
defended for what he called its salutary
efficacy for terror and example week
suggests that Adams was heeding the
words of passages his favorite historian
that crime once exposed had no refuge
but you know audacity also a principle
that persists well sealing filling in
these and quite a few other instructive
omissions the picture provided by
goddesses scholarly sources lends
considerable support to his judgement
about the precedents for the Bush
Doctrine and its implementation from
Adams through what's called wilsonian
idealism and on to the present sure
that's uh needless to say this should be
very familiar to anyone
familiar with British history and many
others as for the expansion of the
precedents to the entire world others
can make their own judgments and they
have fear and often hatred of the United
States have risen to unprecedented
Heights significantly increasing the
threat of terror as was anticipated and
also anticipated by the United States
and certainly by Britain and also
increasing the threat of ultimate doom
the same is true of the extension of the
Clinton doctrine of control of space for
military purposes to Bush's doctrine of
quoting ownership of space which may
mean instant engagement anywhere in the
world putting any part in the world at
risk of instant destruction
that's the space-age version of the
Adams doctrine that expansion is the
path to security well to summarize
briefly there is a spectrum of
articulate opinion on the resort to
military force at one extreme as the
post-war consensus formally articulated
in the UN Charter reiterated at the
South Summit and once again by the
high-level UN panel the rest of the
spectrum and basically adopts the
principle that the United States is
uniquely exempt from international law
and delegate this right to its client
and entitled to resort to any measures
it chooses to respond to a challenge to
its power position and prestige and to
ensure inhibited access to key markets
energy supplies and strategic resources
just keeping to the liberal
internationalist end of the spectrum I
should stress again however that the
American public keeps quite firmly to
the post-war consensus that is virtually
excluded from the political system and
to a large extent from our ticket
opinion well at the margins we do find
more nuanced opinions on the resort to
war one of the most important is the
International independent commission on
ink of inquiry into the Kosovo war which
was headed by the distinguished South
African juror Justice Richard Goldstone
the Commission rendered the harshest
criticism of the NATO bombing anywhere
near the mainstream concluding that it
was illegal but legitimate illegal for
obvious reasons but despite its
illegality quoting it was legitimate
because all diplomatic avenues had been
exhausted and there was no other way to
stop the killings and atrocities in
Kosovo justice Goldstone concluded that
the UN Charter may need revision in the
light of the report of the commission
that he headed that was the conclusion
rejected by the UN panel last December
the NATO intervention Goldstone explains
is too important a precedent for it to
be regarded as an aberration why because
it was cowered carried out by the
powerful States he also dismissing
routinely the principle of universality
he also stressed the need for objective
analysis of human rights abuses well one
question that objective analysis might
address is whether indeed as the
Commission concluded all diplomatic
options had been exhausted in Kosovo
fact is that when NATO decided to bomb
there were two diplomatic options on the
table and NATO proposal in a Serbian
proposal after 78 days of bombing a
compromise with rates between them which
suggests that diplomatic options may
well have been available a second
question more important is whether
indeed there was no other way to stop
the killings and atrocities in Kosovo as
the
independent commission asserts clearly a
crucial matter here objective analysis
happens to be unusually easy there's a
vast documentary record from impeccable
Western sources US State Department
published several compilations of
documents the British Parliament had a
lengthy investigation NATO OSCE others
they all reach the same conclusion
overwhelmingly the killings and the
atrocities followed the bombing in the
extensive literature on this topic from
media to scholarship the documentation
is almost universally ignored and the
chronology is reversed I've reviewed the
dismal record elsewhere and put it aside
here justice Goldstone is in fact
unusual and that he recognizes the facts
in his words the direct result of the
bombing was that almost a million people
fled Kosovo into neighboring countries
and about 500,000 were displaced within
Kosovo itself a tremendous catastrophe
for the people of Kosovo a catastrophe
that was compounded by major crimes
under NATO military occupation
afterwards the consequences of the
bombing should certainly have been no
surprise they were predicted by NATO
commander Wesley Clark as soon as the
bombing began quite publicly other
sources make it clear that the Clinton
administration also anticipated the
crimes that followed the bombing and in
fact Clarke confirms that in more detail
and his memoirs it's hard to imagine
that the British authorities were more
diluted Kosovo is in fact an ugly place
before the bombing before the NATO
bombing though regrettably not by
international standards according to the
major Western sources about 2,000 people
had been killed in the year prior to the
invasion many of them by
KLA Albanian guerrillas attacking Serbs
from Albania in an effort as they openly
announced to elisa the harsh serbian
response that could be used to rally
western opinion to their cause
the British government makes the
astonishing claim that until January
1999 two months before the bombing most
of the killings were the responsibility
the KLA guerrilla is attacking from
Albania and the rich Western
documentation reveals that nothing
substantial changed in the two months
that followed up until the bombing one
of the very few serious scholarly
studies even to consider these matters
estimates that serves were responsible
for 500 of the 200 killed this is the
careful and judicious studied by
Nicholas wheeler who supports the NATO
bombing on the grounds that there would
have been worse atrocities had NATO not
bombed so the argument is that by
bombing at a time when most of the
atrocities were attributable to the KLA
guerillas with the anticipation that the
bombing would lead to far worse
atrocities NATO was preventing
atrocities the fact that this is the
argument contrived by the most serious
analysts tells us a good deal about the
decision to bomb particularly when we
recall that there were diplomatic
options on the table and that the
agreement reached after the bombing was
a compromise between them formally at
least NATO instantly violated the
agreement
well Kosovo is one of the two great
achievements that were brought forth to
give retrospective proof that for the
first time in history states were
observing principles and values under
the guidance of their anglo-american
tutors and that the Charter must be
revised to allow the West to carry out
humanitarian it
the other example adduced was east-timor
that example is truly atrocious that it
can even be brought up without shame as
a remarkable comment on Western
intellectual culture and here almost the
entire West is complicit the US and
British role are by far the worst that's
extensively documented in print so I'll
skip it along with some other recent
examples that merit discussion and I
think lead to the same conclusions
well one case that can hardly be ignored
has to do with the bush Blair invasion
of Iraq which is based on a single
question in their words as they and
their associates repeatedly emphasized
Iraq's refusal to obey Security Council
orders to stop developing weapons of
mass destruction after the collapse of
these pretexts we were solemnly informed
that the justification was not
anticipate Ori self-defense as had been
insistently proclaimed but rather Bush's
messianic vision to bring democracy to
the world as the new version is
described by the liberal press
well reactions to the announcement of
the messianic vision ranged from
rapturous aw to critical commentary
which praised the nobility and
generosity of the vision but warned that
it may be beyond their means the
beneficiaries may be too backward might
be too costly that this is the guiding
vision and always has been it is
presupposed throughout a self-evident
it's hard to find an exception within
the mainstream
you might try all that was missing was
evidence evidently the declarations of
our leaders suffice
massive counter-evidence up to the
present can be dismissed as irrelevant
without comment
well these strongest witnesses for the
defense should be the leading scholars
and the most enthusiastic advocates of
what's called democracy promotion the
most prominent among them is the
director of the democracy and rule of
law project at the Carnegie Endowment
Thomas Carruthers he's just published a
book reviewing the record of democracy
promotion since the end of the Cold War
and he finds what he calls a strong line
of continuity running through all
administrations quoting him now where
democracy appears to fit in well with US
security and economic interests the
United States promotes democracy where
democracy clashes with other significant
interests it is downplayed or even
ignored all administrations are in his
words schizophrenic
with curious consistency he predicts
with regret that Iraq policies will
likely exhibit similar contradictions
between stated principles and political
reality but the dedication to the
principles is nonetheless unquestionable
well didn't take long for his
predictions about Iraq to be fulfilled
the occupation authorities worked
assiduously
to avert the threat of democracy but the
US and Britain were compelled with great
reluctance to permit elections that was
a major triumph of nonviolent resistance
a few competent observers would disagree
with the editors of the Financial Times
quote them that the reason the elections
took place was the insistence of the
grand ayatollah
ala Sistani and the mass popular
resistance that he supported elicited I
added that Sistani who vetoed three
schemes by the us-led occupation
authorities to shelve or dilute
bush and Blair did not waste a single
moment in declaring that they intended
to subvert the elections that they had
tried to prevent by rejecting any
timetable for withdrawal as a large
majority of the Arab population want and
as even their own candidate yet allowi
was compelled to include as a plank in
his program so the strong line of
continuity persists and the struggle is
far from over
Carruthers also wrote the standard
scholarly work on democracy promotion in
Latin America in the 1980s in part from
an insider's perspective he was in
reagan's State Department as in the
programs of democracy enhancement he
regards the programs as sincere but a
failure and a systemic failure where US
influence was least in the Southern Cone
progress was greatest where US influence
was greatest in the region's nearby
progress with least and the reason
Carruthers explains is that the United
States would tolerate only limited
top-down forms of democratic change that
did not risk of setting the traditional
structures of power with which the
United States has long been allied
Washington sought to maintain the basic
order of quite undemocratic societies
and to avoid populist base change in
short the strong line of community
continuity goes back a decade earlier to
its Reagan
roots and remember I'm not quoting a
critic but the most prominent advocate
of the scholarly advocate of the
programs well it goes back far beyond
but I'll skip that and none of it should
come as any surprise it merely reveals
that the United States is very much like
other powerful states past and present
pursuing strategic and economic
interests of demonym sectors
intellectuals
have the task of covering it up and
making it look as if it's dedicated to
principles and values democracy is fine
as long as it takes the top-down form
that does not risk popular interference
with primary interests of power and
wealth and much the same doctrine holds
internally where enormous efforts are
made to promote to protect the minority
of the opulent from the majority it's a
primary goal of government and quoting
the framer of the American
constitutional system
James Madison explaining explaining what
the new system should be to his
colleagues at the Constitutional
Convention
well popular struggle over these matters
over the centuries has produced many
victories for freedom and democracy but
progress it is not a smooth upward
trajectory there are periods of
regression sometimes reaching so far
that the population is almost completely
marginalized in pseudo elections in
recent years they're run by the same
people who sell toothpaste and cars
literally as we all know very well
business despises and fears the markets
of Orthodox economic doctrine and which
informed consumers make rational choices
in the United States business spends
hundreds of billions of dollars a year
to prevent that outcome projecting
imagery to delude consumers
uncontroversially that's the goal of
advertising not
information and the observation is as
old as Adam Smith who warned that the
interests of merchants and manufacturers
is to deceive or even to oppress the
public as they have done on many
occasions now served by major industries
developed for these purposes when the
public relations industry is given the
task of selling candidates it naturally
resorts to the same techniques as it
does in selling commodities projecting
imagery to delude voters so deceit is
employed to undermine democracy just it
as as it is the natural device to
undermine markets the November 2004
election presidential election in the
United States provides a very striking
example that one that takes real talent
to miss the the United States where
there's plenty of information about it
as polls show voters had little idea of
the stand of candidates on issues in
fact only about 10 percent said that
their vote is based on the candidates
agendas ideas platforms and goals about
which furthermore they were often
deluded as I already mentioned important
studies right before the election and
virtually unreported showed that the
bipartisan consensus is far to the right
of public opinion on major issues that's
a real triumph of marginalization of the
population in a formal democracy and
it's worth adding that the US political
and economic managers are teaching
useful lessons to their counterparts
elsewhere I'm sure you can provide
examples well that's a small sample of
issues of major significance for the
future not least among them is the
propriety of the use of force inquiry
might reveal genuine case
of intervention that are illegal but
legitimate but there's always a heavy
burden of proof the prized example
offered at Leeds this as a dubious
doctrine for the times and tends to
reinforce the measured judgment of the
World Court in 1949 RIA form reaffirmed
in the Nicaragua case and others and
recently reiterated by the high-level UN
panel to quote the court in 1949 the
court can only regard the alleged right
of intervention as the manifestation of
a policy of force such as has in the
past given rise to most serious abuses
and such as cannot whatever be the
defects in international organization
find a place in international law from
the nature of things intervention would
be reserved revert by reserved for the
most powerful states and might easily
lead to perverting the administration of
justice itself inquiry very definitely
does reveal that state terror and other
forms of threat and use of force have
brought the world very close to the edge
of ultimate doom it's actually shocking
to observe how easily such discoveries
are ignored in the intellectual culture
including quite recent and astonishing
ones today surely only the most blind
and irrational will ignore the call that
was issued by Bertrand Russell and
Alfred Einstein exactly fifty years ago
when they said here then is the problem
which we present to you stark and
dreadful and inescapable shall we put an
end to the human race or shall mankind
renounce war
so now professor Chomsky will take some
questions if you do pose a question it
would be helpful if you started by
telling us who you are please yeah my
name is ash our mom from the University
of Nottingham and I come from Algeria
professor Chomsky thank you for the talk
it's a really a pleasure - I'm glad I
came from nothing to hear a speech my
question is regarding the Middle East I
didn't I wasn't lucky enough to come to
you earlier talk today and I wanted to
know what your thoughts were on the
recent developments in the Middle East
especially regarding the recent London
summit and you know what your thoughts
about what would happen or what's going
to happen I didn't hear completely talk
about the London summit er yeah intra
general the Empire particularly recent
developments in the middle seen highest
real Arab conflict with Israel notably
missing thank you and the most important
state was not there namely the United
States because part of the intellectual
culture in England and most of the West
and of course in the United States is to
suppress a very crucial fact the barrier
to a political settlement of the
israel-palestine conflict for the last
at least 30 years in fact beyond is the
United States but we're not allowed to
say that because we are by definition
the enlightened States and that's our
leader or so can't be true but they were
missing and therefore what happened was
mostly irrelevant the actual results of
the summit were pretty much to reaffirm
what happened in the Abbas Sharan truth
the truce is better than no truth it's
better to have less killing than more
killing on the other hand it was
tremendous victory for us
Israeli rejection ISM the only
substantive element and is pretty much
the same in the London summit was to
deny the legitimacy of any form and any
resistance to the military occupation
which means that the military occupation
can continue and that doesn't mean just
the military occupation it means all the
topics which are not discussed and at
the summit or at the Abbas Shoreham
truth and those are would have been in
the core of the conflict for 30 years
increasingly so for the last 10 years
that's the continual takeover of
Palestinian land and resources including
out the most valuable land including
crucially the water resources
Palestinians are left as among the most
water deprived people in the world
because about 80% of their water
resources are used by Israel and this
just continues constantly and read it in
this morning's newspaper with the report
of 3,500 new homes built between to the
east of Jerusalem the paper didn't
report that these programs were started
by the doves Clara being in Paris and
are now continuing to be implemented
went on right through the Oslo
agreements without any great peak year
with the year 2000 clinton's last year
and continues now and now it can
continue without any parting to the
agreements can continue without any
disruption there are some vague talk who
what they like to call Bush's vision of
two states whatever that's supposed to
mean some vision Egon but the fact of
the matter is that for the last since
1976 when the u.s. first vetoed a
Security Council resolution
calling for a two-state settlement
written abstaining the since then this
has been the prime obstacle to
settlement
and unless somebody tries to deal with
that it's over I should finally add that
this is another one of those issues on
which US public opinion is strongly
opposed to government policy in fact the
support for this position in the United
States is about 17 percent 1 7 percent
but that opposition is inactive because
nobody has a clue about what's happening
none of what has been going on for the
virtually none of what's been going on
for the past 30 years even reported and
that you can't get barely even find it
the scholarly literature which is very
obedient I mean there are exceptions of
course but to a large extent that's true
if you look at the serious scholarship
you can find it but nobody knows and the
London summit unfortunately didn't carry
it forward
pretty good another question please
thank you
my name is Alma and I depend n burrow
here and I'm a musician and I have a
question for a professor Chomsky and
looking at the recent events it seems to
me that certainly the past two Bush
elections have demonstrated more than
anything that America is in crisis with
itself as with itself as much as
socially and politically is a crisis
with itself America is a crisis with
itself and a crisis with the - with
itself at what point do the American
people get their country back as it
would seem to me I know we know we know
for example that it's in past
administrations there has always existed
a conflict of interest visa vie business
etc you know that but it would seem to
me now that past revelations demonstrate
clearly that business has perhaps well
and truly taken over to use the local
parent a lock stock and barrel and what
I see for example in Iraq is not a
government in charge but is big business
in complete charge of the complete
operation to the extent that security
seems to be provided for example by
privatized quasi mercenary
so what my question then in a nutshell
is at what point do you see the American
people waking up what are they going to
do about this well first of all what
you're describing could pretty much be
said about Britain and through its whole
history and thing you know there's most
likely differences here and there looks
good
it's
and the British Empire for example was
run by mercenaries to a far greater
extent than the u.s. in Iraq how did
Britain hold India how many British
troops were there it was mostly local
forces Gurkhas see poised taken from one
area sent to kill people in some other
area that so they waited Afghanistan and
Africa and so on the reliance on
civilian soldiers is very rare I mean
it's in fact a mistake that the United
States made in Vietnam you can't they
learn that you can't rely on civilian
soldiers to carry out a murderous
colonial war Britain always knew that
France always knew it others knew it
that's why they really relied either on
professional killers or on local forces
that could be sort of used you know it's
true that the United States that's why
the top military and the top political
Isilon in the United States turned
against the draft against conscription
in around 1970 because they finally
learned the lesson that's familiar to
every preceding imperial power and that
the u.s. itself kept to in and invade
the Philippines and others with
conscripts and it's true now the second
largest force the second largest
military force in Iraq is not written
it's private contractors some of them
former US military some South African
murderers some a lot of Latin Americans
who were a lot of Latin American Chilean
solid or and other other security forces
armed and trained by the United States
to carry out atrocities there there was
much work to do so they're going off to
Iraq but this is just the traditional
pattern and the Alliance to business is
of course very true but there's nothing
novel about that and it's nothing
specific to the United States in
different degrees what's I mean the
United States is not identical to other
societies you know Britain's not
literally but there are very striking
similarities and in many respects what
the United States is now is the
direction towards which European elites
are trying to move Europe including
British it's not including the
marginalization of the population which
is not a new policy but continually
takes new forms Chris Froome Gallants
journalist you said that American public
opinion is in many ways to the left of
the parties do you see an imminent
coherent force beginning to claim some
of that public opinion back as even
Hillary Clinton's beginning to pay
homage to the right do you see any cause
for optimism on the left well first of
all remember what's called the left in
the United States is the New York Times
the I'm not joking the leading
economists who I'm sure you'll be with
giving an honorary degree through one of
these days Greg Manko who's the head of
probably get a Nobel Prize is the head
of the Reagan's economic advisor he just
opened an article by saying I'm not
joking that Harvard University is
probably the most left-wing institution
on the face of the earth so that's the
left you know if anybody knows what
Harvard is like you'll appreciate the
comment but Harvard the New York Times
you know Democratic Party that's
supposed to the left and there are so
far to the right that the most of the
population is way to the left of them
can the actual pup so the real question
is not really about the left
but whether mainstream public opinion
can be made to brought about growth to
enter into policy formation that is can
the country be turned into a functioning
democracy not just a formal democracy
but I think that's question you can ask
your
- it's not a question but specific to
the United States the u.s. may be a
couple of steps in advance of other
industrial societies but it's you know
you can answer the question very easily
yourself is there hope for a change
in the past frequently if you look over
past history its reach the end of
history in a utopia of the Masters has
repeatedly been proclaimed here -
background I think 1880 William Morris
gave a which would be a famous speech in
at Oxford and I wish I could remember
the words because they're quite eloquent
but the theme was he says he knows that
it is received opinion that history is
over and that everyone must subordinate
themselves to the rule of business and
the most brilliant minds tell him that
but he knows he knows that if that's
true civilization is at an end and he
refuses to believe that it's true
and he was right you know following that
king quite important developments
leading to the much higher degree of
freedom and justice that we now have and
that's been repeated over and over me
and yeah this happens to be a moment of
triumphalism for concentrated state
private power the kinds of meeting at g8
here are pretty soon but there have been
moments of triumphalism in the past
repeatedly always shown to be wrong so
yes there's plenty of opportunities to
change it and now the opportunities are
much greater than in the past because
there already is a legacy of freedom
which has been one which was much beyond
what was available in the 1880s or the
1920s or the 1950s to take the last
period in which there was such
triumphalism so sure plenty of
opportunities question is whether people
use them so take one last question
hi my name is Nina and I haven't got a
fully formulated question but I was
hoping that you could say a few words on
on the connection between what you've
been talking about and the abandonment
of the rule of law between states and
what is going on within states
especially the so-called enlightened
ones now to the run-up in the run-up to
the g8 for example the clamp down on
protests and political activism in this
country in the run-up to the g8 there's
a lot of clamp down on political
activism and protest and I was hoping
IDE the you are now a journey protester
to geez running running up to the g8
rebels the security system - okay then
engineer the there's been on well you
know much better than I do plenty of a
lot of hysteria stirred up about
violently threat of violence at the g8
meetings that's what you're referring to
big police presence security forces if
that's what you mean yeah
my suspicion is judging by past events
that that's a conscious effort to stir
up violence the if you take a look at
past the government have a very strong
interest in stirring up violence of such
meetings governments and the private
power that they are closely connected to
they desperately do not want the issues
to be discussed they want to keep the
issues that the protesters are having
mine off the agenda and they would like
it best if nobody I've ever heard about
the meetings but can't have that degree
of secrecy so people hear about them and
they come to have
positions that they want to protest they
don't like the frame were a lot of
people in fact the overwhelming majority
the world as far as we know certainly in
countries where you can take polls is
opposed to the agenda which the
propaganda system calls globalization
it's not globalization it's a very
particular form of economic integration
oriented towards assuring investor
rights and undermining democratic
choices I mean that's a particular form
of international integration and a lot
of people are opposed so for example in
take the North American Free Trade
Agreement NAFTA
it's an unusual agreement that said it's
not about free trade that none of the
free trade agreements are about free
trade it certainly was an agreement at
least if populations are considered
parts of their countries so in Canada
and the United States we have good polls
the majority of the population was
opposed Mexico polls aren't so good so
you can't be certain that there were
plenty of opposition and in fact it's an
unusual agreement and that all three
countries the populations were opposed
and they had alternatives like the labor
movement in the United States presented
a very substantive alternative for a
free trade agreement but that couldn't
be reported so and it wasn't to this day
it's unreported Congress's own research
bureau also proposed the alternative
pretty similar the labor movement that
couldn't be reported
so as rammed through by executive
agreement over popular opposition and of
course those who carry the various
stages forward would like to make sure
the public is out of it well one way to
keep the public out is to make sure that
protests are limited to the
stone-throwing
and police
gas masks and that sort of thing if as
long as the incidents as the event is
restricted to the discussions in private
between the important people and
stone-throwing by the unimportant people
then you can be sure then there's a
victory you know the issues are off the
agenda so that they would like to
stimulate violence as natural and if you
look at the history in past recent cases
it's often been true a good deal of the
stone-throwing and so on turns out to be
police provocateurs or else be just the
very secure strong security presence you
know kind of elicits a reaction from
people who would like that you know what
they regard as fun or something what the
protesters ought to do was be aware of
that and avoid it make sure that they
use their strength which is the issues
in the public support and the
educational importance of building up
organization to counter projects that
they're opposed to what will happen
we'll see we know the record of past
events and it's often been what I
describe sometimes as in Italy and the
general ones it turned out there was a
lot of violence turned out it was almost
all attributable to the police police
provocateurs they black bands would be
breaking windows and banks and a couple
of days later people would see them
walking in and out of the police station
I don't know if that will happen here
but the very attempt to create an
atmosphere of tension and security tends
to promote that type of reaction okay
the University of Edinburgh and the
Gifford committee is very grateful to
Professor Chomsky for coming here to
lecture on these very important topics
and for debating with the audience and
I'm sure you'll want to join with me in
thanking him again
