there are things we can all do I mean
we're all practically everybody here I'm
sure it's from a pretty privileged
sector of the population you have lots
of opportunities you can you can speak
you can write you can organize you can
there you can reach out to other people
if you keep doing it it can have an
impact
it takes a something like the women's
movement a lot of you're old enough to
remember how that happened
I mean if habit began with very small
consciousness-raising groups the groups
of women getting together and talking to
each other and coming to comprehend that
a lot of its internal to comprehend that
you don't have to accept oppression that
there is oppression first of all like if
you'd asked my grandmother is gee
oppressed she wouldn't know what you
were talking about of course she was
hopelessly impressed
it just wasn't that's that's life you
know it's like ask me do you breathe so
just getting to understand that you
don't have to accept the oppression you
can be a free independent person and
then came efforts to expand and there
was better resistance you know it wasn't
easy by any means and in fact there
still is and there's a backlash and so
on and so forth but you just keep
struggling for now the civil rights
movement it didn't get anywhere near
Martin Luther King's dream but it did
have effect
big change from saying Alabama in 1960
know things that are bad but not like
that
and it had the same way it started with
you know goes back decades of course but
it really took off the win a couple of
young black students I didn't know
check out her 60-year 51 years ago they
were arrested beaten and so on pretty
soon
snick form Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee the students got some support
in a Spelman College in Atlanta where a
lot of the snake activists came from
there were two faculty members who
supported them Howard gen and startin
Lind both expelled but they did get some
support and the Freedom Riders freedom
buses started there was little
participation for the North it was very
brutal that people were killed beaten
you know not fun I mean I remember
demonstrations ladies 1965 in the South
where they're just brutal police
violence and repression the federal
marshals there kind of watching him not
doing anything but but that didn't it
didn't get some games it hit a limit it
hit a limit as soon as it reached the
North it's kind of striking Martin
Luther King of 1966 expanded the
movement to Chicago then they were just
dumped on miserably it was a mark that
was an effort to mobilize the poor
mobilize people around slums moved on to
the war in Vietnam
huge antagonism they ended up the way I
described just kind of written out of
history by northern liberals but it did
have success and the successes are real
and we know how they were won
same with thee but everything else
Amandine Vietnam war protest didn't
reach a substantial level but remember
what it was like four years I mean I
when I started giving talks about the
Vietnam War in the early sixties it was
in somebody's living room or in a church
with four people no and in fact if we
tried to do with the college say um I -
you'd have to bring together half it
doesn't optic
and make one of them Vietnam and I hope
that somebody would show up as late as
October 65 that's after what Burnett
fall was describing but I could in
Boston which is a liberal City you could
not have a public demonstration against
the war literally would be violently
broken up often by students that's a
fact in March 1966 yeah this time that
hundreds of thousands of troops were
rampaging in South Vietnam a huge
destruction country virtually destroyed
in Boston again in a liberal City this
is we couldn't have public
demonstrations because they'd be broken
up and we tried to have one in a church
downtown Church Arlington Street Church
now the church was attacked
you know Tomatoes cans the face actually
there was a police contingent I walked
outside now stood next to the police
captain I asked him you know can't you
do something to stop the defacing of the
church he said I can't do anything about
a minute later a tomato hit him in the
face and about thirty seconds the place
was clear but that was going on in March
1966 a year later there were big
demonstration and it's there were no
special kind of tricky strategies just
what we all know how to do if people
don't want to think about facts that try
to bring out the importance of
understanding facts which after all
everyone knows in fact if you look at
public attitudes even Tea Party
attitudes they're kind of social
democratic literally so for example
among Tea Party advocates and of course
the rest of the population a
considerable majority are in favor of
more spending for health and more
spending for education they're against
welfare but more spending to help
say women with dependent children that's
the result of very effective propaganda
Ronald Reagan one of his great successes
was to demonize the concept of welfare
so welfare means for Reagan you know
Reaganite rhetoric a rich black woman
and driving to a welfare office in a
chauffeured Cadillac to take your
hard-earned money and spend it on the
drugs there's nothing well nobody's in
favor of that but are you in favor of
what welfare actually does yeah that
ought to be supportive and I just don't
think it's true that people don't want
to hear about facts and the same is true
on health on the deficit the things I
mentioned you know not a hundred percent
but there's a fairly for example about I
think it's two-thirds of the population
thinks that corporations should be
deprived of personal rights that's a
pretty significant move now that would
undo a century of court decisions not
just citizens united goes back as injury
and that's against the will of about
two-thirds of the population well all of
these things offer plenty of
opportunities for discussion interchange
education organizing activism the
opportunities are all there it's mostly
the will to undertake them that's
lacking and it's not easy I mean that
this costs associated with it so you
know undoubtedly even for privileged
people but you know not the costs that
people like us can't bear not that kind
of cost
