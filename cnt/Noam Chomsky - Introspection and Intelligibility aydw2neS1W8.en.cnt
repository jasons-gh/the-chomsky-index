every fall you will introduce yourself
what do I base it was it's a mere
historian that I work very my still
college in in London
I like ask you unknown about something
that you said is once to a question
questions back any of us was not having
real worlds a reference I thought what
I'd like to to find out is that some of
those cases seem to be cases that are
not accessible or not easily accessible
to consciousness service at multiple
house you pointed out very strange each
a little bit of now in your writings but
I are given it takes you know someone to
point out those kinds of because before
people we own estimate with other
examples though I think the ordinance or
Universalist to stay the facts that
these phrases don't have real-world
reference seems more easily accessible
so example another sentence of yours I
think using like the bank moved across
the room after burning down yeah but you
seemed the perfect totally
straightforward sentence English in a
little more or less we can start the
Train of of events but then when you
reflect on it for just a second you
think huh that's funny you know that
maybe nothing no real object kind of a
then cross the road which is the point a
example so my question is this for the
last kind of example how is it that
we're able to use those sentences so
easily to convey a truth because it
seems on first inspection at least that
you know if a sentence either
a search so presupposes the existence of
an object that does not exist and they
needed maybe these days is an object
that cannot exist it seems a person
section like they should either just a
correct force although they should
collapse as you know a realization areas
actually I should mention that Paul is
the only person who writes on
cymatics who takes any of this seriously
so that's unique but I think what it
means is just that most of what we do is
unreflective it's it's kind of like a
seeing a rigid object in motion when
there's versing the moon illusion or
understanding other people we have the
slightest idea how we do it we can't
introspect into our own behavior any
more than we can introspect into falling
bodies I mean it's just intuitively
obvious that if you have two two objects
of different mass or the one with the
larger mass is going to fall faster this
turns out to be false but if we can't
introspect into something as simple as
say falling bodies or why some things
fall others rise a haven't we hope to
introspect into anything as complicated
as what the human mind is doing you've
got to study it from the outside of the
way you study other things
and when you do very hard there are
illusions about one of the main
illusions in the go through all of
intellectual history is that somehow the
ourselves we ourselves ought to be the
easiest thing to study because we can
look into what's going on
so say you know Tom Nagel asks what it's
like to be a bat and that we can give
the answer but try answering the
question what it's like to be me I don't
think I can answer that question either
at least I can it's you just you can't
pose questions like that that they don't
mean anything we to figure out what it's
like to be me or a bat or a nematode or
no matter how simple it is is a hard
scientific question and to ask what it's
like to be a person even yourself is
maybe the one of the hardest questions
you can write novels about it write
poetry about it or something but you
can't give a discursive account can't
answer the question and I
we can't hope to answer the kinds of
questions that you're talking about just
by introspection somehow when people use
the word bank let's say they
automatically understand what you just
brought out and they don't find it
confusing unless you point out to them
look this technically doesn't make any
sense and then you get things like
sacred piece puzzles but the puzzles
arise because you're trying to present
in a rational form that's you know
somehow objective things that are
handled by people in a totally different
way if a man gets a special dispensation
you get special this little face of it
so every worry is that you know does
this commit as the existence of two
systems of the capable of analyzing
sentences like that there's you know the
the I guess the normal signing
interpretation system which is indeed
and accessible to to consciousness as
you say but then there's this other
property
Kalama see that's funny yeah but it
seems like this faculty is itself doing
some kind of semantic analysis all those
sentences so we simply ran the kind of
words from the you know on the basic but
like a slightly on wondering coffee
system whereby we have two systems that
can do some kind of slant analysis well
I think I think we have to set up two
different systems there's are many
different systems benefits a probably a
high level of modularity in the mind one
of our capacities they call it a science
warming capacity which every one every
has in some fashion is to try to make
sense of our experience in a coherent
way I mean Russell once pointed out that
the only thing we're really confident
about is our own immediate experience
and the rest of inquiry including all
science is to try to give some coherent
account of what this experience is and I
think that's basically right this
science farming capacity which children
use to make sense of the world primitive
tribes use and so on as it's just a
different one it's also trying to make
sense of the use of language so for
example when you a child let's say if
present you in a pH attain type
experiment where you know something
moves and something else moved the child
will automatically set up a content an
invisible contact between them there's
got to be some invisible mechanical
thing that's causing them to interact
because that's just the way we see the
world that in fact that's a major event
in the history of science it was when
Newton showed that doesn't work
when he demonstrated that the evil was
called in the mechanical philosophy the
assumptions about the nature of the
world that were made by every great
scientist you know go a little Ivan
instacart go again to everyone and
Newton himself he believed it that's why
he regarded his discoveries an absurdity
that no person with any scientific
understanding could pay any attention to
but these have to be true that you can't
have a mechanical universe that you have
what he and others regarded as a kind of
awful property action without content
can't happen and our intuitive way of
understanding the world just happens to
be different from the way the world
appears when we apply our science
forming capacities to it there was a
wrenching moment you know in fact that
changed the whole nature of science so
for Galileo of the great scientists of
the early modern period the goal of
science was to show that the world is
intelligible post Newton it changed that
took a long time for it to sink in but
basically changed we give up the hope of
understanding the world we just try to
understand theories about the world
which is totally different
that's what can you get apparent
contradictions like Hume who understood
this pointed out that Newton's the
greatest achievement was to show that
there are mysteries which we will never
comprehend he was referring to things
like action without contact
interaction without
two on the other had to get modern
scientists and philosophers like they do
it they would ever have many others
effect generally who condemned what's
called mysterion ISM that is the that is
there are things that we cannot
comprehend
that's the Dan Dennett lots of others
this is some kind of pathology this
principle we can understand anything
well what they're claiming is something
quite they already internalized the
change of the conception of science from
trying to discover an intelligible world
given up by the time Newton's
discoveries sank in to trying to
discover intelligible theories and maybe
we can develop an Intel about anything
about almost anything maybe anything you
can think of but that doesn't mean that
the world's going to be intelligible so
mysterion is of just almost has to be
true and it was proven by a Newton in
fact though he didn't like it he thought
it was absurd
if human recognized it look it's true
what can we do with a lock recognize so
lock one of his great insights was that
you know what's bold lock suggestion in
the history of philosophy that he said
that just as there are he putted the
theological framework where we can
extract it from that what he said it
just as God added to matter of
properties which we can't comprehend
like action in business so God might
have super added to matter a Faculty of
thinking the hypothesis of thinking
matter which was in with it kind of
opened up the possibility of really
having a scientific psychology dropped
for
the centuries but that's it basically
you have to try to figure out what is
the property of whatever's in there that
allows thinking but I think that gets
right back to your question we can with
our scientific capacities we can look at
this and say hey there's something
really wrong here we have to have
another system for describing it which
doesn't have these internal
contradictions and that's just a
different system than what we call
common sense or ordinary ways of looking
at things and within the that system you
can devote if I could try to develop a
notion of reference so in say physics or
linguistics or any other kind of
organized inquiry you you hope that the
entities that you construct mental
entities that you construct symbolic
entities you hope that they actually
pick out something that exists in the
world so if you scientists think they
found the Higgs boson they would like to
believe that there is a Higgs boson out
there you know and if they English talk
about phonemes they'd like to sit under
something real that's a funny but that's
a totally different notion from the ones
in our ordinary language in fact this
leads to a lot of problems in
contemporary philosophy I think if I
take the whole twin earth discussions or
the idea that you know the water is h2o
all of those discussions they're just
mixing up two different systems
can't ask whether water is h2o in
natural language say English because it
doesn't have the word h2o
that's from another system you can't ask
whether water is h2o in chemistry
because it doesn't have the word water
of course chemists use it informally but
they have h2o and not water there's no
if you actually look at what water is in
human language it's a very complex
notion does not even h2 go but so put
even you can't pose the questions that
are discussed in the between Earth
literature because of mixing two quite
distinct systems it's kind of curious
because the Philosopher's who develop
these systems believe something that
comes from wine that can Stein and so on
that you can that words don't have
meaning except inside a language okay
well if you believe that then if you mix
up to two languages it's going to be
incoherent and you'll get what looks
like a sentence water is h2o but water
is getting its meaning from English and
h2o is getting its meaning from
chemistry and chemistry is a system
which at least strives to have reference
that's the whole point of science and
English is a system of done strive to do
anything it's just it's just like
walking it's what it is that it doesn't
happen either
