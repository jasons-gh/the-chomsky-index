you
stakeholder means workers and community
there's no economic reason economic
principle that says they that a
corporation has to work solely for the
benefit of shareholders in fact you can
read the business literature that you
could just as well have a corporate
system in which the stakeholders are the
ones who were involved and the fact they
can move in and take over as happens
when you get the real worker community
ownership there's various intermediate
means like a CO determination in German
enterprises gives the union's a
substantial state part in degree of
decision-making and it's limited but
something it's not community there its
unions but it can just well be community
you know once you have worker ownership
a workers live in the community and that
already begins to lead to community
involvement through the families and
friends the associations neighborhood
associations churches whatever it could
be so it's kind of a matter of degree
but wherever you have a real worker
ownership that's going to happen
so there's a of course one huge example
that's Mondragon which is both you know
I don't want to say it's utopia is a lot
wrong with it but it's a major very
successful conglomerate production
finance hospitals schools housing and
it's that's owned by the participants
workers and community
there's big sit-down strike at a Chicago
enterprises Republic windows a couple
years ago conglomerate wanted to close
it workers said in they finally managed
to keep it now they've taken it over
they were able to time the conglomerate
or multinational whoever it was just
wanted to get rid of it they they were
able to buy majority shares it's not
workaround and I was just in Ireland
recently and there was a big sit-down
strike at a a plaintiff eat the court
that accept miss cold and I just when I
was there I was able to meet with the
workers who would led the strike I got a
lot of community support people in the
community were bringing in food and so
on
was there some rich businessman wanted
to close it they they kind of then win
everything but they won a lot from the
sit-down strike for them it was a kind
of a victory
I mean there's no kind of algorithm you
know that you can just apply it depends
very much
everything depends very much on
circumstances that's a cute Castro
yeah I mean it was violence to the mast
base first of all is plenty of pop of
support the guerrilla movement extended
the support net overthrew a dictatorship
is probably a good it's it's critical
and also if it's defensive sort of take
sales all authority of Mellon
I'm the clearest been at guerrilla
movement really developed if they're
vicious repression and people have to
fend themselves
so these violence and self-defense but
again there's no simple rule that you
can apply you have to look at this
situation see what's legitimate and what
isn't
