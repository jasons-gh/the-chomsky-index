the war and peace report Amy Goodman
United Nations secretary-general ban
ki-moon said Tuesday he is setting up an
investigation into the attacks on UN
facilities during Israel's recent
assault on Gaza some 2,100 Palestinians
most of them civilian were killed in the
conflict along with 67 Israeli soldiers
and six civilians in Israel well today
we spend the hour with professor Noam
Chomsky world renowned political
dissident linguist and author he's
Institute professor emeritus at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
where he's taught for more than half a
century in a rare event that took place
last Tuesday 800 people packed the whole
of the UN General Assembly to see Noam
Chomsky ambassadors and the public from
around the world the event was hosted by
the exercise of the inalienable rights
of the Palestinian people Noam Chomsky
gave a major address and I followed with
a public interview first the speech it's
a pleasure to be here to be able to talk
with you and discuss with you afterwards
many of the world's problems are so
intractable that it's hard to think of
ways even to take steps towards
mitigating them the israel-palestine
conflict is not one of these on the
contrary the general outlines of a
diplomatic solution have been clear for
at least 40 years not the end of the
road nothing ever is but a significant
step forward and the obstacles to a
resolution that are also quite clear the
basic outlines were presented here in a
resolution brought to the UN Security
Council in January 1976 it called for a
two-state settlement on the
internationally recognized border
and now I'm quoting with guarantees for
the rights of both states to exist in
peace and security within secure and
recognized borders the resolution was
brought by the three major Arab states
Egypt Jordan Syria sometimes called the
confrontation States Israel refused to
attend the session the resolution was
vetoed by the United States a u.s. veto
typically is a double veto the veto the
resolution is not implemented and the
event is vetoed from history so you have
to look hard to find the record but it
is there that has set the pattern that
has continued since the most recent u.s.
veto was in February 2011 that's
President Obama when his administration
vetoed a resolution calling for
implementation of official US policy
opposition to expansion of settlements
and it's worth bearing in mind that
expansion of settlements is not really
the issue it's the settlements
unquestionably illegal with long with
the infrastructure projects supporting
them for a long time there has been an
overwhelming international consensus in
support of a settlement along these
general lines the pattern that was set
in January 1976 continues to the present
Israel rejects a settlement of these
terms and for many years has been
devoting extensive resources to ensuring
that
will not be implemented with the
unremitting and decisive support of the
united states military economic
diplomatic and indeed ideological by
establishing how the conflict is viewed
and interpreted in the united states and
within its broad sphere of influence
there's no time here to review the
record but its general character is
revealed by a look at what has happened
in gaza in the past decade carrying
forward a long history of earlier crimes
last august august 26th
a ceasefire was reached between israel
and the palestinian authority and the
question on all our minds is what are
the prospects for the future
well one reasonable way to try to answer
that question is to look at the record
and here - there is a definite pattern
ceasefire is reached israel disregards
it and continues its steady assault on
Gaza including continued siege
intermittent acts of violence more
settlement and development projects
often violence in the West Bank
Hamas observes the ceasefire as Israel
officially recognizes until some Israeli
escalation elicits a Hamas response
which leads to another exercise of
mowing the lawn in
Israeli Harland's each episode more
fierce and destructive than the last the
first of the series was the agreement on
movement and access in November 2005
I'll give a close paraphrase of it it
called for a crossing between Gaza and
Egypt at Rafa for the export of goods
and the transit of people continuous
operation of crossings between Israel
and Gaza for the import and export of
goods and the transit of people
reduction of obstacles to movement
within the West Bank bus and truck
convoys between the West Bank and Gaza
the building of a seaport in Gaza the
reopening of the airport in Gaza that
Israel had recently destroyed these are
essentially the terms of successive
cease fires including the one just
reached a few weeks ago the timing of
the November 2005 agreement is
significant this was the moment of
Israel's disengagement as it's called
from Gaza the removal of several
thousand Israeli settlers from Gaza this
is depicted as a noble effort to seek
peace and development but the reality is
rather different the the reality was
described over quickly by the Israeli
official who is in charge of negotiating
in implementing the ceasefire the vice
gloss
confident of then Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon as he explained to the Israeli
press the goal of the disengagement I'm
quoting him was the freezing of the
peace process so as to prevent the
establishment of a Palestinian state and
to ensure that diplomacy has been
removed indefinitely from our agenda the
reality on the ground is described by
Israel's leading specialists on the
occupation historian respected historian
Edith xerath all Israel's leading
diplomatic correspondent Akiva Eldar
wrote the major book the standard work
on the settlement project called Lords
of the land referring to the settlers
what they say about the disengagement is
this they say the ruined territory and
by then it was ruined largely part of
the reason for the removal of the
settlers the renew ruined territory was
not released for even a single day from
Israel's military grip or from the price
of the occupation that the inhabitants
pay every day after the disengagement
Israel left behind scorched earth
devastated services and people with
neither a present nor future the
settlements were destroyed in an
ungenerous move by an unenlightened
occupier which in fact continues to
control the territory and to kill an
arrest its inhabitants
by means of its formidable military
might that's an accurate description
from the most respected sore Israeli
source the Oslo Accords 20 years ago
established that Gaza and the West Bank
are an indivisible territorial unity
whose integrity cannot be broken up for
20 years the United States and Israel
have been dedicated to separate Gaza and
the West Bank in violation of the
Accords that they had accepted and a
look at the map explains why Gaza offers
the only access to the outside world of
Palestine
if Gaza is separated from the West Bank
whatever autonomy might ultimately be
granted in the West Bank would be
imprisoned Israel on one side the
hostile Jordan ally of Israel on the
other side and in addition one of
Israel's slow and steady us-backed
policies is to take over the Jordan
Valley but a third of the West Bank much
of the arable land which would
essentially imprison the rest even more
more tightly if Gaza is separated from
the West Bank that's the major
geostrategic
reason for the Israeli insistence with
us backing on separating the two in
violation of the Oslo agreements and the
series of cease fires that have been
reached since November 2005 well the
November 2005 agreement lasted for a few
weeks in January 20 2006 a very
important event took place the first
full free election in the Arab world
carefully monitored recognized to be
free and for fair it had one flaw
came out the wrong way you must promise
won the Parliament control of Parliament
US and Israel didn't want that you may
recall at that period the slogan on
everyone's lips was democracy promotion
the highest us commitment in the world
was democracy promotion here was a good
test democracy election came out the
wrong way the u.s. instantly decided
along with Israel to punish the
Palestinians for the crime of voting the
wrong way a harsh siege was instituted
other punishments violence increased the
United States immediately began to
organize a military coup to overthrow
the unacceptable government that's quite
familiar practice I won't go through the
record the European Union to its shame
and discredit and went along with this
there was an immediate Israeli
escalation that was the end of the
November agreement followed by major
Israeli onslaught in 2007 a year later
Hamas committed even a greater crime
than winning a fair election it
preempted the planned military coup and
took over the Gaza that's described in
the West in the United States most of
the West as Hamas is taking over Gaza by
force which is not false but something
is omitted the force was pre-empting a
plan the military coup to overthrow the
elected government that was a serious
crime it's bad enough to vote the wrong
way in a free election that the
preemptive
u.s. plan military coup is far more
serious the attack on Gaza increased
substantially at that point major
Israeli onslaught
finally in January January 2008 another
ceasefire was reached terms were pretty
much the same as those that I quoted
Israel publicly rejected the ceasefire
so that it would not abide by it
Hamas observed the ceasefire as Israel
officially recognizes despite Israel's
refusal to do so now that continued
until November 4th 2008 on November 4th
which was the day of the u.s. election
Israeli forces invaded Gaza killed half
a dozen Hamas militants that led to a
two Kassam rockets attacking Israel huge
Israeli response lots of killings all
Palestinians as usual in the end of by
the end of December a couple of weeks
later Hamas offered to renew the
ceasefire the Israeli cabinet considered
it rejected it this was a dovish cabinet
led by a hood owner
rejected it and decided to launch the
next major military operation that was
cast led which
was a horrible operation so much so that
it caused an very substantial
international reaction investigations by
United Nations Commission on the
International Human Rights Watch in the
middle of the this assault the assault
incidentally was carefully timed to end
immediately before President Obama's
inauguration he had already been elected
but he wasn't inaugurated yet so when he
was asked to comment on the ongoing
atrocities he responded by saying that
he couldn't do so the United States has
only one president and he wasn't
president yet he was talking about lots
of other things but not this the attack
was time to end immediately before the
inauguration so he therefore could
respond to the questions by saying well
now's not the time to look at the past
let's look forward to the future
diplomats know very well that that's a
standard slogan for those who are
engaged in serious crime let's forget
about the past let's look forward to a
glorious future well that was in right
in the middle of the assault the
Security Council did a pass a resolution
unanimously us abstaining calling for an
immediate ceasefire with the usual terms
that was January 8 2009 it was never
observed and it broke down completely
with the next major episode of mowing
the lawn in November 2012 you can get a
good sense of what was going on by
looking at the casualty figures for the
year 2012
79 people were killed 78 of them
Palestinians the usual story professor
Noam Chomsky speaking last Tuesday in
the hall of the UN General Assembly
before 800 people in an event hosted by
the UN Committee on the exercise of the
inalienable rights of the Palestinian
people will return to a speech and my
public interview with him in a moment
