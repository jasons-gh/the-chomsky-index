national waters in transit between
Lebanon and ciphers killing people
kidnapping others taking them to Israel
either for interrogation or simply as
hostages keeping them in jail for years
some people are still in jail without
charges not many years but that's all
correct their charges are correct but
that doesn't justify the hijacking on
the assumption which I accept at least
that violence is not legitimate in
retaliation against even worse
atrocities or as preemption against
future atrocities violence is not
legitimate in such cases so we can
dismiss those claims though they're in
fact correct and incidentally the
us-israeli hijackings and remember if
Israel does it we're doing it those
hijackings are also out of the
historical record I mean occasionally
you'll find a reference to them in a you
know the bottom column on something or
other but they're not part of the
history of terrorism the hijackers of
the Achille Lauro claimed that this was
retaliation for the bombing of Tunis
couple days earlier well we dismiss that
with contempt on the same principle
namely violence is not justified in
retaliation or a preemption and assuming
that we can rise to the level of the
minimal moral level that I mentioned
earlier if we're not confirmed
hypocrites in other words then some
consequences follow about other acts of
retaliation and preemption but that's
too obvious to talk about so I'll just
leave it to you to think about well
that's 1985 the peak year of
international terrorism in the Middle
East it's a as a research project you
might see if i left out anything that is
a competitor for the prize and not aware
of it none are mentioned in the
literature
on terrorism well notice that as I said
at the beginning you don't really have
to work very hard to see these things
you have to work very hard not to see
them takes a really good education to
miss this it's a think about it and see
1985 was of course not the first or the
last act of international terrorism in
the Middle East there are many others
quite important for example in 1975
Israel meaning Israeli pilots with us
planes and you escort in December 1975
the bomb the village in Lebanon killing
over 50 people no pretext was offered
but everybody knew what the reason was
at that time the UN Security Council was
meeting to consider a resolution which
was supported by the entire world with
marginal exceptions only one crucial
exception the United States which meet
the resolution calling for a diplomatic
settlement of the israel-palestine
conflict incorporating UN 242 and all of
its wording the main resolution security
and you know territorial integrity all
those nice things on the internationally
recognized border the offending part of
this one was that it also referred to
Palestinian national rights and that's
not acceptable to the United States it
rejected them then it rejects them now
contrary to a lot of nonsense that you
read the US vetoed the resolution that
terminated didn't term Atmos continue
another still going on in fact year
after year of efforts at diplomatic
settlement which US has unilaterally
blocked Israel doesn't have a veto at
the Security Council so they reacted to
the debate by bombing Lebanon on killing
50 people without a pretext that's not
in the annals of international terrorism
either there are more read many more
recent cases including the two invasions
of
yitzhak rabin and Shimon Peres in 1993
in 1996 us supported in Lebanon us
ported both of them lots of deaths
hundreds thousands of people who driven
out and so on Clinton had to back off
his support for the 1996 invasion after
the kana massacre over a hundred people
in a UN refugee camp that point he said
can't handle this anymore a better leave
there was no pretext of self defense in
this case this is just outright
international terrorism or maybe
aggression and it continues so let's go
up to the current Intifada which broke
out on September 30th of year 2000 in
the first couple of days there was no
fire from Palestinians with
stone-throwing but Israel was in fact
using Israeli us attack helicopters to
attack civilian complexes apartment
complexes and so on killing and wounding
dozens of people in the first few days
the Clinton administration responded to
this by well by our presidents phrase by
enhancing terror recall a bush condemned
the Palestinians for enhancing terror
last month so I'll use his phrase in
line with the guidelines the Clinton
administration committed itself to
enhancing terror by making on october
third by making the ideal for the
biggest shipment in a decade of attack
of military helicopters to israel and
along with spare parts for the apache
attack helicopters that have been sent a
couple of weeks earlier that's enhancing
terror in the days right after these
helicopters were being used to murder
and wound civilians attacking an
apartment complexes and so on the press
cooperated by refusing to report this
note not failing to report it refusing
to report it it was specifically brought
to the attention of editors and they
simply made it clear that I'm going to
report it there's no question about the
facts
but to this day it hasn't been reported
except in the margins that policy
continues to skip to december 2001 last
month two months ago george bush was
condemning the palestinians for
enhancing terror and he contributed in
the conventional way to enhancing terror
in crucial ways in fact on december 15th
the UN Security Council debated a
European initiated resolution calling on
both sides to reduce violence and
calling for the introduction of
international monitors to assist in
monitoring a reduction of violent that's
a very important step that was vetoed by
the United States went to the who want
to enhance violence evidently it's hard
to think of any other interpretation for
this the press didn't have to bother
giving an interpretation because it was
barely reported if then went to the
General Assembly where as far as I'm
aware it wasn't reported at all and
there was an overwhelming vote
supporting the same resolution this time
the United States and Israel were not
entirely isolated in opposition as
several Pacific Islands joined in now
rule one or two others so therefore you
know not the usual splendid isolation I
don't think I recall that that was
reported a couple of about a week before
10 days before that there was another
major contribution to enhancing terror
the Fourth Geneva Conventions according
to the entire world literally outside of
Israel apply to the occupied territories
the United States refuses it doesn't
vote against this when it comes up in
the united nations that have stains i
presume the reason as the United States
does not want to take such an open
blatant stand in violation of
fundamental principles of international
law particularly because of the
circumstances under which they were
enacting recall that the geneva
conventions were established in order to
write after the second war
war in order to criminalize the acts of
the Nazis so saying they don't apply is
pretty strong statement how are outside
of the United States and Israel the
whole world agrees the International Red
Cross which is the agency responsible
for applying and interpreting them
agrees in fact there's no far as I'm
aware no further question about this
Switzerland which is the responsible
state called a meeting of the High
Contracting Parties for the Geneva
Conventions that is those like the
united states that are legally obligated
by treaty to enforce them it's a high
solemn commitment called a meeting on
December fifth and in Geneva and the
meeting the place passed a strong
resolution saying the determining that
the Geneva Conventions do apply to the
occupied territories which makes illegal
just about everything that the United
States and Israel do there they went
through the list settlements
displacement everything that goes on the
United States boycotted the session they
got another country to boycott them
Australia according to the australian
press under heavy us pressure australia
joined in boycotting them if the u.s.
boycotts it's like a negative vote at
the Security Council or the General
Assembly then get reported and it's out
of history okay but that's another
important step to enhancing terror all
of this took place incidentally in the
midst of a 21-day truce one sided truth
Palestinians weren't carrying out any
acts but a couple of dozen palestinians
were killed including a dozen children
that was right it was right in the
middle of this that these efforts to
enhance terror took place maybe that's
an unfair interpretation and there's
some other motive but I'm not thinking
of but that's what they look like to me
you can think about that in any event
international terrorism in the Middle
East certainly continues as long history
and if you look over the record of
course it's mixed and complicated but I
think you'll find that the balance is
pretty much along the lines that I
described in fact the balance reflects
the means of violence available as it
usually does if you look around the
terror in fact that's why in a whole
range of terror a state there or is far
worse than individual terror for the
obvious reason that states have means of
violence that individuals don't have our
groups and that's what you find if you
look I think overwhelmingly it's
commonly said that terrorism is a weapon
of the weak that's completely false at
least if you accept the official US
definition of terror if you do that then
terror is overwhelmingly the weapon of
the strong like most other weapons well
that's history but all of this stuff is
out of history its history is what is
created by well educated intellectuals
and it doesn't have to have any
resemblance to that thing called history
by naive people and I think if you check
this you'll find that that's true well
that's the Middle East let's turn to
Central America the other main focus of
the plague by depraved opponents of
civilization itself here I can be I'll
be brief because what at least the core
parts are just none controversial in at
least uncontroversial among people have
minimal regard for international law and
international institutions and so on
actually the size of that category is
very easily estimated namely ask
yourself how often we are now going to
say has appeared in the discussions
about the evil plague of terrorism in
the past five months huge flood how much
has been devoted to some on
controversial cases again on
traversal if you think the World Court
in the Security Council an international
law I have some significance well in
1986 the International Court of Justice
condemned the United States for
international terrorism unlawful use of
force and its war against Nicaragua
again I'm going to keep to the
guidelines bend over backwards allow
this to be interpreted just as
international terrorism not the work of
aggression so we'll call it
international terrorism the court
ordered the United States to terminate
the crimes and to pay substantial
reparations billions of dollars Congress
reacted by instantly escalating the war
by new funding to escalate the war the
Nicaragua took the matter to the
Security Council which debated a
resolution calling on all states to
observe international law mentioning no
one but everyone knew who was meant the
u.s. vetoed it Nicaragua then went to
the General Assembly which passed
similar resolutions and successive years
United States and Israel opposed in one
year they got el salvador all of this is
out of history it has to be just
inconsistent with our preferred image of
what history supposed to be I know as I
say you you can check how much this has
been these are uncontroversial cases you
can check to see how much it's been
referred to recently and remember who
were the individuals responsible people
like Negroponte e proconsul of Honduras
Rumsfeld special on wood in the Middle
East and so on and others plenty of
continuity well the the the US reacted
as I said by escalating the war and also
for the first time giving official
orders to its mercenary forces to attack
what are called soft targets that's what
the southern South Southern Command call
them soft targets meaning undefended
civilian target
agricultural cooperatives and so on that
was known it was discussed in the United
States I was considered legitimate by
the left so Michael Kinsley who
represents the left and mainstream
debate the interesting article he was
known as other than a republic in which
he said that we shouldn't be too quick
to condemn State Department
authorization for a tax on undefended
civilian targets because we have to
apply pragmatic criteria we have to
carry out cost-benefit analysis and see
whether as he put it the amount of blood
poured in is compensated by a good
outcome namely democracy what we will
determine to be democracy and what that
means you could see by looking at the
state's next door like El Salvador in
Guatemala which we're okay democracies
and if it passes our Testament it's okay
so in other words international
terrorism is fine assuming it meets
pragmatic criteria and now across the
spectrum you know left to right among we
that is educated privileged intellectual
not the population of course all right
the in Nicaragua the the population had
an army to defend it it was bad enough I
mean tens of thousands of people killed
the country correctly devastated may
never recover but it had an army to
defend it and I'll salvador in Guatemala
that wasn't true the army was the state
terrorists this us-supported state pair
as they were the army there was nobody
defend the population and in fact the
atrocities were far worse also they're
not a state so they couldn't go to the
World Court and the Security Council to
follow legal means of course without any
effect because we people like us have
determined that the world is going to be
ruled by force not by law and since we
have the power as long as we determine
that a state that tries to follow the
legitimate means of responding to
international
neither there's nothing to do but that's
our choice you know nobody else's choice
can't blame anyone else on that for that
the you know in order to carry out there
was however enough popular resistance
not elite resistance but popular
resistance to the atrocities there that
the u.s. had to resort to a cleanse to
an international terrorist network an
extraordinary international terrorist
network remember the u.s. is a powerful
state it's not like Libya Libya wants to
carry out terrorist acts they hire you
know Carlos the Jackal or something the
United States hires terrorists States
we're big guys so the terrorist network
consisted of Taiwan Britain Israel
Argentina at least as long as it was
under the rule of the neo-nazi generals
when they were unfortunately removed
they fell out of the system Saudi
Arabian funding quite a substantial
international terrorist network never
been anything like it in contemporary
terms we might call it an axis of evil I
suppose the outcome again keeping to the
guidelines we believe our leaders the
result was hundreds of thousands of
people slaughtered the millions of
orphans and refugees every conceivable
atrocity the region devastated the
single uncontroversial case Nicaragua
which was the least of them that alone
far surpasses the crimes of September
11th and the others suffered far worse
this is again we're bending over
backwards and giving the u.s. the
benefit of the doubt so we're only
calling it international terrorism
organized by depraved opponents of
civilization itself well that's the
second major area Central America all of
this however is off the record too in
the current history journal and it's
typical in this respect nothing that i
just have referred to its mentioned nor
is it in the whole scholarly literature
in fact except way at the margin
you can check and see it just doesn't
count the 80s are described as the era
of state-sponsored international
terrorism but they're not referring any
of these things the US was trying to
prevent state-sponsored international
terrorism by taking proactive means like
the most massive international terrorist
network that's ever been known that's
very typical of the scholarly literature
journalism and again you can do a check
there's barely been a word about any of
this as the second phase of the war on
terror has been reading declared once
again with pretty much the same people
and the every reason to expect similar
outcomes well let's continue from all of
this an obvious conclusion follows there
is an operational definition of
terrorism the one that's actually used
it means terror that they carry out
against us that's terrorism nothing else
passes through the filter furthermore
that's as far as i know that's a
historical universal i can't find an
exception to that you might try so for
example the Japanese in China and Korea
were defending the population against
Chinese terrorists and going to create
an earthly paradise for them if they
could control the terrorists the Nazis
in occupied Europe were defending the
legitimate governments like machine and
the population from the terrorist
partisans who were supported from abroad
as indeed they were they were
from London and Poland and France and so
on the facts I say I can't find an
exception you might try also as far as
I'm aware this is virtually Universal
among intellectuals educated folks like
us apart from statistical error this is
the line that they take now it doesn't
look that way in history we have to
remember who writes history that'll
leave you with a little bit of
skepticism if you look at actual history
not the one that's written I think
you'll find that this is the case and I
could even maybe suggested as a research
topic to some enterprising graduate
student who aspires to a career as a
taxi driver the well just to continue to
the present let's just take the last
couple of months September 11th was a
perfectly clear example of international
terrorism no controversy about that so
we have to waste time on it what about
the reaction well it turns out the
reaction is also an uncontroversial case
of international terrorism again let's
keep to the guidelines will just listen
to what our leaders say so on october
eleventh president bush announced that
the Afghan but through the Afghan people
that we will keep bombing you until you
hand over people who we suspect of
terrorist acts although we refuse to
provide any evidence and we refuse to
enter into negotiations for extradition
and transfer clear case of international
terrorism I on october twenty eighth at
admirably his British counterpart
Admiral Sir Michael boys who's the chief
of the british defence staff took it a
step for further three weeks after
remembered speak getting rid of the
taliban regime was not a warring that
was an afterthought and three weeks
after the bombing began that was added
presumably so that intellect
would have something to feel good about
or something I don't know anyway three
weeks after the bombing that was added
as a new worrying and Admiral voice
announced to the Afghan people
accordingly I think this is the first
mention of this war aim that we will
continue bombing you until you change
your leadership okay first that was all
very prominent like page one of the new
york times in both cases to both cases
our textbook illustrations of
international terrorism if not
aggression that we're still bending over
backwards and it's all off the record by
usual convention we're doing it so it
doesn't count it's only when they carry
out what we officially define as
terrorism that it counts well it's easy
to go on but let me just returned to the
week thesis there can't be a war against
terrorism at least against as terrorism
is defined in official US documents it's
a logical impossibility these this is a
small sample of illustrations you can go
on easily but it's enough to show that
that can't be true that's the weak
thesis what about the strong thesis that
it's all so entirely obvious that it
won't even be embarrassing to talk about
it because it's all right on the surface
nothing hidden about any of this
everything I mentioned is perfectly well
known you know you'd have to penetrate
anything to discover it no obscure
sources nothing just the obvious
evidence and it's very easily you can
easily add to it this kind of literature
about it for the last 20 years but
that's all of that literature also can't
be discussed because it comes out with
the wrong conclusion so it's treated the
same way terrorism is in our
intellectual culture again the choice
not a necessity so we end up with a kind
of a dilemma if we're on if we're not
honest forget it if we are honest
there's a dilemma one possibility is
just to acknowledge that we are total
hypocrites
that we and then to at least have the
decency to stop talking about things
like human rights and right and wrong
and good and evil and so on and just say
yeah we're hypocrites we want to we have
force and we're going to rule the world
by force period let's forget about
everything else the other option is
harder to pursue but it's imperative
unless we would like to contribute to
still worse disasters that are likely
lie ahead
you
well
it's too soon
you
