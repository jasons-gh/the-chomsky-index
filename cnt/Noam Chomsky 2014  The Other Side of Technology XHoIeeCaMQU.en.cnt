well first of all I think we got to be
clear clear about the facts most of you
judging by your ages know a lot more
about this that I do but my impression
is that the new technology is bringing
about illiteracy not literacy I can see
it directly with I'm gonna get a ton of
email constant flow of email I noticed a
couple of years ago that there's a
change in the character of the email a
lot of it is very short some of it is so
short it actually fits in the subject
line and somebody pointed out to me it's
probably Twitter things these are what
this illustrates is something much more
general that's going on there among
especially younger people than younger
means a lot of people from my point view
that said it's there's a tendency
towards abbreviation like my
grandchildren when they write a letter
it's it's texting you know just get a
couple of symbols on the I notice my own
students that don't read as much as they
used to I mean I used two years ago if I
made say literary references and class
students usually know what it is now
much less actually one of the Guru's of
the new technology I've forgotten his
name said recently that with
contemporary advances we don't need
things like the war and peace or Proust
any longer we can do it very briefly you
know this is something that I think is
it's it's already happening it's even
being studied there are some studies of
literacy among college students over a
longer period and it is reducing there's
much less reading of independent reading
of say literature and much more focus on
things
do very quickly and briefly and so on
there's even some studies preliminary
studies by neuroscience cognitive
neuroscientists which may indicate that
there are neurological changes taking
place as an effect of the reduction of
the rapid stimulation and the kind of
stimulus hunger that comes with it and
the restriction on attention spans that
come from the technology I think it's a
double-edged sword in other words part
it does the new technology does offer
the possibility of achieving greater
thought and understanding but it also
can reduce it I don't know about you but
if I read something on say Kindle that's
very different from reading you the book
you read it in the book you think about
it you go back to the earlier page you
know pay attention to it if you're
reading it on Kindle you're just trying
to get it just go through your head and
so fast you don't remember what was in
there you know I think that's a kind of
a dangerous phenomenon as far as what
education can do I think it should try
to cultivate the values of thought and
reflection doesn't matter how fast you
read this is no advantage to reading
fast you have to read thoughtfully and
carefully and that's the way students
should be induced to look at the
intellectual artistic other treasures of
the world but that's that but I think
they may have to combat the new
technology
