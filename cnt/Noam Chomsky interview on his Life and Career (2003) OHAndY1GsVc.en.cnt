well some of it I do because I find that
intellectually challenging and exciting
and demanding and some of that I do
because I just feel it has to be done so
you know people are suffering bitterly
throughout the world there are a lot of
things we can do about it and that seems
to be a responsibility that comes with
privilege and freedom which we have to
an unusual degree maybe unique degree to
involve ourselves in these issues what
do you think of the United States I
think it's a complicated country it has
wonderful achievements it's in some
domains it's gone beyond any other
country in the world
protection for freedom of speech for
example many other liberties it's got
tremendous advantages incomparable had
the biggest economy in the world over a
century ago yeah I don't think it's used
them properly the there's plenty of many
of the actions that the US government
has taken in the world I think are
deplorable and should be stopped and
reversed and it's you can't really
comment on a country there's just too
many facets to it there's a society
there's a culture there's just too many
things I mean when I take my grandson to
a baseball game as I did last Sunday I
enjoy being part of mainstream America
when I look at US government foreign
policy or the domestic highly regressive
domestic policies I'm extremely critical
Noam Chomsky will be with us for just a
little under three hours and we will go
to the phones in the next several
minutes but for the first part his
program we want to chat a bit about his
life Philadelphia played a big role in
your life what year were you born I was
born in 1928 in Philadelphia
a immigrant first-generation immigrant
family Jewish my parents were very much
involved in fact immersed in the Jewish
community Hebrew culture my father was a
Hebrew scholar ran the Hebrew school
systems my mother taught in it deeply
committed to
Zionist Zionism we have to remember that
that was something different then from
what it is today and actually I grew up
in a community which in which we were
for most of the time the only Jewish
family in a mostly German and Irish
Catholic community and a lot of problems
which incidentally my parents never knew
about but the streets were complicated
places problems for you that they never
give us an example well as I say there
was a lot of anti-semitism of those this
is the 1330s deeply anti-semitic period
the I don't like to say it but I grew up
with a kind of a visceral fear of
Catholics I knew it was irrational and
got over it but it was just the street
experience and there were periods during
these were periods of complex ethnic
conflicts in the cities um there were
times when I was a young teenager where
in Philadelphia there was a curfew I
think a seven or eight o'clock curfew on
teenagers if we wanted to go out in the
evening we had to have parental
authority there were times when the walk
from the subway station to the Hebrew
school was under police guard and it
wasn't just Jews were not you know there
was a lot of anti-semitism but a win in
all directions actually get a pretty
good picture of it from
some of the novels written about the
period describing urban ethnic conflicts
which are complicated and real grew up
in the middle of them
we're had your parents come from and
what were they like my father had come
from Ukraine right before the first
world war escaping the Czarist army my
mother had come from what's now Belarus
her family she came when she was a baby
actually but and the two families were
were first-generation immigrant families
what would they like over your parents
life well had a very warm loving child
that I looked back at it was a lot of
warmth and affection we they were both
working
they taught Hebrew school so I was in
school actually from all day from the
time I was about a year and a half old
and it I was actually in an early years
up to high school in a experimental
school that was run by a Temple
University a dewy-eyed
in a school a wonderful place I don't
know if there's anything like it today
fostered the creative activity there was
no competition that I didn't know I was
a good student until I got to high
school because the question never rose
you know you weren't graded by your
achievements I mean I knew I skipped the
class but I didn't think anything in
particular other didn't or did anyone
else it was a very healthy exciting
intellectual and social environment why
did you decide to go to the University
of Pennsylvania where you got I believe
your undergraduate your masters and your
PhD question never arose you didn't go
into the idea of going public
leaving home was inconceivable yeah we
were working students both my wife and I
you
at home you went to the local school I
worked in the afternoon the the the
concept of going away to college just
wasn't it wasn't in the you know didn't
exist you didn't the question never came
up when did you first get interested in
linguistics that was sort of accident
well it's complicated actually my father
was a Hebrew scholar he did work on
medieval in grammar and growing up as a
child I you know read his manuscripts
and the drafts of the book and so on I
was kind of intrigued but but then I
happened through actually through
political contacts to meet zelich Harris
who I later discovered was the most
important and influential linguist in
the country happened to be teaching at
the University of Pennsylvania I was
actually on the verge of dropping out of
college at that time I was pretty bored
with it as I got in at 16 and a lot of
anticipation and excitement and was
mostly killed in the first year and I
was not really committed to staying I
met him and he drew me back into college
I suspect in retrospect that he was
doing it on purpose but I don't know
anyhow I started taking his graduate
courses and through his influence other
also mostly graduate courses in other
fields and he was an extremely brilliant
and exciting person in many respects and
my interests developed through those
contacts and then on from there when did
you meet your wife Carol she was about 2
years old and I was about four years old
I guess these were closely knit
communities
she was also from a Jewish community or
father that and mother were from
European immigrants and
the families knew each other and we had
sort of met as children and they went
through a kind of similar history you
know Hebrew schools Hebrew camps by time
we were teenagers we interacted in a
different fashion we married pretty
young she was nineteen I had just turned
21 there are people that say there are
two Noam Chomsky's as you know the
language and the political activists
which one of those do you prefer well I
can't really say if the world would go
away I would much I would be very happy
to keep to what's called my professional
work linguistics philosophy cognitive
science and so on which I do find
exciting exhilarating challenging and
demanding and easily could could easily
put my full-time activities into it on
the other hand the other activities in
their own way or difficult rewarding
complicated also challenging and
necessary again if you've just joined us
our guests for the next two hours and 45
minutes
Noam Chomsky who is now located at MIT
how long have you been there almost 50
years what year did you go there and why
I went there in 1955 and actually at
that I had just I had been at Harvard
for four years in a graduate fellowship
and had just gotten a PhD from the
University of Pennsylvania where
actually hadn't been for four years I
had no recognized academic field the
work that I had was doing was didn't fit
anywhere didn't have any academic home
and I had no particular expectations of
going on into an academic career because
they didn't for one thing that did seem
to be any possibilities but I did
receive an invitation from MIT to be in
the electronics lab I don't know a tape
recorder from telephone practically and
anoint nothing about electronics but I
was the electronics lab at the time was
directed by Jerry Wiesner later became
Kennedy's science advisor who was a
pretty very imaginative personally was
he the laboratory itself was a mixture
of all kinds of exciting activities a
good deal of MIT at that time was in a
transition from being primarily an
engineering school to becoming primarily
in fact totally a science-based
University it's a ten-year transition
which had a lot to do with things
happening in American science and
technology and so on and the electronics
lab where I was was the center of a lot
of these activities biology
neurophysiology mathematics linguistics
acoustics just on and on many of these
were experimental efforts it wasn't at
all clear that they were going to go
anywhere some of them succeeded very
well others failed but it was a great
ferment of intellectual excitement and
interaction and challenge now there were
other places like it at the same time
for example the laboratories and as I
was primarily in the electronics lab in
a research position but I also was asked
to do some teaching I did I was able to
teach introductory linguistics and
philosophy courses the first ones in
these areas that had been taught there
but mainly I was my service to the
university was teaching cram courses in
French and German to graduate students
who in those days had to pass a reading
exam
in French and German which they
considered a total waste of time because
they knew they were never going to look
at anything and there was a technique
for sort of getting them through the
exam essentially teaching them to fake
their way through the exam and that's of
course as I was teaching first couple
years on the screen is some shots of
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
which is on the Charles River right
across from Boston in Cambridge
Massachusetts how many students there
you know I think there's roughly last
time I looked it was about four thousand
undergraduates and I think about maybe
twice that many graduate students
something roughly on that order my
background on you says that you have
published 65 political books and 33
linguistic books from a total of 60
different publishers we have been doing
book shows here for many many years I've
never heard of anybody publishing 98
books well a lot of those books are
collections of talks interviews if you
looked at the ones I actually sat down
and wrote you know it wouldn't come as
anything like that what was your first
first book the first book was called
syntactic structures and that was
actually not intended for publication it
was notes for an undergraduate
linguistics course at MIT which at that
time this material was basically
unpublishable it did not belong in any
recognized field I had submitted a
couple of articles to journals which
were returned and I'd submitted a book
for publication and it was returned MIT
press with the was returned with the
sensible comment that didn't seem to
belong anywhere and they oughta wait
until the field exists before trying to
submit a book which was not an
unreasonable comment it did come out 20
years later by then the field have been
established the first syntactic
structures was actually notes which
Dutch publisher who visited the
so I'm sitting on my desk and asked if I
would put it together and let them
publish it as a monograph then they did
what was your first political book first
political book was American power and
the new mandarins which was a collection
of essays came out in 1969 it's just
been reprinted it was essays and taught
mostly a lot of them based on talks
through the 1960s starting around 1963 I
began I became pretty much involved in
the Vietnam War issues and was giving
many talks usually the audiences of two
or three people it was absolutely no
interest at the time but over the years
had built up button to by the late
sixties there were there were way more
invitations and opportunities than I
could take up I was also directly
involved in activism and resistance what
am i have to say four years every time I
came to Washington the first thought
that came to mind was the smell of tear
gas in and out of demonstrations in and
out of jail a number of times and the
the essays were a collection of in the
book were a collection of talks
commentary discussions based on these
activities I have on my lap here a
Norman Mailer book called the armies of
the night and up at the top is a picture
of you back in 1967 what were you doing
there
at the Pentagon that was a big
demonstration at the Pentagon and
suppose it was October 1967 one of the
first large-scale national
demonstrations not the first one of the
biggest on a national level actually
Miller and I ended up in the adjacent
cats and a detention center somewhere
after we were arrested over the years
lots of controversy lots of books we're
gonna go the phones in about ten minutes
and they'll have a chance to deal with
these but the other book that I have in
my lap and I've got a lot of your books
is one that's a small one it's called
9/11 and it it was a best-seller what
was what's your main point in this book
about 9/11
well that book is a collection of
interviews it's a it's not a it's a
sample of interviews and it happens to
be just those that happen to be
electronically stored so for example it
doesn't include the interviews on BBC II
and so on under the right after 9/11
there was a massive requests from the
United States and around the world for
discussion of the events their
background what they meant what they
were gonna lead to and this is a
slightly edited collection of a number
of those interviews the point was if
there is a single point that we should
be aware of the role that we play in the
world what happened on 9/11 is a
horrifying atrocity it's probably the
worst single act of large-scale terror
that's ever taken place I don't think
there's another single case where
thousands of people were killed in one
act on the other hand for much of the
world the response to 9/11 was welcome
to the club we've been through this and
you often done it to us so for example
the forgotten whether I quoted it in
there but the the research journal of
the Jesuit University in Managua
Nicaragua which is one of the main
research journals in Central America
they published an editorial immediately
after 9/11 describing it as everyone did
as a horrifying atrocity expressing
sympathy for the victims
saying you could call it Armageddon and
then they added but we have been through
our own Armageddon in slow motion under
the under massive terrorist attack
organized and directed by the United
States which led tens of thousands of
people killed in the country practically
ruined that may never recovered so we do
sympathise with the terrible atrocity
that was carried out against you but
it's not unfamiliar to us and that was a
reaction through a good deal of the
world now that's why if you look at the
there was an international Gallup poll
taken shortly after September 11th I
think it was about September 20th
roughly in that about a week after
asking this was at a time when the
bombing of Afghanistan had in effect
been announced but had not yet been
undertaken so it was in that interim
period and the question asked around the
world was do you support if what it said
actually is if the perpetrators of the
terrorist attack are identified on that
assumption would you be in favor of
bombing the place where they came from
their refuge and then there were two
questions if it attacked only military
targets second if it also hit civilians
well it was never published in the
United States but the responses were
interesting there was very little
support for the policy that was actually
undertaken and incidentally we should
say that they hadn't identified the
perpetrators but in Latin America which
is the region of most experience with
the u.s. domination and intervention
responses the support was extremely low
it ranged from about 2% and support in
Mexico to about 11% I think in Colombia
and Venezuela the only marginal
exception was Panama
which has a very angular an American
component there and even there 16
percent supported bombing I think 80
percent supported diplomatic means for
the efforts for extradition and that
reflects a history of experience long
experience so yes all over the world
there was overwhelming sympathy for the
victims horror of the terrible atrocity
but a recognition that life's more
complicated we've been on the receiving
end for a long time from European
imperialism which was violent and
destructive and from the US variant of
it and I think it's only the first of
all it's the nearest honesty to face
this but if we're interested in reducing
the threat of terrorism which is
enormous exit if you want to really be
frightened to read the recent heart
Redman study a sponsored study of the
Council on Foreign Relations on
terrorist threats to the United States
and they're pretty awesome
well if you if you hope to reduce and
lessen these threats you have to make a
crucial distinction between the
terrorists themselves who are carrying
out criminal acts and you treat it like
criminal acts and the reservoir of in
which they're concerned their message
kind of resonates even among people who
hate and despise them but nevertheless
recognize some authenticity to what they
say and it's that a reservoir of you
can't really call it sympathy but
understanding where real grievances lie
that have to be dealt with that's true
no matter what kind of terrorism you're
facing if you want to reduce the threat
pay attention to the grievances from
which they arise and if they're
legitimate and then they often are a
deal with them for one thing because
they're legitimate
for another because it's just sanity if
you're hoping to reduce the terror these
are topics discussed in book can Jess
interviews Justin and Noam Chomsky's our
guests and we're gonna go to the phones
we have a call from Maryville Illinois
first up go ahead please hello dr.
Tomsky
um I was introduced to your writings and
works as an undergraduate about four
years ago at the University of Illinois
and I was I was intrigued by your you
know by the straightforwardness that you
had in your writings and I first read
them on V net and anyway my question
it's a two-part question they're
unrelated parts my first question is
what do you attribute the incompetence
of today's leaders in this country as
compared to you know the leaders such as
FDR and in the early 20th century you
know men of distinction and and honor I
know you know presidents like Andrew
Jackson and and some other ones were you
know not very honorable but uh what do
you would you attribute this I mean it's
been it's been decades now where we've
had leaders you know one after the other
just you know promote these policies and
enact these you know these wars and
these you know what do you attribute
that to nice car
that's good well I'm not sure I would
use the word incompetence I mean I think
they're very competent they know what
they're doing they're dedicated
committed they even tell us very frankly
what they're doing so for example the
national security strategy that was
announced last September was a very
clear brazen statement of a program of
sustaining world dominance by means of
force and announcing the intention to
rely on force to suppress any potential
challenge to that dominance that's quite
a departure as a policy statement and it
sent many shutters around the world
including the
foreign policy a lead at home but
there's nothing incompetent about it
it's a very clear explicit statement
Frank statement why they're pursuing
those policies well we can look at them
but if we take an honest look at the
past it's not very pretty I mean we can
ask for example why we were sitting
where we're sitting there were people
here after all lots of them you know
millions of them what happened to them
well the founding fathers were pretty
frank about it they knew what they were
doing
so John Quincy Adams for example many
years after his own very ugly
contributions to this were over did have
a change of heart and he condemned what
they had done for in what he called
exterminating the hapless race of Native
Americans with ferocious cruelty or
words approximately like that they
understood what they were doing they
cleared the continent they conquered
half of Mexico in a war which was
bitterly condemned within the country
correctly it was a terrible war a
century ago the United States conquered
the Philippines killed a couple hundred
thousand people that a good part of the
military command ended up facing war
crimes trials afterwards there was
bitter condemnation of that to Mark
Twain for example leading may be the
leading writer in the United States
wrote very bitter sardonic anti-war
essays and and we can go on the history
has not been a pretty one and that's why
the the after the national territory was
conquered
power extended to the region of the
United States was not a major actor in
the global scene until after Second
World War but it was regionally the
dominant power in the care
in Central America extending to Hawaii
which was taken from its own citizens by
force and guile on to the Philippines
but particularly in Central America and
the Caribbean and those are not if you
take a look at the record there it's not
at all attractive Washington DC for noam
chomsky good morning good day um well
there's more like 300,000 Philippines
and that's my point and my disagreement
with mr. Chomsky its to general mr.
Chavez be specific as a prosecutor in
factually and the facts are known the
body counts are well known and everyone
quotes them incorrectly
that's my disagree with the I like to
work very much and many people follow
you but I think you need to
if Hussein's criminal to be prosecuted
then our involvement and participation
in Helmut Kohl's involvement
participation ATS is a prosecutable
crime also and also our uranium war
crimes or the wars in Ethiopia James
Baker restarted in 91 and not 20 million
Ethiopians are in risk of starving to
death and there's plenty of food in this
world there's no famine without war this
is the heart of the matter and the
generalizations goes farther away from
it and look at their faces see them and
thank you for your time
well I certainly agree with you that one
should be accurate about the facts and
if you would like to bring up some
specific questions about facts be happy
to answer to think about them and if you
know I made a mistake to correct it
you're right about the tremendous
suffering and agony throughout the world
much of it we it's not by no means all
the result of US policy obviously not
problems in Africa are extremely ugly
and complex in the Congo alone several
million people have been killed in the
last few years in the wars that would
not be easy to handle and deal with
though a good deal could be done about
them there's plenty of starvation I
don't think war is the only factor that
lies behind the famine that often
famines take place when as you say
there's plenty of food but social and
political conditions are such that the
food isn't getting to the people who
need it and there's plenty that can be
done about that the AIDS epidemic is
devastating not only Africa but many
other parts of the world and resources
there there are methods of treatment
which require not huge sums of money and
we could dedicate ourselves our portion
of our resources to dealing with that we
have ample resources many of them being
used in destructive ways but your point
is correct there's all sorts of horrible
things going on in the world some of
them were responsible for and there we
have a direct responsibility to
terminate what we're doing and improve
the situation
others are things we could assist and to
the extent possible we have a
responsibility to do that there are
plenty of others which are gonna be well
out of our control this book called
Middle East illusions is in the
bookstores right now by Noam Chomsky as
we go to North Andover Massachusetts
you're next go ahead please Oh professor
Chomsky good afternoon I'm honored to
ask you a question I have when you said
to the grandson that you were able to
enjoy a baseball game with last week
with your love of words and your love of
linguistics I was just curious if you
ever had the opportunity to have any
connection with mr. Edward L Bernays who
was a resident of Cambridge for the last
40 years of his life was first in New
York City and was for almost a hundred
years connected with very powerfully the
public
years work of the American tobacco
company working with Guatemala for a war
that almost was started because of
bananas in the 50s and all of these
different media actions that I believe
have really contributed to where we are
now in our our worldview of we have got
a corporate mentality of destroying what
we don't like taking it over
manipulation of it because his luring
from his uncle Sigmund Freud was
utilized to his best ability with
twisting people's view of what was good
for them so that he could sell products
to them Thanks caller Eddie Bernays
actually I never you're right he lived
in Cambridge we weren't that far apart I
never actually met him but all the other
public relations yeah but I've written a
fair amount I've looked at a lot of his
work and in fact I've written a fair
amount about it I suspect that it wasn't
his Freud who was the big influence on
him but rather in fact exactly what he
said he said the major influence on him
was his participation in the first state
propaganda agency in the United States
Woodrow Wilson's Committee on Public
Information which was established in
order to try to drive a basically
pacifist population into support for the
war that Wilson very much wanted to get
into in in Europe and it succeeded
within a short period of time the
propaganda efforts they were called
propaganda in those days it was more
honest use of terminology the propaganda
efforts of the Committee on Public
Information a very Orwellian name was
did succeed in driving a pacifist
population into raving Andy German
fanatics you know to the point where in
the Boston Symphony Orchestra couldn't
play Beethoven things like that it drove
the country into a kind of hysteria and
the participants in that committee
included many people of subsequent great
distinction and influence Edward Bernays
was one another was walter Lippmann the
leading public intellectual at 20th
century and most important figure in
American media both of them went through
the experience and learned from it and
wrote about what they learned from it
what they learned as Bernays put it in
his a famous book of his called
propaganda late 1920s I think he said
that we have learned that the
intelligent minorities can engineer
consent through the use of manipulation
propaganda and control and we should do
it for the benefit of the public it's
for the benefit of the public that we
should control them and engineer their
consent Lippmann said pretty much the
same thing also drawing from the
experience of the wartime propaganda
agency
he wrote significant important essays on
democracy in the 1920s called
progressive essays and democracy they
were both liberals kind of Wilsonian
progressives he said well we've learned
that there's a new art in the practice
of democracy the art of what he called
manufacturing consent
ranae's his term was engineering of
consent and this is very significant
because the public should not be
participants in the democratic process
they should be spectators not
participants they are ignorant and
meddlesome Outsiders as he put it and
for their own benefit
we the intelligent minority the
responsible men must control them
Bernays is particular significance this
had all sorts of influence all over the
place but in the intellectual culture in
political science and so on but Bernays
this particular influence was exactly as
you say and
he was one of the founders of the modern
public relations industry which grew
into a massive industry right at that
period had it existed before but it
became very important after the at this
time and its goal was to control
attitudes beliefs to marginalize people
to induce to drive them towards what
were called the superficial things of
life like fashionable consumption and
keeps them out of the public arena where
they don't belong
Bernays --is first major achievement was
a program that convinced women to smoke
cigarettes women didn't smoke in those
days but he had an elaborate public
relations program including models
walking down Fifth Avenue you know to
show us with cigarettes showing this is
what modern women are like and it did
succeed in turning women into smokers
with a tol that we need not discuss the
Guatemala case you're correct he was the
public relations
he ran the public relations for the
propaganda effort to support the
overthrow the democratic government of
Guatemala which led to horrifying
atrocities which the country is still
suffering from one of the examples that
we should be anything but proud of and
he did play a role on that you know he
did a lot of other things he's famous at
Cambridge for a campaign to save the
Sycamores on Memorial Drive which was
again a successful public relations
campaign that many people admired
Springfield Massachusetts for noam
chomsky hello good afternoon professor
Chomsky my question to you is do you
believe that a nation should suffer a
tantrum a detrimental cost in order to
compensate for wrongs committed by the
governors of that nation nearby segments
of that nation in the past
I'm not sure exactly what the question
means are we respect your living under
let me see if I can understand it
suppose you're living under a
dictatorship and the dictators carry out
some horrendous Act so you're living in
Stalinist Russia let's see and Stalin
carries out horrible crimes are the
people of Russia responsible for those
crimes well to only a very limited
extent because living under a brutal
harsh a terrorist regime there isn't
very much I can do about it
they could think there's something they
could do and to the extent that you can
do something you're responsible for what
happens suppose you're living in a free
democratic society with lots of
privilege enormous incomparable freedoms
and the government carries out two
violent brutal acts are you responsible
for it yeah a lot more responsible
because there's a lot you can do about
it and therefore the the cost of if
you're responsible if you share
responsibility in criminal acts you are
liable for the consequences Jacksonville
Florida good afternoon hi professor
Chomsky it's an honor to speak to you
sir I'd like to have you addressed the
idea of 9/11 as like a false flag or let
it happen on purpose kind of situation I
mean it's not exactly unprecedented
unprecedented in American history or
world history for that matter especially
given the project for the American
century where Paul Wolfowitz said that
it would take like a Pearl Harbor like
attack on America to be able to
implement their plans and could you
address that for me please well I know
that's a widely held belief frankly I'm
personally extremely skeptical about it
I don't think there's any likelihood
that an action like that could have been
planned and I don't really think there
are any historical precedents for it if
the White House had
and in any way involved in planning this
it would have been an act of absolute
madness on their part but for one thing
you could never tell where what was
going to where it was going to go for
another would certainly have leaked on
his inconceivable that a plan of that
nature wouldn't have leaked and it just
doesn't make any sense in my opinion and
I don't think the evidence is at all
compelling I've read what there is
you're quite right about the
exploitation of it when it happened it
was exploited not just in the United
States but all over the world so for
example the Russians were exploited
September 11th as they saw it as a
window of opportunity to step up their
really brutal repression and violence in
Chechnya claiming for presenting it as a
struggle against terrorism and expecting
to get authorization from the United
States the world ruler which indeed
happened Israel used it as a window of
opportunity to step up repression and
the occupied territories claiming it's a
war against terror China did the same in
western China where they're carrying out
again harsh repressive activities
against the dissidents sometimes rebel
groups again expecting us authorization
which they got all over the world
governments including more democratic
governments used it as an opportunity to
impose more discipline on their own
populations so yes it was recognized
throughout the world by state power as
an opportunity to increase repressive
actions that were underway or to imposed
discipline and so on but that doesn't
mean that all those countries planned
they just recognized it as a window of
opportunity and I think the same was
true here if you just joining us we have
about two hours and 15 minutes to go on
our in-depth program on this Sunday
afternoon with Noam Chomsky next call
tre Illinois hello hello I'd like to
question the effectiveness of
demonstrations and especially civil
disobedience in effectively changing US
policy
in the Vietnam War dragged out for 17
years public opinion turned against the
war in 1968 if the war dragged on for
seven more years and the PIA impulse and
public opinion research showed that the
public even though they hated the war
they hated the demonstrators even more
so that just prolonged the war like we
have a March here in Peoria rally
against the war in Iraq we had 200
marchers we've got five inches in the
newspaper one little inch of new
information why people should be against
the war you're never going to be able to
demonstrate in the street get coverage
like that and get your message across
you have to do direct door-to-door lit
dropping literature dropping stuffing
doorknobs or canvassing toward the door
to get your message out with a full
sheet of paper with all your arguments
the media is not going to do your job
for you did not get your message across
in the detail and the full expression
that you'd like to see maybe let us the
error even would be more effective than
the demonstration because demonstration
is just one inch and letters you just
get maybe four or five inches of full
explanation of what you're doing and the
Illinois during the Vietnam War we're
much more effective in electoral
politics with McCarthy and George
McGovern in fact Democratic Congress
caucus in the House voted against
funding for the war despite the fact
that McGovern lost that McGovern had
just demonstrated enough strength in
election districts across the country at
the grassroots level of africanus Minh
knew that next time up they would see
challenges to congressional seats in the
congressional districts with McGovern
successfully elected delegates they saw
the handwriting on the ward they voted
to cut off the funds in the Democratic
caucus in the house and the day after
that Nixon signed the peace treaty and
ended the war so that was the effective
way electoral politics but here people I
went to Chicago teaching for peace and
justice yes essentially and then
chortling over 10,000 people blocking
one street in Chicago and they using
that as a big victory but toddler you
can easily use an alternative street run
tanks down the street to mow people down
that's a totally a symbolic victory
these demonstrations don't accomplish
anything in in Illinois here I'm going
to let you go thanks the ax major point
well
you're one part of what you say I
completely agree with just
demonstrations not connected with
day-to-day ongoing educational and
organizing activities are pointless but
take the case of the Vietnam War which
was dragged out in that case I think
there the evidence is pretty strong that
the demonstrations were very effective
they were they were part of on exactly
what you're suggesting should be done
they were part of every day-to-day
organizing educational activities and
the demonstrations grew out of them
stimulated other people to join made
other people understand what was
happening contributed to the activism
which ultimately after many years many
years led to the appearance of political
figures who were willing to become you
know the leaders of the official leaders
of a what was by then a mass popular
movement and that was after years and
years of very hard work including
demonstrations and I think there's very
strong evidence that they were
successful if you want to have some
direct evidence for it in 1968 after the
Tet Offensive in January 1968 the
business world turned strongly against
the war because it was becoming very
costly to the United States it was
becoming costly because Lyndon Johnson
was never able to call a national
mobilization of the kind that was called
during the Second World War which led to
a very efficient economy he wasn't able
to do that because there was too much
discontent they had to fight what they
call the guns and butter war which led
to stagflation and economic problems the
discontent was the result of activism
including demonstrations Johnson was
essentially there's a real power play
from the business world he was
essentially told to call off the war
after the Tet Offensive which indicated
was going to go on for a long
he wanted to send 200,000 more trips to
South Vietnam the Joint Chiefs of Staff
were opposed the reason they said was
because they thought they would need the
troops for civil disorder control in the
United States
we're large segments of the population
we're just getting out of hand now they
mentioned women youth minorities others
this is in the last part of the Pentagon
Papers worth take a look at the disorder
and the discontent revealed themselves
in many ways the demonstrations being a
very visible part but much more than
that and the appearance of politicians
Eugene McCarthy's a good case was much
later and only when there was a mass
base for it then the politicians
appeared not before there were few the
grinning and Morse were too but very few
until there a mass popular movement had
developed and I don't really agree with
you about the Diamonds funny it can be
if it's not done properly yes it can be
destructive
you can say that about anything the
demonstrations on February 15th around
the world were so and they're the
biggest mass demonstrations in history I
suppose they were so significant that
actually the New York Times a little
unhappily and it's a comment on them
said day after that there are now two
superpowers and on the planet and one is
the United States meaning the US
government the other is world public
opinion well you know world public
opinion was visible on February 15th and
that led to the recognition that there's
a powerful force there that has to be
dealt with it didn't stop this war but
you know the there's never been protests
like this against the war at that stage
you're quite correct in your account of
how long it took to build up protests to
the Vietnam War which actually started
in 1962 this protest was before the war
had actually started that indicates a
major change
and consciousness and understanding in
the country and it's the basis I think
for developing significant popular
movements which will impede and help
reverse the use of violence in world
domination and control but it doesn't
happen in a day and your point about the
day to day explanation work leafleting
and so on is absolutely correct unless
that's a central part of the activity
demonstrations don't mean anything
jerusalem rhode island good afternoon i
sir
anti-terrorism bills were rushed through
congress in the days after the Oklahoma
City bombing and have been extended
since September 11th the the problem is
that clearly some of those bills had
been written and printed before the
bombing already the FBI Joint Terrorism
Task Force has issued Flyers urging the
public to call for information about
possible terrorists defenders of the US
Constitution and and those people who
would make numerous references to the
Constitution or attempt to police the
police and loan individuals I believe
this is an undermining of basic
democracy and and I believe that the FCC
rule change that is proposed for on June
2nd that would allow the media companies
such as Clear Channel Communications to
be able to purchase newspapers will
limit the Free Press as a novelist I
believe that you probably also support
not allowing these large media companies
like Clear Channel to be able to
purchase newspapers on top of on top of
radio stations since two out of every
three households are reached by six
major media companies as a novelist
um do you do you support the Free Press
or do you support this media rule change
that um that mr. Powell Michael Powell
who was the son of the Secretary of
Defense : Powell
for some unusual reason but it has been
eluded through Alice in Wonderland in
the World Trade Center disaster written
by David Icke what that a relationship
between mr. Powell and Michael Powell
and and the government's hidden agenda
to eliminate basic civil liberties are
do you support this media rule change by
the FCC thanks caller yeah well on the
specific question of the you brought up
many interesting points on the specific
question of the FCC ruling I'm on your
side I don't think that I think that the
planned ruling will increase monopoly
the tendency towards centralization and
monopolization of media which is a very
bad thing it's been going on for years
quite apart from this the major monitor
of the study which they regularly
published study which deals with this is
been back Dickens book the media
monopoly
I think the first edition of it must
have been about 20 years ago and he then
identified if I remember correctly about
50 major concentrations of media in the
country the last edition which was a
year or two ago I think it was down to
under 10 and the FCC ruling will reduce
it even further and not in the print
media but in including the print media
in fact I think it's a very bad thing we
want to diverse as a diverse oppressors
we can get I don't think that's the only
problem with the press at all but it's a
problem on the other issue that you
raised about anti-terrorism legislation
and civil liberties here I think we have
to be we have to have a certain caution
terrorism is a serious issue I mean
personally I don't object when I pass
through security at the airport I think
that's you know I could argue about the
details but that something should be
checked make sense on the other hand the
Justice Department the bush Justice
Department
has claimed rights which are incredible
the if they are implemented it is a
major attack on civil liberties and to
an extent they have been and to an
extent they've even been upheld by the
court
I mean they've claimed the that the
executive has the right to imprison
people including citizens of the United
States to hold them without trial
without charge without access to family
and lawyers and to do so indefinitely
until the president declares that the
war on terror is over which means
indefinitely there's a new act under
discussion Patriot two it's sometimes
called which includes provisions that
would grant the Attorney General the
right to actually withdraw citizenship
rescind citizenship on what's called
inference the Attorney General's
inference from some pattern of behavior
that the person supports terrorists
under this utterly outlandish no free
and democratic society should tolerate
anything remotely like this there are
what's happening on Guantanamo is
absolutely shocking and has been
condemned by every human rights and
civil rights organization throughout the
world and maybe getting worse I don't
know
can't authenticate it but there are now
reports in the British press and
Australian press that there are plans
for and it's Bennett the British Foreign
Office has a agree that it's correct
that there are plans to have execution
chambers in Guantanamo where people can
be executed without anything remotely
resembling a fair trial on charges that
and without proper legal representation
or anything like that these these moves
are act really shocking and we should be
you're right that we should be deeply
concerned about them I've might quote I
can remember the wording a comment by
Winston Churchill about this Churchill's
bust is on George Bush's - desk II
looked at it every day
Churchill described he said that
- something like this - to place a man
in prison without charge and without the
judgment of his peers in a fair trial is
in the highest degree
odious and the foundation of all
totalitarian governments whether Nazi or
communist Churchill said that in 1943
when he was opposing efforts to
institute preventive detention for
alleged intelligence purposes and in
1943 Britain was in pretty dire straits
it was under attack by the most vicious
and murderous military machine in
history and its survival was not obvious
nevertheless he took that position which
is correct and he's right what's now
being proposed is and in part
implemented is in the highest degree
odious and the foundation of all
totalitarian societies whether not to
your communists and we should be deeply
concerned about that here's some of the
ninety-eight books that Noam Chomsky has
published over the last guess what we're
talking about almost 50 years American
power and the new mandarins and it
forward by hards n this was 2002 when it
came back out which one called World
Order's old and new by Noam Chomsky
remember the year this was out first
published in 1994 and there's an
expanded edition in 1996 and here's
another one deterring democracy was a
national bestseller can you still buy
this one on the stores it was a national
bestseller I doubt that's what it says
rap to the top you should know never to
believe anything that's put by a
publisher run it covered that was 91
extended 92 most of these still in print
yeah Carlsbad California go ahead please
thank you yes sir I'm a military officer
with 25 years of experience who's read
Mark Twain's more prayer and I got a
couple of quick questions for you and
I'd like to know whether or not you
think it's perfectly natural for a
country to protect its borders and guard
its national interests whether they be
protecting a population against
terrorism or securing economic interests
and in the case of radical Islamic
terrorism that we might have had the
first the terrorist bubble in a failure
in the wake of a failure of diplomacy
and that that wasn't necessarily our
failure looking at their motive intents
and consequences and that that's the
first part if I could come back to you
well should a country have a right to
defend its population and its economy
certainly I don't think that's a
question I didn't exactly understand
what you meant about the Islamic
terrorism well given the war in Iraq
that we were over there perhaps in the
in the face of radical Islamic
terrorists no there's no look that was a
fabrication there is no evidence
whatsoever
I mean Iraq was on Saddam Hussein's a
horrible monster just as he was when he
was supported by the United States the
people now in office in the 1980s he was
a hideous monster Osama bin Laden is
another hideous monster but there are
different monsters and they hate each
other and there's no evidence whatsoever
for of any meaningful evidence of a
connection between Saddam Hussein's
horrifying regime and the network's like
al Qaeda they despise each other and
have had no known connections the only
effect of the war on in Iraq on terror
is that it has as predicted increased
recruitment for al Qaeda so it's
increased the threat of terror exactly
it was predicted by intelligence
agencies in the United States and
throughout the world and other
specialists but the idea that attacking
Iraq had something to do the war on
terror is is just mendacity quick follow
up Carlsbad yes sir thank you with
respect to foreign policy and the pieces
potential for peace in the Middle East
do you think that first world countries
which have a tremendous ability to
provide resources and and aid to
developing countries can promote peace
in the face of Arab humiliation and
overcome Israeli defensive mos
well we have to ask that there's a
rehear I think we might listen to
the leading specialists on the topic
namely from Israeli intelligence so the
the chief of the former chief of Israeli
military intelligence just pointed out
in a book in Hebrew that until Arabs
until Israel is willing to treat Arabs
with respect as decent as human beings
with rights there will never be an end
to terror twenty years earlier a former
head of Israeli military intelligence Oh
show that harcavy said essentially the
same thing he said until we deal with
the legitimate grievances and demands of
the Palestinian people under military
occupation there will always be the
threat of terror he was writing at a
time when Israel was virtually immune
from terror from within the territories
just in the year 2000 the the head of
the Israeli secret police Shabak the
general security services which
controlled the occupied territories
essentially said the same thing they
said until we deal with the legitimate
grievances and demands of the
Palestinian population under occupation
we will never put an end to terror that
the the so the humiliation is there and
the degradation is there and the
repression is there and yes it does lead
to sometimes the terror certainly
opposition and incidentally if we want
to look ourselves in the mirror as we
should this goes way back George Bush is
not the first president to ask why do
they hate us almost 50 years ago
President Eisenhower in internal
discussions with his staff which have
since been Declassified discussed what
he called the campaign of hatred against
us in the Arab world not by governments
which are on our side but by the people
and his National Security Council gave
an explanation for it they said that
there is a perception in the Arab world
that the United States supports corrupt
and oppressive regime
which blocked democracy and development
and that we do it because of our
interest in controlling the oil reserves
of the region and furthermore they said
that the perception is correct so it's
very difficult to counter and they said
yes we have to continue doing it you
hear the same feelings expressed today
even by wealthy Muslim managers of
multinational corporations they perceive
the United States correctly as
supporting brutal corrupt repressive
regimes that are blocking democracy and
development and yes that leads to
antagonism and often hatred it's not the
source of some event Laden but it is the
reservoir of background that the heads
of Israeli military intelligence and the
secret police we're talking about we
have to be serious about that if you
want to stop terrorism
I'm the same is true elsewhere it takes
a northern island as long as the British
responded to our a terror with just
escalation of violence it increased the
terror when they came to the point of
beginning to deal with the legitimate
grievances it did improve the situation
enormous Lee it's not a utopia but it's
much better than it was 10 years ago
Stamford Connecticut for our Noam
Chomsky hello yes Chomsky I share your
views and revulsion at much of US
foreign policy and I think you're right
once you understand it it's irrefutable
ich rule evil and self ruthlessly
self-interested in many many many
instances and I find you to be an
invaluable voice of criticism and
dissent yet your views are almost never
appear in the mainstream media do you
feel you're censored at some level by
the mainstream organs in this country
well I wouldn't call it censorship
you're right that I don't appear in the
mainstream media and not just me but the
same is true of other critical voices
the media do in fact reflect a pretty
rigid and
I think narrow spectrum of opinion and
if you don't belong to it you know if
you're there it's it's not censorship
it's their choice and decision Sharon
Pennsylvania you're all with Noam
Chomsky good afternoon good afternoon I
have some disagreement but most
agreement with you and one of the it's
it's in the point that I feel you don't
go far enough for instance just on the
last point for instance NPR I read that
even when you're speaking to a smaller
audience at American University from
which NPR broadcasters Diane Rehm Show
your you've been barred from that
program even when you're very
conveniently to be interviewed and I
think it has a lot to do with the fact
that the chairman of NPR is the former
head of all CIA propaganda foreign
broadcast and the head for instance of
PBS is the former head of voice of
America now when you've got that on the
suppose an alternative to the corporate
media there's a big business media which
is interlocked and owned by
military-industrial weapons
manufacturers and colludes with the CIA
I think there is quite a bit of
censorship and another I do read your
stuff on Z mag dot org like a previous
caller and that's very useful I think
but it doesn't go far enough in many
cases richness your your you claim that
somehow it's not plausible that the
administration or a faction within an
intelligence supporting the
administration had prior knowledge and
saw that the only one that would benefit
from this attack in 9/11 would be the
war mongers within the Bush
administration and the police state
factions within the Ashcroft justic
Justice Department I think is belied by
the fact and this gets to the media that
James Bamford the top NSA expert who
wrote the book body of evidence points
out from Declassified State Department
and pentagon documents that in the early
60s the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the
Undersecretary of Defense had plans to
terror bomb American cities murder
American citizens even bombing an
American ship in Guantanamo Harbor to
frame up Cuba to blame Cuba for these
u.s. government
planned bombings and then use it as a
pretext to invade now there is a real
precedent there it was only called off
by the Kennedy administration because
apparently they figured this you know
they Mike it might go awry but it shows
that there are these uh clones of this
very fanatical ultra-right faction
almost duplicate at that time within the
high levels of government that
correspond to this Bush administration
with this plans for world domination
Thanks caller mr. Johnson well what
you're referring to is operation
Northwood you can its Declassified you
can read it if you like it was a
contingency plan called at the request
of the Department of Defense and it did
have roughly the character you describe
but if you look at contingency plans
they are all over the map they've got
plans for everything and it was not
implemented and it wasn't the only one
there were other plans that came from
the more liberal sectors of the Kennedy
administration for example plans to
stage a what look would look like a
Cuban invasion of Haiti which could then
be used as a basis for invading Cuba
actually that one came from Arthur
Schlesinger away over at the liberal end
but you know from looking at contingency
plans by governments I don't think you
couldn't conclude very much on the 9/11
event you have to make a distinction
crucial distinction between two things
the earlier question at least as I
understood it was whether the Bush
administration was involved in planning
it for that I think it's outlandish the
question you're asking is whether there
could have been foreknowledge of it well
that's conceivable but then we have to
be a little cautious because remember
that in 1993 almost 10 years earlier
there was an attempt to blow up the
World Trade Center which came very close
to succeeding and if it had succeeded
would have caused tens of thousands of
death deaths since that time there was
no doubt in the intelligence community
that operations of this kind were
possible and might take place whether
there was any foreknowledge of this one
I haven't seen any convincing evidence
of that but it's conceivable in a moment
were gonna take a break in our guest
Noam Chomsky is a graduate of the
University of Pennsylvania with a BA and
MA and a PhD got out of there in 1955
has been at MIT since 1960 9550 actually
55 and has published a total of 98 books
over these years you have three children
Diane
avi and Harry that's right where are
each of them today what are they doing
Ivy's the older oldest is teaching at
Salem State College near Boston Latin
American specialists in Latin American
history teaches history Diane our second
daughter is happens to be in Mexico at
the moment but is primarily living in
Nicaragua where she's been about 15
years as her family there
our son Harry the third child is living
in the Bay Area works and software
engineering this kind of thing we have
about an hour and 45 minutes to go and
we'll be back with Noam Chomsky and more
and your calls in just a moment

about ten years ago the United States
had the highest wages in the world which
is what you'd expect this is the richest
country in the world by far and it has
absolutely unparalleled advantages real
wages have in fact stagnated or even
declined for the majority the population
since their peak around 25 years ago but
in the mid-80s the effects of the
double-edged so-called conservatism of
the Reaganites namely markets for the
poor and state protection for the rich
that hadn't yet had its full impact by
1993 the impact was quite obvious the
Wall Street Journal was able to exalt
over what it called a welcome
development of transcendent importance
namely US labor costs had fallen below
all other leading industrial powers
apart from England wehaveto did fall
below England for a while but then
Margaret Thatcher succeeded in driving
the working people and the poor down
even more efficiently than us meanwhile
profits were rising to new heights
earlier this year every year Fortune
magazine has a you know the big business
magazine has a review of the fortune 500
you know the 500 top guys and this year
earlier this year they reported dazzling
profits that's their word for the 500
top corporations even though sales were
stagnating so wages are going down sales
are stagnating and profits are zooming
to dazzling Heights sometimes called a
paradox in fact if you look at Social
Policy is not terribly paradoxical
watching professor Chomsky there from
1994 and he's here in our studios for
the next 1 hour and 45 minutes and we've
got calls waiting to talk to him this
one from Omaha Nebraska
you're on the air Omaha please go ahead
yes I appreciate the opportunity to ask
a question I think it's in line what was
what was just shown you know a little
talk you're getting about economics
stuff um I've been pretty deeply
interested in socialism over the past
twelve years and you know I keep hearing
that you know socialism is on the rise
again in the u.s. at least within the
universities and stuff they say always
say now all the faculties you know how
he used in Westar more and more
socialistic and yeah I guess I see is
kind of rude of all the evil all this
you know imperialism and capitalism
economics creating all these mmm you
know Wars and terrorism blah blah blah I
just I'd like to hear more of your
commentary on you know the potential or
what's going on
you know realistically now in the US and
the world in terms of a sort of a true
socialistic movement you know in terms
of like the working class really taking
charge of economics potentially rather
than all this to me is what screwed up
versions of what is called socialism you
know through tax cuts and blah blah blah
blah blah you know that they're going to
read this true you know that's what you
get to the mainstream media that they're
going to create tax cuts and
redistribute that mat so that's what
they call socialism thanks a lot
well the tax cuts are a curious kind of
socialism I mean the tax cuts are
intended to and having the effect of
redistributing income even more toward
the rich than is currently the case in
fact the tax cuts are pretty clearly
part of a an effort to destroy the
progressive legislation of the past
century including social spending in
general Social Security
medicare/medicaid the progressive taxes
and so on
that's virtually conceded I don't know
how closely we've been following the
business pages in the last couple of
days but it's been revealed that the
former secretary of the Treasury before
it was fired commissioned a study by the
top government economists Treasury
Department during the budget and so on
to estimate the likely effects of the
Bush administration economic programs
that includes a vast increase in federal
spending primarily for the military
which means high tech industry in
general and tax cuts directed target
directed primarily towards the most
wealthy sectors enormous tax cuts they
estimated deficits on the order of a
forty four trillion dollars trillion
dollars that's a lot of money that was
supposed to be put into the February
budget proposals but didn't appear there
there's a debate about whether that was
purposeful or not anyway it's now
revealed and conceded the White House
spokesperson Ari Fleischer was asked
about it in a press conference a couple
days ago and he said yes the figures are
correct and then paraphrasing him he
said something like this he said this
means that Congress will have to be
responsible in reforming Social Security
Medicare and Medicaid now the kind of
reform he's talking about is not funding
it through reinstituting progressive tax
measures but basically killing it they
know that they cannot approach the
population in an election on a platform
saying we're gonna eliminate social
spending and transfer wealth even more
to the wealthy than it is today but they
can and I think are intending to drive
the country and through it a number of
economists have called a fiscal train
wreck which will then have the effect of
eliminating social spending so this is
about as remote
many ver this is you it's it's
government intervention on the benefit
for the benefit of the wealthy now as
far as socialism is concerned that term
has been so evacuated of content over
the last century that it's hard even to
use I mean the Soviet Union for example
was called a socialist society and it
was called that by the two major
propaganda operations in the world the
u.s. the Western one and the Soviet one
they both called it socialism for
opposite reasons the West call that
socialism in order to defame socialism
by associating it with this miserable
tyranny the Soviet Union called it
socialism in order to gain whatever to
benefit from the moral appeal that true
socialism had among large parts of the
general world population but this was
about as a remote from socialism as he
can imagine I'm the core notion of at
least traditional socialism is that what
you mentioned that working people have
to be in control of production and
communities have to be in control of
their own lives and so on it's and you
know this is this because the Soviet
units exact opposite of that working
people had no control over anything
they were virtual slaves and the
collapse of the Soviet Union is in fact
small victory for socialism in my
opinion eliminated one of the major
barriers to it and should have been
recognized as such but the term has been
as I said so become so meaningless that
it's hard even to use if we use it in
the traditional sense which you brought
up that goes you know that's goes
straight back in American history you
read the working-class press and the mid
19th century you know press published by
artisans and what we're called factory
girls young women from the farms working
in the textile mills and eastern
Massachusetts which was center of
beginning of the Industrial Revolution
their press was calling for they said
their theme was that those who those who
work in the mills ought to own them wage
labor which was called wage slavery was
regarded by most Americans as not very
different from slavery even the
Republican Party regarded wage labour as
just a pro at best a preliminary to free
labor but intolerable because it's kind
of servitude a large part of the
northern population fighting civil war
was fighting under that banner this goes
straight through the 20th century the
idea that people should be in control of
their own destinies and lives including
the institutions in which they work in
the communities in which they live and
so on call it what name you want but
that's traditional socialism and there
are there are today attempts to describe
a kind of a detailed vision of the
future based on these notions the most
extensive and detailed one I know is by
Michael Albert that Zenith which you
mentioned the participatory economics
and there are other such proposals but I
think this is deeply in a deeply
ingrained and people's understanding and
consciousness and barely below the
surface in fact it's a call for a
essentially extension of democracy to
the industrial sphere and to the
communities as well we should also bear
in mind that the leading American social
philosopher John Dewey I was as
mainstream as apple pie he his main work
was concentrated on democracy he pointed
out over and over again that as long as
we have what we call he called
Industrial feudalism that is a
tyrannical control private power
controlling production commerce
democracy will be very limited
it has to we have to move to what he
called industrial democracy if we hope
to have significant democracy as for
politics his position was that until
that happens politics will be the shadow
cast over Society by big business
whatever and I think most of the
population recognizes that and accepted
New York City good afternoon good
afternoon
yes hello dr. Chomsky I heard you refer
to your early experiences with Zionism I
imagined a more universal and idealistic
Zionism from that period and I was
wondering if you could speak on the
evolution of your relationship with
Zionism and the State of Israel and also
perhaps if you could speak on what your
vision might be for an Israel maybe
drawing on that more optimistic early
Zionism and how the process of getting
to that vision differs from Oslo Clinton
and Barack in 2000 and now the road map
well this left me brief but in this book
that was mentioned before Middle East
delusions there's a lot of discussion of
that some of the essays there go back to
over 35 years up to the present but to
try to put it briefly at the time when I
was a I was a Zionist youth leader an
activist back in you know in the 1940s
but for me Zionism meant opposition to a
Jewish state and that was a recognized
accepted part of the Zionist movement
why no means a majority but it was a
position within what was called the
Zionist movement opposition to a Jewish
state and I think the reasons for that
we're good the same reasons why I'd be
opposed to a Christian state or a white
state or an Islamic Republic same
reasons a state should be a state of its
citizens and not of some privileged
category of its citizens and the State
of Israel incidentally by
High Court ruling is the state of the
Jewish people in Israel and in the
Diaspora but not of its citizens and I'm
opposed to that I've always been opposed
to it so on that respect my views
haven't changed the if this was merely a
matter of symbolism wouldn't matter much
so the fact that the United States has a
day off on Sunday okay doesn't make it a
Christian state in any sense that
matters but if there were special
privileges for Christians or White's or
others it would be a different matter
then I think we should be opposed to it
and that's true in Israel after the
establishment of the state in 1948 which
the issue of the existence of Israel was
essentially over as far as I'm concerned
it should have the rights of any state
in the international system
I don't think states have many
legitimate rights but that's another
story but whatever rights you Accord to
any state in the international system
okay Israel should have those rights it
should be democratic internally meaning
the state of its own citizens not of a
of the majority of them and other Jews
elsewhere after 1967 the situation
changed radically in 1967 Israel
conquered the West Bank Sinai Gaza and
the Golan Heights and since that time
it's now the 36th year of a quite harsh
and brutal occupation in which time
Israel with that when I say Israel I
mean the United States and Israel
because just about everything Israel
does is by u.s. authorization and with
US diplomatic military and economic
support they can't go much beyond what
the US authorizes and what they have
done is move to integrate the West Bank
particularly into Israel to the extent
that they want it
so there are settlement massive
settlement programs which have broken
the West Bank into
can tons effectively and the to get
quickly to the Clinton Barack programs
at Camp David they were a wookie map of
what was proposed
it's rather striking that the while
there was much talk about the how
magnanimous and generous the offers were
you can't find a map I don't think a
single map appeared in the American
media they were available they were in
the Israeli media and Europe standard
scholarly sources and so on but they
didn't appear if you look at the map you
can understand exactly why the
settlement was completely unacceptable
to the Palestinians it broke the West
Bank into effectively for virtually
separated Canton's north central and
southern with a little part of East
Jerusalem the center of Palestinian
commercial and industrial and cultural
life separated from the three virtually
a few connections but difficult ones and
that program has that's a settlement
program that was conscious continued
rapidly under Clinton and Barack it's
continuing even more under Chevron and
Bush and it is undermining the
possibility of a meaningful political
settlement if you ask what the future
ought to be in my opinion here I happen
to agree with about two-thirds of the
population of the United States
according to polls and almost the entire
world there has to be preliminary
preliminary settlement on approximately
the international border is the pre June
67 border with some adjustments because
of changes since but mutual adjustments
actually Clinton's chief negotiator
Robert Maui discussed this in foreign
affairs the main establishment Journal
and he said what makes sense I think
that there have to be effectively
one-to-one land swaps which would be the
basis for at least a political
settlement that would lay the basis for
an end to violence integration of a
peaceful integration of Israel into the
region as it
leading industrial and financial senator
but just part of it without further
conflict if that stage can be reached
and there is an overwhelming
international consensus on that and
strong popular support in the United
States the US has been blocking that for
25 years it's part of the illusions that
are talked about in the title of that
book if we can get to that stage then
the further questions you're raising
that come up how about there will be
serious problems of democratization both
in Israel and in the new Palestinian
state my own feeling remains pretty
conservative it's what it was 40 60
years ago that the long term I don't
think it makes much sense to break that
territory into two parts if you know the
area at all or if travel there you can
see it's awfully artificial and harmful
in the longer term I think there should
be moved towards some kind of federal
structure ultimately as relations
let's hope improve among the people and
nationalist sentiments are subside and
hatreds subside moves towards closer
integration and circumstances ferment
weird about the halfway point with our
end up with Noam Chomsky he has a
professor at MIT and Cambridge here's a
look at the outside of his office
building where he works and eventually
you'll see where his office is inside
how much time do you spend there usually
three full days a week days well for
some reason like classes for many years
have been on Thursdays so Thursday's
classes Tuesdays and Fridays
appointments interviews other things how
many classes a year are different
courses a year do you teach well
technically I've been retired for the
last couple of years but this year I had
two courses at MIT and one
1/2 course that another University State
University of New York how much are you
speaking I can't even remember almost
constantly I mean do you have you gone
the road lot still quite a lot either I
arranged that timing so that I can be on
the road obviously fun days but I don't
have commitments at work a fair amount -
yeah I want to take a number of calls if
you don't mind make some notes here so
we can hear some voices of people that
are watching and we'll go through a
couple of these here and then we'll come
back to see and have you wrap up some of
the comments on their calls New York
City next go ahead please yes I dr.
Tomsky a couple of things I'm sorry I
make this quick but a couple of
challenges that you pointed out the
United States being the only superpower
and having a much larger role and
responsibility in the global community
some of the changes that need to happen
and going back to the earlier colors
points on sort of socialistic philosophy
I mean good for the all is the way I
would look at that it seems to almost
oppose the foundation of the United
States being more of a capitalistic
system where it is profit driven and
maybe I'm drawing too big of assumptions
but it seems like we're more than
plutocracy and democracy and a lot of
the the people who are in a position
make those changes on behalf of the
United States also have special
interests in their ears from the
industrial society or that's prevalent
propagating a lot of the industrial
feudalism as you mentioned and thereby
also creating some of the frustration
the antagonism and resentment against
the United States resulting in terrorism
as we've seen it so how do you see
something like this changing when you've
got sort of a disinterested public or a
public that's kind of being kept out of
the whole process and about to be even
more so with further meetings
consolidations I was just curious to
hear your thoughts on that we go to Fall
River Massachusetts what your question
comment yeah professor Chomsky already
answered my question
seems to me you're really holding Israel
to a double standard you say nothing of
the fact that no Jews can live in Saudi
Arabia or Jordan but you you hold Israel
to such a standard and also Jewish
people cannot visit the Temple Mount and
but when Jews control religious areas
they're supposed to make it available to
everybody so could you address that why
do you hold Israel to a double standard
Thanks Denver Colorado what do you have
to say today yes I I just want to thank
you very much for having Noam Chomsky on
the show this is a great honor and one
of the most important writers in history
but I just want to present a hypothesis
and I would like him to us to address us
do you think the recent Sharon's move to
refer to the old words as people say and
see what appears to be all roads leading
to Tehran far as military action do you
think the deep on Tostan you'll see
you'll see that point I'm making do you
think the ban to stone model prevailed
in Israel and do you think this wasn't
is this a an effort to sort of
neutralize the Arab opposition because I
think it appears to me that the
inevitable move for military action is
will be against Iran probably within the
next year or so one last one and then
we'll come back to dr. Chomsky we go to
Palo Alto California good morning
professor Chomsky our I guess it's
afternoon where you are yeah I have a
couple questions about 9 1 111 the
terrorists somehow prevented the US Air
Force jet fighters from being scrambled
in the normal ten minutes and they
caused the delay of 75 minutes for the
jet fighters to be sent up and they hit
the Pentagon with a guided missile
because if if it had been one of those
airliners there would have been about a
hundred thousand pounds of aluminum
album along there and that could not
possibly have vaporized the way the
government said it did and somehow the
terrorists arranged those cell phone
calls and that's been shown by
experiment to be impossible and somehow
those terrorists
put explosives in the World Trade Center
buildings because Columbia University
seismographs showed pulses that could
only have been caused by explosives at
the beginning of the fall of each of
those buildings not as they were
actually falling now all of these things
you can read them for example at the
cosmic penguin calm that has links to 55
different web sites containing
information about these facts all right
so thanks there's a lot there yeah maybe
you can summarize some of it okay
maybe these east ways to go backwards
okay yeah well the last caller raised
made a number of technical observations
which I completely incompetent to
comment on I have no idea whether there
were seismographs that showed that they
were explosives in the building and
frankly I'm extremely skeptical the fact
that a lot of material appears on
internet sites is not very compelling
the Internet is a very valuable
instrument you can learn all sorts of
things from it but anybody can put
anything they like on the Internet
that's part of its value and you have to
evaluate the information I haven't
checked any of the technical issues that
you've discussed so I can't comment on
them but I should say that I have
extreme skepticism about them on Sharan
I ran a quarter right before Sauron the
O word namely occupied territories that
you've already used as conquered
territories which is pretty strong and
accurate the and the road to Tehran and
the efforts to neutralize the Arab world
here I think we have to be extremely we
have to look closely the Sharan plan and
the bush plan as far as we have any
information about them is simply a
continuation of the Bantustan ization
process if you read the Israeli press
which has excellent reporters like
from your house and you don't lady who
write about this all the time what
they're describing and what you see if
you go to the West Bank is just breaking
it up into Canton's I mean the
separation wall which is going from
north to south has already encircled a
palestinian town calcula and it is
virtually destroying it it was just
announced that it's going to go to the
east to settlements to the east Arielle
and Amano well there's a story in The
New York Times today about the
settlement of Itamar which is even to
the east of that whether that'll be
included in the separation wall or not
we don't know but it's a salient which
was in the Clinton Barack plan that
basically cuts the northern sector from
the rest there is just no doubt that the
separation wall or some equivalent will
include the vast settlement and
infrastructure programs to the east of
Jerusalem extending almost to Jericho
which cuts it again
minoes city is a growing city they
Ramallah do meme which was established
primarily in the Clinton Barack period
pretty much with the purpose of
bisecting the West Bank and it's got
infrastructure connections to Israel
which essentially break up the
Palestinian territories that plan as far
as we know George Bush's vision as he
calls it as far as we know anything
about it is simply it is a kind of
program which is called a bantha stone
ization program in israel for good
reasons could you say that word again
Bantu Stan is Asian I mean it stands for
that's a reference to the South African
programs of the early 1960s of setting
up black homelands which were called
Bantustans transguy was the first there
were several others they were never
recognized by anyone but their idea was
to set up black States under black
leadership surrounded by white areas and
it was one of the most grotesque efforts
of the apartheid regime and its worst
period that's been regarded as a model
Israeli planners pretty openly and it's
discussed in those terms criticized in
those terms usually but it's not
unreasonable I mean it's a canonization
program setting up Canton's which have
some connection but not much and are
basically unviable is that an effort to
neutralize the Arab world I think your
suspicion is correct but it's certainly
not going to work if it's anything like
that program as for Iran being the next
step it's certainly being set up whether
and theirs
unfortunately the United States is
creating a self-fulfilling prophecy
I mean it's very likely that the war in
Iraq will inspire Iran to develop
weapons of mass destruction in fact
that's been predicted by intelligence
agencies and analysts all over the world
including the United States that this
plan the national security strategy the
plan to crush by force any potential
challenge to u.s. domination is
virtually demanding that potential
adversaries create some kind of a
deterrent and the only kind of a
deterrent they have to a state with
overwhelming power is either terror
which is a deterrent or weapons of mass
destruction or as in the case of North
Korea massed artillery aimed at the soul
and at American forces there which are a
deterrent to attack on North Korea but
you know when you when you announce your
intention to rule the world by force and
to crush any potential challenge you're
virtually demanding that potential
adversaries do something about it and
Iran might move on to develop weapons of
mass destruction which will then be used
as a pretext for an attack however I
personally don't think there's going to
be an attack on Iran the reason is that
Iran is not like Iraq Iraq was
defenseless completely defenseless and
that was known and that was a
prerequisite for an invasion Iran is not
the
offenseless I mean it doesn't begin to
compare with the United States and power
but it's not defenseless in the sense
that Iraq was and for that reason I
suspect an attack is not likely on the
other hand subversion is not at all
unlikely and according to some American
academic specialists who have written on
the topic
there have been effort there are
underway efforts to stir up subversive
activities and stimulating iran's a
complicated country stimulating some
nationalist elements like Azeri in the
north to build up breakaway movements
it's reported I can't verify it by
academic specialists that a good part of
the Israeli Air Force over 10% is
permanently stationed in eastern Turkey
presumably at American bases there and
it's flying regular reconnaissance over
at the Iranian border
probably either for surveillance or
intimidation whether this is happening
or not I don't know it's reported from
credible sources and I think something
like that is considered is much more
likely than a direct attack but and this
is contrary to the wishes of the
countries of the region and the
countries of the world who have been
trying correctly to support reformist
tendencies in Iran
these efforts undermine them and to
step-by-step integrate duran back into
the international system on healthy
terms there are strong reformist
tendencies they fight they have plenty
of barriers but they should be supported
not undermine so that what you described
could be the planning we don't know you
know we don't have we don't have access
to internal plans but what is the
information available suggests something
like that as to Israel and a double
standard I don't quite agree I as I
mentioned I'd be just as strong just as
strongly opposed to the so-called
Islamic Republic's
of which there are a number which are
not states of their citizens but but are
dedicated in principle to Islamic rule
and some like Saudi Arabia are
horrendous it's one of the reasons
whether then strongly opposed to us
strong us support for repressive and
brutal states like Saudi Arabia for many
years when Eisenhower and his staff
we're talking about the campaign of
hatred back in nineteen fifty-eight this
was they were referring to us support
for states like that
oppressive states that have all sorts of
horrible legislation including what you
mentioned and should and are opposed to
democracy and development in the US
shouldn't be supporting it's part of the
reason for opposition the US policies
throughout the region so I don't agree
that that's a double standard the first
question is a complicated one what kind
of a country is this well you know
that's for it's people that decide the
take say the existence of corporations
that's a major part of our society we're
a largely corporate run society now
where did corporations come from other
corporations we're not corporations were
given the rights of persons about a
century ago by courts and lawyers not by
legislation that's a sharp blow against
the classical liberal principles that
the country was established not I mean
Adam Smith or James Madison would have
turned over in their grave at the idea
that an abstract entity like a
corporation is given rights of persons
persons of flesh and blood
like freedom of speech and freedom of
search and seizure and so on these are
legal these are collectivist legal
fictions as they're sometimes described
in the legal literature
they're basically tyrannies controlled
from top
the bottom they there's the idea that
they should have Rights of Persons from
a classical liberal point of view the
view of the founding fathers it's just
outlandish they now have rights far
beyond persons so the recent trade
agreements so-called trade agreements
not really trade agreements they grant
corporations rights that go far beyond
persons of flesh and blood
General Motors for example can go to
Mexico and demand national treatment
meaning to be treated like a Mexican
business but a Mexican of flesh and
blood can't go to New York or San
Francisco and demand national treatment
when you get very far this is a complete
reversal on a sharp attack against the
liberal principles the capitalist
principles on which the country was
founded what about the political system
the political system is really what
political science is sometimes called
polyarchy not a democracy that is a
system of elite decision and public
gratification that's what go back
earlier in the discussion that's what
people like Lippmann Bernays and others
were talking about it has good
constitutional sources if you look at
the debate James Madison was the main
framer of the Constitution his view
explicit and the discussions of the
Constitutional Convention is that power
as he put it should be in the hands of
the wealth of the nation the more
capable set of men the people who have
sympathy with the rights of property
meaning property owners and he argued
strongly against democracy he gave the
model of England which is of course what
they were thinking about he said in
England if the population really had the
vote the majority of the population
would vote for a better distribution of
the wealth of the society at that time
that meant
and in other words the they would vote
for what nowadays we would call agrarian
reform to give to keep break up the
concentration of land and give it to
people who needed it and Madison
concluded that's intolerable we can't
accept them so therefore we can't accept
the system in which the population will
in fact have a direct say in social and
economic policy and affairs of state now
the population should be fragmented and
power should be in the hands of the
wealthy who basically are concerned with
property rights that's not the position
of the population of the United States
and over the centuries there have been
many struggles about this it's a large
part of American history is struggles
about these issues what the country is
founded on and what it should be should
be the matter for the people to decide
you pointed out the questioner correctly
that it's the the population seems I
think the word you use was disinterested
I don't really believe that I think the
population feels helpless I feel there's
not much I can do about it
in fact attitude studies show that the
there's a measure called helplessness
can we do anything about what's
happening
now that's been going up in recent years
I think it reached its peak the last
time it was studied about the year 2000
and people do feel helpless they feel
that the government is not doing
anything for them so for example in the
last presidential elections 2000 right
before the election so no Florida
shenanigans and so on
about 75% of the population didn't take
the election very seriously regarded it
as some kind of game involving rich
contributors and party bosses and the
public relations industry which crafts
candidates to say things that maybe will
pick up votes but that don't let you
know where they stand on issues issue
identification was extremely low in the
most people couldn't tell where the
candidates stood on most issues and it's
not because they're stupid or
incompetent that's because the election
is crafted that way yeah you're supposed
to vote on what are called qualities not
issues part of the reason for that is
that on major issues popular opinion in
a lead opinion happened to be sharply
divided and those issues just don't come
up in elections and I think at some
level the population much of the
population is quite aware of this and is
I don't think it's lack of interest I
think it's a feeling of lack of ability
to do much about it but that is exactly
but if we want to improve the situation
in the country and I think we should you
know that's the opportunity for
activists organizers people who want to
empower people and enable them to do
things and it certainly can be done we
do have a legacy of freedom it hasn't
been a gift it's the result of struggle
it was one we can use that legacy of
freedom if we like or we can abandon it
but those are choices no I'm John ski
Farmington Michigan thank you for the
opportunity I think you answered the
part of my question regarding Iran and I
had a follow-up with Bush administration
increasing the rhetoric and being the
drama war against Iran I wanted to know
your opinion on US policy on Iran and
what can we run do to confront in one
hand oppressive regime at home and in
another hand the possible US invasion of
Iran Thanks
yeah that's under the the situation in
Iran is extremely difficult within Iran
the it's pretty clear that substantial
majority of the population wants to
pursue the reform measures which will
undermine the power of the
a clerical autocracy and the set up of
the country who makes that heart
legislation can be passed a reformist
legislation but then it has to be
ratified by the clerical authorities and
of course they always turn it down so
they veto all the reforms legislation
and they've got force behind them they
have military force paramilitary and
military force so the population is
facing a difficult internal situation
now that situation we can help the
reformist movements or we can hinder
them
we're hindering them by threatening
invasion that simply gives credibility
to a more authoritarian and harsh and
brutal elements the country is under
threat of attack that's you know that's
what's going to happen we see it right
here the way the Bush administration has
used the threat of terror which is real
to impose authoritarian measures and to
control the population in ways which are
unacceptable and the same is happening
in Iran of course efforts from the
outside to help the two through
diplomacy through commercial relations
through trade and so on to integrate
Iran into the region in the world that
can only that's the best thing we can do
to help the the progressive reformist
elements in ever had which do want to
turn it into a more free and democratic
society we can't solve the problems for
them but we can improve the conditions
under which they can deal with their own
problems and it's not gonna be easy for
them they're facing harsh internal
constraints about an hour to go on
in-depth with Noam Chomsky's Spokane
Washington hello hello gentlemen first
dr. Chomsky I would like to thank you so
much for elucidating all the problems of
political arenas around the world for me
in contrary to a speech you came from
one one deny I am a community center I'm
an international first student and
economics major and I'm a senior and so
there are a lot of international first
majors that I very much interested in in
your opinions early on in the program a
gentleman called from the military and
and he stated on don't you feel that a
country should protect its population
and his borders as well as its economy
yes given I I'm a little curious one in
stating that yes you feel that a
country's economy should be protected
you are inherently stating that yes we
should send the military to enforce the
rules of a corporation and the
corporation of course now and
unfortunately in this country being seen
as an empty actually having as you said
more rights than an individual you are
saying that it's okay all right yeah
well in that case I was speaking not
very clearly I understood the question
to mean should we protect it does a
country have a right to protect itself
from attack okay so if someone attacks
from abroad to say you know destroy
American agriculture and Industry do we
does the country have a right to defend
itself yeah I think it does but your
maybe I spoke badly but you're
interpreting what I said as meaning do
we have a right to send the military
abroad to enforce the domination of
us-based corporations no of course
that's not defending the economy in the
sense that I had in mind so I think I'm
an agreement with your point if I
understand that guess some more books
some of the 98 books you've published in
your life here's Noam Chomsky pirates
and emperors old and new international
terrorism in the real world new edition
what year is this reason we put out the
first one which was just pirates and
emperors was 1986 right in the middle of
the reagan-bush war on terror as they
called it
remember that the war on terror was read
eclair Don September eleventh not
declared first one was 20 years earlier
and it was just reissued with new essays
bringing it up to date since 1986 here's
another one
foreword by Edward Saeed faithful
triangle updated edition the United
States Israel and the Palestinians
now that was written in 1983 right after
the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and it
was updated in 1999 with a number of
essays articles about the intervening
period there's hunger Noam Chomsky
understanding power the indispensable
Chomsky what year did this come out that
was I was really surprised that I didn't
know that that material existed it's
mostly from transcripts of lengthy
discussions an ATAR interchanges if I
recall from about 10 years ago actually
this particular version is 2002 what was
published then yeah but I think most of
the material in it is from the earlier
period the two editors at Peter Mitchell
and John shuffle did a fantastic job of
I know how they did it of finding the
discussion and transcripts material
putting them together they also put on
put on the internet there are no
footnotes in the book they put the
footnotes on the internet and they it's
really their footnote they have
elaborate sources backgrounds extensive
material it's a terrific reference I use
it tonight
Norton Virginia go ahead please consider
it a great honor to be able to speak
with dr. Johnston I'm so impressed by
what I've just heard that I have a
difficult formulating my question what I
wanted to ask about is in his capacity
as a linguist does he think do you think
dr. Chomsky that a lot of the repression
abuse of power that we're seeing going
on and terrorism included is a fear of
Goddess energy and do you know this
goddess or the female goddess energy got
us into co se in regard to the Gaia
hypothesis well first of all as a
linguist I've actually nothing to say
about this
there's no professional special
knowledge that bears on your question
[Music]
tell you the honest truth I don't really
think say about it I be interested in
knowing what you think not there since I
had obviously thought about it go ahead
and landing on there I appreciate mr.
Chomsky yeah thank you for being on the
show and doing your best to be a great
American what what the founders were in
Hayek's words and constitutional
liberties what Hayek thought he was was
an old Whig as opposed to the modified
Whig that showed up in 1830s which was a
part of the manufacturing of a new sense
of what we were but in your book about
rethinking Camelot I to be a patriot
rather than a court dissident I think
you have to look to the actual documents
the proof of the senior Bush complicity
in the CIA's assassination of President
Kennedy and to suggest that there was no
change when we went back to federal
reserve notes from Kennedy's us notes as
well as the 58,000 who subsequently died
in the Roman colony of Indochina trying
to preserve the interests of the 5%
Catholics who own ninety-five percent of
wealth is denying a thread in the
tapestry of history that the Jews and
the Gentiles had founded this country
knew about that was embodied in
Jefferson's letter to Samuel Khrushchev
all identifying the real Antichrist is
this engine for enslaving mankind which
is exactly who the corporations that you
apparently rail against now represent
around the world I mean this is the oil
industry is Roman Catholic Cheney and
Rockefeller merely their hired help and
the Bush family funded Hitler
that's a put him on the front of Time
Magazine's Man of the Year and you
I understand your reticence to speak to
the facts but when we know we can send
up a human crying go after Bush for his
complicity by the FBI documents Kitchell
document of november 22nd 1963 which you
can get new Hoover's document which Bush
denies but which places him in the CIA a
week later as well as the court case
hunt versus Liberty Lobby that the jury
determined the CIA in fact committed the
crime I think a person of your stature
has an obligation to the country
particularly your age none of us got
here alive to call a spade a spade and
say what's true if we're going to be a
righteous land and the land that all of
our ancestors believe this country
should be well I agree we should call a
spade a spade and say what we think is
true in the book most of what you talked
about I don't know anything about so it
won't comment on but the specific thing
that you did raised my book rethinking
Camelot I wrote it because there had
just been the the State Department had
just released extensive documentation
about the early 1960s a period which I'm
very much interested in in connection
with Vietnam it supplemented the mass of
information that was already available
from the Pentagon Papers and many other
sources when the Pentagon Papers came
out that was an unusually rich source
because that was not declassified
material that it was material that was
not intended to reach the public so it's
kind of like capturing some country's
archives so that was unusually rich
material I would was involved in in at
some extent and the wrote about it right
away that's this book for reasons of
state that was mentioned is mostly about
the Pentagon Papers the new book every
thinking Camelot was about this included
the subsequent documentation in my view
I'm telling calling a spade a spade the
way I see it the documentation which is
unusually rich demonstrates as close to
conclusively as you can come in matters
of history which is always uncertain but
demonstrates very persuasively
that
the John F Kennedy was a hawk on Vietnam
he wanted to get the troops out but so
did everyone but only after victory he
made that very clear and explicit there
is no indication in the documentary
record that I can find that he had any
intention other than that and there is
furthermore no indication of any
significant change after the
assassination the policy continued on
course same people directing it as under
the Kennedy as under Kennedy pretty much
the same people pursuing the same
programs as conditions changed their
tactics changed but there's no reason
that I know of the belief that he would
have done any differently and the same
on other issues
um the assassination was a crime and an
atrocity but the idea that there was any
kind of high-level conspiracy behind it
seems to me extremely unlikely on the
basis of any evidence I can discover and
I've looked pretty hard Mount Laurel New
Jersey good afternoon to you professor
Chomsky I agree with most of what you've
said in the past and in this program as
well I have three observations to make
that I have collected over the last few
months particularly after watching the
media circus with regard the Iraq war
and what happened unfortunately after
the 9-1-1
incidents firstly my general feeling is
that more and more Americans are being
deluded into thinking that they're
saviors of the world democracy you know
it's a feeling it's a prevalent feeling
which is propagated with the media as
you said before it's just like how
Britain used to say for India you know
there's like we are the people we are
giving the right kind of things to these
people these poor people living in their
misery and in the Superstition we are
the ones who are like teaching in the
art of survival in this new civilized
world you know it's like that kind of an
attitude the second thing is one would
probably think that after the
nine-one-one after the grievous
misfortune which happened there would be
some humility and some understanding and
some feeling among the public to
understand the causes of what why these
things have happened and you know also
try to understand the sheer feeling of
indignity which is felt by people from
different parts of the world but
unfortunately the public is becoming
more
annoyed and deeply mistrustful of people
from other races within their own
country because of what happened to nine
one one and the third thing is that as
far as people like you are concerned
you're one of the few people the voice
of reason which appear from time to time
in different media to undo the
propaganda by these mainstream media but
several times such voices like yours are
hijacked by other people like radicals
or rock stars or movie stars and things
like that so it all seems to undermine
the credibility of the cause that we are
trying to portray before America this is
what is right there should people really
be thinking you know well those are good
questions they can each take one hour's
discussion the on the first Americans
being deluded by the media we have just
seen a spectacular example of that the
which has been discussed around the
world I should say on September the
campaign began about the you know the
from beat of war about invading Iraq and
at the same time the gut there was a
massive government media propaganda
assault charging or at least insinuating
that Iraq was an imminent threat to the
security of the United States and even
that that Saddam Hussein was involved in
al-qaeda style terrorism that he was
behind there may be involved in 9/11 and
planning future atrocities that's been
and that had an effect if check the
polls very quickly majority of the
population did come to believe that Iraq
is a direct threat to us security the US
was alone in the world in believing that
Saddam Hussein was a threat I mean he's
hated all over the place and rightly but
not regarded as dangerous so the
countries that he invaded Iran and quite
you know despised him happy to see him
drawn and quartered but they didn't fear
him I mean they know perfectly well that
Iraq was the weakest state in the
been virtually disarmed its military
expenditures were about a third of
quoits which is 10% of its population in
fact they had been moving to try to
reintegrate Iraq into the general
regional system though the despise
Saddam it's only in the United States
that people thought he was a threat to
their security and that was government
media propaganda the connection was with
with terror was completely fabricated
and it was so effective that in Bush's
Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier speech
he was able to say without fear of
ridicule that the victory in Iraq was a
victory in the war on terror I was quite
the contrary if anything it increased
the threat of terror by increasing
recruitment for terrorist groups as
predicted by the intelligence agencies
again that's spectacular propaganda as
can the connection with 9/11 is so such
a fantasy that it's hard to discuss you
won't find that Intelligence Agency or
serious strategic analysts in the world
because any credibility to that but over
the months from the beginning of the
propaganda campaign a large part of the
population by now probably a majority
actually came to believe it so yeah
there's plenty of delusion your point
about Britain and India is very
pertinent I suspect you're Indian and
it's it's pretty much I mean the u.s. is
not inventing this it's following
closely the model of other imperial
powers so when a Britain crushed India
India was one of the major commercial
industrial centres of the world back in
the 18th century after two centuries of
British rule that had become an
impoverished mostly agricultural society
the it wasn't until after Britain was
expelled that in the renewed its course
of development and indeed after Britain
was expelled that there were no more
famine
up through the whole British period
there were massive famines but Britain
did disregard itself and in fact many
British still regard themselves as
benefactors civilizer who were going to
India to you know help the Nate the poor
natives by some of the leading British
intellectuals very you know some of the
most honorable people in modern
intellectual history people like John
Stuart Mill wrote the most outrageous
nonsense about British benevolence in
India and how it had was there to save
the barbarians and so on and so forth so
you know the under the Continental
powers if you take a look or even worse
so yes this is an old story and the u.s.
is following a very familiar but
extremely ugly path and in this kind of
self delusion as the as for the feeling
among the public after 9/11 you know
it's very hard to judge public
sentiments but at least my impression is
different from yours it seems to me that
9/11 was a kind of a wake-up call for a
lot of people the United States is a
very insular society that most people
don't pay much attention to what goes on
outside and in fact people don't know
much about the outside world they don't
geography history sold something out
there but the impact of September 11th
part of the impact I think was to make
people feel we better find out something
about the world and our role in it and
the way people feel and so on and there
was a notable increase very great
increase in requests for talks and sales
of books all the small publishers I had
that were started republishing books
that had been out of you know been out
of print for years but just because the
demand grew so much I mean I know myself
the request for talks and discussions
just skyrocketed after 9/11 and everyone
else who's publicly available had the
same experience I think it was a very
healthy reaction
they were also unhealthy reactions of
the kind that you mentioned there there
too life is a complicated affair but
some of the reactions were healthy
sensible and an opportunity to build on
I think a lot of the massive protests
against the Iraq war which was
unprecedented is based on that as to the
hijacking of voices well you know people
can do what they want you just it's up
to each individual you everyone else to
decide what makes sense what doesn't
make sense
north wid Mira New York go ahead please
I'd like to ask you regarding your
history with Zionism do you see a
difference between a Jewish homeland and
a Jewish state yeah yeah so I mean one
could debate the validity of having a
Jewish homeland in Palestine that's the
question but let's accept that for the
moment the part of the Zionist movement
that I belong to and my parents as well
I should say back in the 30s and 40s did
was committed to reestablishing to
establishing a kind of Jewish homeland
in Palestine it's debatable but yeah
that was my position then and still is a
Jewish state is a different matter
that's a state which in fact the groups
that I was part of were calling for by
national settlement in Palestine a
bi-national Palestine Jewish and
Palestinian society based on it was a
socialist movement so based on coopera
there was big co-operative movement
collectives and so on efforts to
integrate the general populations into
it how realistic that was or even how
valid one can debate but it's quite
different than the notion of a Jewish
state once the state was established in
1948 a lot of these questions became
and as I said before I think the state
itself should have whatever rights any
state can legitimately claim and as I
mentioned I don't think states can claim
many rights but maybe any but whatever
they have in the international system
this is one of them but to be a Jewish
state or an Islamic state or a Christian
state or a white state that's a
different matter Madison Wisconsin go
ahead please yes I wanted to follow up
on a comment that professor Chomsky made
with regard to trade agreements from
what I understand foreign corporations
have even more rights in the United
States than American corporations do
because the foreign corporations are
entitled to sue the US government for
financial losses supposedly caused by
American laws say governing
discrimination in the workplace or the
environment well that's not just foreign
corporations I mean the trade laws do
grant corporations rights that human
beings don't have included among them
are measures it's a complicated matter
but there are measures which in effect
allow corporations to sue governments
for alleged the you know loss of profits
and so on and some such suits have been
carried out by US corporations
incidentally against Mexico against
Canada and in principle other
corporations in other countries could do
that here too
these in my view are completely
illegitimate you can't sue Mexico I
can't sue Mexico but metal-clad
corporation was able to sue Mexico
because they claimed that environmental
laws passed by a Mexican province
interfered with their right to put I
think it was a waste disposal dump there
or something and they actually won under
after rules but that's a mutual that's
not just foreign corporations
corporations Eureka California yes
professor Chomsky have a three quick
questions for you they're simple to
answer other than voting what can a
person do there's one thing I'd like to
know about the crude situation the other
thing is other than the Constitution
what document or one book would you
suggest a person read and third are you
ever going to get your own talk show on
radio well the answer the last one no
I've never heard a man talk sure I
couldn't handle it and I'd never get it
anyway
on the second question I really can't
mention one book that people should read
it depends on your own interests and
concerns I'm asked a lot to give people
you know reading lists but until you
know the only people who can decide what
they ought to read or the people
themselves they know their interests
they know the concerns they know their
degree of commitment I mean if you ask a
question you know what should you read
about this and that topic I may have a
suggestion but what book should you read
I can't say you want to know something
about the history of the United States
one book I'd suggest is a book by old
close friends who was on this program
just a year ago Howard Zinn his people's
history of the United States which i
think is just sold its millionth copy
there's a terrific introduction to the
history of the United States in a way in
which it is not usually taught but
should be so that's one suggestion as
far as voting is concerned voting is
fine thing I'm glad we have the right to
vote but you have to have somebody to
vote for you know there have to be
issues and candidates and what are
called sometimes secondary associations
that means organizations of people who
press their own interests and concerns
then voting can become meaningful so
let's say take the primary system in the
United States and just ask how it works
say New Hampshire primaries what happens
is
candidates come to town and they say
here's what I stand for vote for me and
then they go somewhere else that people
are listening to them probably you don't
believe what they're saying I have no
special reason to but that's not the way
a democracy got a function the way a
democracy oughta function is the people
in the town should say get together
discuss and work out what they think
ought to happen in the country and then
they should invite people either they
elect their own candidate pick their own
candidates which is the best way or if
others are running for office say okay
come here and we'll tell you what we
think you ought to do if you're elected
if you don't want to do that then go
away this is what we want that would be
democratic more democratic
but until things like that happen on a
very large scale there isn't going to be
a functioning democracy if you don't do
i I tend to vote for local candidates
and as it goes up the scale ident fold
less and less because I think they're
less and less responsive to the
population and less and less and more
responsive to external forces however it
varies you know and then it's really a
particular choice case-by-case el paso
go ahead yes dr. Chomsky I've been a fan
of yours for many years and regarding
the last caller's questions books that
should be read I've read a couple of
interest to myself lately that I'd like
to hear your comments on one of them is
Ann Coulter's book called slander which
talks a lot about the liberal media and
I'd like to ask you what you think we in
the public can do to get the media the
mainstream media to respond and give
more conservative views and more
international views and we're currently
being fed by the newspapers and the
mainstream media broadcast my second
question has to do with the book by John
Peters from time immemorial and I find
that a very well researched book and I
was appalled to learn of the British
involvement
and the state of affairs that exists now
in Israel and I was also appalled to
learn of the delusions that have been
passed down for apparently centuries
regarding the history between the
Israelis and the Arabs in what you call
you know the Jewish homeland
Thanks caller okay well the John Peters
book I'm sorry to say is a hoax which
was exposed and was withdrawn from
publication after exposure and it's now
come back I'm surprised to see when the
book first came it looks well researched
on the surface what's the point the the
book oh the book claims that the
Palestinians are recent immigrants who
came in after the Jewish settlement and
therefore they can sort of go home and
there's no moral issue it has a lot of
footnotes and what looked like a lot of
sources it was immediately analyzed very
carefully the best work on it was done
by Norman Finkelstein you can read a
detailed analysis of it in his excellent
book image in reality and the
israel-palestine conflict but he exposes
very quickly it was also exposed in
Israel by some of the leading scholars
who pointed out this nonsense the book
had a wonderful reception in the United
States the publishers then made an
editorial error and allowed it to appear
in England as soon as it appeared in
England it was demolished and by
scholars by journalists by everyone it
was then kind of withdrawn here people
withdrew their support for it and it
disappeared I'd suggest you look very
carefully at the critical discussion of
it before relying on what it says as
Fran Coulter I didn't read her book but
you know talk about the liberal media it
just doesn't make any sense I mean for
one thing you know the media have a if
you want to say the media or liberal I
can't disagree I mean so the journalists
tend to support
choy woman's choice yeah probably do
they believe in civil rights yeah
probably but that hasn't was nothing to
do with the content of the media the if
you want to I've never in my little OTT
about the media but I've never talked
about liberal conservative bias but I
don't think it means anything
you want to understand the media first
of all take a look at their content okay
I gave one example before the propaganda
fantastic propaganda which managed to
convince people of these incredible
delusions about Iraq it's not that the
media came out and said Saddam Hussein
was responsible for 9/11 but they
permitted distribution of those charges
uncritically in such a way that the
population actually became came to
believe it and there's case after case
of this before this I earlier in the
program I mentioned that you can't find
a map in the media of the the Clinton
Barack offers of a settlement in Camp
David which was so highly praised well
you know I don't know if that's liberal
bias or conservative bias but it's not a
journalistic integrity if you want
people to understand what this proposal
was showing them that that's the way to
decide what it was and that was withheld
and there's case after case of this i
think there's enormous documentation of
the fact you can check it if you like
that the shaping the choice of topics
the shaping of information the you know
the basic assumptions and so on fall
within a fairly narrow spectrum which
tend to be highly supportive of state
and corporate power i don't think it's
either liberal or conservative it's just
the way things work when i'm some of my
favorite newspapers are called very
conservative like the news reporting on
the wall street journal is as good as
any i know
maybe better and it's supposed to be a
conservative Journal but the the
question is what is the media product
and then if you want to understand it
you don't look at liberal and
conservative whatever they mean you look
at the institutional roots what kind of
institutions are the media well you know
turns out their major corporations tied
in with even bigger ones their income
comes from other businesses namely
advertisers they're basically selling a
product namely audiences to other
businesses and I think if you look
you'll find that the interests and
concerns of the sellers and the buyers
have a very powerful influence on the
media product that has to be
demonstrated not just asserted but
that's my opinion and as I say I know
there's a written a lot about it but I
don't think has anything to do with
liberal and conservative bias about
30-minutes Levin though I'm Chomsky
Germans Bern New York go ahead please
the internet as a source of news has any
chance of really breaking the deadlock
that you so well spoke of in your book
manufacturing consent and continue to
speak about the Internet has been a
tremendous value in education and
organization and in going around the
framework of sort of doctrinal control
that comes from the main institutions
that's happened here most of the
activism of the past years has been
internet-based take say the world Social
Forum which is completely without
precedents a huge international movement
aiming at more just a global justice and
more just international economic and
social political arrangements a hundred
thousand people showed up in porto
alegre brazil last year representing
great numbers of people throughout the
world almost entirely through internet
interactions you can't find anything
about it in the main media the
opposition to the multilateral agreement
on investments which was strong enough
powerful enough to get the powerful
state the main states to back off from
it was internet organized other
countries have done even war the
overthrow of the Suharto dictatorship in
Indonesia was substantially based on
internet communication among students
and others not a lot of people had
internet access there but enough so that
they could get around the dictatorial
controls and help create a popular
movement which overthrew the dictator in
South Korea there was just as remarkable
demonstration of democracy through the
internet and their last election South
Korea happens to be a very wired up
country I think probably more than any
in the world for capita and through the
internet it was it became it was
possible to develop what amounted to
alternative media that broke the media
monopoly helped organize and bring
people together in support of the
candidate who actually won South Korea
can teach us some lessons and the way
democracy should work this was a real
achievement and it's something that is a
model for others on the other hand we
should also bear in mind that the
Internet is a you know it's got many
facets it's also a method of coercion
and domination it's also a source of a
lot of fantasy you can put up anything
you like on the Internet
good thing but it has its negative
aspect you have to read what you find
there with critical caution and
skepticism Falls Church Virginia hi
it's a real pleasure to talk to you
Brian mr. Chomsky I've got three quick
points that I'd like comment on one is
he's familiar with the Bible Code and is
there any truth to that to comment on
House Republicans can take sayings like
a rising tide lifts all boats
and imply that tax cuts help the poor
when if the tide if there if that's if
you really think about the analogy you
have rowboats that are owned buying the
yachts and they're claiming that because
that that but when they get richer that
the rowboats are going to rise and as
robo's represent minimum wage they've
actually funk and the third is solution
to his real Palestine a states carved
between Egypt and Israel from the Gaza
Strip to the inlet on the other side
just equal amount of land from each side
for me from Israel and Egypt buy out the
land and provide a Palestinian state
what do you think of that thank you
well on the Bible code you know you've
got to make your own judgment but I
don't put any credence in it on the
rising tide lifting all boats that's
really vulgar propaganda that means
exactly as you said it's just the
opposite the tax cuts are targeted for
the benefit of the rich overwhelmingly
and the chances that it'll even
stimulate the economy are very if you
want to stimulate the economy you don't
put money into the hands of the
wealthiest part of the population you
put money into the hands of the poorer
parts of the population we'll spend it
and that'll stimulate investment and so
on it's not a stimulus to the economy
it's a gift to the wealthy and to call
it a the propaganda that's behind it is
disgraceful on israel-palestine the idea
of a one to one land swap it does make
sense but if you take a look at the map
think proposal that you made isn't gonna
work there's no way of making a land
swap on the egypt-israel border that
would mean anything the it wouldn't do
any good for Gaza and it and the main
Palestinian population is in the West
Bank that's where they live that's where
they have a right to live at least you
know they have other claims which
they've mostly abandoned but at least
the 22 percent of the mandatory
Palestine that is in the West Bank
should be effectively theirs maybe with
some land swaps along the border but
Israel did offer a little piece of the
Negev cutting it out as a gesture in the
Clinton Barack offers but that was
meaningless if you looked at where it
was it didn't mean a thing
Phoenix go ahead please yes I really
disagree with your comment about the
United States sanctioning or determining
Israeli policy it seems to me into most
Americans that with the three billion
dollars and heed that we give to Israel
every year and the three billion in
military dollars and then now recently
with eleven billion dollar loan back
Spencer our F greed too that Israel is
basically got us by the short hairs
right now with a pack and jinsa giving
money to the congressman they can't turn
around and vote against these things
so all you have all these all this money
that's going to Israel it turns around
gets used by the military complex to buy
weapons for Israel and the United States
citizens being but losing control of
their congressmen because if they vote
against these things then they get put
like like Jim Moran being ostracized for
stating the truth then you have a
situation where you have the Pentagon
controlled by Wolfowitz and Pearl and
dr. that crime who have millions of 800
million dollars missing in
appropriations that Americans feel
helpless in terms of how money is being
given to Israel spent for the benefit of
Israel and then you say that that we
control Israel I think you got it
entirely backwards I'd like your comment
about that yeah
well it's a topic I've written about a
lot and I won't try to run through it
but there has been a debate for some
time as to the sources of us what's
called us support for Israel I don't
even like that phrase I think it's very
harmful to Israel but us support for
Israeli expansion and militarism that's
what it is what are the sources of that
well you know of one theory is what you
describe
it's the lobbies and the influence on
Congress and so on my view is that the
record doesn't support that what it
shows I think and I've tried to give the
evidence for this in print is that the
u.s. relationship to Israel has very
closely tracked the conception of Israel
as a what's called a strategic asset for
the United States
I can't run through the record now but I
think if you look through it you'll find
that as Israel was regarded as part of
the effectively the part of the US
system for dominating Middle East oil
resources which is the main concern in
so far it was recognized as an asset for
that connections with Israel increased
so in 1958 for example the US
intelligence for the first time
described it called for a more support
for Israel because on the grounds that
as they put it a logical corollary of
our opposition to Arab nationalism is
support for Israel as one of the as a
reliable base for u.s. power in the
region alongside of Turkey and at that
time you ran these are the so-called
peripheral States that oppose Arab
nationalism in 1967 us support for
Israel shot up but that was not because
of effects on Congress it was because
Israel performed a major service to the
United States it destroyed the center of
Arab nationalism namely Nasser's
Egypt which was regarded as a threat to
the oil-producing monarchies and to US
domination of the region okay Israel
wiped it out aid Israel
way up and I think the record continues
like that by now Israel's become
virtually an offshore US military base a
lot of as you mentioned a lot of the
money that goes to Israel comes right
back to the United States and military
equipment in the high-tech industry and
by now there that just very closely
enter integrated as highly militarized
societies based on heavily on high-tech
military industry by now Israel has a
military forces which according to their
own army the IDF the air and armored
forces are larger and more advanced than
those of any NATO power outside the
United States though it's a tiny country
but that's because it's a effectively an
offshore military base for the United
States and I think when the United
States has not wanted Israel to do
something and it's told them so they
always back down the lobby goes away has
little effect but it's it's arguable I
mean there's evidence on both sides and
I suggest you pursue it Boston you're
next
yes my question is in regard to the
Green Party I understand norm as a
supporter would that be true in general
yeah supporter in principle I had my own
view if you're asking how I thought
people had a vote in the 2000 election
is that I was supported what was called
at the time you know tactical voting I
mean in states like Massachusetts where
the outcome was clear in advance I think
it made sense to vote for the Green
Party as a way of building up an
alternative and ultimately important
organization and the political life of
the country in states that if I had been
voting in Florida I would have voted
against bush because I thought there was
enough of a difference between the
candidates to want it not to go to bush
in the Republicans
so it's a support but yes next Barstow
California you're on the air
Barstow go ahead dr. Chomsky I wanted to
ask how you can possibly turn to the UN
as some source of moral authority it
seems to me Eck I don't see how it can
be regarded as anything other than a
totalitarian instrument of the same
corporate elites that you claim there is
interest you claim to oppose well the UN
is first of all the UN remember can do
nothing beyond what the great powers
primarily the United States allow it to
do so it operates within a framework set
by great power interests nevertheless it
does represent a wider range of
interests and concerns than any
particular country I don't say it's a
moral authority and I've never called it
that but the UN has can become and to
some extent has been a important and
effective instrument for doing many good
things in the world it cannot do so
beyond the limits of what the great
powers will permit I have a stack of
emails here and we're running out of
time and I'm if you don't mind keeping
the answers short I'll try to go through
a bunch Bob Feldman thought you might be
interested in asking MIT professor
Chomsky one is it true that the twelfth
largest recipient of US Air Force War
research contracts in 1999 MIT also
provides him with office space for his
literary work I don't know if it's the
twelfth largest but it's certainly a big
military contractor so for example in
the 1960s when I was very active against
the war and involved in direct
resistance facing jail in jail and so on
I was actually a hundred percent funded
by the Pentagon I in fact MIT altogether
if I remember the figures was about 90
percent Pentagon funded or something
like that and it's undoubtedly still a
substantial less much less than that but
a substantial military contractor
also there's some book
being questions so MIT administers
laboratories which are full-time
Pentagon laboratories but whether it's
twelfth largest or not I can't tell you
this is from San Francisco and I'm sorry
about the pronunciation that's you mayor
it looks like I'm curious as to what
Professor Chomsky's reaction was to
hearing that President Carter was
awarded Nobel Peace Prize well I don't
think that the recipients so the the
Nobel Peace Prize is a very mixed story
in the case of Carter what he was
offered the prize for is what we should
be asking about he was primarily offered
the prize because of the Camp David
peace agreements in nineteen seventy
seventy eight which established a peace
treaty between Egypt and Israel and that
was regarded as a great diplomatic
triumph and so on that's a gross
misrepresentation of the facts and what
in fact the peace treaty was based on an
offer that Egypt made in 1971 in 1971
President Sadat of Egypt offered a full
peace treated Israel mentioning nothing
about the Palestinians nothing about the
occupied territories full peace in
return for Israeli evacuation of
Egyptian territory Sinai Israel can
recognize that as a genuine peace
offered considered it turned it down
because they wanted to expand into the
Sinai the US had to make a choice at
that point Egypt was in fact following
the u.s. position official position the
u.s. had to decide whether to persist in
that or to shift it and support Israeli
expansion Henry Kissinger
called for what he called stalemate no
negotiations just reliance on force the
us back to Israel's rejection of the
offer that led almost directly to the
1973 war which was
very dangerous for Israel very
destructive almost led to a nuclear war
years of oppression violence and terror
finally in 1977 and 78 the US and Israel
basically accepted so that's original
offer I don't regard that as a
diplomatic triumph I think was a
diplomatic catastrophe
Matthew Conover hi I'm a bit of a fan of
mr. Chomsky's work since picking
necessary allusions five or six years
ago since then I've read countless
essays and interviews in finding
American power and the new mandarins
rather relevant to current events
however mr. Chomsky makes it clear he
doesn't like his personal life discussed
because he disdains the cult of
personality
I completely understand this but it
doesn't stop me from being curious about
his life so I was excited to read The
New Yorker profile a couple of months
ago I'm just wondering if mr. Chomsky
also read it and what his thoughts are
about it are I wouldn't comment on it
frankly but did you cooperate except to
advise you not to take anything in it
seriously unless you can verify it
independently it's it's an attack on a
political hated political enemy in an
attempt to discredit them you can decide
for yourself whether it's right or wrong
but just check anything verifiable and
attack on Union events did I understand
later up did you talk to them I talked
to anybody you know any journalist comes
into my office I talk to them
MacFarquhar was the woman who wrote the
piece I believe but I say you that's for
you to judge just check through anything
in it that you can verify okay and see
what you discover hello dr. Chomsky this
is from Catherine B King you give us
your severus criticism of the left as a
general movement that also has manifest
in today's ethical and political
situation I think we may learn more
about how to make things work from such
a critique than from the current polemic
with the right so should there be a
critique of the left will you give us
and I give her C criticism of the left
well you know the left is so amorphous I
don't know what to say I mean there are
parts of the left that I disagree with
radically there are parts of what's
called the left that
I support the I just know how to comment
I mean their thing many of the positions
taken by people who are considered on
the left I think are completely wrong
others completely right you have to go
case by case
Jerry Stinson of Greenwich Connecticut
two or three weeks ago I emailed
professor Chomsky on the importance of
voting George W Bush out of office in
November 2004 is courteous reply
expressed agreement that this particular
president should not be given an
additional four years in office assuming
then that professor Chomsky believes
President Bush is worth mobilizing
voters against I'd like to hear his
reasons for believing so to put it very
simply what's so bad about President
Bush
well there are President Bush stands for
an international and a domestic policy
both of which I think are extremely
dangerous the domestic policy is what
was discussed earlier to drive the
country into a fiscal train wreck
through the tax cuts benefiting the
wealthy which will lead to the
elimination of social programs like
those that Ari Fletcher mentioned
Medicare Medicaid Social Security
probably schools others and turn the
popular and return the population to the
country to a period before the
progressive legislation of the past
century which has very much improved
things I think it's perfect but it's
been an improvement I think that's a
disaster internationally the program is
exactly what was stated in the national
security strategy a call for us global
domination through force with acceptance
of the right to attack anyone who might
potentially challenge us domination
that's outlandish I mean that's a call
for us to be submitted the Nuremberg
trials Greenwich Connecticut you're on
they're very ironic that was my letter
you read if I could just ask the rest of
the the other question and that is
is this you Jerry Stenson yes okay I
rest of us is there a candidate or
undeclared Democrat or not who you
believe offer a significant alternative
to Bush and can win is that what you
want that's it
Thanks thank you well there are two
questions there are significant
alternative and can win like I think
Dennis Kucinich offers a very
significant alternative but whether you
can ever remember an election in the
United States unfortunately is a media
campaign a media so in fact based on
huge funding primarily corporate funding
its public relations show and we ought
to change that but that's the way it is
on other candidates it's a complicated
story I won't comment New York City dr.
Tomsky the privilege to speak with you I
was wondering if I could get your
thoughts on the u.s. his most recent
immigration policy where it is
drastically reducing the numbers of
highly skilled and professional educated
workers from China India Pakistan and
other developing countries ostensibly to
reduce unemployment among qualified
Americans and yet on the other hand they
are freely granting Immigration and
Citizenship to workers from Mexico Cuba
who are for the most part minimum wage
earners I was wondering if you thought
there were any political as opposed to
economic reasons for this well groups
Cuba's a separate case I mean people the
US has been trying to stimulate
immigration from Cuba but that's for
because it's been trying since 1959 to
bring down the Cuban government Mexico
again is a special case low-wage Mexican
labor is you know maintains part of the
lifestyle of Americans by producing
extremely it's extremely cheap exploited
labor which is working under inhuman
conditions and the agricultural system
that's a disgrace in itself as to
keeping out more skilled workers well
you know that's groups that have power
are going
try to protect themselves and skill
professionals do have a wield
considerable power they don't want to be
a Vanowen competition whether what
immigration policy should be like is a
another question altogether I mean if we
believed in free trade if anybody
believes in free trade they would accept
Adam Smith's principle that free trade
is based on free distribution of Labor
free movement of labor and not just free
movement of capital is that a correct
policy well probably not because there
are a lot of other issues that conflict
with it about you know maintaining
national cultures and all sorts of other
things so I think it's it's not easy to
state generally what an immigration
policy should be like but the reasons
for the choices that you're pointing to
I think are reasonably clear I know you
said we should make up our own mind on
the New Yorker article but there's a
couple of paragraphs I want to read and
ask you about it has to do with your
wife who is with you today
Carol Astor she's how many how many
years have you been married since 1949
Carol shares her husband views and has
been politically involved herself but
she dislikes the activists existence
even more than he does my life has
certainly not turned out the way I
expected she said to me the interesting
question is if I were in the position of
making the choice to marry now would I
choose him she went on that's a funny
question who knows I mean it's very
different from what I expected just in
terms of the fame and notoriety and
whatever you call it the intrusion of
public life the ridiculous clutching at
him the noblesse oblige aspect sometimes
he says I just have to take that call
we've actually got it now so that the
phone almost never rings except when
it's rings at 3 a.m. from some party
where kids are having an excess ear a or
nose or who knows what well he's got
into contacts very much out of context
and selected in order to present a
certain impression I mean some of the
words may be accurate but that's the
reporters goal is to present a certain
picture you can ask my wife how she
thinks about that
assuming we have more time we get around
El Cajon California you're on the air
dr. Chomsky I'm wondering if you might
comment on the failure to find the
weapons of mass destruction that were
supposedly held by Iraq and the
implications that would have for the
United States and in the world if no
such weapons are found thank you
well there's in out in the rest of the
world it's a big issue in England that's
leading to major attacks on the
government the former foreign secretary
Robin Cook just had a long sharp
critique of the government for simply
lying to the public the position of the
British government was very simple and
straightforward you know that Mr Blair
said today that he's going to lay out
the information which will show that
they have found weapons of mass today
okay I haven't seen that yeah but up
till now they have not presented any
meaningful evidence what they I mean
frankly I'm surprised I mean I would be
very surprised if you couldn't find some
evidence that Iraq was producing
biological and chemical weapons my
suspicion is if you actually 40 miles
from Washington last week someone found
it was they found anthrax and other
bacteria that had been left over from
some program presumably terminated so
they claimed and you're certainly going
to find that somewhere or other but the
failure to find the weapons of mass
destruction that were claimed and the
undermining of specific claims has been
pretty remarkable
you'll recall that Colin Powell's
position and the official government
position here was his words the single
issue is will Iraq disarm if that was
the single issue and you can't find
weapons of mass destruction that means
plenty of fabrication and in fact the
intelligence community itself is up in
arms about this we got one call laughed
and we're finished at noon in Georgia go
ahead please
if you had any thoughts on the late John
rolls theory of Justice thanks
we've just got a minute yeah well he was
at he's a extraordinarily important
philosopher and a wonderful person that
knew him too from endlessly important
book it revitalized political philosophy
in the 20th century your immediate
future you're hearing Washington do
something later today
I got talk as usual this afternoon back
to Boston more talk more next button a
book middle of a book almost finishing a
book right now when will it be out as
soon as I find enough scattered moments
here and there to put it in the piece of
the final pieces of it you're saying the
fall I hope you're seventy-four years
old
yep coming up to 75 plan to retire
anytime soon from all of us formally
every tax a couple of years ago but
that's formal just keeping changes no I
don't see any major changes in the
future if you've just joining us we've
had three hours with dr. Noam Chomsky
he's based at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology a native of Philadelphia a
graduate of Philadelphia versity of
Pennsylvania 1949 got his MA there in 51
and his PhD in 55 and has published 98
books in his life thank you very much
for joining us thank you thanks to our
audience have a good day
