it states yes nice yeah why does the
United States support Israel well
there's a history and a very interesting
one that actually goes back to goes back
a long time that one thing to remember
is that Christian Zionism is a very
powerful force which goes back long
before Jewish Zionism in England
particularly Christian Zionism was a
powerful force among British elites it's
part of the motivation for the Balfour
Declaration and for Britain's support
for the Jewish colonization of Israel
remember the Bible said you know and
that's a big part of British elite
culture same in the United States
Woodrow Wilson was a devout Christian
who read the Bible every day so did
Harry Truman in the Roosevelt
administration one of the leading
officials Harold Ickes once described
the return of the Jews to Palestine as
the greatest event in history it's
realizing the lesson of the Bible these
are deeply religious countries in which
the biblical command so-called are taken
quite literally also this is just part
of colonization this is the last phase
of European colonization and notice that
the countries that are most strongly in
support of Israel are not just the
United States it's the United States
Australia and Canada the offshoots of
England Anglosphere sometimes called
unusual forms of imperialism
these are settler colonial societies
callin societies in which the not like
India not like the British and India's a
societies South aircraft was a little
like this or Algeria under the French
settler colonial societies in which the
settlers came in essentially eliminated
the native population also driven by
religious principles very religious
groups
driven by Christian Zionism those are
major cultural factors there are also
significant geostrategic factors and you
go back to 1948 there was actually a
split between the State Department and
the Pentagon in the United States over
how to react to the new State of Israel
the State Department was was questioned
it was not committed strongly to Israeli
conquests the establishment State and
was concerned about the refugees it
wanted an implementation of the refugee
problem the Pentagon on the other hand
record was very impressed with Israel's
military potential the Israeli military
successes if you look back at the
internal record and Declassified the
Joint Chiefs of Staff described Israel
as the second largest military force in
the region after Turkey and a potential
base for US power in the region that
continued can't run through the whole
record but in 1958 when there was a
serious crisis in the region Israel was
the only state that strongly cooperated
with Britain in the United States and it
won plenty of support from the
governments and the military for that
reason 1967 is when the current
relations with Israel were pretty much
established Israel performed a major
service to the United States by
destroying a secular Arab nationalism a
major enemy of the United States and
supporting radical Islam which the u.s.
supported and it continues right until
the present right now we saw an example
of that just during the Gaza latest Gaza
attack you recall that at one point
Israel began to run out of munitions
during the assault despite the fact that
it
armed to the teeth the United States
provided Israel with additional
munitions through the Pentagon and
notice where they were taken from these
were music US munitions pre-positioned
in Israel for eventual used by US forces
one of many signs of how the Israel is
regarded as essentially a military
officer of the United States very close
intelligence relations that go way back
many other connections and the media
tend to take up to support the policy of
the government with very few you know
kind of little questioning around the
edges but basically accept the policy so
for example take another issue I take
the US invasion of Iraq you cannot find
the phrase US invasion of Iraq in the US
media that was obviously an invasion a
blatant act of aggression a textbook
case of its Nuremberg trials called the
supreme international crime cannot be
mentioned President Obama is praised as
an opponent of the invasion and What did
he say
he said it's a mistake it's a strategic
blunder we're not going to get away with
it that's about as that's the kind of
opposition that you heard from the
German General Staff during Hitler's
invasion of Russia
it's a blunder shouldn't do it and
should knock off England first that's
regarded as opposition the same in
Vietnam it's no there's now a
commemoration underway big commemoration
of us sacrifices in Vietnam try to find
the phrase US invasion of South Vietnam
there or anywhere in the past years
since 1961 when it took place
non-existent maybe on Democracy Now
would I write but way out of the fringe
and this is not unique to the United
States takes a Britain right now there's
interesting debates in the British
literary journals like The Times
Literary Supplement as to whether
Britain should finally begin to
recognize the genocide 'el the word
that's used genocidal character of
British colonization hundreds of years
ago should Israel should Britain begin
to face it you know you can ask that
question in many places the tendency of
the intellectual community to go along
like a herd in support of state power
private power is just overwhelming
we intellectuals like to think of
themselves as dissident critical
courageous standing up against power
absolutely untrue
look at this - Oracle record that's a
small fringe and they're usually
punished the mainstream tends to be what
was once called a herd of independent
Minds marching in support of state power
nothing new here unfortunate if the
fight against it
not new
