hmm so yes if it's hard to say anything
about the prospects what about the
obstacles of home what do you see as the
main obstacles in our society and the
main elements of power that has to be
challenged or overcome if if the demands
of ya a movements like you have to come
in I 260 again some of the first
different societies but there's a lot
similar for one thing there is but
throughout the Western world there's
highly concentrated the economic power
which therefore carries with it a very
strong political power there are forces
of repression which can be mobilized to
prevent popular movements and developing
but they're they're relatively fragile
it's not like you know fascist state so
they're fragile and they can be
undermined by popular resistance they're
not simple you know but it can be done
has been done so for example tix of the
civil rights movement
in the south where took off a repression
was really vicious I mean it was like
psychic states under recall
demonstrations their demonstrator I'm
people killed no it wasn't a joke but it
makes significant progress the other but
the major problem I think is kind of a
combination of hopelessness and apathy
it's hard to distinguish between them
but for most of the population much as
population things nothing can be done
that shows in pretty remarkable ways so
for example they don't keep to the
United States the attitudes towards
systems of power are quite remarkable so
a provable Congress is in literally
single digits I've probably most kind of
population things they already thrown
out
the presidential candidates knowledge
hire banks hated you know corporations
despise you know almost anything any
estrogen can pick but people don't like
it they think it's just harming them but
they don't think they can do anything
about it sometimes it's almost surreal
but take it what's called here the 911
of truth movement people who think that
the Bush administration was responsible
for 911 it's a substantial part of the
population probably about a third of the
population thinks it's at least
plausible may be true so that means say
a third of the population thinks that
we're governed by people who are
homicidal maniacs who want a murderous
rule but we can't do anything about it
so you believe it when you get to try to
go on with your daily life and this
sense that everything is hopeless is a
very good technique control it can
understand dissent on there's no doorman
the labor movement has been
significantly destroyed not totally but
largely dia other popular institutions
barely exist if a if some action takes
place in the United States say a talk or
some organizing event or something takes
place either a university or a jerk
because that's all there is
if you go to other countries often we
made out a union hall or something but
they don't nothing like that is this
year so people are very atomized they're
very separated from one another they're
burdened with debt their doctrine ated
from infancy with consumers culture you
can only evaluate your arm that
determined who you are what value you
have diamond commodities you have people
are separate from one another this very
little interaction well that does
contribute to a sense of hopelessness
and that's a technique of indoctrination
control uh not if you were coming people
have to get to feel that they can do
something every organizer noses if
you're trying to organize them whatever
man is an anti-poverty campaign or
campaign against electoral fraud or
whatever it is in the inner city of one
of the things you really have to start
with is something simple get people
together to see if they can maybe get a
traffic light put up in a street where
children have to cross the street to go
to school and get to work on that and if
you can
achieve that you get a sensible we can
eat something you know that we run
something else but that's the way
organizing always work in fact be
sitting at the lunch counter was an
example let's see if we can get the
right to have a cup of coffee to lunch
counter and if you can get that we can
go on to something bigger which and it's
a look at the history of social
movements interesting to see how they
work its civil rights rules is an
interesting case it did achieve a lot
but it hit a barrier that it couldn't
cross take Martin Luther King if you
listen to the speeches on Martin Luther
King Day you know extolling his great
achievement they end on in 1963 with a
speech I have a dream speech to her by
note but Martin Luther King didn't stop
in 1963 he went on to try to face class
issues and as soon as he did that he was
driven out of polite society and made no
progress on that fact the day he was
assassinated
he was on its way to organize a march to
Washington for the start try to start
for people's movement and after its
assassination the March took place his
wife leaded his widow it got to
Washington they set up a tent city
resurrection city and Congress is just
the most liberal converse in American
history quickly pulled out the police
they came in the middle of the night a
dramatic destroyed the city threw him a
lot of town that's what happens when you
try to face classes so and that's not
that parties life's never discussed
we're clean everything's good yeah so
this leads to my second question if such
as a lot of the things that I was going
to ask you them because we've been
learning about their health care system
here and the healthcare playing system
and I'm quite surprised about the big
differences that there is compared to
where I'm from Denmark anywhere yeah the
United is unique in the industrial world
so I want to ask how come since you have
had such great characters and movements
like you mentioned King and many others
that there is such a big difference
between the usps to an unusual extent to
business from society I mean all Western
society debate with business room but
the u.s. is extreme and it has been for
150 years and one consequence of that is
that
benefit system you know well court
systems are much weaker in the United
States been in Europe or Australia
Canada you know any industrial country
and it showed up another way they're
going to take salaries of professionals
and CEO of units of corporation I'm
they're ridiculously high everywhere but
in the United States it's there in
stratosphere the year and the power of
if you take a look at the electric
elections elections they're not
wonderful anywhere but in the United
States you can pretty well predict the
outcome of an election just by the
amount of campaign funded and you can
pretty well predict policies by the
concentration of campaign funding that's
been pretty well studied incidentally
some of the best kind of left political
science literature that's quite
remarkable which means that elections
based we don't take place the campaign
funding of course comes overwhelmingly
from the corporate sector and the
wealthy so they essentially by the
election and the result is you get
policies that reflect their interests
but not the interest of the population
so take healthcare again for a long time
now 50 years or more the public has
pretty much supported some kind of
national health care system that what
people usually say is it Canadian styles
distant not just kind of it's so great
but that's the only country and I know
to this very insular country
if you ask people where Denmark is
ethanol say it's in Africa literally so
it was very internally directed country
so you know that Canada exists so people
say a canadian-style system which is ok
but not the best buy anything but they
just can't get through I mean when in
the current debate over health care
system there was one residue of a
national health care system was called a
public option it's like one of the
choices would be can people choose to be
in a public system it was about almost
two to one support for that but Obama
didn't even try I tried it just
abandoned it quickly and young and
that's the power of the financial
institution of the United States is I
think the only country in the world as
far as I know where there's our laws
that say that comp that the government
can't negotiate drug prices so drug
prices are two to three times as high as
they are anywhere else you go and look
for some favorite drug in the local
pharmacy will cease way higher than it
is anyone because the government can't
negotiate prices well that's the power
of the pharmaceutical industry and then
a business run society that would to get
strong Decimus centers of power and
normally influential and government
announced words that people can't get a
public health care system even if they
want it thus the
it's something on the case but public
policy we usually it did a very
different from public opinion against
the dead by checking cold healthcare to
striking example health care is a very
important example not only for human
reason most kinds of names of people who
have known no access to healthcare fit
in an emergency room yeah but also just
a straight economic current example at
the United States had a health care
system compro was a down market or any
other society there wouldn't be a
deficit at all to be surplus but even
that doesn't matter have to read the
press never talk to them but Obama's
power program proof things a little but
nothing what other countries nothing
like what the public wants so how I
guess it's a question of priorities and
we all have to make up our own mind but
then a lot of the exhibition that I've
been engaged in in Denmark and a lot of
the people i know is a very critical
towards state and state power it's very
critical to us today power or very
focused on limiting their the power of
the state then but isn't that in that a
bit dangerous in a society like to learn
dangerousness society which has a strong
private power private our state fairs
bad not
private parriage a lot worse estate
powers at least partially accountable to
the public private power is totally
unaccountable to the public like you can
vote to influence who your
representative will be in Parliament but
you can't vote for what the major
corporations will do that's in principle
so that in fact if you didn't so yes I'm
opposed to state power to but you have
to recognize this another major power
there actually is an image that once
borrowed from the rural workers in
Brazil the rural workers union had an
image about living in a cage they say
we're living in a cage and we what we do
is try to broaden push the back bar
farther out but we also need the cage I
mean if there's a saber-toothed tiger
outside you want the cave even if you
don't like cages well we're living in a
cage with unaccountable private power
there and unless we have some government
partially accountable institution that
can protect us from Italy total disaster
so how do we reduce the power of
corporations I think they just totally
they're already in there already arm
movement and they ought to be expanded
to just move to a community and work
around corporation no corporations
worker and community on dinner project
the reason why I mean something there
are some that distance I'm quite
successful my tech say Spain everyone
knows Spain has so cold enough problems
fiscal problems unemployment problem not
entirely I'm mantra gun doesn't that's
the biggest work around collective in
the world it's quite cute and they're
done okay you know they obviously are
affected by the recession but not
unemployment the bank's the hospitals in
school learning work and there's no
reason why I can't be expanded over the
whole society it in fact that's being
done to an extent like in the United
States to version it's not massive but
there's a growth of work around
enterprises it just was just a an
agreement made between mantra gun and
the steelworkers union in the United
States try to expand similar
prizes figure it could be with enough
popular organization it could work so a
couple of years ago Obama basically
nationalized the banks and the auto
industry that's what it amounted to you
know the bailouts are basically
nationalization also means the public
own well what happened and they were
given back to their original owners
people very much like them at public
extent but another possibility would
have been dependent over the workforce
and if the Occupy movement had a
district it's powerful and I would feel
frustrated so these are things that can
be that they're not utopian they're on
the border of possibility I'd like to
thank you thanks so much
good see you you can say to have a good
trip
you
