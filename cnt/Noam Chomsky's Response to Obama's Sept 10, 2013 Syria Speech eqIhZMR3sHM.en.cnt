to talk more about President Obama's
speech and the crisis in Syria were
joined by the world-renowned political
dissident linguist author MIT professor
Noam Chomsky he's authored numerous
books his latest is on Western terrorism
from Hiroshima to drone warfare that's
out next week he joins us via Democracy
Now video stream from his home in
Massachusetts Noam welcome to Democracy
Now first let's get your response to
President Obama's announcing last night
and a nationwide address which I'm sure
was watched worldwide that for the
moment there would be no strike on Syria
as the u.s. supports a Russian plan to
deal with the chemical weapons stockpile
of Syria well the Russian plan is a
godsend for Obama
it saves him from what would look like a
very serious political defeat he has not
been able to obtain virtually any
international support for this the
action he's contemplating that even
Britain wouldn't support it and it
looked as though Congress wasn't going
to support it either which would leave
him completely out on a limb
this leaves him a way out he can
maintain the threat of force that which
incidentally is a crime under
international law that we should bear in
mind that the core principle of the
United Nations Charter bars the threat
or use of force threat or use of force
so all of this is criminal to begin with
but it will continue with that the
United States is a rogue state it
doesn't pay any attention to
international law he was kind of
interesting what he didn't say this
would be a perfect opportunity to ban
chemical weapons either to impose the
Chemical Weapons Convention on the
Middle East the convention contrary
what Obama said does not specifically
refer just to use of chemical weapons it
refers to production storage or use of
chemical weapons
that's banned by the international norm
that Obama likes to preach about well
there is a country which happens to be
happens to have illegally annexed part
of Syrian territory which has chemical
weapons and is in violation of the
Chemical Weapons Convention and has
refused even to ratify it namely Israel
so here's an opportunity to eliminate
chemical weapons from the region to
impose the Chemical Weapons Convention
as it's actually formulated but Obama
was very careful not to say that he for
reasons which are too obvious to go into
he and that gap is highly significant
of course chemical weapons should be
eliminated everywhere but certainly in
that region the other things that he
said were not unusual but nevertheless
kind of shocking to anyone not familiar
with US political discourse at least so
he described the you know he said that
for seven decades the United States has
been the anchor of global security
really seven decades now that includes
for example just 40 years ago today when
the United States played a major role in
overthrowing the parliamentary democracy
of Chile and imposing a brutal
dictatorship called the first 911 and
Latin America go back to earlier years
overthrowing the parliamentary system
and Iran imposing a dictatorship same
Guatemala a year later attacking into
Indochina worst crime and the books were
period killing millions of people
Central America killing involved in
killing in imposing a dictatorship in
the Congo and invading Iraq on and on
that's debility I mean that a Harvard
Law School graduate can pronounce those
words is pretty amazing as is the fact
that they're accepted without comment so
what he said is I'm gonna lie like a
trooper about history I'm gonna suppress
the u.s. role the actual US role for the
last seven decades I'm going to maintain
the threat of force which is of course
illegal and I'm going to ensure that the
Chemical Weapons Convention is not
imposed on the region because our ally
Israel would be subjected to it I think
those are some of the main points of his
address Noam Chomsky Noam Chomsky the
world renowned linguist political
dissident we're going to go to break and
then spend the hour with him on
President Obama's policy and what's
happening in the Middle East my fellow
Americans for nearly seven decades the
United States has been the anchor of
global security this has meant doing
more than forging international
agreements it has meant enforcing them
the burdens of leadership are often
heavy but the world is a better place
because we have borne them and so to my
friends on the right I ask you to
reconcile your commitment to America's
military might with a failure to act
when a cause is so plainly just to my
friends on the Left I ask you to
reconcile your belief in freedom and
dignity for all people with those images
of children writhing in pain and going
still on a cold hospital floor for
sometimes resolutions and statements of
condemnation are simply not enough
indeed I'd ask every member of Congress
and those of you watching at home
tonight to view those videos
of the attack and then ask what kind of
world will we live in if the United
States of America sees a dictator
brazenly violate international law with
poison gas and we choose to look the
other way that was President Obama
addressing the nation last night
professor Noam Chomsky your response to
his description of those who oppose
military strike against Syria for a
chemical weapons attack once again
what's particularly interesting is what
he didn't say so yes
good idea to look at the videos of the
gas attack in Syria but then we could
also look at the photos of deformed
fetuses in saikhan hospitals still
appearing decades after John F Kennedy
launched a major chemical warfare attack
against South Vietnam 1961 dousing the
country with poisonous dioxin laced
Agent Orange dioxins of one of the major
carcinogens the attack was aimed at food
crops in an effort and ground cover the
part of the general assault against the
country a huge number of atrocities
millions of people killed that chemical
the effects of chemical warfare are felt
until today partially by American
soldiers do or we could look at the
photos of other deformed fetuses coming
regularly in Fallujah attacked by the US
Marines in November 2004 the killing
several thousand people destroying much
of the town using weapons which of
unknown character but which left
radiation levels that epidemiologically
to Hiroshima under the effects of that
on
I cancer rates on deformed fetuses on
children devastated by horrifying
deformities that we could look at -
those are the ways in which the US has
brought has been the anchor for global
security for seven decades can run
through the record if there were time
but everyone should know it these of
course that's not said the USB the idea
that the US has introduced and imposed
principles of international law
that's hardly even a joke that the
United States has even gone so far as to
veto Security Council resolutions
calling on all states to observe
international law that was in the 1980s
under Reagan no state was mentioned but
it was evident that the intention was to
request the United States to observe
international law after it had rejected
a World Court judgement condemning it
for what was called unlawful use of
force means international terrorism
against Nicaragua in fact the US has
been a rogue state a leading rogue state
radically violating international law
refusing to accept international
conventions there's hardly any
international conventions that the US
has accepted and those few that it has
accepted our condition and so as to be
inapplicable to the United States that's
true even though the Genocide Convention
of the United States is self authorized
to commit genocide in fact that was
accepted by the International Court of
Justice in the case of Yugoslavia versus
NATO that one of the charges was
genocide the u.s. appealed to the court
saying that by law the United States is
immune to the charge of genocide in self
immunized and the court accepted that so
the case proceeded
against the other NATO powers but not
against the United States in fact the
United States when it joined the World
Court it helped introduce the modern
world Court in 1946 and joined the World
Court but with their reservation the
reservation is that international
agreements laws do not apply to the
United States so the UN Charter the
Charter the Organization of American
States that the u.s. is immune to their
self immunized to their requirements
against the threat and use of force
intervention and so on
it's kind of astonishing I mean I know
it's hard to be astonished but it should
be astonishing that a president of the
United States who is furthermore a
constitutional lawyer or a graduate of
Harvard Law School can say things like
this in the full knowledge that the
facts are exactly the opposite radically
the opposite and there are millions and
millions of victims who can testify to
that
right today is happens to be a important
date the 40th anniversary of the
overthrow of the parliamentary democracy
of Chile with substantial US aid now
because we insisted on having a vicious
dictatorship which became a major
international terror center with our
support rather than allowing a
democratic socialist government well
that's these are some of the realities
of the world the picture that the
president presented is that doesn't even
merit a name fairytale well professor
Noam Chomsky why do you think that the
u.s. so quickly started to push for
military strikes and what do you think
the US or the international community
should do to deal with this alleged use
of chemical weapons in Syria what do you
think the appropriate response would be
the appropriate response would be to
call for
imposing the Chemical Weapons Convention
in the Middle East in fact beyond but
will keep to the Middle East which would
mean that any country that is in
violation of that convention of whether
it has accepted it or not would be
compelled to eliminate it swept its
chemical weapons stores just maintaining
those stores producing chemical weapons
all of that's in violation of the
Convention and now's a perfect
opportunity to do that of course that
would require that the US ally Israel
give up its chemical weapons and permit
international inspections incidentally
this should extend to nuclear weapons as
well we the further step would be to to
move towards the kinds of negotiations
Geneva negotiations that the UN
negotiator our left our Brahimi has been
calling for with Russian support and
with the United States kind of dragging
its feet the Obama Mis stated that to
last night now that's the one thin hope
and it's pretty thin for some way to
allow Syria to escape what is in fact
plunge to sua several suicide and why do
you think the US started to push for
military action so swiftly as it always
does the United States is a violent
military state it's been involved in
military action all over the place that
it invaded South Vietnam practically
destroyed Indochina vated Iraq this
elicited a sunni-shia conflict which is
now tearing the region to shreds I don't
have to run through the rest of the
record but the United States moves very
quickly to military action unilaterally
sometimes can get some allies to go
along in this case you can't even do
that and it's just the routine the
United States is self immunized from
international law which bans the threat
or use of force and this is taken for
granted here so for example when
President Obama repeatedly says all
options are open with regard to Iran
that's a violation of fundamental
international law it says we are using
the threat of force in violation of
international law that to which we are
self immunized there's nothing new about
this can you think of any other country
that's used military force that
internationally on anything remotely
like the scale of the United States
during these seven decades when
according to Obama we've been the anchor
of global security
well Noam Chomsky supporters of the u.s.
plan say that the only reason that Assad
agreed to hand over a relinquish control
over commit chemical weapons was because
of the threat of military force of US
military force and what interest does
the u.s. have in striking Syria
militarily the first comment is is
correct the threat and use of force can
be effective so for example the Russia
was able to control Eastern Europe for
50 years with the threat and occasional
use of force Hitler was able to take
over Czechoslovakia with the threat of
force yes it often works no doubt that's
one of the reasons it's banned under
international other international law of
the reason the pretexts for him
and imposing for carrying out a forceful
act have generally declined to the point
that even the British government hasn't
accepted them the Congress's are they
going to reject them and the United
States the government resorted resorted
to the what is usually the last the last
resort when everything else fails saying
our credibility is at stake that's
correct
u.s. credibility is at stake Obama
issued an edict and it has to be
enforced that's a familiar doctrine as
one of the leading doctrines of world
affairs at credibility of a powerful
violent States and must be maintained
it's occasionally called it the Mafia
doctrine it's essentially the doctrine
by which the godfather of rules is
domains within the Mafia system that's
one of the leading principles of world
order credibility has to be maintained
that that has many variants sometimes
it's called the domino theory if we
don't impose our will here the dominoes
will start to fall others will begin to
be disobedient in the case of Chile
forty years ago and go back to that with
Latin Americans called the first 911
Henry Kissinger explained that Chile
under a nd he said is a virus that might
spread contagion elsewhere all the way
to southern Europe he wasn't saying that
Chilean troops were going to land in
Rome he was concerned rightly that the
model of peaceful parliamentary
democracy might spread in which case the
contagion would spread beyond and the
u.s. system of domination would would
erode just earlier on the program
you had an interview with soil and our
latest Orlando with regard to Chile and
that's exactly the same doctrine applies
there the US carried out invaded Cuba
Pigs invasion when that failed Kennedy
launched a an enormous terrorist
campaign murderous terrorist campaign
the goal was to bring the terrors of the
earth to Cuba as Arthur Schlesinger
described that and it his advisor about
an American advisor was in the hands of
Robert Kennedy and it was no joke was
very serious that's been followed by
fifty years of economic warfare were
very harsh economic warfare all
unilateral the world is overwhelmingly
opposed to it but it doesn't matter we
as a rogue state we do what we like and
the reasons are explicit in the internal
record are the reasons you go back the
early sixties your internal government
record explains that Castro is guilty of
what they called successful defiance of
us principles going back to the Monroe
Doctrine 1823 and no Russians just the
Monroe Doctrine which established in
principle our right to dominate the
atmosphere the US wasn't powerful enough
to do it then but that was the principle
and Castro is carrying out successful
defiance of that principle therefore he
must that Cuba must be subjected to
massive terrorism economic warfare and
strangulation that's been going on for
fifty years
same principle of the Mafia principle
the same was true in Vietnam of the
primary motive for the Indochina Wars
going back to the early 1950s that was
presented here
the domino theory but what that meant
was if you read the internal records
that there was a fear or justified fear
that successful independent development
in Vietnam might spread through the
region might spread contagion through
the region others would attempt the same
path as Vietnam itself was of no great
significance but it might spread as far
as Indonesia which has rich resources
and there - there might be a move
towards independent development
independent of the US domination and it
was even feared that that might bring in
Japan
John dower famous Asia historian
described Japan as the super domino the
US was concerned deeply concerned that
if Southeast Asia moved toward
independent development Japan would
accommodate the word that was used to
East and Southeast Asia becoming its
technological industrial center and
creating a system and Asian system and
from which the US would maybe not be
excluded but at least which wouldn't
control of the US had fought the Second
World War to prevent that that's Japan's
new order and it was in danger of being
reconstituted if Indochina gained
independence
that's the domino theory and that was
understood mcgeorge bundy kennedy
johnson national security advisor in
retrospect observed that the Vietnam War
the United States sure called off the
Vietnam war of 1965 the Y 1965 well
because in 1965 a us-backed military
coup took place in Indonesia
slaughtering hundreds of thousands of
people of wiping out the only mass based
political party and
instituting regime of torture and terror
but opening the country up to Western
exploitation with its rich resources and
that meant that the Vietnam War was
essentially over USA 1 its main
objective is pointless to continue it
that this policy is these are major
principles of world affairs and they're
understandable and they're understood so
go back to Cuba again when Kennedy came
into office he was concerned with
changing Latin American policy developed
the set up of a Latin American research
Commission it was headed by Arthur
Schlesinger as a historian it was an
advisor and they came out with a report
it's been edited by Schlesinger to the
President and in its listener described
the problem of Cuba he said the problem
of Cuba is the Castro idea of taking
matters into your own hands an idea
which may have resonance in other parts
of Latin America where the mass of the
population is subjected to the same kind
of harsh repression that they are in
Cuba and if this idea spreads the u.s.
systems control erodes well going back
to the Middle East is the same in 2007
Noam democracy now interviewed General
Wesley Clark the retired four-star
general who was the supreme Allied
commander of NATO during the Kosovo war
general Clarke described how an unnamed
Pentagon official just after the
September 11th attacks talked about a
memo that said the u.s. plan to take out
seven countries in five years including
Syria about 10 days after 9/11 I went
through the Pentagon and I saw secretary
Rumsfeld and in deputy secretary
Wolfowitz I went downstairs just say
hello to some of the people on the Joint
Staff who used to used to work for me
and one of the generals called me and he
said sir you gotta come in you got to
come in and talk to me a second I said
well you're too busy he said no no he
says we've made the decision we're going
to war with
Arak this was on or about the 20th of
September I said we're going to war with
Iraq why he said I don't know he said I
guess they don't know what else to do so
I said well did they find some
information collect connecting Saddam to
al-qaeda he said no no he says there's
nothing new that way they just made the
decision to go to war with Iraq he said
I guess it's like we don't know what to
do about terrorists but we've got a good
military and we can take down
governments and he said I guess if the
only tool you have is a Hammer Every
Problem has to look like a nail so I
came back to see him a few weeks later
and by that time we were bombing in
Afghanistan I said are we still going to
war with Iraq and he said oh it's worse
than that
he said he reached over on his desk he
picked up a piece of paper he said I
just he said I just got this down from
upstairs meeting the Secretary of
Defense's office today and he said this
is a memo that describes how we're going
to take out seven countries in five
years starting with Iraq and then Syria
Lebanon Libya Somalia Sudan and
finishing off Iran I said is it
classified he said yes sir I said I said
well don't show it to me
and I saw him a year or so ago and I
said you remember that he said so I
didn't show you that memo I didn't show
it to you that was General Wesley Clark
I was interviewing him at the 92nd
Street Y here in New York in 2007
professor Noam Chomsky if you could
respond well I think that it's it's
quite plausible the the Bush
administration veered slightly not far
but slightly from the general pattern
actually the goal of US policy for
decades has been to control and dominate
those countries but the Bush
administration was more extreme
they thought they could actually just as
they put it take her out and forcefully
impose a run of regimes not that that
would be anything new there's a long
list of similar cases going back to Iran
in 1953 Guatemala in 1954 there was a
assault against major assault against
Indonesia in 1958 an effort to strip
away the outer islands where the
resources are and because they were
concerned about too much independence
and Indonesia that failed fasion of Cuba
failed the murder of Lumumba which the
US was involved in the Congo destroyed
Africa's major hope for development
Congo is now total Horror Story for
years the u.s. supported them about the
dictatorship and now it's maybe the
worst place in the world and on
right through case after case this is
standard US policy the Bush
administration went beyond but they were
a more extreme in their goals and their
actions and they had to pull back
because that was just beyond us capacity
of Iraq the Iraq war was a very serious
defeat for the United States unlike the
Vietnam War in the case of Indochina
it's called a defeat but that only means
that the u.s. did not achieve its
maximal objectives it did achieve its
major objectives as McGeorge Bundy well
understood it had prevented a Vietnam
from moving on a path of independent
development which might have had this
contagious effect that Kissinger was
concerned with as it was put at the time
the one rotten apple may spoil the
barrel meaning just what Arthur
Schlesinger and other said if you allow
independent of taking matters into your
own hand and one place that it works
others will try to emulate it system
will erode a standard principle for
systems of power the godfather of the
Mafia understands it perfectly well in
the Mafia system if some small
storekeeper decides not to play pay
protection money that the money may not
mean anything to the Godfather but he's
not gonna let him get away with it and
in fact he's not just going to go in and
send his goons to get the money he's
also gonna beat him to a pulp because
others have to understand that
disobedience is not tolerated in
international affairs that's called
credibility the bombing of Kosovo Wesley
Clark's bombings Kosovo was the same
after other their work pretext that they
collapsed and the final one as Tony
Blair and George Bush said was we have
to maintain the credibility of NATO NATO
had issued edicts and we must ensure the
they're obeyed and NATO of course does
not mean Norway it means the United
States if I could interrupt for a minute
to ask you about your reflections on
this anniversary of the September 11th
2001 attacks here in the United States
your reflections on this anniversary and
also how it relates to Syria and the
Middle East and what needs to be done
now I will respond to that though my own
view is that we should be concentrating
on the first 911 the one in Chile which
was a much worse attack by any dimension
but the one here was very significant
was a major terrorist act thousands of
people killed it's the first time since
the war of 1812 that US territory had
been attacked the United States has had
remarkable security and this therefore
was a inside for the etre Harville
atrocity a very significant historical
event and I changed attitudes and
policies in the United States that are
quite considerably in reaction to this
the government was able to ram through
the laws and Patriot Act and others that
sharply constrained civil liberties it
was able to provide pretexts for
invasion of Afghanistan invasion of Iraq
destruction of Iraq consequences of
spread through the region and it
provides it's the basis for Obama's a
massive terrorist war the drone war is
the most extreme terrorist campaign
that's underway no maybe the most
extreme in history and the justification
for it is the same the second 9/11 9/11
2001
so yes it's had enormous effects on the
society and it's on the Attic
policies many victims throughout the
world can testify to that
how do you see the situation in Syria
being resolved and now can you tie it in
to the larger Middle East crisis talk
about Israel Palestine talk about the
u.s. relationship with Iran and
relationship with Saudi Arabia well this
year Syria right now is plunging into
suicide if the negotiations options that
October he me and Russia and others have
been pressing if that doesn't work a
Syria is moving towards a kind of very
bloody partition it's likely that the
Kurdish areas which already are semi
independent will move towards further
independence probably linked up with the
Iraqi Kurdistan adjacent to them maybe
make some arrangements of Turkey those
are already in process and the rest of
Syria what remains will be divided
between a bloody murderous Assad regime
and a collection of rebel groups of
varying times ranging from secular
Democratic to murderous brutal
terrorists that looks like the outcome
for Syria there is another part of Syria
which is not talked about it's occupied
by Israel and annexed by Israel that's
the Golan Heights annexed in violation
of explicit Security Council orders not
to an exit the bear credibility doesn't
matter because Israel's Anela so that's
another part of Syria that brings us to
Israel Palestine now just a couple of
days ago secretary Kerry Secretary of
State Kerry appealed to the European
Union to continue to support illegal
criminal israeli settlement
in the West Bank wasn't put in those
words but the way it is put is that your
had taken the quite appropriate step of
trying to draw back from support for
Israeli operations in the illegal
settlements incidentally that the
settlements are illegal is not even in
question that's been determined by the
highest authorities the Security Council
that of the United Nations the
International Court of Justice in fact
up until the Reagan administration of
the u.s. also called them illegal
Reagan changed that to an obstacle to
peace and Obama has weakened it still
further - not helpful to peace but the
u.s. is virtually alone in this the rest
of the world that accepts the judgment
of the Security Council of the
International Court of Justice that the
settlements are illegal not just the
expansion of the settlement but the
settlements themselves and Europe had
pulled back from support for the
settlements and Kerry called on Europe
not to do that because pretext was that
this would interfere with the so-called
peace negotiations that he's set up
which are a total farce I mean the peace
negotiations are carried out under
preconditions u.s. imposed preconditions
which virtually guaranteed failure there
are two basic preconditions we have
between seconds or we have 15 seconds
okay one precondition is that the US run
them the u.s. is a participant not
neutral the other is that Israeli
expansion of settlements must continue
no these negotiations can continue under
those conditions
