Can you hear us 
Yes. 
Prof. Chomsky, welcome to acTVism Munich. 
Thank you. 
Let's get straight to the interview. 
In your 1988 book, entitled 
"Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media", 
talk about five institutional filters that control and change the flow of information. 
These serve certain interests in our society. 
Can you tell us something about these institutional filters? 
Have they become stronger or weaker in our time? 
So, first, there was a later edition of this book in which 
my co-author Edward Herman and I wrote a new introduction. 
And Wwr indicated that one of the five filters was too narrow: the fifth. 
When we wrote the book in the eighties, we called the fifth filter the anti-communism filter. 
But it should have been called much more general. 
There's always some fake enemy that's about to 
to destroy ourselves, against which we have to defend ourselves. 
Comments, analyzes and the selection of messages are geared towards 
to support state propaganda. 
and the course of action against this real or imaginary enemy. 
For a long time this was the Soviet Union. 
It's very interesting to see what happened - you learn a lot about 
Propaganda and research if you look at what happened 
when the Soviet Union collapsed. 
This is the best way to learn about the Cold War. 
What happened? 
In 1990 there was no longer a Soviet Union. What happened then? 
First of all, you should ask yourself what happened to NATO. 
NATO was founded to protect Western Europe from the Russian hordes. 
Theoretically. 
And what happened to NATO when there were no Russian hordes left? 
Has it been dissolved? No, it was removed. It expanded eastwards 
and is right on the Russian border today. 
A threat arises, and another world war threatens because of what is happening in Ukraine. 
In the meantime, NATO's mission has been officially changed. 
Now it should protect the international energy system: the waterways and pipelines. 
NATO is a global system, a global force, 
which is controlled by the United States. 
This shows what NATO has always been 
and you learn about anti-communism as a propaganda technique. 
What happened next 
A few weeks after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the United States invaded Panama 
Killed hundreds, maybe thousands, of people when the slums were bombed. 
all to kidnap someone the United States didn't like 
and brought to justice for crimes 
most of which he had committed on behalf of the CIA. 
. Well, that's almost normal with one difference: 
You couldn't invoke the Russian threat here, 
because there is no Russian threat. 
So it was the Hispanic drug dealers who were about to destroy us. 
It went on for a while, it didn't work very well, 
so you had to come up with new pretexts. 
The Middle East is a very interesting case. 
The Bush administration - the first president in the Bush family - had to do after the fall of the Russians 
immediately introduce a new national security strategy. 
In principle, it said that we would continue as before, but with new pretexts. 
For the Middle East, intervention forces intended for the Middle East applied 
to stick wherever - and now comes a really interesting wording 
the serious threat to US interests 
could not be put in the shoes of the Kremlin. 
In other words, we lied to you for 50 years. It is not the Russians at all. 
That is what is called radical nationalism, independent nationalism. 
And finally, in order to stamp it out, you need the intervention forces. 
So everything takes its course, but with new pretexts. 
This shows us that our fifth filter was inadequate. It's not about anti-communism. 
It's about whatever pretext needs to be invented, 
the continuing worldwide interference, overthrow, armed forces or 
to justify international agreements for the protection of large domestic capital. 
This is the fifth filter. To come back to your question: they are all used today. 
Since you just mentioned the Middle East issue, 
I would like to talk to you about the current situation in the Middle East, 
where a radical fighting force called ISIS is raging, which among other things is decapitating journalists. 
I would like to refer to your book "Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media", 
in which you speak of unworthy and worthy victims. 
Can you briefly explain what this means 
and how does this apply to the current atrocities there? 
Well, ISIS, of course, are the unworthy victims. 
Are you a pretty hideous force? 
But the US is strangely opposed to it. 
Take a look at US ISIS policy: 
there are some forces in the region that are really fighting ISIS, mainly Iran. 
Iran is fighting ISIS. Do the US support Iran against ISIS? 
No. Iran is an enemy, we have to undermine it. 
On the ground is the main armed force against ISIS - in the area around Kobane, Syria - is the PKK, 
the guerrilla force based in Turkey, which is on the US terrorist list 
The United States does not support them. 
Of course, this also applies to the Assad regime, which ISIS is also fighting. 
So what is US policy regarding ISIS? 
One of the main rapporteurs on the region, one of the best 
and the most accurately informed, Patrick Cockburn, calls it an "Alice in Wonderland" policy. 
A policy that is senseless and mixed up. 
The Obama administration is somehow trying to fight ISIS 
while also fighting everyone who is already fighting ISIS. 
So who are the worthy and unworthy victims? 
It all depends on who the United States is fighting. 
Let's talk about some economic issues. 
We know that the European Union and the United States are just behind closed doors 
negotiating a free trade agreement known as 
Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP for short. 
Our Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Obama praise how this agreement 
Job creation, economic growth and trade. 
You completely rejected the term free trade agreement and found 
that there is no free trade, that they do not favor global trade 
have anything in common with an agreement. 
Could you do this a little? 
First of all, we should remember the five filters. 
It is not a free trade agreement. 
It has practically nothing to do with free trade. 
Practically nothing. 
There are tariffs, but they are very low. 
And changes in customs agreements change practically nothing. 
It is protectionism. 
It is against free trade. 
First of all, consider that everything is decided in secret. 
It is fundamentally secret, the population must not know anything about it. 
However, it is not secret for everyone. 
The corporate lawyers and lobbyists who write the agreement know what it says. 
So it's not a secret for corporations and government leaders. 
Only the population is not allowed to know about it. 
That should already make you think. 
Parts of it have leaked, some of it through Wikileaks. A part that leaked 
was the section on intellectual property rights, one of the central elements of the agreement. 
And what are intellectual property rights? 
Well it's a complicated word that describes high protectionist measures 
for the profits - the exorbitant profits - more American 
and international pharmaceutical and media groups. 
This is anti-free trade. 
This is extreme protectionism in the interests of very wealthy 
and more powerful parts of the economic system. 
Other parts of the agreement - and don't forget 
that because of the confidentiality we don't know any details, 
however, we can get an idea of   other agreements 
include a number of regulations related to investor rights 
to protect against the population. 
Take NAFTA (North American Free Trade agreement) for example, we know that. 
NAFTA was also negotiated in secret, and is now open to the public. 
Large parts of it guarantee US investors in Mexico to be treated like domestic. 
So should General Motors invest in Mexico, 
it has to be treated like a mexican company. 
When a person from Mexico comes to New York 
he does not get the same rights as an American citizen, on the contrary: 
He could end up in prison for the rest of his life. 
But US companies should have the same rights as Mexican companies. 
US agricultural companies, heavily subsidized agricultural companies 
which completely contradicts the free trade concept 
to get the right to flood the Mexican market with fruits and vegetables, 
with which Mexican campesinos can of course not compete. 
This leads to a so-called immigration crisis, 
because they are driven from their country and have to flee. 
That is NAFTA. 
Another regulation allows corporations, not people, not you or me, 
but corporations to sue a state 
should take measures that could reduce profits. 
So, for example, if Mexico decides to go to an environmental protection zone there, 
where any US corporation wants to invest, 
this corporation can sue Mexico for thwarting its profits 
- future profits in the area, 
in the area that Mexico is trying to protect. 
Again, people cannot. But corporations do. 
These types of provisions can be found in trade agreements. 
They are not free trade agreements. 
It's not about free trade, in fact it's mostly not about trade, 
and they are definitely not agreements, at least 
when people live in one of the negotiating countries. 
Most of the people are against the agreements, 
that's why they work in secret. 
Every word in the term free trade agreement is simply wrong. 
In Germany there is a lot of encouragement from the people in the form of 
independent organizations for the concept of unconditional basic income, 
according to which citizens receive a sum of money without reservation, 
to meet their basic needs like rent, food, electricity etc. 
Can you give your assessment of unconditional basic income? 
Unconditional basic income? 
In Germany and elsewhere? 
It is an interesting concept indeed. 
It originally comes from the right camp. 
Clock jumping. 
Milton Friedman, for example, suggested it. 
In his view, this could have prevented the measures taken by a welfare state. 
But it doesn't have to have a reactionary component. 
It can also be interpreted as a progressive measure that people have rights. 
Take a look at Article 25 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
It states that people have a right to adequate nutrition, 
Have health, employment, security, etc. These are minimum rights. 
Every society should guarantee it. 
Well, one way to guarantee this would be a socially acceptable form 
an unconditional basic income. 
In principle, so-called welfare states try to provide this. 
So yes, that's something you could show. 
I don't think it goes far enough, but as a short-term solution, 
it is suitable to alleviate central problems. 
And there are already elements in various societies, 
that actually provide such things. 
Let's get to my last question: 
Could you list some of the dangers that humanity faces 
or will face in the 21st century? 
And what mechanisms are available to the public to prevent these disasters? 
So what dangers do we have to face in the 21st century? 
There are two enormous dangers, huge shadows that hang menacingly above everything. 
The first of these is an environmental disaster that is definitely imminent. 
We can debate how long it will take, but it will come. 
And it could get really serious. 
There are things you can do about it, and something is done in some countries. 
Denmark, for example, is moving towards sustainable energies. 
Germany increasingly has plans to focus on sustainable energies. 
But the majority of us are just racing towards the cliff that we're going to plunge down. 
One thing is almost certain, if we continue to live or want to survive properly, 
the fossil fuels from the earth may no longer be extracted. 
But the opposite happens: energy companies never miss an opportunity 
to suck every drop of oil or gas from the earth and they can't be stopped. 
Part of the logic of a capitalist market is to maximize short-term profit, 
without paying attention to the consequences for others or the future. 
It is a huge problem. 
There are things you can do about it, but that happens to a limited extent. 
It will be a real disaster for our not too distant future generations. 
The other big shadow is nuclear war. 
Don't underestimate that. 
We have repeatedly come close to a nuclear war. 
A nuclear war is basically the final catastrophe. Some survive, but not much. 
And we were close to it. There are some serious threats today. 
In theory, we would know how to deal with these threats, but we don't. 
Instead, the nuclear programs are being expanded. 
The U.S. program will be expanded by about a trillion dollars over the next few decades. 
There are serious crises in Ukraine, in the Middle East 
and other places that could all lead to nuclear war. 
These are the biggest problems. 
There is another problem in the background. 
It's not about survival, it's about minimal decency. 
I mean the neoliberal attack on the global population, 
which has lasted for several generations. 
It has different effects in different places, but it is almost always very damaging. 
Some countries have been able to slowly get rid of 
some of the most important are in South America. 
For the first time in 500 years, South America has started 
to free yourself from the imperialist control of the West. 
In the past century, that meant control by the United States 
The countries united to develop internal organizations 
and thus solve the enormous challenges in your own country. Without western dominance. 
The US has been driven out of almost the entire hemisphere, 
which is tantamount to a remarkable change in world affairs. 
In part, they react to the neoliberal attack, 
which was particularly devastating in South America. 
You followed the rules and suffered for them. 
In Europe, austerity measures are extremely destructive to life, 
survival and democracy. 
Some attempts are being made to resist 
especially in the peripheral countries. 
In the United States, the neoliberal attack has virtually destroyed democracy. 
It hardly works anymore. Take a look at the last November 2014 elections. 
Actual turnout statistics have recently been released. 
They were identified by some of the leading political scientists: 
Walter Dean Burnham and Thomas Ferguson. 
They show that turnout in past elections 
mostly as high as it was in the early 19th century. 
At that time only white male citizens with possessions were allowed to vote. 
Today, turnout in a large part of the country has dropped back to this level. 
This is a sign that people have hope 
have simply given up in the democratic system. 
You have every reason: 
Detailed studies show what we all basically already know: 
the vast majority's opinions and attitudes have no impact on politics. 
Today, politics is dominated by an extremely small sector of concentrated wealth. 
This is plutocracy, this is not democracy. 
Take a look at the economic situation: 
Since the neo-liberal attack began largely under Reagan, 
actually earlier, but under Reagan it escalated, 
it was a period of stagnation or decline for the majority of the population. 
Real wages for male workers are back at the level of the sixties. 
In the meantime, productivity increased and prosperity increased, 
which only benefits a tiny percentage of the population, 
actually only a fraction of a percent. 
For the majority of the population, this means stagnation, sometimes also decline. 
These are serious problems. 
You can handle them, they're not the same size as the first two, 
that I mentioned, but they are to be taken seriously. 
They seriously affect people's lives significantly 
Well, there are many more problems to be solved, especially terrorism. 
A worldwide terror campaign is taking place that goes far too far, further than anyone else. 
It's Obama's drone campaign. 
It is a terror campaign of unprecedented magnitude. 
This campaign is formally, officially, explicitly aimed at people supported by the government 
suspected of wanting to harm us someday. 
Maybe one day want to harm us. 
You have to be killed, along with everyone else, 
he are in their immediate vicinity. 
I mean, would Al Qaeda or anyone else launch such a campaign 
we would be outraged beyond measure, we would probably destroy them. 
But in this case it is official politics that is supported by the western countries. 
It is a serious problem. Worldwide terrorism is a serious problem. 
It ranks very high up. 
So we could go on and talk about many other things. 
Noam Chomsky, renowned American linguist and cognitive scientist, 
Philosopher, political commentator and activist, it was a pleasure 
To have you with us today. Thank you.
