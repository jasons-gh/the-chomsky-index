noam chomsky of one word a judge by his
books is not one but two people there's
no much um ski professor of linguistics
probably the most famous expert in the
world on the nature and structure of
language whose contributions to this
esoteric science have not only been
original they've been revolutionary and
then there's Noam Chomsky the polemicist
and political philosopher whose articles
and books on American political policy
in general and the war in Vietnam in
particular have aroused intellectuals
and given support to both the anti-war
and draft resistance movements both Noam
Chomsky's a resident at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
where his professor of modern languages
and linguistics
dr. Chomsky what is the relationship
between thought and language you know I
have the idea that when I think and when
I dream I'm doing it in words does this
mean that if a person didn't know a
language he couldn't think abstract
thoughts well I don't want to pretend to
give any expert answer to that but on
the basis of my own introspection I I'm
sure I think in language but I'm also
sure I I think in visual imagery and in
other symbolic forms as well I would
think that clearly if you don't have a
language you can't express a very rich
range of thought and I assume that that
contributes although does that suggest
that I think in words because the words
are available if they weren't available
of that would there would be a thought
process that went on in other kind of
symbols well I think for example you'd
have no difficulty imagining a scene
let's say and imagining something taking
place in that scene
even without a verbal comment but how
would I deal with such things as truth
and beauty and all the wonderful
certainly would be so sharp limits on
the range of thought if language were
not available but I wouldn't go so far
as to identify them mm-hmm what about
the language in which a person does
think I suppose it's the language which
is most natural to him I asked one guest
in what's language he dreamed and
because he spoke six or seven languages
and his answer why is it a dependent
upon the character he was talking with
used a language which was appropriate
his language tied to does what can one
think more fasoli in one language or
another for example well I certainly
there it's it's difficult and as an
adult let's say to acquire another
language so readily and with such
facility that one can't really think in
it fluently and easily there are rare
individuals who can do this but children
on the other hand probably can master
quite a number of languages and deal
with them all essentially as native
languages think in them dream in them so
on really almost be unconscious of what
language they're using any given moment
I suppose eternally I didn't grow up
this way myself but friends who've grown
up in multilingual environments say that
as very young children they were even
unaware that they were speaking
different languages clearly they knew
that you spoke one language in the
street and another language your
grandparents and another language to
someone else but they didn't really
identify them as different languages
just different ways of speaking to print
individually so a person who it - a
person who is not multilingual and
particularly one that didn't grow up in
a multilingual family would almost seem
that would be more difficult to think in
another language because of its
structure than it would to think in this
language for example whose structure
seems to be easier to work with well
unless you're lucky enough to be able to
acquire a language in a natural setting
whatever that means exactly it's
extremely difficult to really
internalize it to make it really part of
yourself in the way in which your native
language is and I suspect there's little
doubt in fact that that's just the
property of human brain not that there's
a way of developing
a system which is really part of our
thought and life and there is another
way of acquiring a system that remains
at a certain distance from us we can
handle it intellectually but but there
is a barrier to as you say internalizing
it easily as a great barrier and in fact
it apparently gets much more severe as
and probably after I'd say in
adolescence or later than that it's
almost it's extremely difficult if not
impossible to pick up a a new language
as really an integrated internalized
language does the the nature or the
structure of language tell us anything
about how the human mind works I think
it tells us a good deal in fact my own
feeling is that's for myself at least
that's the major interest in the study
of languages that I think this length
use of language is plainly a very
distinctive human property and one which
is it is distinctive that is the fact we
can teach a bird to say words means
nothing and well you can teach I think
the most interesting work recently has
been with with chimpanzees who've been
taught extensive symbolic systems as far
as I can see these are complicated
associational systems and I think very
different from language in the way they
function in my opinion though there's
much controversy Asus's and I think by
pursuing that kind of line of
investigation in fact one may in fact
discover and were precise detail what
are those unique I'm sure they are
unique properties of language that make
it possible for a human child so readily
to acquire the system of vast complexity
and to use it is vastly complex
incredibly complex and that does
contribute immensely to the possibility
of creative thought and expression in a
way which is totally unique to human
beings and I think that by looking at
the detailed structure of language one
can we have any almost incomparable way
of gaining some insight into the
specific nature of the human mind as a
as a unique biological structure
existing nowhere else as far as we know
so what we discover will be transferable
probably to other areas of learning
beyond language well I think it's that
going to be very interesting to try to
in fact there are there's a good deal
with can modern cognitive psychology
so-called does try to use linguistic
models and investigating other domains
of intellectual competence and that's I
think very fruitful and rewarding path
to follow it's really difficult in other
domains to gain such insight into the
complexity of structure as in the case
of language recently its language is not
only uniquely human but it's also
uniquely easy to study among the various
kinds of intellectual achievements that
a person develops for example it's you
know you also have a very complicated
theory of physical space and that you've
developed somehow everything that has or
a theory of human interaction or a
theory of personality and so on but we
don't externalize these as we external
eyes there which is there to be seen
measured therefore we have lots of
possibilities of studying it and through
studying it gaining I think considerable
insight into into the nature of mental
capacities and cognitive structures and
the human electoral achievements and in
general there are good many people
specialists in the field as you know who
believe that language is simply a matter
of training that that a child can be
trained to speak and that there's
nothing unique about this you I know
feel that there's something more than
simply training why do you feel that
there's something more to learning
language than simply training well first
of all it's it's worth mentioning that
most overwhelmingly people learn
language without training I mean if you
simply immerse a child in a situation
which language is spoken he acquires the
system instead but is more than a
response to the stimuli of the most
person around him speaking well well the
the the most obvious and sort of gross
fact about language which shows that I
think is the innovative creative
character of it and every child is
capable of the understanding and
producing very complex structures which
have no simple relationship no
point-by-point relationship no no
relationship on the basis of analogy
let's say we be experienced that he's
written generative creative structures
of language just that that you can as
we're talking we say new things which we
may not have said before we hear new
languages as we talk there's vital
repetition and what we say well if you
really were to to see how little
repetition there is you can let's say
take a book or a newspaper or a library
for that matter and search for
repetitions of phrases or sentences and
so on they writ they occur but rarely so
there are particular sub parts of
language they read greetings or
conventional utterances of one sort or
another that do repeat frequently but
these are incidentally often marginal in
their structure for example a sentence
like how do you do has a structure which
is in fact unique it's not the structure
of any English sentence the and we don't
create new sentences of that type that's
just a ritualized utterance but most of
our linguistic interchange is in fact
highly innovative and of course it's not
just random I mean its innovative but
somehow appropriate to situations it
doesn't necessarily follow the rules
that we're all taught in school of a
subject in a predicate or a noun and a
verb I mean I would have the impression
that somehow in my schooling I was
taught to do what it is that I do now
well people have that impression but the
reason is that the actual rules of
language which certainly are not taught
in school because in fact nobody even
knows them for this they are totally
unconscious I mean what you're taught in
school is some relatively superficial
set of generalizations about some of the
products the important is it important
to know that well I think it'd be
important to know it but the the point
that has to be stressed is that when
first of all that everyone knows you
know speaks the language very fluently
in a very rich language before ever goes
to school and furthermore even if you
wanted to teach somebody the rules of
language you wouldn't be able to do it
because the rules are largely unknown
we're just barely beginning to discover
them it seems to us that there's no
problem in speaking just as it seems to
us but there's no problem and what's a
walking but if we were tricked to try to
design an automaton let's say that would
walk or ride a bicycle or identify a
person I mean for example you look at me
from one point of view and if I turn my
face you could still recognize yeah
that's not so easy to do I mean we can
do it because we have some
special unknown capacities for a
perceptual identification well in case
of language 2 we have this whole totally
unconscious set of intricate mechanisms
made something's built into them to
their system well I have no doubt that
most of the richness of the structure of
language is just the biological property
the organism can't be can't be taught
any more than you can be taught theft
but it doesn't do they've got no way
that you can x-ray it or or well put our
finger on it at the moment
neurophysiology is not in a state where
one can detect the physical structures
that underlie linguistic use I mean only
rather gross things are known for
example it's known that that language is
controlled by the Dhamma that the brain
has two hemispheres and language is
controlled by one dominant hemisphere
incidentally humans are as far as I know
that's right anyone knows the only
organism that has lateralization that
has specialization of the two
hemispheres apes don't for example and
this is as is well known this is closely
connected with language that and you
know areas of the brain are known that
have special relevance to various
language functions but when you get into
the detailed intricate structure of the
system it's still a mystery fire mystery
one might say the same about learning
nobody knows anything about the
neurology of learning either for them
now one of the most controversial things
that you've come up with is the fact
that what you're saying is true not only
of English but true of all languages the
commonality that runs through all
languages I would have guessed that some
languages we're so rigidly structured
that if you learned a set of 20 rules
that would take care of all situations
well see if what I just said before is
true that is if a great deal of the
structure of language is just the
biological property that you bring to
the learning situation not something
that you acquire in it and if we further
assume as is unquestionably the case
that humans are not specifically adapted
to learn one language or another that is
there's no racial difference that makes
it easier to free learn this language of
that language or something of that sort
from those two assumptions alone it
follows that all languages are going to
be essentially uniform in that part of
their structure which is biologically
determined just as there's a they're
only gonna be certain
the limitations in the kind of gate that
you can use when you walk you can't fly
you know I know human beings gonna fly
we're all gonna walk we may walk in
slightly different ways and these may be
culturally determined in part and so on
well I don't press the analogy too far
there's more differentiation in language
than that but still I think that there
is simply a biologically determined rich
framework which we can learn a lot about
in that way I think we can find out a
good deal about it and they're
interesting theories about it
that predispose us to acquire a system
of great complexity of a very specific
sort on the basis of a very slight
familiarity very slight exposure to data
and one of the most remarkable things
about acquisition of language is that
Whitledge in the child or for that
matter an adult has had very few seconds
in his lifetime and very and the total
range of data available to him is about
as small as compared with the with his
ability to express himself and to
produce and understand sentences and
utterances and discourses as he does in
his normal life and that again indicates
that that there's a rich biologically
determined structure which therefore
must be uniform across languages not as
far good to get back to your original
point you know whether there are
languages with a small number of rules
that would suffice to explain everything
certainly nothing of that sort is known
I mean - insofar as languages have been
carefully studied living languages at
least they seem basically - they do
differ you know one language is not
another language but they don't differ
differ as far as we know it's less
creative aspect in all languages that is
so that it's absolutely you know that's
not just a human property I mean which
is true of every language how did you
become interested in linguistics I know
you grew up in Philadelphia your father
was a Hebrew scholar and it's been
written about you that you proof read
here's a book on medieval Hebrew grammar
at the age of what 10 something like
that did you have a kind of genetic
fate that you were gonna go into to
language as a result of it well I was
undoubtedly influenced by my father's
working medieval Hebrew grammar which I
did was extremely interested in and read
his work and so on it then lapsed for a
while and I I actually came back to it
in college from a totally different
point of view did you and your father
talked a good deal about this was it a
matter of family conversation that well
the nature of languages it was one of
his he was this major scholarly
interested is and I picked up a good
deal about it so often a sudden tends to
go in opposite direction rather than the
same direction well I don't know if one
would really call this the same
direction I mean his my own interests in
linguistics developed from a very rather
different point of view and although
there is convergence and I suppose
influenced that's the still it's it's a
different rather different area of
linguistics I mean the kind of
linguistics that I began to study in
college had developed in virtual in a
totally separate intellectual tradition
from the one in which I had I thought
I'd in which I had this kind of informal
access was that useful incidentally to
have had that informal background and
studying technical scientific
linguistics later on I think the merger
of the two is for me at least very
useful I gather your interest in college
grew out of an association with one of
your professors who apparently persuaded
you not to leave college as a matter of
fact yeah I was sort of planning to drop
out of college considering it the mother
bore by by about sophomore year I guess
just not challenging enough well yeah I
found nothing interesting in it really
in them took one course after another
and then killed my interest in one field
after another and yes by the time I was
a sophomore I had sort of had it until I
met two zellig harris who turned out to
be an outstanding linguist I met him in
totally different contact nothing do
with linguistics but I liked him was
impressed with him there is the first
really intellectually interesting person
was the context in which you did meet
him politics radical politics radical
politics which is your other interest of
course which was a major interest of my
effect the overwhelming interest at that
stage of my life
I met him in that connection actually it
had to do with left-wing what was then
called Zionists I guess would now be
called anti Zionist activities that I
was deeply involved in and he was
engaged in we had many he was very
significant influence on my thinking in
that area as well but through that
contact I became gradually interested in
the work he was doing he finally got
back into it and ended up was the source
of your rather revolutionary theory the
one you've just been discussing up to
the point where you enunciated this
theory linguistics was a somewhat
different study and when you did
enunciate it it caused a considerable
furor so it was a it was certainly an
original approach do you know what set
you off on that from the more
conventional studying of linguistics
that you had done at college well it's
you know one can never be certain about
that the other thing it I mean there
were I think in part it was due to the
fact that I approached language at once
from a point of view which was related
to what I had what I was more or less
immersed in informally before I ever got
to college the kind of linguistics that
I had that I began to know about
informally had to do largely with
historical change and with efforts to
explain the facts as they now exist on
the basis of changes that had taken
place through a sequence of historical
stages the linguistics that I was
studying in college was very anti
explanatory it was very descriptive it
was in a sense you might almost say
quasi behavioristic it was interested in
this is what happened but no explain
just why well it was an effort to give
accurate descriptive accounts of
languages and it was often done in a
very sophisticated way to me that seemed
inadequate largely because I knew of how
explanation would appear in a historical
context and I was encouraged to try to
develop an explanatory theory in part
also by the fact that I was fortunate
enough to be studying logic and
mathematics and hence had some grasp of
the kinds of formal systems that in fact
were
hired to attempt to give a an account of
this ultimately of this creative ability
understanding all these things together
but you came to Harvard as a junior
fellow and you did much you work at that
time that one you did produce your first
publications on this at 8:00 they
weren't published yeah my first three
certainly weren't accepted well in fact
the first the only really extensive work
that I did on it a long long book is
fact its impress now but it was finished
in 1955 and it couldn't be published at
that time and it was turned down fact by
publishers not unreasonably actually it
was unrecognizable nobody could even
tell what field it was in and I was
unknown and those but what I did was
well in fact it was several it was quite
a few years I think before this work had
much of an impact in the field and that
was largely I think because of some
other linguists who became interested in
it didn't they
I began to work in a man named Robert
Lee's in particular or my colleague
Morris Halley's MIG what you you teach
linguistics at MIT what do you do to
keep your students from falling into the
same state of indifference that you did
when you were in school well I don't
know what to say about that I mean first
of all I have to do mostly with graduate
students who tend to be very highly
motivated
I do teach undergraduates but I teach
them in other domains I teach an
undergraduate course in social and
political theory and there I think many
of the problems of how one relates to
intellectual work and an academic
commitment and scholarly commitments
Masson to arise and that's a very
personal matter I I don't think there's
any formula nor would I ever try to
persuade someone to follow a particular
path but something one has to work out
from still and there are many difficult
you said that your that your original
association with zellig harris was in
the area radical politics you are
identified with the new left whenever
that is you certainly have been an
activist as well as a writer and
anti-war anti Vietnam War
and you've said that the course of
history may be determined to a very
significant degree by what the people of
the United States will have learned from
the catastrophe meaning of course the
Vietnam War what in your opinion have we
learned from this experience I would say
very little unfortunately at the time I
wrote that which I guess was seven or
eight years ago what I had in mind was
that there are really two different ways
of looking at this catastrophe one can
look at it as a failed venture a mistake
something which was it was a mistake
because it failed mistake because it
failed but perfectly all right if it
succeeded and I think it's probably fair
to say that at least among intellectuals
people who are who write and speak
publicly they let a harsh on the
intellectuals yeah I think that totally
unprincipled than this I mean I think
the dominant view is that if we had
gotten away with it a little bit or I
but we couldn't get away with it so
therefore it was stupid in there but we
should get out but you know worse than a
crime it was wonder or something of that
story now if that's all that's learned
from it I think it will have no effect
on future history it will have shown
that there are limits to American
imperialism and your opposition has been
on moral grounds that it was wrong from
the outset although you said your
opposition came fifteen years too late
well active opposition Jim fifteen years
too late I think the time for active
opposition should have been about
nineteen fifty or a little later but I
didn't become really actively engaged in
opposing the war until about nineteen
sixty four sixty five at that point the
United States was very deeply involved
in what if we were honest we would call
aggression against South Vietnam that's
in fact what it was but I had of course
always been opposed to the war in fact I
was opposed to the Korean War and may
surprise you but it was even skeptical
about the second world war
are you a pacifist no not a pacifist are
the identification for a war under
certain circumstance yeah I can see
justifications for a defensive war I
could interact
cutting it all together I think they're
justifications for a war against Nazi
Germany in the 40s but I felt I was a
high school student at the time but felt
then and have continued to feel and in
fact wrote about it in this book that a
good deal of the
alleged justification for the war was
totally beside the point and that we
were engaged in the war for reasons
other than opposition to fascism were
concerned for people being sent the gas
chambers and things of that kind in fact
those motivations I think we're
virtually non-existent nevertheless
despite the hypocrisy and there was
plenty I think that that war could have
could be justified and I'm not a
pacifist in the sense of someone who
believes that it is in principle wrong
ever and always to undertake violent
acts I think you've got strong reason
for it very strong the burden of proof
is certainly on a person who wants to
undertake the use of means of violence
but I believe occasionally that burden
Jim DeMint the way in which you describe
the Vietnam War particularly in your own
words is such that one would think that
a good American I use it in quotation
marks would totally reject the support
of the Vietnam War
it's it's in your words it's it stands
for all that we're opposed to oppression
of other peoples and so forth no either
you would be wrong in your description
well there has to be a reason why the
American would accept a war of this sort
which is it I guess you would never say
was a wrong description of course it's
just well vectored well first of all I'm
not sure see we don't know what the
population that as a whole accepts or
rejects because they're inarticulate
largely among the people who are
articulate intellectuals people who
speak and write articles and so on I
think they've made it overwhelmingly
clear that that they consider the
question of right or wrong irrelevant in
the case of the United States of course
it's relevant if we're talking about
some other country for example everyone
would agree that it was wrong for the
Russians to invade Czechoslovakia that
is no one says well it was okay because
they got away with it but those criteria
are never applied to ourselves and that
is totally unprincipled though typical
of you know other societies act this way
as well and it's that kind of lack of
principle that I think has to be
overcome and the ideology being about
see ourselves as others see us or as we
see others I suppose see ourselves by
the principles that we occasionally
enunciate to apply those to ourselves
I want to ask you in 30 seconds whether
if we do in fact Piper
suing or expanding upon your studies to
learn more about mens intelligence and
how it functions well that contribute to
a better life it may contribute to a
better understanding of what the
essential needs of human beings are and
from that it's conceivable that someday
we'll grow a concept of a of how a
decent society ought to be organized I
think thank you very much
