I've done it I've been really lucky to
have done a series of books with Chomsky
and working with him over the years I've
really been struck by his consistency
his patience and equanimity in and in
terms of his intellectual chops he's
awesome in his syncretic ability to take
a wide and disparate amount of
information and cobble it into a
coherent analysis and like the door Jay
Thunderbolt of Tibetan Buddhism Chomsky
with relentless logic peels away and
devastates the layers of deceit and
deception produced by the embedded
journalists of the corporate media and
the mandarins of state power and
American Empire always he reminds us all
ways he reminds us as he did this
afternoon on the lawn of the boulder
Public Library addressing a large
gathering there that the responsibility
is up to us we the citizens really must
change the society and culture if we
want to see a world of peace and social
justice and democracy in this country
earlier David Horowitz
but Chomsky does have his critics and
one must acknowledge them and one of the
leading critics is someone named David
Horowitz he wrote an article called the
sick mind of Noam Chomsky and this is
not untypical of the kind of vitriol and
and a loathing that is directed toward
this incredibly mild mannered and you
know self-effacing man this is what
Horowitz says you know we have to do
like good journalist ping-pong
journalist the good and the bad okay his
venomous message is spread on tapes and
CDs and the lecture circuit Chomsky's
influence is best understood not that as
of a religion ttle exual figure but as
the leader of a secular religious cult
as the Ayatollah of anti-american hate
this guy's deep this guy's did this
cultic resonance is recognized by his
followers his most important devote a
David barsamian is an obscure public
radio producer on kgn you in Boulder
Colorado who has created a library of
Chomsky screeds on tape
alright fair and balanced we report you
decide well Chomsky at 74 is
indefatigable we spoke last night before
thousands in Denver he's leaving early
in the morning to give two talks in Los
Angeles he is as a bono of u2 once
called him a rebel without a pause and
he draws huge audiences wherever he
wherever he goes and he's literally
booked years in advance as he once told
me i'm not a charismatic speaker and if
i had the capacity to do so i wouldn't
use it I'm really not interested in
persuading people what I like to do is
help people persuade themselves
often Chomsky is introduced as someone
who exemplifies the Quaker adage of
speaking truth to power he actually
takes exception to that he says the
powerful already know what's going on
it's the people who need to hear the
truth now celebrating 25 years of kgn
you please welcome Noam Chomsky
one of the things I've learned from many
years of not being a charismatic speaker
is that my voice doesn't carry very well
so tell me if you can hear me before I
okay yeah well we're all aware that
right at this moment bodies are being
torn to shreds by infernal weapons
unknown numbers of people who's who have
already been driven to the edge of
survival by a decade of murderers
sanctions may be facing starvation and
slow death under these circumstances
it's not very easy to step back and try
to ask why all this is happening where
it's likely to go and what we can do to
shape the future but that's what I want
to try to do about the last question
what we can do to shape the future the
answer is straightforward quite a lot in
fact there's no one who anywhere who can
do as much as we can we're uniquely
privileged we have unusual freedom
that's not a gift from on high it's a
legacy that was won by centuries of
constant dedicated struggle and that's
really the answer to what we can do pay
attention to the legacy and carry it
forward privilege and advantages confer
responsibilities that should be truism
what comes next is hard though personal
choices one choice is to face the
responsibility not easy though a lot
easier than it is
other countries other places is not as
privileged as we are the other choice is
to shirk the responsibility and hand the
future over to be determined by forces
that we can be sure are not benign well
many people in the world probably the
vast majority as far as we know are
hoping and probably desperately hoping
that we will make the first choice face
the responsibility and they view with
dread the consequences if we do not if
we do not act to control what they see
as a juggernaut that they regard as the
greatest threat to peace in the world
and these days threat to peace means
literally threat the survival well not
everyone is dismayed so take Osama bin
Laden if he's alive somewhere I'm sure
he's enjoying mightily the scenes that
are portrayed in one way on television
here and in a different way by
correspondence and commentators who are
not embedded within the invading system
he's made it very clear what he wants he
wants a word of the death between the
evil empire and the billions of people
around the world and that's what he's
getting the political even before the
invasion of Iraq the US political
leadership had inspired extraordinary
level of fear throughout the world not
just the Arab and Muslim world since the
invasion the war that the world is seen
not the one being portrayed here
that word has aroused a wave of
revulsion that's actually becoming a
serious concern even the policymakers
here and it's reaching the mainstream
press so not just in the last few days
the mainstream press has been publishing
lead articles about it they report give
you some quotes a growing hatred of
America regarded as a violent aggressor
cruel aggressor that's relying on
overwhelming force to crush anyone who's
in its way and worse still seems to be
rejoicing in its ability to destroy a
defenseless enemy people shooting with
rusting rifles that tanks and bombers
the rejoicing over that is not inspiring
great love around the world furthermore
Saddam Hussein has been transformed by
the invasion he was regarded as a thug
and a despot and hated and he's becoming
a hero Bray I'm quoting again a brave
and noble man his present his praises
gush from the lips of Arabs from nearly
every walk of life quoting long
experienced American reporters in Jordan
in this case the director of the Center
for Strategic Studies in jordan says
that without doubt saddam now occupies
the high moral ground across the Arab
world and he finds that very disturbing
thinks it's going to cause huge problems
for countries like Jordan and Egypt
especially if there's any step towards
democratization because of the voice of
the people is heard he knows what voice
it's going to be it's going to be the
voice of radical Islamists
who are calling for a war against
America and also secular nationalists
who despise Saddam Hussein but now
admire because he's standing up to the
savage Americans and no one else is and
in death he's likely to become an even
greater hero there have been polls
recently taken by American academics of
the the Arab in the Arab world and what
they find is also a cause for a lot of
concern a huge majority from all over
all over from Morocco to the Gulf states
and Lebanon a huge majority want Islamic
clergy to play a greater role in
government about ninety-five percent are
convinced that the United States has no
interest in the region beyond
maintaining control over its oil and
incidentally those concerns go back 50
years that was the reason for what
President Eisenhower called a campaign
of hatred against us in the Arab world
back in the mid-nineteenth late 1950s
now they knew about it they're convinced
now as to that the US has no interest
and he incidentally in the his staff
concluded that was correct that is their
interest and they were supporting
oppressive and governments and
preventing development because of the
interest in maintaining control over
Middle East oil that's the 1950s not
today now 95% are convinced that that's
still the interest along with protecting
Israeli power and humiliating Arabs and
Muslims or anybody who's in the way
relying on the fact that they have an
overwhelming monopoly of violence by now
they even speak of Saddam Hussein with
reverence even
they hate him as a murderous tyrant well
one recent story in the biggest long
story in The Washington Post about all
this opens by saying something ominous
is brewing that does not portend well
for the United States and that's an
understatement it does not that's quite
an achievement by george w bush and his
associates these discussions are
referring to the arab in the Muslim
world actually that's the world that
they claim to be liberating in fact it
extends far beyond seems to be worldwide
it's not the last few days though it's
gotten much more extreme if somebody was
watching all of this from outer space
they might be led to believe that George
Bush was embedded in the White House as
an agent of Osama bin Laden he's
certainly acting that way well you know
we can
and unfortunately it's not a joke it
does not portend will the consequences
could be very grim well we can we got
choices on this too we can decide to
live in a cocoon the cocoon that's
created by television and embedded
commentators we can admire ourselves for
our magnificence or we can look at what
the world thinks and ask why that's you
can this people have to decide for
themselves what's the wisest most
admirable course and don't think it's a
hard decision well as I said going back
we can go the the fear of the United
States of its leadership this
particularly this political leadership
although actually goes beyond that goes
back well before the
