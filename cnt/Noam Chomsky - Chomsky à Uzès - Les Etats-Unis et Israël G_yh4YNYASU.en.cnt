during the First World War put me I
again with you buddy competent when Rich
general Allenby conquered Jerusalem
Jenny I think that he can be a punk easy
with that in you read the headlines in

there's another factor and effect of
there's a secar the world that sometimes
called the Anglosphere england and it's
offshoots young i think obi-wan Kenobi
no despair the Anglosphere consists of
several colonial societies no buffet a
little you java associated de Coulomb
sub separate 1 etcetera that's that's
the most grotesque form of imperialism
in developing all death get the pony
decimal I'm so a little bit like the
French in Algeria good initial
settlement equation these separate
colonial imperialist societies don't
just control the population they
exterminated associated TC people in
addition peplum homeless or not suet new
potential cabinet extending go back in
French history two men France was
settling Algeria the Minister of War was
saying we have to exterminate the native
population boy Olivia he thought the
fall seconded that most American
Canadian found a TI te paki forest
immediately mo- they publish medallion
in the anglosphere that's Harry best
carried out so in the united states and
canada and australia they're pretty much
exterminated ok love you so
yo get adobe professional academy i
think anyway 7e that's considered very
noble of course because everything you
do is noble by definition mythical ta go
get you the two that the double if you
just saw an example that few weeks ago
you nobody thought they get this thing
and the United States sent in commanders
to assassinate bin Laden Aletha didn't
know over you the operational do playa
seceded it had an operation had a name
the paths wat handle the name was
operation Geronimo Oh Pascal's alien
video and Geronimo was a hero who was
trying to defend his tribe is the only
way the only way down a hole to help
David if all that he do who were who
were exterminating AK days that mean it
but in the United States he's a figure
of ridicule oh that he said I wanted
esta aqui key that he goes LT happened
to go to Mexico shortly after this and
in Mexico people were just infuriated
because it will be Steve just updated as
a snip and it may see denied it sure you
said that is from day one two reasons
for what is in their history is to be at
the wrong end of the guns oh yeah mom
Donny's flooding the feel of what's due
to live within 50 second reason is this
was happening in Mexico the part of
Mexico that the United States conquered
from Mexico it with hemoptysis
astrologer positive as ever a party Kiev
after narrowly monkey bars a Disney I
don't think it was nobody in the West
understands this Roscoe absolutely no
the component a co-sponsor the victims
on
very well nvidia well not going back to
Israel it is kind of an instinctive
feeling in the United States and England
that the only psychic on a salty ma
that's thank teeth with it if not
australia i should say in Canada that
they're doing just what we did so how
can it be wrong good good good it is a
yes vote on festivals collecting in
santa monica calif oh ok that was it is
unique he almost had needles you don't
you don't miss you there are a lot of
factors and they really have to be
sorted out okay i would factory so i'm
only is if you get is a better and
there's another point to mention the
israel provides a lot of advantages to
the united states they handle money the
Dozen year he say I don't look that up
that way they didn't he what advantage
to the Palestinians provide their for
their own wealth they are main power
they just getting away their annoyance
and human rights depend on your power
and wealth and what you offer to the
rich did you I loved upon today yeah
well so Palestinians are no right don't
they they don't have a drink okay buddy
see you know that's a lot of it so
there's plenty of reasons no apologies
no apologies
