we have a variety of questions from the
audience lovely without a few of them
about three sets of questions I will try
to present to you curve sets is there a
chance that the democracy in the u.s.a
is going to turn into an oligarchy
that's one question and I'd like to read
out this one I companies with the
previous one of the logical possibility
is behind the 911 attack is that
directly or indirectly the bush plan is
behind it after all they benefited most
from it the establishment media ignores
this issue this is the usual conspiracy
theory do you have any evidence or
culture or do you know of any evidence
another set of questions answer it but
I'll forget to thank you let's say let
me start the second when you write to
the first a person's work complicated
the second one on whether the principal
did the bush administration gain from
September 11 answered yes does that tell
you anything no every authoritarian
system in the world came from September
11 and it was immediately predictable
and I remember my first interviews with
journalists a couple hours afterwards
the first question I was asked is you
know about this and I said look every
power system in the world is cheering
the Russians will love it it's giving
them an excuse to increase their
atrocities in Chechnya
under the pretext that they're defending
themselves under from terror the Chinese
will love it they're going to step up
their atrocities in western China
against the you Gore's claiming it
depends against terror Indonesia loves
that they're going to go on a rampage
nochi and Massacre everyone because it
to defend themselves against terror
Ariel Sharon you know go wild in the
occupied territories does it have to
protect ourselves from terror and so it
continues in fact just about every
country I mean more violent ones just
extended their own violence but the less
violent ones say like England or United
States of friends immediately impose
that what they call protection against
terrorism acts of one kind or another
which I don't nothing live with terror
but a lot to do with disciplining their
own populations so if you take a look
around the world the more what are
called the more democratic societies
instituted mechanisms of control of the
population under the pretext of
defending themselves against terror so
and this was completely predictable this
happens after and even after an
earthquake things like this happen power
systems will exploited to expand their
own power over their primary enemies
which are their domestic enemies are on
population and if if they happened to be
carrying out violent repression though
expects extended so the fact that the
Bush administration gained from it the
crew does he mean tightening it just
says they're just one of the power
systems in the world to gain from did
they plan it in any way or know anything
about it this is extremely unlikely I'm
when they would have have been
scene 2 tried anything like that firstly
if they had is on a certain that it
would have leaked you know it's a very
core system secrets are very hard to
keep so something would have leaked out
very likely and if it had they'd all
have been before firing squads and I'd
be the end of the Republican Party
forever you know I'm to take a chance on
that just even to get control what would
her door was completely unpredictable
was going to happen you can predict that
the claim would actually hit the World
Trade Center I'm happened that it did
but could easily miss the so that you
could hardly control it but he would be
certain of is that any hint of a plan
would have leaked and would have just
destroyed them and take a chance on
something like that would be meaningless
now if you look at that there's up is a
big industry in the United States on the
left as well I mean see the email that I
get this huge internet industry from the
left trying to demonstrate that there's
books coming out the best sellers in
France and so on that this was all fake
than it was planned by the Bush
administration and so on if you look at
the evidence anybody who knows anything
about the sciences would instantly
discount that evidence I mean there's
plenty of coincidences an unexplained
phenomena and you know what it does
happen and lighting that happens on but
if you look at a controlled scientific
experiment same thing is true I mean
when somebody carries out a controlled
scientific experiment that the best
laboratories at the end there are lots
of things that are unexplained and there
are funny coincidence
this is that if you want to get a sense
of it take a look at the letters columns
in the technical scientific journals so
like nature science or something the
letters are commonly about unexplained
properties of reports of technical
experiments carried out under controlled
conditions would you just not leave a
lot of things unexplained but the way
the world is now when you take a natural
event you know not something that's
controlled most of it will be
unexplained though we all sorts of
things that happened but you know you
can afterwards you can put them into
some kind of pattern but beforehand you
can't the pattern may be completely
meaningless because you put them into
some other pattern too if you want
that's just the way complicated events
are I so the evidence that's been
produced in my opinion is essentially
worthless and the belief that it could
have been done is so he has such low
credibility I don't really think it's
serious I shouldn't say that you know
I'm pretty isolated on this and in the
West I mean the large part of the left
completely disagrees in this and has all
kind of elaborate conspiracy theories
and know about how it happened why it
happened and so on but I think that just
fresh life I think simply wrong but also
I think it's diverting people away from
serious issues I mean just it doesn't
mean it I mean it were true which is
extremely unlikely who cares I mean the
main significance but it's it's a little
bit like the huge energy that's put out
on trying to
who killed John F Kennedy yeah who knows
and who cares I mean plenty of people
get killed all the time why does it
matter that one of them had to be John F
Kennedy if there was some reason to
believe that there was a high-level
conspiracy might be interesting but the
evidence against that is overwhelmed and
after that it's just a man you know it
happened to be a jealous husband or the
mac theater someone else what difference
in me it's just taking energy away from
serious issues of the ones that don't
matter and I think the same is for your
personal opinion the question of whether
the United States has become an
oligarchy is actually the wrong question
because it presupposes that it was once
a democracy but it wasn't in fact if you
look at the it's not even claimed to be
unless just public propaganda but if you
look at sort of political science
literature people would try to be more
or less series of politics sign called
democracy it's the technical term that's
used for it as a polyarchy polyarchy is
a system of elite control and public
gratification so the job of the public
and of polyarchy is to show up every
couple of years and push a button and
choose among a small group of small
leadership group from essentially the
same class and background and interests
and then they've publix let's go home
and buy shoes or something like that but
not involve themselves and public
affairs it's the job of the leadership
responsible men as they call themselves
to make the decisions that's the way the
country was set up again
after the Constitutional Convention
James Madison the main frame where the
Constitution was very explicit about it
is that we have to set up a system in
which power is in the hands of would
equal the wealth of the nation the men
who have only metaphors the men who have
sympathy for the rights of property
owners and who understand that the goal
of government is to protect the minority
of the opulent against the majority I'm
quoting actually those are all quotes
you don't read that when you go to
school no but if you go back to the
constitutional convention where they
were talking openly now that was the
idea and the political system was set up
to have that result and that's why
there's so much power in the Senate the
Senate was the wealth of the nation and
only elected occasionally every six
years and that's why the Sun showered
presidency as compared with
parliamentary systems and the effort to
break the rest up into sort of factions
and separate them and so on was part of
a way of ensuring this well I said this
has been a struggle ever since I mean
popular groups don't like it so there's
constant struggle supreme where
democracy and constant efforts to
repress them and that's just that's the
whole of American history you know goes
in cycles their games this depression
and so on we happen to be in the middle
of a very repressive cycle it's
reflecting what happened in the 1960s in
the 1960s there was a tremendous wave of
democratization lots of people just
became engaged in the public arena and
organized women
farmers everyone it was a period of
enormous activism and engagement that's
one of the reasons why it has such a
negative image so if you read about the
1960s or you study about it in school
you're caught that it was a terrible
time it's called the Time of Troubles
you know everything was horrible well it
was it was it was move towards a popular
engagement in democracy and I had to be
repressed and they've been is then this
is all over the world not just in the
United States the same Europe and Asia
I've seen them in the former colonies
were you know we're resistance movements
were developing liberation movements it
look like the world was falling out of
control and since then there's been a
large-scale wave of repression on every
front it's some of its ideological some
of it is in the international economy
the neoliberal mechanisms of cold their
main role is to try to constrain
democracy they have it to have a
economic effect to mostly harmful but
the most important aspect of them is
directed against the threat of democracy
and that's happening internal to the
United States as well many different
ways and again there isn't the organism
or you know the activism that's going on
which is substantial as a resistance to
this but there's no question about the
United States becoming an oligarchy it
was designed that way it's never in that
different in fact you can just take a
look at the election that's coming up in
the next November and take a look at the
two candidates they were both born into
backgrounds of substantial wealth and
political power they both went to this
elite University they both joined the
same secret society and that
universities Skull and Bones Society
which is to Train rich kids and out of
the rulers of the world get the right
social attitudes and so on and so forth
they are able to run in the election
because they're funded by the same
institutions the same financial and
other corporate institutions fund them
so therefore they are able to run and we
call that an election I mean I mean they
had elections they all come to Sparta to
look they did you know they pick
different people who run it and this is
an extremely our assistant but there's a
lot of propaganda they're trying to tell
people particularly people say in
Eastern Europe that this is some kind of
democracy well yeah it is some kind of
democracy but but not political
democracy I mean a intersect is a very
fruity countries there's a lot of very
good things about it so the power of the
state to coerce and control people
happens to be very limited unusually so
I think unique in the world and that's a
good thing there are other many good
things but political democracy is not
one of them it's got to be created I'm
in many respects the u.s. is what
sometimes called a failed state a state
with formal democratic institutions but
they don't function and you can see that
on policy issues all over the place I
mean if you want to give you plenty of
examples but on major policy issues
crucial ones that whichever in regards
this person public opinion and a lead
opinion are completely different and the
result is that those issues simply do
not appear in the political arena and
are not discussed in the media and
people don't know much about them and
they have the feelings they can't turn
into political issues because it's not
the way to country grunts if you look at
the elections elections of the United
States has an extremely powerful
propaganda system by far the most
advanced in the world I mean the
Russians Germans tried to copy what they
couldn't even come close sophistication
that's called the public relationships
which was created in the free countries
it was created in England in the United
States for very good reasons in England
the United States about a century ago a
link groups began came to understand
that they are not going to be able to
control their populations by force too
much freedom has been won so the
capacity to control people that corset
declined and the only alternative is the
control attitudes and beliefs so they
develop these huge industries massive
industries through control attitudes and
beliefs and it is the nominees the
society I mean about the probably two
trillion dollars a year in the United
States is sent to some what's called
marketing marketing is just propaganda
it's ways to try to induce you to devote
your life and energy to something that
will keep you away from bothering people
in power and consumerism going to debt
that whatever it may be does don't
bother us that's marketing and it's a
immense industry in the United States
England by how its spread too much rest
of the world but concentrated in the
freer countries these are modes of
control and well one of the things the
public relations industry does is run
the elections so elections are run by
the public
candidate chris will be the financing of
elections that comes from overwhelmingly
from the corporate sector money they're
going to finance elections since Kennedy
are mostly on television it's a it's a
way of trapping people but the public
relations industry which basically runs
them has an ideology pretty
straightforward I'll tell you about the
ideology is to keep away from issues and
to concentrate on what are called
qualities so the way you present a
candidate is not here's what I think
about visit that issue but you can trust
me or I'm a leader you know I'm the kind
of person you would like to meet in a
bar and have a drink with there's
something like this if you look at the
campaign's that's the way that present
you have to keep away from issues
because most of the public disagrees on
issues and you don't want to get people
involved in issues anyway it's not it is
so what you do is present people as you
create characters I mean the people who
run for officer they comes kind of come
out of central casting another train to
speak and talk in certain ways I'm take
this whole business about Bush being a
religious mania and maybe is it could be
about as religious as I ask for align
them but everyone knows in the united
states that about forty percent of the
population our religious fanatics and I
mean fanatics you know kind of like the
most extreme Islamic fundamentalists
over half the population in the United
States literally believes that the world
was created six thousand years ago and
about forty percent or what are called
evangelical Christians they've had a
born-again experience
sort of Christ it's not saved room and
this is not well that's huge voting bloc
and if you can pretend to be religious
you can try to gain support of that if
you notice every candidate in the United
States on either party ever since Carter
started with Carter but ever since then
every single candidate has to at least
pretend to be religious fanatic partly
to pick up the voting block so like take
Bill Clinton you imagine how religious
ease doesn't every Monday morning in the
newspapers and all the newspapers had
front page photographs of Bill Clinton
and church the day before and evening
song arms go on and so forth and the
bush people have pushed it to an extreme
because I'm going to really harming the
population so they have to do something
else to organize and it's the same with
everyone else they all have to prove
somehow that I could put their that
create characteristics which people may
vote for well these are all the ways of
undermining democracy that's what try to
convince people to max out their credit
cards on consumer goods that they don't
want or pay attention to can you trust
them are all modes of preventing the
threat of democracy from development and
these are not for obvious reasons major
industries I mean a leaf group simply
don't want the population to become
involved in the political and social
affairs much too dangerous so again
asking whether the US is becoming an
oligarchy she's not there
question thank you very much
