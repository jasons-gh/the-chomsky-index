this well we do have live organized
people in this country as we've seen
over the past few months but they're not
the live organized people that you and I
grew up belonging to and being active
with they are live organized people who
mostly are responding to calls from
right-wing commercial radio station
commentators and television hosts who
are doing things like protesting against
taxation against the government against
what they call socialism against the
Obama health care plan whatever they
think of it as what do you make of this
kind of what Pat Buchanan once called
peasants with pitchforks approach to
public policy coming from the right in
the streets and in the media of this
country with a certain amount of
vehemence and a certain following as
well that were I don't know how many
people but it seemed to me from looking
at television coverage maybe a couple
hundred thousand people who marched in
Washington a couple of weeks ago under
various banners of the right what do you
make of this and the implications for
small D democratic government in the
United States all right I think the
implications are dangerous but and it's
easy to ridicule them you don't look at
the crazy things they say you want to
kill my grandmother you know so on and
there's a lot of nonsense that's true
but what we really ought to be asking
ourselves is why the peace movement the
left the activist organizations aren't
organizing these people a lot of what
they're protesting is is pretty sensible
I'm a lot of the protest for example or
against the bailout the massive bailout
you know they feel that they were
betrayed you know they pressured worked
very hard to prevent it two minutes
later they got it on why should the
you know bankers end up from the
recession more powerful than they were
before which is what's happening you can
read it in the business press they're
exalting about it
they're more powerful and they were
before their you know the big banks are
even bigger than they were the
government insurance policy the
too-big-to-fail insurance policy is
guaranteeing them that they can continue
doing exactly what they were doing which
tanked the economy they can take risky
make risky loans and investments since
it's risky they'll make a lot of profit
money coming out of the rears if it
collapses the taxpayer will come in and
bail amount was it too big to fail
bonuses and profits are going through
the roof and meanwhile people are
suffering well they have a reason to
protest that and but but the tragedy is
that the protests are and many other
things the protests are being organized
by pretty much the same sectors that are
creating the crisis the corporate money
that's behind them is the ones who are
very happy that it's coming out like
this and the the as a real failure of
the activist movements the left the
peace movement so on that we're not
organizing I think that's the question
we ought to ask and there are other
things I mean there are historical
memories that are awakened you know want
to draw analogies too closely but
there's some similarities which are not
encouraging certainly for someone my age
these people have real grievances I mean
I have not seen a demographic analysis
of you know those who call in on talk
shows but I listen to them a lot and
they're interesting I mean if you sort
of suspend disbelief you forget about
reality of the world and just listen
it's not a joke if you listen
the message that comes across this has
an internal logic to it it's coherent it
gives answers to people who want answers
and need them and deserve them they're
crazy answers but they're not hearing
any others I mean these are people
who've you know are there done
everything right you know and Christian
god-fearing and take care of their
families and and for for 30 years
they've been shafted but somebody's got
to give them an answer of why the media
has always had the function in this
country of suspension of disbelief but
that has traditionally been called
entertainment what you're saying is the
suspension of disbelief has we've left
Edward Armour behind a long time ago
that firewall between the entertainment
the Jack Benny part and Milton Berle
part of media for those of you who go
back that far and the Edward r murrow
part of media that wall has come down
and what you're now saying is it's a
suspension of disbelief is a
characteristic of especially broadcast
media in all of its domains supposed
entertainment infotainment and
information that's happening but I don't
really think that's the main problem I
was not a great admirer of the media in
the earlier period I know a pretty awful
in many ways I think they're better now
than they were 30 40 years ago because
the country is better so more civilized
country the media reflect that I think
I'm not really thinking about the
entertainment aspect of the media though
yes it's significant I'm thinking about
the part that has substantive content
crazy content but it is substantive it
does give answers I mean to people who
for the last 30 years have seen their
wages income stagnate or decline
benefits decline services decline there
is nothing for the children you know
worlds out of control these are the
people who on poles maybe 80% of them
say the country's going in the wrong
direction the government's run by the
few and the special interests not the
people and so on you know they're not
wrong this is all happening to them and
the answers that they're getting from
say you know rush limbaugh Michael
Savage the rest of them are well we have
an answer the rich liberals own
everything they own the corporations
they run the government
they run the media and they don't care
about people like you they don't care
about the flyover people between the
East Coast and the West Coast they only
care about giving everything you work
for a way to you know to illegal
immigrants or gays or something so we
got to protect ourselves from them and
furthermore they run the government when
they put up a health program it's not to
give you health it's to kill your granny
no and that's an answer to something
it's a terrible answer but it is an
answer and if you do suspend disbelief
you forget about what's happening in the
world really
it's a coherent answer now they're not
hearing anything else and the memory
that comes to my mind again I don't
press the analogy too hard but I think
it's worth thinking about is late by Mar
Germany there were people with real
grievances the Nazis gave them an answer
it's the fault of the Jews and the
Bolsheviks and we've got to protect
ourselves from them and that'll take
care of grievances and we know what
happened but Germany in the 1920s was
the most civilized peak of Western
civilization and in the arts and the
sciences highly democratic functioning
democratic institutions a decade later
it was in the pits of human history but
again the analogy is not it's not closed
but it's frightening and unless an
answer can be given to these people
unless they can be led to understand
what's really happening through them we
could be in for trouble let me
