the role of the news media is central to
the modern democratic process for most
people the news media the dominant
source of information about the world
they tell us what matters they tell us
who matters the way we vote or the way
we respond to opinion pollsters is based
largely on media information so the
quality of a democracy now depends upon
the information they provide the
mainstream media really represent a lead
interest and they serve those elite
interests in a way that can be described
as carrying out a propaganda function if
you want to understand the way some
system works you look at its
institutional structure how is it
organized how is it controlled how is it
funded and so on big question of course
is what kind of information do we get
does it come from a diverse range of
perspectives or are some views dominant
and others excluded the most commonly
repeated theory is that the media tilt
towards the left or to the liberal end
of the political spectrum what's curious
about this view is that there's almost
no evidence to support it in fact the
bulk of evidence suggests the media tend
to be biased the other way the spectrum
of opinion most often represented goes
from Center to right while voices on the
Left are generally absent this is the
essence of epidamnum Noam Chomsky's
thesis in the last 10 or 20 years
there's been massive research
documenting the fact that the media are
extraordinarily subordinated to external
power now when you have that power the
best technique is to ignore all of that
discussion ignore it totally and to
eliminate it by the simple device of
asserting the opposite if you assert the
opposite that eliminates mountains of
evidence demonstrating that what you're
saying is false
that's what power means and the way you
assert the opposite is by just saying
the meteor liberal okay now the question
that we discuss is are the media too
liberal or are they not too liberal
we're talking about your letter saying
that the media were biased in the last
election the bulk of our mail supports
the notion that there is a definite
liberal tilt to the news media all right
now that we've narrowed the agenda to
the one acceptable question or the
two liberal let's have a look at the way
it's argued if you want to show that you
would look at the media product and you
would try to demonstrate that it
reflects you know a slant or distortion
supporting a liberal agenda nobody does
this that would take a little work and
because if you did it you'd immediately
fall on your face because I worked the
other way so what's done is to produce a
proposal which is so idiotic that you
have to wonder at the cynicism of the
people who are putting it forth and
their contempt for the population the
proposal is the following let's ask how
journalism oKed
okay so we find let's say eighty percent
of democratic okay we've now proven the
meteor to liberal there's nothing I
first of all no matter what you know the
facts are right the prove zero you could
find that ninety nine percent of the
journalists are members of the Socialist
Workers Party you know or some Maoist
group and that in itself would prove
nothing about the media output the issue
is whether the media are free are the
media by their institutional structure
free to allow expression of opinion from
whatever source and looking at any topic
and so on and so forth so if it turned
out that 80% of journalists were part of
one faction of the business party rather
than another faction of the business
party would that tell you anything even
if you take these studies of their face
value that there are a number of flaws
with them perhaps the most important one
is that they assume that it's the
journalists rather than the owners the
advertisers the new shapers or the
newsmakers who control the manufacture
of news that's a bit like saying that
the workers on the factory floor decide
what the car industry produces it's long
been understood you know hundreds of
years that unless people are controlled
they're going to challenge power they
will not simply willingly accept
subordination domination
hunger and so on nobody's going to
accept that if they have choices so it
is therefore necessary for those who are
in the positions of control
decision-making monopolized wealth and
so on it is necessary for them to
somehow keep the population from their
throats as they put it and that can
either be done by force or as force that
capacity declines by control of opinion
there's no other method
