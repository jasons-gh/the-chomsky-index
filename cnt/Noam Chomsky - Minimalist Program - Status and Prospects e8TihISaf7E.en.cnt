sponsor of this conference dr. al I had
with you Jerry Lee the founder and chair
of these Institute was not able to join
us so she sent me a message a letter
that I'm very happy to retail it has a
lot of information about what Roshan
Institute does and how they help studies
and research in this area
she writes as the founder and chair of
Russian cultural heritage Institute it
gives me great pleasure to welcome all
participants the second North American
Conference in Iranian mystics nasal - at
the University of Arizona which is the
ideal site to host a conference
specializing exclusively in languages of
Iranian family given the strength of its
linguistics and Persian and Iranian
studies programs I command
professor Sima carry me and the Europe a
of Department of linguistics for a
leadership in organizing Nestle - and
continuing the great vision of Professor
Richard Larson former chair of the
Department of linguistics at Stony Brook
University who initiated this
groundbreaking conference and
successfully convened miss r1 at Stony
Brook University in April 2017 as a
linguist myself I am particularly proud
that our Institute is the principle
sponsor of needs or - as it was for me
so one Russian cultural heritage
Institute was founded in 2000 to promote
the preservation transmission
transmission transmission and in truck
instructional image and culture in the
United States and the Institute has
provided grants and established numerous
endowments at some of the most
prestigious universities including the
University of Arizona to support and
expand Persian Studies programs faculty
positions and academic programming
activities russian russian culture
Institute also partners with
world-renowned cultural institutions to
sponsor educational public book programs
relating to prison arts and culture such
as conferences exhibitions performances
in Fujio and community outreach events
in addition we are proud to have helped
nurture the next generation of prison
studies specialists to hundreds of
Roshan instituted fellowships and
scholarships for excellence in Persian
studies but enough innovative research
publications digitalisation translations
doctoral dissertations and others call
it scholarly activities and we have
understand cultural heritage institute i
wish to express our congratulations to
Professor ping Academy for having
attracted such notable scholars as
participants and keynote speakers at
least or two it is a particular honor to
can some of them among Oryx extensive
network of national institute cells I
deeply regret missing the opportunity to
be among all of you but wish everyone is
successful and enjoyable conference
filled with learning and excellence
colleague exchanges and we have and
peppers there leather and now on behalf
of Nestle - I thank this time I would
like to introduce my colleague well
thank you singing for inviting me to
introduce known you know well Simon
asked me to kill his mom and I at first
the crime is known she kindly insisted
snow electric we
and I'll do it my way if you love me
okay so some of you may know that
millions of years ago I started as a
physicist and then much later I became
acquainted you know and with nones work
and I found his approach to linguistic
very congenial to a physicist you know
bringing together by cogent further
abstraction previously you know separate
hypotheses introducing inaudible
elements what were called and D
categories
something that has been fiercely
criticized by the anti generativist
still to this day but you know there is
a quote that normalized and I like from
the Nobel physicist
who say that the proper of science will
approach the science is to replace
complex visibles with simple Invisibles
this this physics has been doing
relentlessly and known has been doing
that too well let me show you something
so these are the proceedings of a
physics conference held in 2016 in the
lovely you know seaside place of a
Castilian child Italy and it is you know
the Journal of physics the top German
and physics I'm showing you this because
there is a paper by neuron in this it's
a talk that he gave at that conference
in September 2016 now every two years
you know they organize this conference
which is you know space-time matter
quantum mechanics and it is a tradition
in the last day of the conference to
invite scholars from other fields in
2016 it was linguistics so know as a
paper here which is entitled the
Galilean challenge architecture
animation of language I also have a
paper here but that's in a century so he
he gave this talk which was very
well-received by the physicists you know
there were some friendly clarification
questions it was really you know very
very well received before his talk
there was another talk by an Austrian
physicist that has a quote trans means
more with his record that I'm sure oh no
we find very congenial so the quote from
Niels Bohr is the following it is wrong
to think that the task of physics is to
find out how nature is physics concerns
what we can say about nature you know
it's almost so let me tell you you know
conclude a little anecdote so over
dinner that evening afternoon stop I was
sitting next to a highly distinguished
physicist no William then une rue hukum
pardon me with questions about nose work
I did my best to answer the questions
friendly question he's very friendly guy
beard big guy famous physicist now let
me tell you the following
he is the author of what is called the
Unruh effect what is the Unruh effect
you see in a moment why I'm telling you
this the owner effect is the following a
stationary observer looking at an
accelerating body in the vacuum will see
an increase in temperature due to
acceleration all physicists think it's
right you know it's true you know the
derivation mathematical derivation of
this principle by Bill moon who is
impeccable
so can you verify experimentally well
not really not in the real world because
look in order to observe one Celsius
degree of increasing temperature you
would have to accelerate that body 10 to
the power 20 meters
second per second you can't do that so
you understand that it was an easy task
for me to persuade bill Unruh of the
solid status of empty categories of
silent you know case in a number of
languages of deleted copies it was very
easy for me to persuade him so I really
think in a sense that Norma is the
virtual physicist like me like to
express my regret that we were prevented
from having the interaction we
anticipated with Aaron and colleagues
always painful to see governments that
are fearing with academic freedom the
particularly painful awareness bear on
them this is not the first time that
with regard to Iran I recall a couple of
years ago there was a copy the American
Association for the Advancement of
science its international conference and
Boston there were many protests about
the fact that Iranians didn't run in
scientists admit there are significant
contributions to topics of great
interest were prevented from attending
was painful to see this
well turning to our topic
languages can be studied in many
different ways as you won't know the one
crucial divide is between the studying
language as something internal to people
a trait of the person so it's property
of means and I'm talking English and not
forces that I had that's a property of
me that I have a shared capacity to
flinch and it's a species property
that's one approach it would be treating
the language something like the way we
treat an individual visual system for
example it's a property of the
individual another approach is to regard
language as something external to
individuals out there somewhere not
inside us the first approach is
expressed pretty well by great linguist
audience person about a century ago the
regarded the prime concern of
linguistics to be to discuss to discover
how quoting him how the elements of
language come into existence in the mind
of a speaker an individual speaker
obviously on the basis of finite
experience a yielding nobody called the
notion of structure in the mind that is
definite enough to guide the speaker in
framing sentences of his own that
particularly free expressions these are
typically new to speaker in Europe and
then beyond that further concern had to
discover the great principles that
underlie the grammars of all languages
that's yes person in the century ago
adopting yes persons position that a
linguist or studying something in the
mind of the speaker booth what his
present does innate endowment and the
mature state that's achieved something a
study very similar to the investigation
of other biological systems
well yes person was actually the last
representative of a long tradition a
very rich tradition which goes back to
the origins of the Scientific Revolution
in 17th century the Scientific
Revolution began really when the
thinkers of the day simply refused to
accept what seemed natural and
self-explanatory
the weather was full of bodies or the
perception of a geometrical figure or
anything else and recognized that these
phenomena were mysterious puzzling not
self-explanatory at all but demanding
explanations and one phenomenon that
caught their attention in fact was
language that's Galilean challenge that
massimo referred to galileo and his
contemporaries expressed their amazement
that what is in fact is a remarkable
phenomena the fact that with just a few
sounds symbols it's possible to express
an infinite number of thoughts and also
to somehow convey to others who have no
access to our minds however in terms of
our most inner thoughts apart developing
and what their nature is by just
society like the elements of their own
words all put them in their own words
they were awed by the method by which we
were able to express our thoughts the
marvelous invention we would now not
pull it an invention the marvelous
invention by which using twenty five or
thirty sounds we can create the infinite
four varieties expressions which having
nothing in themselves in common with
what is passing in our minds
ethel nonetheless permit us to express
all our secrets and allow us to
understand what is not present to
consciousness in effect everything we
can conceive than the most diverse
movements of our soul and it is pretty
amazing if you think about seems natural
give us some thoughts it is a remarkable
fact in itself also there's nothing
comfortable in the organic world in
achievement the understood and explains
the Galileo himself regarded the
alphabet as the most dependence of human
inventions first because it enabled this
achievement to be implemented and
carried out but also because the
alphabet incorporated implicitly was
of the ages and the answers to all
possible questions kind of like a
universal Turing machine the shortly
after they form Aryans and logicians and
L monastery spent that these notions
developed much of the foundations of
contemporary logic and many insights
into linguistics as well but they had
all generated a what turned out appeared
quite a rich tradition of the universe
called universal and rational grammar a
universal because it's common to all
human languages is irrational because
I'm seeking explanations not just
descriptions
it was firstly seeking to in essence
terms that describe the great principles
that underlie the grammars of all
languages well while the formulations
were imprecise I think it's fair to
interpret this tradition as recognizing
at least implicitly that the capacity
for language as well as individual
languages are actually internal
properties of persons
it was also generally assumed now we
have as much better evidence but
plausibly assumed at the time that this
capacity is shared through the species
with no differences and is unique to
humans and fundamental respects it's a
true species property and the basis for
human thought
human creativity in culture well this
general program falls within the Natural
Sciences in recent years while most the
most expression that's been pulled by a
linguistics program the early efforts to
meet the galilean challenge the faced
serious difficulties both empirical and
to empirical difficulty just didn't have
enough evidence anything like conceptual
difficulty was that nobody had a real
idea as to how to capture this notion of
a concept of structure in the mind which
enables speakers to construct the
infinitely many free expressions
capturing their thoughts while all of
this was swept aside by the
structuralist behaviour currents of the
early 20th century the yes person
himself was completely forgotten the
interesting review of the structuralist
reaction were lack of reaction to yes
person by Julia Falk historian
linguistics and language about twenty
years of them.the but it was completely
forgotten the structuralist
behavioralist approach that adopted the
second approach to the study of language
something external and you can see this
very clearly if you simply look at the
definitions of language that were given
by leading figures so for example for de
Saussure language was a kind of social
contract that it wouldn't call the
collection of word images in the
community of speakers so something
outside for leonard bloomfield the
American linguist that language was a
set of utterances that can be expressed
in a speech community for the leading
and the Philosopher's of language like
though even Quine the language in his
words as a fabric the sentences
associated with one another with stimuli
by the mechanism of conditioned response
the leading philosophers of language
david lewis languages some infinite set
of sentences the both Kwan and Lewis
so argued there doesn't make any sense
to think of a particular concept to
structure that could determine
characterizes incidents it only makes
sense thought about the incidence of the
thing that's external to a person well
the tradition was totally forgotten even
people I guess person well by the mid
20th century became possible to return
to the tradition which was unfortunately
unknown those later rediscovered and to
express clearly what what this what a
concept the structure in mind would be
that permits the creation the
construction of an infinite number of
expressions expressing their thoughts
this was the result of the work of
mathematicians and Alan Turner for Abel
Campos and others who made sure clear
developed what effect is the modern
theory of computability and made it very
clear what it means for a finite object
to generate an infinite number of
expressions and that allows us to at
least approach the galilean challenge
concretely for the first time the
structure of the concept the structure
in mind is the internal language
nowadays sometimes called the AI
language it's a finite generative system
that generates an infinite array of
structured expressions each of which is
interpreted as a thought which can be
externalized in some sense remove
sensory motor or modality typically set
up sound but as we know not necessarily
so this property we can pull the basic
property of language and then to meet
the galilean challenge
once this concept is clarified there are
series of tasks the one of them of
course is simply to try to describe
accurately the variety of I languages
not a slight test second problem is to
explain how the speaker can select a
particular instance of the set of infant
set of expressions in mind the wind
speaking and the interacting thirst
another question is how this selected
expression is externalized typically in
sound third and how the expression is
processed and interpreted by a speaker
mapping the sound to an internal
expression well of these topics the
second and the third
the externalizing the selected
expression and interpreting it but both
of these are input output the processes
the kind that we sort of know how to
dress then a lot of them there's been a
lot of progress in discovering of what
kinds of operations are involved and
externalizing the internal expression
processing what's very but the first of
these tasks how a speaker selects a
particular expression that that remains
the total mystery there's nothing said
that's part of the property of the
voluntary action general which is for
whatever reason and beyond the
contemporary human capacity to grasp the
problem was described the rather well by
among the leading maybe the leading
scientist who studies as voluntary
action video Pete scenes colleague
Roberto Jamie and
a review of the review of the state of
New York recently they pointed out as
they put it translated that we're
beginning to understand the puppet and
the strings but we have absolutely
nothing to say about the puppeteer in
our case how the selection takes place
so that we put aside as a knit one of
several personal mysteries that are part
of the element challenge well the island
which is a property of the individual
and so is the species-specific Faculty
of language ug in their lingo the
faculty the Naples the island which to
be acquired and the study the Faculty of
language of you d ug faces two crucial
empirical conditions which are immediate
that's one of the thoughts this approach
instead of his language the one is the
problems learning ability counting the
aisle items to be acquired
the other is the problem of the
vulnerability and help that the faculty
is language has somehow emerged in the
why serious questions no support these
are the questions of the rational and
university reinterpreted in their terms
the year should be recognized that all
an approach of this kind of language
imposes very austere conditions on what
counts as a genuine explanation that we
will have a general genuine explanation
of some phenomena of language if we
provide an account they'll tell any
device that's used to describe it can
have been learned doesn't have a ton of
evolved short of that we don't have an
explanation we just have an organization
of people which is very valuable it's
very useful to have an organized account
of phenomena rather than just a chaotic
yes that's an achievement but it's short
of explanation the explanation will
require genuine explanations invariably
from this point of view requires a
demonstration of learnability
demonstration movie vulnerability and
again that is an austere requirement
with any device recruit proposed for an
aspect of language has to request it
chase that as an ultimate challenge well
the first proposals my back to the
fifties as well you know the deal with
this developed two kinds of devices the
ones first director parameters for
compositionality and other
transformational grammars for the
ubiquitous property of the displacement
and language interpretation of
expression both word certain ones
somewhere else Worth's silence typically
both of these systems as were far too
complex to even approach the goal of
genuine explanation the general
assumption at the time was that
compositionality is a kind of natural
and expected property of language that
dislocation though ubiquitous is some
strange imperfection that of human
language should not to be expected to
sum out in the explained away now that's
a view that's still very widely held in
current literature but I think actually
the opposite is true the recent work
suggests that the most primitive
operation the one the most fully lead
meets the conditions of evolvability
learnability is stringent enough
displacement
collect that later wrong
compositionality is a more complex
operation but even though the two can be
unified in the important way that these
are fish that began to be understood as
opposed minimums program was pursued
while going back to the earlier period
in the ninth by the 1960s it was
recognized that phrase structure grammar
czar completely unacceptable wrong
properties entirely not for one thing
the first richard.reimers conflate the
properties that are quite distinct like
hierarchy the linear order and
projection which is very different
properties
put together in a first order grown but
beyond that tree structure drummers
simply permit too many options like
there's nothing in the theory of for
agreement that prevents the rules like
VP arrow in CP that's fine for a
structured rule like this that huge
numbers of possible forest structure
rules which lead was just avoid because
they make much sense but that's no good
the theory has to tell you what does
make sense what you can't afford
anyway but sixties at least in the
tradition that on discussion the first
structure drummers were essentially
eliminate anything they use of the first
shorter grammar is at best very weak
descriptive device the word placed by
x-bar theory x-bar theory had that's the
number of consequences which are not
really appreciated at the time so think
back the x-bar theory of course avoid
linear order there's no linear order and
an explore that forces you to move to a
principles and parameters approach
there's no choice
since it takes a English and Japanese
and roughly your amateurism in linear
order there has to be they have
essentially the same x-bar theory but
some parameter the tilting which way you
want to order the tune so from it should
have been realized right away that
exporting excludes the possibility of
rule-based systems that least
compositionality and requires the move
to what later became misfolding
principles and parameters approach is
really no alternative
now also x-bar theory was a step because
of this property towards a much more
significant far-reaching
conclusion about language architecture
that became clearer manuia worked in the
minimalist program in which all prepare
in a moment well there was also serious
inadequacy of x-bar theory which was not
recognized at the time not until a few
years ago and said that x-bar theory
cannot handle X eccentric constructions
which abound so takes a just playing the
subject predicate we're going to deal
with it said rotation Koopmans
protect an internal subject that offices
there's two objects nominal phrase and
verbal firuze which have to be
constructed separately and independently
and then put together and they do not
fit into the next one through
theoretical work and this is a whole
over the place in fact every case of
movement of internal merge is case
yields an extra center of construction
now if you look at the literature from
the 60s right through to today the many
artisans were developed to try to sort
of get around this problem giving one
new to be the clausal example but with
no reason to do
- versus entirely unacceptable so
there's something very seriously wrong
about
explorative by the 1990s that seems to
number of us that are enough and learn
about languages particularly with a huge
explosion of inquiry that took place in
the 1980s after the principles and
parameters approach it and more or less
formulated with some clarity they'd had
leading to the very productive research
and well quite a lot was learned and it
seemed that it might be possible to try
to confront directly for the first time
the task of constructing genuine
explanations there's an explanation
based on properties that would meet the
twin conditions conditions of
learnability evolvability would seem
conflicting if you think about them the
problem with learnability requires that
the system be rich enough to account for
the transition from impoverished data to
rich knowledge on the other hand it must
be simple enough so that it could
possibly evolved but the nineties it
seemed possible to begin to reconcile
these apparently conflicting conditions
well pursuing that program which do is
to seek the simplest computational
operation and ask how much can be
explained on the basis of the simplest
operation which must exist and other
factors that enter into the into the
attainment of the fisher state of the
island which the other factors are of
course external data and general what we
may regard is not
laws other properties sometimes called
third factor properties typically that
would be for a computational system one
reduce or I'm the magician behind the
curtain
well the obvious conditions would be
conditions of the computational
efficiency for computational system like
language so how much can be explained in
these terms that's essentially the
members don't notice that in this issue
to the extent you can do this you
satisfy the learner ability and
evolvability conditions the learner
ability condition because nothing has
learned the simplest computational
operation simply must exist as an innate
property so nothing's learned the
evolvability grow is also overcome
because the basic property does exist
it's just a fact and it's clear that the
Sun the operation or set of operations
must have evolved to deal with it then
we would naturally expect that if nature
would at least take the simplest
possible operation so the fact that the
simplest possible operation evolves is
not a question that otherwise we don't
have the facts that exist so there's no
learnability revolve ability problem the
innate property mut might very well be
triggered by external events but that's
typical with any structures but
generally biological traits so that does
leave questions like how the elementary
operation is implemented in the brain
now there is interesting research on
this that's studying at the moment is
I'll go for it reaches recent state of
the art and neurolinguistics very
Anderson ideas well what's the simplest
computational operation with there's one
computational operation so simple it
must exist any computational process
that's simply the operation of taking
two enemies already constructed the
forming a new entity from them then in
the simplest case not modifying either
of them or adding any new structure that
is simply the operation of minor it set
formation which will merge in the
current literature and that meets the
dual conditions of the mobility and
evolve abilities so anything that can
account for in terms of merge is a
genuine explanation there seemed to me
to have been fairly substantial
achievements in this one achievement is
simply the fact that you unified
compositionality and dislocation these
in fact there will be two sub cases of
the blender set formation you put two
objects together you do they're separate
from one another
that's the compositionality where one is
inside the other and then you factored
on that's justification there's a
universal property of language that when
you do dislocation internal merge the
one of the copies typically the lower
one is it either totally deleted or is
left with some small residue in some
languages is not fully expressed and
that follows at once from third factor
considerations limiting
Asian women would be it's a tremendous
burden on the internal computation and
even the the externalization controls
the motor apparatus and so on to repeat
every copy so what the mind does is to
restrict as quickly as possible the
computational operation speaks the
limited one that has interesting
consequences that leads to portion
problems as everyone knows anyone who's
worked on parsing programs knows that
one of the hardest problems is what a
full killer got problems was trying to
try the how to fill the gaps whereas the
gaps that's associated with which a year
the beginning in sentence but most of
that could be able to come and she
simply copied it recently articulated
everything but it seems the language
that just doesn't care about efficiency
its parsing or about efficiency of
communication altogether it only cares
about constructing the optimal systems
and most elegant internal simple system
there's many examples of that a lot of
consequences well that's one of this
indicates that far from being an
imperfection er the dislocation is
expected then a computation and
elementary competition system in order
to bar it has to have some stipulation
and furthermore if you think about it of
the two options compositionality and a
dislocation that this location is the
simpler one for one reason it requires
no search almost no search it just has
to search the object that you're looking
at for compositionality you've got to
search the entire lexicon
huge search plus anything that's already
been instructed to decide put those two
things together so it's the simplest
operations
primitive and there are also other
reasons for thinking that it is the most
primitive so for example it was
interesting study by Marsh Minsky some
years ago founders artificial
intelligence he and one of the students
is simply experimented with the simplest
computational systems technically the
simplest Turing machines the ones with
the smallest number of states and the
smallest number of symbols and just
asked what happens if you let these
things run free and what happened was
that most of them simply crushed that
they either get into infinite loops of
the determining the ones that didn't
crash had an interesting property they
yielded the successor function now take
a look at internal merge it is except in
the simplest case in fact is the
successor function it was the language
is the lexicon of one element internal
merged yields a successor function and
Minsky suggested plausibly the nature
was likely to have looked for the
simplest thing the works which would
infect the knowledge that be able to say
internal murders but there are other
reasons to feel look at other organisms
even down to the level of insects but
they have counters like an ant can count
the number of steps that have took going
to a certain food source and then back
when you build up counters you get
pretty close to the successor country so
if you think about it in evolutionary
terms there's a there's a basis for
moving from simple counting systems up
to the point where somehow with some
small change in the wiring of the brain
you go all the way to the simplest
operations that successive function is
actually in eternal merge of at the
point but more generally both forms of
merged
or automatically available once you pick
the simplest operation for the is a
rather a new kind of result unless a
real significant one it's one of the
rarest novels of the genuine explanation
of the fundamental property of language
well notice that of course it's not just
dislocation its dislocation plus
reconstruction so it automatically
yields the for the mind the internal
expressions which in fact of the basis
for the full interpretation and the
reconstruction for a matter as many
interpreters constant ancestors to take
the familiar example take the sentence
it's his mother that every boy admires
embarrass his mother that admires every
boy obvious difference and not modifier
variable relation to look at the reasons
it's perfectly obvious
that's what's reaching the mind of not
the year is the full system without the
externalization that deletes copy and
that yields the interpretation of course
much more complex examples to take one
the illustrator compare which of his
pictures that did the museum think that
every artist likes best answer is first
which of his pictures convince the
museum that every artist likes flowers
with no relation between every and is
you get very complex examples what
reaches the mind yields the
interpretation instantly what reaches
the ear this problems a lot of decoding
to try to figure out where the gap is
that's these are genuine explanations of
non-trivial
property's actually the most interesting
case which has been extensively
discussed literature a very odd way is
the property called structure dependence
this is a very strange property of
language which was noticed back in the
fifties a study of these topics again
and seriously why is it the case that in
all languages in all instructions the
linear order is ignored and what's used
is only our structure is very strange
for two reasons
one thing everything that you hear is
not your order but everything you hear
is ignored
you never hear structure that's that's
correct
now the other reason is that
computations on lineal superficial
looked far simpler it's very easy to
write programs that say you pick the
third word picked the first book they
move it to the front it's trivial the
what language universally does let's say
forget about the simple computations
using one that keeps the linear two
hierarchical structure the standard
example that's discussed in this is
officer agent why yeah she say you can
animals that fly swim the wires that
pain can't swim nut can fly in some ways
that was a bad example to use but
suppose it creates the illusion that
there might be a way of learn this by
looking a lot of data it's an illusion
but there's an immense literature and
thought in their sons with paper still
coming out one's impressed coming out of
language they're trying to show that
with original systems a recurrent neural
networks have been there examples would
be possible that's to learn this that's
totally they were all of this literature
is totally irrelevant
very hard to make
it's worth thinking for one thing all
the methods fair doesn't matter
suppose they succeeded it would be of no
interest whatsoever not because if they
succeeded they are not addressing the
question that is the right question why
is this chosen in all languages and all
instructions why doesn't anything like
what you say then you were much simpler
that's what you hear so even he could
get a method looking many training
examples with huge supercomputers and
someone that gave you something like
them with infants no would tell you
nothing but the question is why does it
work this way why not some other one
another strange property of this
literature is that it's doing something
that is never done in the sciences it's
trying to find a complex way to refute
the null hypothesis the null hypothesis
is that the simplest possible operation
yields structure dependence which is a
fact if the only operation is merged
automatically it yields structure
dependence so the problem solve
but simplest possible way with a genuine
explanation so we have to ask ourselves
what curious pathology is it in the
field of computational cognitive science
that leads people over and over again
with more papers coming out still to try
to find a way to refute the null
hypothesis and meanwhile not addressing
the single question about that is raised
namely why is it always this way it
wasn't never any other way
it's an interesting and of course the
quite beyond that there were cases in
the literature which the example of what
walks raisin is misleading because it
does suggest you might be able to find a
way to learn them from theater
perfectly standard cases where it's just
impossible also takes a control rules
carefully the guy who fixed the car
packed up his tools widest carefully go
was packed its tools not with support
any notifications like that there's zero
data from the child so no amount these
are the richest are in our system isn't
our humble trainings not abundant so it
was a very strange phenomena or thinking
about but the facts and the fact of the
matter is the structure dependence like
dislocation with construction are very
curious properties they're universal
from language they do we do that of the
optimal solutions for them in the case
structure dependence goes even beyond
most many of you know there's no nor
linguistic evidence possible mention
suggested to the group in Milan the
studied cases where subjects were
presented with nonsense languages one of
which once it was languages real
language based on structure of real
languages which they didn't know the
other used rules that violate were
sacrum like for example using linear
order enough for say indication and what
was found was that he in the case where
the nonsense language was modeled on a
real language using structure dependence
you get activity in the normal language
areas of the brain for a preservative
well in the case of the nonsense
language of using things like linear
order you get diffuse activity in the
brain
the meaning is basically being treated
as a puzzle no this was
no based on a second linguistic
experiment which was not so much reason
for suggesting yet to study by Neil
Smith and the antics in pleading was any
venerable working have been working for
some years with a subject has extreme
cognitive disabilities figure out
anything as a remarkable linguist except
languages of this munch and Smith and
simply noticed that when they tried some
similar experiment with Chris he could
do nothing at all with the simple
language that used many water but the
nonsense language based on a real
language immediately was the basis for
the suggestion that the neural
linguistic study there's also by now
evidence from the child acquisition so
by now studies have shown that infants
as young as 30 months old already have
mastered the principal structure
dependence ignore water structure almost
no so in fact we have we have the
emerging evidence from full sources that
tell us that the null hypothesis pierced
me for that which makes it even stranger
that their efforts to try to show that
there's some other way to achieve what
follows from almost no assumptions well
that does raise the question why their
order exists at all if it's not used in
the computations that deal with the core
of the Galilean challenge no they
construct the basic property this
instruction is an infinite number of
expressions that capture the thoughts
that we have weakened if linguistic
interpretation too well the answer that
pretty obvious the newer exist because
that's what the articulatory system
requires but of course the articulatory
system has actually nothing to do with
language that was sensorimotor systems
were a place probably millions of years
certain hundreds of thousands of years
before language ever developed and
they've never changed only the most
marginal changes have been speculated
about changes new particular to our
system so when we studied linear order
we're in fact studying the system which
has nothing to with language but work to
be more put it differently we are
studying an amalgam of consistence one
of them language which shields
expression thought another a separate
system the sensorimotor system has made
big money which mr. Maldon was
consistent
that's the externalization problem try
to relate to independent systems both of
the processing problem to relate to
independent systems notice in the case
of sign which that's right now knows
essentially equivalent spoken language
any interesting math better but there's
a different dimension sign language can
use the dimensionality of visual space
so it doesn't strip and keep the linear
world
it uses the points in space will even
the simultaneous actions like the facial
gestures - with signs and that's not
possible so it has a kind of a
multidimensionality the spoken language
doesn't have and doesn't strictly keep
the linear unless you think about it
it's very natural to expect that when
you're studying the amalgam of two
independent systems
that's things now two independent
systems can be related it's going to be
pretty complex but also there are many
different ways to solve
the protein I thought it would lead to
most expected vehicle changed pretty
quickly from generation to generation
and it seems increasingly plausible that
the current variety and complexity and
the mutability of human languages
probably is located in the
externalization system meaning it's not
strictly speaking language mama could
turn out and one over to try to see us
listen we can approach but turn out that
the core by language the part that's
creating that's meeting the basic
property constructing an infinite array
of structure of expressions giving them
a semantic interpretation it could be
that this is uniform among people and
actually noticed that that's pretty much
presupposed by the world in formal
semantics nobody suggests that there
were rameters photos they knew they were
tuning in the event developers it works
but let's just tacitly assume that it's
University which makes good sense
because there's almost no evidence for
it the child doesn't actually know
events about these things were so it's
shorts gotta be universal none that's
very likely true for most of syntax as
well maybe water so one potential gold
and think about trying to approach it's
too sure that poor on language is just
fixed and that the variety mutability
complexity is in the trying to put
together two different systems that have
nothing to do with that kind of an odd
conclusion follows this is correct
namely that virtually all the work on
language in the last 2,500 years
it isn't about language it's about
connection between language and some
other system also follows that the word
for language this
misleaded what's called language in the
various languages is usually something
about the mouth the tongue the lips
which is really about the sensory motor
system one of those nested motor systems
so I think that kind of a rethinking of
the nature of the field means to be
merged when you think seriously about
the galilean challenge well it's I mean
just getting to the point of current
researchers it is possible to show that
fundamental operation merge has the
number of problems one is it isn't
sufficient they need other operations
what easy to show that we would like to
be able to show that these other
operations are essentially consequences
of the need to meet satisfied conditions
of computational efficiency and there's
interesting work in that direction it's
a large intriguing test to establish
that inclusion firmly but there is there
steps in that direction and also there
are interesting questions when you look
at merge itself but the fundamental
operation it turns out that it was
defined much much too loosely that was
defined in such a way that many sub
cases can be imagined that which appear
to give that's interesting descriptions
of many phenomena like across-the-board
movement someone but these operations
these extensions are fundamentally
illegitimate as you can see when you
begin to explore them closely and look
at their consequences and that's another
direction in which current research is
going it's of course an enormous task or
challenging test to try to show that the
tremendous array of
evidence about the languages of widely
varying typology Canon all of this
exploded since the study of other
languages again basically posing
questions that couldn't have even
certainly could have been formulated
couldn't even imagine some years ago so
try to but the ones being discussed in
this conference for example so to try to
show that those can all be given genuine
explanations
that's quite a serious challenge and
makes the field work very interesting
