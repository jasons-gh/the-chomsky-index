it's really not something I care about
very much I don't like things to be
personalized I mean there are ideas that
I hope people will regard as significant
develop incorporate into their own
thinking and pursue further and that's
what matters whether a name is
associated with it or not is
insignificant the kind we've been
discussing left libertarian conceptions
of how society should be organized which
I think have deep roots and the
Enlightenment and have been developed
since and on the other side the pursuit
of the deep problems about the
fundamental character of human cognitive
nature or what its roots are evolved how
it functions well how it differentiates
humans as a group because they're not
divided from the rest of the animal
world I think these are fundamental
issues that have to be that should be
pursued and developed and I hope they
are
but whether my name is associated with
or not I couldn't care less
