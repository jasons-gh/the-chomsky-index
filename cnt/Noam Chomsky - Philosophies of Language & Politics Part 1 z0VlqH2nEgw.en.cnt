good evening and welcome to tonight's
meeting of the Commonwealth Club of
California you can find the club on the
Internet at Commonwealth Club org I'm
Larry been ski former national affairs
correspondent for Pacifica Radio and
former host sunday salon on Pacifica
stations KPFA in berkeley and kpfk Los
Angeles I've also been a college teacher
for 20 years at Stanford Cal State
University East Bay in Berkeley City
College and i'm moderating tonight's
program it's an honor and a privilege
and a pleasure to be here tonight with
someone I spoke with on the radio many
times over the years dr. noam chomsky
institute professor and professor
emeritus of linguistics at the
massachusetts institute of technology
and author most recently of the
anthology the essential Chomsky welcome
to the Commonwealth Club Noam Chomsky
that book the central Chomsky is one of
an astonishing total of ninety five
titles that Noam Chomsky has authored or
co-authored mostly offered over his long
and distinguished career his academic
background is of course in linguistics
which he studied and taught at MIT since
first joining that distinguished
institution in 1955 dr. Chomsky has
received no fewer than 33 honorary
degrees and has spoken to major
audiences and conferences all over the
world I first met him sometime in the
early 1970s when he and I were both
participating in a rally opposing United
States government intervention in
Vietnam and will be I'm sure discussing
that era and its relation to the
contemporary era tonight first though I
wanted to begin by asking you know'm and
I'm going to presume the gnome that out
of a full sense of familiarity but
because we do go back aways there was an
article the other day in the new york
times you may have seen the headline MIT
taking student blogs to nth degree and a
student was quoted in paragraph two is
saying MIT is the closest you can get to
living in the Internet as you know
there's a great deal of pulling of hair
and gnashing of teeth on the part of
journalists and journalism people these
days about the decline and disappearance
of newspapers the shrinking content of
newspapers are we going through a phase
where so much attention is changing from
the traditional means of information
delivery to something else that we
should be concerned that something vital
to democracy is being lost or is this
just another transformation as we see
from time to time over the centuries in
the way that people get information from
each other I think something's being
lost we can all you know put up blogs on
the internet and express our opinion
it's a good thing but there has to be
there have to be foreign bureaus doing
inquiry and domestic viewers somebody's
got to be researching
now I don't necessarily admire the way
the major media do it I think there are
plenty of flaws in that but nevertheless
it is the source of information that
can't be duplicated by people that there
are computers they can you can get
access to a wide range of information
but you know even even that is based on
reporters on the ground and if they're
gone a lot is gone that can't be
replaced but nevertheless the bloggers
at MIT or people in this room or people
listening to us on the radio now have
access to a greater range of contact
with other human beings on the planet
all over the place and can get input and
information that you have so eloquently
written about over the years is filtered
out of the mainstream media it's
filtered out but contact with people on
the ground is not going to replace that
I mean if there are many things that are
happening right now they're critically
important that you can't find in the
major media I could give examples but
contacting people in other countries is
not going to provide that information
well let's say suddenly you were
knighted as editor of a major media
organization what would some of those
places be that you would want to see
more reporting done for me well I see
you have something there about Willie
ran get a bomb yeah okay there's a there
are countries lasted me I read news wien
Newsweek somewhere yeah the I mean it's
good question whether we could discuss
that question whether a ran will get a
bomb but they're much more important
questions for example a a couple of
about a week ago here's something I
learned because I was in mexico in
mexico they have extremely good
newspaper la jornada i may be the only
real independent newspaper in the
hemisphere
they happen to run a wire service report
which turns out is all over the wire
services which has not been reported
here to my knowledge namely that the
International Atomic Energy Agency
passed a resolution not about Iran that
was the ones we hear about usually
inaccurately but they passed a
resolution calling on Israel to join the
non-proliferation treaty and to open up
its its facility nuclear facilities to
inspection well the United States and
the European Union tried to block it and
when they failed the block it they voted
against it but it passed anyway well
that's really important news especially
with the hysteria about maybe Iran is
concealing something there was a report
two or three days ago in The Washington
Times that President Obama had assured
Israel that they wouldn't have to react
to this and of course they rejected it
now that's important news or on the same
issue that are is Iran concealing
something there are other countries
nuclear powers that aren't concealing
except that it isn't reported here far
as I could tell so for example of the
the Security Council passed a resolution
maybe a week or ten days ago which was
treated here as a great a victory
victory for Obama direct resolution
directed against Iran actually if you
read the resolution that's it was
directed against the United States
Israel India and Pakistan but that's
another question that that you can find
out on the internet by looking up the
resolution however what's harder to find
out is that India a nuclear power it
greeted the resolution by announcing
publicly and proudly that it can now
produce
nuclear weapons with a yield comparable
to that of the superb of the of the
United States and Russia well that's
quite significant they're not concealing
actually that if you really study the
internet carefully you could find it was
reported in the front page in fact of
the London Financial Times major
business journal in the world so it
can't be that the news viewers don't
know it and there's more that isn't
discussed but you can discover but it
takes research all of these countries
Israel India that there are three
countries that have never signed the
non-proliferation treaty India Pakistan
in Israel in each case their nuclear
weapons programs are have been
significantly aided by the United States
in the case of Pakistan maybe sometimes
called the most dangerous country in the
world with some merit its nuclear
programs are a gift to the world by your
former governor Ronald Reagan his
administration pretended of course
pretended that they didn't know that
Pakistan was developing nuclear weapons
in the 1980s because they wanted to
maintain their massive support for the
dictatorship of zeal Huck who was the
worst most vicious dictator in
Pakistan's history and was also carrying
out a kind of a radical Islam ization of
the country with Saudi and us port and
we know the consequences of that we're
living with the consequences of that
well what about India is really love to
talk about it's obvious in the case of
India lat you'll may recall just about a
year ago of the u.s. signed a entered
into a treaty with India which
effectively authorizes Indian nuclear
weapons production that's what the works
not the wording the wording says
in the though not a signer of the
non-proliferation treaty can override
the international restrictions and can
gain access to nuclear technology from
us from France from others and of course
that transfers very readily into nuclear
weapons production so here we have
threesome countries that have never
signed the non-proliferation treaty in
each case their nuclear powers in each
case they're pretty openly proceeding to
defy international organizations the
international monitoring organization
the IAEA announcing that their programs
are moving long fast and and in each
case they're supported by the United
States well you know it takes work to
discover those things theoretically you
could find them through the internet but
with massive research and that's true
for every issue you look at I mean
unless you could get around the failure
of media to present this information if
there were live active organizations
which could work together and you know
we didn't find out the information and
circulated discuss it discover the
backgrounds and so on but in the absence
of an organized public or many kinds of
organization individuals on their own
that can't face this well we do have
live organized people in this country as
we've seen over the past few months but
they're not the live organized people
that you and I grew up belonging to and
being active with they are live
organized people who mostly are
responding to calls from right-wing
commercial radio station commentators
and television hosts
who are doing things like protesting
against taxation against the government
against what they call socialism against
the Obama health care plan whatever they
think of it as what do you make of this
kind of what Pat Buchanan once called
peasants with pitchforks approach to
public policy coming from the right in
the streets and in the media of this
country with a certain amount of
vehemence and a certain following as
well that were I don't know how many
people but it seemed to me from looking
at television coverage maybe a couple
hundred thousand people who marched in
Washington a couple of weeks ago under
various banners of the right what do you
make of this and the implications for
small d democratic government in the
United States all right I think the
implications are dangerous but it's easy
to ridicule them you don't look at the
crazy things they say you want to kill
my grandmother you know and so on and
there's a lot of nonsense that's true
but what we really ought to be asking
ourselves is why the peace movement the
left the activist organizations aren't
organizing these people a lot of what
they're protesting is is pretty sensible
I'm a lot of the protests for example or
against the bailout the massive bailout
you know they feel that they were
betrayed they pressured worked very hard
to prevent it two minutes later they got
it and why should the you know bankers
end up from the recession more powerful
than they were before which is what's
happening you can read it in the
business breasts they're exulting about
it the more powerful and they were
before they're the big banks are even
bigger than they were the government
insurance policy the too big to fail
insurance policy is guaranteeing them
that they can continue doing exactly
what they were doing which tanked the
economy they can take risky make
ski loans and investments since it's
risky they'll make a lot of profit money
coming out of the rears if it collapses
the taxpayer will come in and bill
amount was it too big to fail bonuses
and profits are going through the roof
and meanwhile people are suffering well
they have a reason to protest that and
but but the tragedy is that the protests
are and many other things the protests
are being organized by pretty much the
same sectors that are creating the
crisis I'm the corporate money that's
behind them is the ones who are very
happy that it's coming out like this and
I and the the as a real failure of the
activist movements the left the peace
movement so on but we're not organizing
I think that's the question we ought to
ask and there are other things I mean
there are historical memories that are
awakened you don't want to draw
analogies too closely but there's some
similarities which are not encouraging
certainly for someone my age these
people have real grievances I mean I
have not seen a demographic analysis of
you know those who call in on talk shows
but I listen to them a lot and they're
interesting I mean if you sort of
suspend disbelief you forget about
reality of the world and just listen
it's not a joke if you listen the
message that comes across this has an
internal logic to it it's coherent it
gives answers to people who want answers
and need them and deserve them they're
crazy answers but they're not hearing
any others I mean these are people
who've you know are there done
everything right you know Christian God
fearing and take care of their families
and and forth for 30 years they've been
shafted
but somebody's got to give him an answer
of why the media has always had the
function in this country of suspension
of disbelief but that has traditionally
been called entertainment what you're
saying is the suspension of disbelief
has we've left edward r murrow behind a
long time ago that firewall between the
entertainment the Jack Benny part and
Milton Berle part of media for those of
you who go back that far and the edward
r murrow part of media that wall has
come down and what you're now saying is
that the suspension of disbelief is a
characteristic of especially broadcast
media in all of its domains supposed
entertainment infotainment and
information that's happening but I don't
really think that's the main problem I
was not a great admirer of the media in
the earlier period I have a pretty awful
in many ways I think they're better now
than they were 30 40 years ago because
the country is better so we're civilized
country the media reflect that I think
I'm not really thinking about the
entertainment aspect of the media though
yes it's significant I'm thinking about
the part that has a substantive content
crazy content but it is substantive it
does give answers I mean to people who
for the last 30 years have seen their
wages income stagnate or decline
benefits decline services decline there
is nothing for the children you know
worlds out of control these are the
people who on poles maybe eighty percent
of them say the country's going in the
wrong direction the government's run by
the few and the special interests not
the people and so on you know they're
not wrong this is all happening to them
and the answers that they're getting
from say you know Rush Limbaugh Michael
Savage the rest of them
or well we have an answer the rich
liberals own everything they own the
corporation's they run the government
they run the media and they don't care
about people like you they don't care
about the flyover people between the
East Coast and the west coast they only
care about giving everything you work
for a way to you know to illegal
immigrants or gays or something so we
got to protect ourselves from them and
furthermore they run the government when
they put up a health program it's not to
give you health it's to kill your granny
no and that's an answer to something
it's a terrible answer but it is an
answer and if you do suspend disbelief
you forget about what's happening in the
world really it's a coherent answer now
they're not hearing anything else and
the memory that comes to my mind again I
don't press the analogy too hard but I
think it's worth thinking about is late
by mar Germany there were people with
real grievances the Nazis gave him an
answer it's the fault of the Jews and
the Bolsheviks and we got to protect
ourselves from them and that'll take
care of grievances and we know what
happened that Germany in the 1920s was
you know the most civil I the peak of
Western civilization and in the arts and
the sciences highly democratic
functioning democratic institutions a
decade later it was in the pits of human
history but again the analogy is not
it's not close but it's frightening and
unless an answer can be given to these
people unless they can be led to
understand what's really happening
through them we could be in for trouble
well let me ask you about the trouble
that we may be in for as a race on this
planet not just as a civil
asian in the United States your
linguistic approach is sometimes summed
up as emphasizing an innate set of
linguistic principles shared by all
humans do we also have in an eight cents
do you think of principles social
principles are we inclined towards
violence are we inclined towards fascism
are we inclined towards democracy are we
inclined towards anything or are those
social constructs that can be altered by
governments and by media and by general
social forces well just as background we
ought to bear in mind that not very much
is understood about these topics
studying human beings are very complex
objects it's hard enough to figure out
what the nature of insects is and when
you get to humans much much harder and
science has very little say about this
some suggestions but not a lot however
history tells us a lot and history tells
us that we have all those
characteristics and we've seen it you
know again take Germany it was the same
genes in the 1920s and the 1930s but
there are very different societies in
fact almost opposite extremes of human
possibility possibility and each one of
us you know has those characteristics I
mean every one of us could be a saint
could be a sinner and usually something
in between and circumstances and
conditions make a big difference now you
mentioned before that's take something
concrete you mentioned before correctly
that the protesters the right-wing
protesters are denouncing government
where does that come from since the
Second World War there has been a
massive propaganda campaign huge
propaganda campaign run by the by the
business world to try to make people
hate government
but it's ambivalent because at the same
time those same sectors want a strong
government powerful state when the works
for them when they're trying to get
people to hate government they want them
to hate things like services that the
government provides for the population
but they're not opposed to the
government the powerful government that
works for them and it takes a Ronald
Reagan again he's called a conservative
but that's ridiculous he was the most
protectionists president and post-war
American history he virtually doubled
protective barriers to try to protect
incompetent us management from being
overrun by at that time Japanese
competitors he government actually grew
under on his watch he was an advocate of
big government but big government that
serves the rich and the powerful and he
left the country with a huge deficit a
Christ a major crisis the savings and
loan crisis you know not quite as bad as
this one but pretty severe dude it began
to deregulation all in the interests of
concentrated sectors of power he also
initiated he sort of pressed forward the
program of massive incarceration of poor
and defenseless people turns out mostly
blacks so the incarceration rate when he
came in was approximately the same as
Europe but maybe a little to the high
end by the time he was gone was out of
sight it increased further under st.
tendencies increased under Clinton
they're still going on but Reagan drove
it that way actually and you mentioned
something about the internet before
where'd that come from I mean that
didn't come from private enterprise that
come from state intervention in the
economy it was Pentagon supported
factors developed right white was at MIT
same as computers
same with lasers containers that are the
basis of trade micro electronics
biotechnology are you saying technology
is value neutral basically when its
amended right were created well you know
in a sense its value neutral but in a
society that had no structure it would
be valued neutral but anxiety that has
structure yeah it's not valued the true
but it didn't come I mean to a
substantial extent it came from a
powerful state intervening in the
economy and pursuing a program which
amounts to is pretty close to saying
that the public pays the costs and it
takes the risks and eventual profit is
privatized well that's big government
and you can be sure that the corporate
sponsors of the right-wing movements I
want to stop that they want to keep it
going just as they admire Reagan you
know there st. listening to the
Commonwealth Club of California radio
program I'm Larry been ski we're talking
today with famed linguist political
activist and author dr. Noam Chomsky
Noam Chomsky along the lines of what you
were just saying you wrote a number of
years ago we cannot say much about human
affairs with any confidence but
sometimes it's possible we can for
example be fairly confident that either
there will be a world without war or
there won't be a world at least a world
inhabited by creatures other than
bacteria and beetles with some
scattering of others you may delusion
before to your age your generation do
you think we've gotten any closer over
the course of your lifetime to a world
without war or are we on the doomsday
clock ticking most mostly towards
midnight well I think their tendencies
in both direction and the future of the
species depend on which of those prevail
so what I said before mentioned before
about the escalation of nuclear weapons
well that's one of many aspects of a
tendency towards destroy
sure on the other hand we are a much
more civilized society than we were say
40 years ago what do you mean by
civilized well take some examples take
the last election 2008 I didn't happen
to like any of the candidates but 40
years ago or for that matter 10 years
ago it would have been unimaginable
unthinkable that the Democratic Party
would have two candidates a woman and an
african-american that's because of
changes in the society the civil rights
movement the women's movement the
environmental movement the anti-nuclear
movement the opposition's of aggression
which is much stronger than it was then
and has in an inhibitory effect let's
just compare that all of this comes out
of the activism of the 60s which is why
it's so denounced and can end it was
making the society more civilized and
more democratic so of course it's
condemn takes a aggression compare the
Vietnam War in the Iraq word ok the the
Iraq war was bad enough but it's I think
the first war in history that was
massively protested before it was
officially launched I say officially
because we later learned that bush and
Blair had already started the war but we
didn't know at the time anyway it was
massively protested before it was
officially launched and that large-scale
protest has had an effect the US did not
apply and could not apply the tactics it
applied in Indochina they simply
wouldn't have been tolerated by the
population so there's no saturation
bombing there's no chemical warfare that
there's no you know the sending half
million troops to the country is no
driving people into concentration camp
but there were four million people who
left Iraq under duress it was several
hundred thousand who were killed but
probably several million who will suffer
psychological consequences better than
the rest of their
yeah it's bad enough but it could have
been worse and the indochina was much
worse and consider the and in fact in
Iraq though it's not the way it's
presented in the media but if you think
about it the United States had this
steadily backed down from its war aims
the US government fought tooth and nail
to prevent elections but they were
forced to permit them they saw had all
kind of schemes to make it you know turn
it into let it be run by proconsuls
they're forced to accept elections they
tried to prevent the elected government
from moving in a nationalistic direction
they failed as late as november two
thousand seven just two years ago the
bush administration announced its
effectively announced its warnings there
were crucial parts were that the US
would have to be a lot permitted a
permanent military presence of
unspecified scale in iraq and that the
country should be open to investment
privileges US investors that's november
two thousand seven that's the bush
declaration which I think was reported
in the press but you can find it on the
internet which it was the the proposal
for the status of forces agreement well
they had to back down at least formally
at least formally there's no permanent
military presence formally there's they
haven't ram through the kind of
investment law they wanted that's pretty
significant it's in the government is
not giving up obama we can go into that
but before that just compare it with the
60s i mean in the 1960s there was so
little protest against the vietnam war
that most people don't even know when it
was launched it happens that in 1962
john f kennedy sent the US air force to
start bombing south vietnam
authorised chemical warfare to destroy
crops and ground cover started
authorized napalm started programs which
ultimately drove millions of people into
what were called strategic Hamlet's
basically concentration camps to try to
separate them from the guerrillas who
the government knew they were willingly
supported protest was virtually zero I
mean I remember giving talks to four
people in a church and the minister the
organizer drunk who walked in off the
street and somebody wanted to kill me
you know and that went on for years but
that's why you and I were involved in
things called teach-ins which
