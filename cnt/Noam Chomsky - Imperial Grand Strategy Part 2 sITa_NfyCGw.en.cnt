the faith of the indigenous population
of the United States is a clear example
of how violence can succeed from the
moment that crazed religious fanatics
from England landed in what is now the
United States and began slaughtering the
Amalekites
that sort of thing from then on as they
spread through the continent just
exterminated millions of people and it
succeeded it's kind of interesting to
see how that success is treated as well
there's time for that
so yes violence can succeed but often at
a tremendous cost or violence can elicit
more violence plenty of examples of that
two examples I just gave including the
invasion of Iraq or some but they're
much more important ones right now
current ones so take this this one is
vastly more important two months ago the
Russia carried out its largest military
exercises in two decades they displayed
new more sophisticated weapons of mass
destruction targeting the United States
Europe and the Russian leaders made it
clear that this was a direct response to
Bush administration aggressiveness and
militancy for closing year's term
exactly as had been predicted it's not
like it's predicted right away that
there's going to lead to a Russian
response and it has one prime concern
that the Russian generals expressed was
Washington's current development of what
are called low-yield nuclear weapons
popularly called bunker busters the
russians can figure out just as well as
US strategic analysts do that these
weapons are designed to destroy russian
command centers which are hidden inside
mountains just like
the American ones and could
theoretically be destroyed by deep
penetration
low-yield bunker busters that would
destroy their nuclear arsenal
Washington's insistence on using space
for military purposes this again
unilateral with this includes
devastating first strike is another
major concern of Russian planners the
other reacting as you'd expect and was
as was predicted by building up their
offensive military capacity u.s.
analysts suspect that the Russians are
now duplicating the u.s. development of
hypersonic cruise vehicles these are
these can orbit space they can orbit in
space at a low altitude right outside
the Earth's atmosphere and they can
instantly penetrate the Earth's
atmosphere delivering a devastating
attack anywhere without any warning and
the Russians are probably duplicating a
u.s. analysts also estimate that Russian
military expenditures have approximately
tripled in the bush Putin years so in
fact there may be some truth to what
Bush described as his gut reaction when
he met Putin for the first time and he
looked into his eyes and he saw that
they were soul mates perhaps they are
the Russians have also formally adopted
Bush's doctrine of so-called preemptive
strike
meaning aggression at will that's the
revolutionary new doctrine of the
national security strategy they are also
relying on automated response systems in
the past we know that these have come
literally within minutes of launching a
nuclear strike barely aborted by human
intervention by now the systems have
deteriorated with the collapse of the
Russian economy
the market fanaticism of the last 10
years well we know a lot about the us
systems of the u.s. automated systems
allow three minutes for human judgment
after computers warn of a missile attack
and that's a daily occurrence so every
day is three minute period which you've
discussed whether allow the world to be
blown up or done after that you'll be
happy to know comes a 30-second
presidential press briefing after the
three minutes the Pentagon has also
found the very serious design flaws in
the computer systems computer security
systems this will surprise absolutely no
one who has any acquaintance with
complicated the software and the
computers infects that matter anybody
has a computer so it's known that are
going to be designed flaws and they've
found them the but this is a lot worse
than your hard disk crashing movor
that errors and the computer security
systems could allow terrorist hackers to
break in and simulate a launch
that's called an accident waiting to
happen
by US strategic analysts and the Russian
systems are far less reliable well the
dangers are very severe and they're
being consciously escalated by the
threat and use of violence and here
we're talking about real threats to
survival of the species this is not
thousands of people being killed but
they're being consciously escalated
because of the priorities which are
rational in their own terms right now
the the u.s. is deploying what's called
a missile defense system in Alaska the
it's it's being it's coming under
criticism the criticism is
it's obviously a political gesture time
for the election and that it's using an
untested technology which probably won't
work at a immense cost or well that may
be correct but there's a much more
fundamental criticism of the fundamental
criticism is that it might work or it
might look as though it's gonna work and
opponents have to make a worst-case
analysis so it looks as if it might work
they are going to have to take
countermeasures and the countermeasures
will be massively building-up means too
overwhelming you have to understand that
that the Chinese and the Russians
understand just as well as US analysts
and were open about it that missile
defense is a first-strike weapon it's
what they call a sword not a shield it
expands the domain of freedom of
aggression including first strike and
that's the way the US has reacted in the
past they recently Declassified records
about the u.s. reaction to Russia's
deployment of a very small limited ABM
system around Moscow in 1968 and as you
predict the u.s. responded to that by
targeting it with nuclear weapons
targeting the outline Rhaegar sprayed
our sights with nuclear weapons this is
a much more serious system than the
reaction will be even more extreme
especially for the Chinese China has a
very limited deterrent a couple of dozen
missiles and this would if it'll even
looks like it's gonna work will
eliminate the credibility of that so
they're gonna have to massively expand
it
well if China expands its offensive
military capacity India is going to
react to that and Pakistan will respond
India is doing it and you get a ripple
effect that goes on vastly increasing
the threat to all of us that particular
part is discussed and is indeed
dangerous
what is not discussed however is the
threat from West Asia now it is
discussed internally so the US Strategic
Command the planning agency for nuclear
weapons its former head generally butler
describes Israel's weapons of mass
destruction nuclear weapons and other
weapons of mass destruction he describes
it as dangerous in the extreme both of
because of the threat that it poses and
because it incites proliferation and
response actually the Bush
administration is now enhancing that
threat Israel already has its Air Force
is larger and technologically more
advanced than any native power other
than the US according to its own
estimate it's not because it's real so
powerful it's because it's an offshore
US military base in effect so their Air
Force is already more powerful than
saying Britons or any other native power
and the United States is now sending
them over a hundred of the most advanced
jet bombers f-16 eyes with the
announcement that they can wonder that
their capability they're capable of
flying dude Iran and back they also
announced that these are updated
versions of the f-16 that is really used
to bomb the Iraqi nuclear reactor the
was a rock reactor in 1981 there's a
kind of a story about that that the
Israeli bombing deterred Saddam's
nuclear weapons program it was known
right away that that's not true
the ozerov reactor was inspected by the
head of Harvard's physics department
immediately as a nuclear power
specialist and he reported in nature of
the world
main science journal that it's just not
designed for nuclear weapons however we
now know from the factors and other
evidence that it did initiate directs
nuclear weapons program another
indication of the standard cycle of
violence inducing violence
well the Israeli press in their Hebrew
versions they don't translate this into
English adds that the United States is
now providing the Israeli Air Force with
what they call special weapons you can
guess what they are
but you can figure out what Iranian
intelligence assumes this is all aimed
Iranian intelligence who of course read
this material they are gonna have to
make a worst-case analysis you can
figure it out I'm not telling you
perhaps the purpose is to incite some
Iranian action that will be a pretext
for an attack perhaps it's just a rattle
the leadership and to contribute to
internal conflict or chaos but whatever
it is it's obviously seriously
increasing threats which at this level
or becoming threats to survival
well the collapse of the pretext for
invading Iraq are quite familiar but not
enough attention has been paid I think
to the most important consequence of the
collapse of the pretexts of Blair and
Bush and others the original pretext was
that the US has the right to attack a
country if it has links to terror and is
developing weapons of mass destruction
they can't say that any more
and there's a new doctrine that has been
proposed which increases expands the
right of aggression the links to terror
have been dropped and it is now no
longer necessary for a country to have
weapons of mass destruction or even
programs for developing but to have
including the official story from Colin
Powell and others it's enough that the
country have the intent and ability to
develop weapons of mass destruction
okay who has the ability any country
that has a high school chemistry and
biology that has the ability to develop
weapons of mass destruction who has the
intent well whatever
Tony Blair Jack Straw and their American
associates say what that translate that
into simple language it means anybody is
subject to attack instant devastating
unwarned attack at any moment if they
just disobey orders that's the new
doctrine far more expensive than the old
one and new military programs are being
developed to enhance the capacity to
carry this out I say extremely important
one was announced immediately after the
national security strategy released in
September 2002 plans were announced
right away to with regard to
militarization of space to shift from
the Clinton doctrine the Clinton
doctrine was that the US must control
space to shift from that to a new
doctrine from control of space to what's
called ownership of space ownership of
space means instant engagement anywhere
in the world from space by putting the
any part of the world at risk of instant
destruction
thanks to sophisticated surveillance
systems and lethal weaponry that's going
to be placed in space
at home well that's quite an accord with
the national security strategy control
isn't done go on the ownership well the
world's intelligence agencies can read
the Air Force Space Command strategic
master plan from which I've just been in
quoting as easily as I can or more
easily and they'll draw the natural
conclusions you can figure out what they
will be that increases the risks to all
of us a very severe risk the collapse of
the pretexts did lead to a new doctrine
actually it's not called a doctor and
it's called a vision actually it's
called a messianic visions by the u.s.
press turns out that the war in Iraq was
inspired by the president's messianic
vision to bring democracy to Iraq and to
the whole region and the president
affirmed the vision in a presidential
address last November well it was
interesting to see the reaction read as
much as I could about it in England too
but mostly the u.s. the reaction ranged
from at one end just rapturous or the
leading veteran correspondent of The
Washington Post the former editor the
International Herald Tribune
concluded breathlessly that that shows
that the Iraq invasion was the noblest
war in history because it was inspired
by a messianic vision there were those
who criticize the doctrine the vision
namely that it's beyond their means it's
generous and Noble but beyond our means
the beneficiaries aren't worth it the
two backward others may not share our
nobility and altruism and such problems
that this is the motive for the invasion
is proposed isn't even discuss it's just
presupposed in news reporting and
commentary and then you're either
critical or you in all the few as a
research project you might look for the
evidence that this is the reason it
turns out that the evidence reduces the
one fact our leader announced it
therefore it is true period North Korea
couldn't do better just check that out
and see if it's true also to accept that
this is the motive requires suppressing
your knowledge that if that's the motive
bush and Blair must be appling the most
astounding Liars and history because
when they mobilize the world for war
tried to there was a single question
that does is Iraq gonna live up to
getting rid of its weapons of mass
destruction it turns out they're now
saying that was a total lie the real
reason was our messianic vision and
we're supposed to accept that as gospel
truth and sort of forget the fact that
the people who were telling it to us are
also telling us they're among the most
extreme Liars ever but properly educated
intellectual class is quite capable of
this and couldn't check for yourself
I've yet to find that I had not found an
exception with considerable surge except
way out on the margins actually there is
one exception one glaring exception a
few days after the president revealed
his vision the Washington Post published
the results of the u.s. run Cole and
Baghdad won
I mentioned before people were asked why
they thought the u.s. invaded Iraq and
there were some who agreed with roughly
a hundred percent of articulate Western
opinion and mainly that the goal is to
bring democracy to Iraq in Baghdad one
percent agree with that five percent
thought that the goal was to help the
Iraqis this is last October way before
all of the latest revelations and the
rest said the obvious what I already
mentioned the view that's the idea
that's inexpressible in the West
well Iraqis don't have to know American
history to understand what the noble
vision means no we can look at that
history and find it out but they don't
have to they know their own history
that's enough so for example they know
that England created Iraq modern Iraq
drew its borders and created it so that
England not Turkey would get control of
the oil in the northern area and also
that Iraq would have to be independent
because they would have no access to the
sea that's why the principality of quake
was carved out so that's the way it was
created they know that the England also
had the noble visions messianic visions
Iraq was independent had a constitution
you know Parliament had all sorts of
nice things meanwhile the British
Foreign Office and Lord Curzon's were
carrying out their own plans which were
the classes released 60 years later
England's much slower than the United
States but they're there it turns out
that they were doing what you'd expect
their plan was to that Iraq and other
countries of the region there should be
what they call an Arab facade that
Britain would rule behind various
constitutional
fiction's see that conception was just
recorded two or three days ago by a
senior British official who said that
after the turnover of sovereignty
through Iraq on June 30th Iraq will have
full sovereignty but in practice it
won't exercise it fully that's familiar
Arab facade that we ruled behind various
constitutional fictions and the Iraqis
didn't need the British Foreign Office
records to know this they know it from
their own experience like the people at
the wrong end of the clubs typically and
furthermore they can see what is now
happening right in front of their eyes
so the United States is building the
world's biggest embassy in Baghdad
sensitively using one of Saddam's main
royal main palaces to house it the head
of the embassy the new ambassador is
John Negroponte II when he was appointed
the Wall Street Journal had a good
article about him in which it says he
called him a modern proconsul and he
said that Wolfowitz learned his trade as
a proconsul under the during the Reagan
ID phase of the current administration
in Washington when he was ambassador to
Honduras presiding over the second
largest embassy in Latin America and the
biggest CIA station in the world
not because Honduras is such a center of
world power but because his
responsibility as proconsul which is
what he was called in Honduras his
responsibility was to supervise the
military bases from which the u.s.
mercenary army was carrying out a murca
destructive murderous terrorist war
against Nicaragua to stop another effort
at successful defiance practically
destroyed the country but it's regarded
as a grand success
because now they
no more successful defiance that was his
job in Honduras so he learned his trade
as a proconsul that led to the United
States being brought to the world court
condemned by the world Court for
international terrorism order to
terminate the crime after which the
current incumbents in Washington
including the moderates Colin Powell
escalated the crime they were ordered to
pay retribution and reparations huge
reparations you know what happened to
that when the u.s. refused Nicaragua
took at the Security Council there were
two resolutions in which the Security
Council supported the restated and
support of the World Court judgment and
called on all states to observe
international law they were vetoed by
the United States with Britain politely
abstaining and they're out of history
because they say the wrong thing like
terror against other people
well that's neighbor potties history and
he's perfectly qualified to run the
world's biggest embassy in the world in
Iraq in order to transfer sovereignty to
Iraqis we're told okay you can decide
whether you want to believe that Iraqis
can also see as we all can if we won
that the u.s. is insistent on keeping
military bases and military forces
essentially permanently and as Paul
Wolfowitz
puts it only a stable prolonged US troop
presence and a weak Iraqi army will be
able allow
to nurture democracy in Iraq okay you
can decide what you think about that
Wolfowitz incidentally is called the
idealist in chief of the Bush
administration the visionary leading the
crusade for democracy if there were time
there isn't I'd run through his record
which is intriguing there's rarely
rarely find anyone with a record of such
a visceral hatred of democracy and
support for tyranny shown in case after
case but put that aside the it doesn't
matter for the messianic vision that
Iraqis overwhelmingly want
Iraqis to be in charge of security not
all again so 7% of Iraqis want US forces
to be in charge five percent want the
u.s. appointed Governing Council to be
in charge
these are British run polls last October
again now of course it's much worse but
it just doesn't matter six months ago
not now 80% of Iraqis said they had no
confidence in US UK forces or in the
civilian authorities and now of course
much worse
but none of this has any relevance to
the messianic vision well Iraqis can
also observe the economic measures that
are being imposed by the current
proconsul Paul Bremer not answerable to
the Pentagon he they in effect open up
the Iraqi economy and banking system to
effective the u.s. takeover that Britain
will get a few crumbs and honor of its
cooperation the plans were immediately
denounced by Iraqi business leaders who
pointed out that they would be destroyed
Bremer also imposed a 15% top flight tax
which makes Iraq what will make Iraq one
of the least taxed countries in the
world
completely unable to rebuild the
devastated infrastructure from the u.s.
British sanctions and the wars and to
carry out badly needed social spending
that's all gone
Iraqi businesses doesn't like it but
there should be fewer problems with
Iraqi workers the Iraq does have a
militant active labor tradition despite
all the repression but the occupying
army as soon as they moved in took
immediate action to destroy the union's
broke into union offices arrests as the
leaders blocked strikes by force
enforced Saddam Hussein's a brutal and
II labor laws and they're handed over
concessions to bitterly and a union US
businesses these economic proposals
incidentally are completely familiar
those are the kind that created the
third world the third world was
compelled but forced to accept market
discipline the rich countries England
the United States Germany up to Japan
and in East Asia the ones that develop
they just you know they may teach the
rules of those principles and graduate
economics courses but they didn't
observe them they relied on a powerful
powerful state interventions that drive
the economy and protected those are the
ones that grew and develop the ones that
had the principles imposed on them by
force or what we now call the third
world so there's nothing unfamiliar
about the proposals being made for Iraq
well it's an open question whether
Iraqis can be coerced into submitting to
the nominal sovereignty that's offered
under various constitutional fictions
designed by the occupying power to block
true sovereignty it's been astonishing
to see their resistance to this I don't
mean bombs and guns I just which are the
least is it just a steadfast refusal to
accept the
of the occupying powers that has been
extremely impressive and it's forced
them to back down that's one question
for privileged people in the West people
like us
there's a far more important question
and that is whether we will permit our
own governments to nurture their
democracy in the style of idealist in
chief Paul Wolfowitz as in their
traditional domains in fact for a long
time well right at this point crucial
questions arise about the nature of
Western democracies and their future
these are extremely important topics
they're obviously the most important
ones for us and they're important for
everyone because it's quite literally
true that the survival of the species is
at stake and the answers to these
questions but those are for some other
time
if you had one wish what would you say
tell you the honest truth I doubt very
much the George Bush as much to do with
policy formation I mean the way the the
presidency is more or less like royalty
in the United States so the Queen of
England opens Parliament with a speech
right but nobody asks whether she
believes or whether she understands that
her role is to it's a ceremonial role
you present it's a role that's connected
with unity of the people of patriotism
obedience and so on and so forth
the content is something else that's by
people who run the country the people
who run the country are those in
political office but much more
importantly they're associates in the
concentrations of private economic power
that's where the country's really run
and that shouldn't be big security
America's leading social philosopher
John Dewey who's right very mainstream
American he pointed out once that as
long as we have what he called
Industrial feudalism rather than
industrial democracy that means
tyrannical totally totalitarian
institutions of running the economy
command economies basically as long as
that's instead of industrial democracy
like workers control and management as
long as we have that then politics will
be the shadow cast by business over
society and that's approximately
accurate and it's not that the state has
no independent choices it does but an
amalgam exactly the role that George
Bush plays in this is very dubious
questionable in some cases like say
Ronald Reagan he probably didn't even
know what the policies worked he was
reading off his notecards of the
teleprompter or something like that and
Bush may have some knowledge of them but
I think he's mostly a symbolic a
ceremonial figure trained at
certain ways and so on so if I had a
minute with him I would say no have you
talked to God lately or two for texture
if John Kerry wins the presidency who
would make any difference in Iraq and
should Ralph Nader's stand if Terry wins
which I think is unlikely just looking
at the relative funding of the two
candidates and elections are mostly what
it
but suppose he does I doubt if we would
make much of a difference in Iraq I'm
their policies I mean it's very hard to
know what carries policies are I'd be
very careful not to his advice again his
advisers have been very careful not to
formulate them but chances are it would
be more like albright and Clinton that
is same policies but not so stupidly and
arrogantly formulated and implemented
which is a difference and you know in a
huge system of power like the United
States those small differences can
translate into large outcomes the major
difference between the two I think would
be domestic the Bush administration are
real extremists I mean if it's a narrow
political spectrum but they're way out
of an extreme I mean they want to
sympathetic reason and open about it
again they want to dismantle everything
that has been achieved by popular
struggle over the last century
everything from the limited measure
of social welfare you know support
systems pensions minimal medical care to
progressive taxation in fact anybody
name think of they want to create a real
utopia for the Masters a very powerful
state they're not conservatives a very
powerful state which serves the rich and
powerful and somehow controls everybody
else one or another means I mean there
is a kind of a quasi fascist strain
there I like to use the term but it's
there and accept that the fascist did
develop welfare systems and they want to
destroy those and the carry will be less
extreme in this respect justice clinton
was less extreme and those make big
differences to like you know you have a
disabled mother you have to take care of
it makes a difference how extreme the
policies are those differences i think
are significant that gets to the nadir
question my feeling is that it's it
should be a very high priority to keep
Wolfowitz rumsfeld those characters that
prevent them from getting another
mandate if they do they can be extremely
dangerous
in every respect we you know the
difference between militarizing space
under the conception of control and
militarizing it under the conception of
ownership and may be the difference
between survival of the species and non
survival I mean neither is very
attractive but there are differences and
the same is true on the domestic front
to a limited extent elsewhere so I do
think it's a priority Nader doesn't I
mean I like him you known him for a long
time I like what he stands for and does
but I really think he's making the stake
actually what do you ought to do in my
opinion and actually this has been there
are things he couldn't do to be in the
campaign
and not affect the outcome there's some
technical things he could do actually
one of them was proposed by a well-known
constitutional law professor at Yale
University Bruce Anderson and it's a
interesting suggestion in the u.s.
select a system you don't elect people
you elect electors and the electors
elect the people the candidates and that
was part of the original Madisonian
system to try to marginalize the public
and keep power in the hands of the
wealthy now it doesn't have quite that
function but the system is still there
which means that made it could if you
wanted to run but select the Democratic
electors that would mean you're voting
for Nader but the elector is carries
okay so that's a way to run and use the
opportunity to say whatever you want to
bring issues up and so on and so forth
but not affect the election and that's
one way to do it and there are other
ways and my opinion is that's what he
ought to do it's fine to bring up issues
and discuss things and so on and so
forth but to Act two to act so as to
bring back into office the people around
the bush which is exactly what it is
that's just not sensible in my opinion
yeah rah-rah said check from the US
ladies in Newark New Jersey first became
political in Vietnam but in slowly
flying came out earning it and I've been
very active in Manchester and they
stopped the work publishing over 20,000
people on the streets and we're still
going strong yeah but they won't ask you
the difference differences that you
might say between the anti-war movement
in the 60s and the early 70s an anti-war
movement now I think it's it's much more
I'm optimistic people around the world
are talking about a different world now
much more than they were before and I'm
not mr. absolutely I completely agree
with you I mean in the 1960s we kind of
forget but the anti-war movement didn't
exist for years after the war in Vietnam
began literally didn't exist I mean
there was so little opposition to
Kennedy's attack on South Vietnam that
nobody even remembers that it took place
I mean it's a study to find out it took
place but did in 1962 Kennedy sent the
US Air Force to start bombing South
Vietnam initiated the chemical warfare
in South Vietnam which has an estimated
600,000 victims not small started
rounding up people programs to round the
ultimately millions of people in what
amounted the concentration camp and that
then just escalated and there was no
protest at all you know I mean no
American president could even dream of
doing that today and that's because of
the activism that developed later in the
60s and even more so in the 70s and 80s
and 90s which is has changed the country
changed consciousness enormously I mean
finally an anti-war movement did develop
in the United States and it same in
Britain I should say any word act
activism here was extremely low in the
sixties virtually non-existent
I remember very well because I was flown
over by leaders of the anti-war movement
here through the 60s because they needed
somebody to give a talk you know but and
this went on for a long time by the late
60s it had developed that had become big
but kind of narrow it expanded enormous
Lee afterwards I mean the major popular
movements that one thinks of those
movements of the 60s the main ones that
really influenced the society and
changed it are not from the sixties
they're from the 70s and the 80s said
take say the women's movement that
barely existed in the 60s and it really
took off in the 70s it's an enormous
effect on the whole society the
environmental movement didn't exist in
the 60s came later are the anti-nuclear
movements the Solidarity movements are
mostly in the 80s and there by now huge
well you get back to this war this war
is a unique in the history of Europe
hundreds of years European imperialism
including the United States it's first
time in European history or American
history that there was massive protest
against the war before it was launched I
can't think of any historical example of
that where there was any protest against
the war before it was law it's low on
the masses for at this well that's an
indication of very big changes in
popular understanding and consciousness
and it you can be certain that people in
power know it here are other things that
aren't told you told you very often we
can find it if you want the Pentagon
Papers were very interesting and unusual
and that it was not declassified it was
stolen so it's like getting the archives
of a conquered country you know where
they don't have a chance to purify them
so the pentagon papers are rather
revealing the Pentagon Papers run from
late 40s to 1968 the end in 1968 the
last part of the Pentagon Papers is
right after the Tet Offensive the Tet
Offensive in January 1968 convinced
American business elites that the war
isn't worth that they've already won
they've already destroyed South Vietnam
there isn't going to be any successful
to find any effect on others so it's
just a waste of money in time and they
essentially ordered the government
ordered linson Lyndon Johnson to call
the war off he was informed not to run
for office stopped the bombing of North
Vietnam and during the negotiations and
he obediently followed the orders but
after the Tet Offensive right afterwards
Johnson didn't want to send two hundred
thousand more troops to South Vietnam
the Joint Chiefs of Staff objected and
the reasons they objected which are
described in the last pages of the
Pentagon Papers is that they said they
were if they continued the war they
would need those troops in the United
States for civil disorder control
because they would not be able to
control constituencies that were out of
control and they mentioned young people
women minorities others it's not gonna
control so they're gonna need the troops
right in the United States and they
refused to send them well that's
important there was already a record by
that time the military top military one
of the army out they were trying to get
the army out of Vietnam remember then it
was a civilian army it was not a
professional army that's one of the
reasons they shifted to a professional
army which is kind of like a mercenary
army of the disadvantage that's what it
comes out to the United States made a
bad mistake in Vietnam it's the first
time an imperial power tried to fight a
colonial war with a citizens army now
that doesn't work that's why the British
used Gurkhas
you know Indians in Afghanistan and
stuff like that it's why the French have
a Foreign Legion I mean every sensible
imperial power that uses mercenaries
usually local mercenaries from one part
of the country move into another and
that sort of thing but the u.s. tried
the fuff carry out a straight
traditional Imperial war of destruction
with a citizens army and civilians start
I can't do that you know I mean
sometimes they go off the extreme
barbarism but they just can't deal with
this kind of situation you really need
professional killers for that like the
French Foreign Legion I mean they can do
it and in fact civilians are also to
integrated with the home society so
what's going on and say the youth
culture in the United States in the late
sixties it was affecting the soldier I
was getting to the point where soldiers
were killing their officers they were
going off on drugs and this the army
really thought the army is going to
disintegrate and they want him out well
that's another change in 1980 when any
president comes into office first thing
he does is call for an intelligence
analysis of the world situation
obviously usually we don't find out
about it for 30 or 40 years until it
gets Declassified but in 1989 when Bush
number one came in as somebody in the
Pentagon leaked a piece of it or in the
CIA a small piece of that was leaked and
barely published into the air if you
find it it was interesting it had to do
with military interventions specifically
it had to do with what they called wars
against much weaker enemies
