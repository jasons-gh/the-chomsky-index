professor Chomsky how do you see the
future of Balkans and do you see any
difference between approach of this
administration and the previous one and
how that would play in geostrategic view
of the creating of new Europe as
somebody sat in the administration
without naming names I think that this
administration is pursuing roughly the
same policies as the preceding one
circumstances change the policies change
they basically just want to keep the
Balkans quiet don't bother us as long as
the Balkans are quiet not bothering us
integrating themselves into the u.s.
dominated system then is fine do it
every like in fact we now have
interesting information from the highest
level of the Clinton administration the
strobe Talbott it was when top planners
in the strobe Talbott it was the head of
the state Pentagon joint planning group
at the time the cost of a war there was
deputy and State Department who was
designated to be in charge of the joint
state military commission a commission
that dealt with negotiations during
kosovo war he just read the introduction
to a interesting book by his his I think
certain sworn it was in charge of
communications John Norris and in the
book stroke in the introduction stirrup
Talbot says this is the book you should
read if you want to know how we in the
Clinton administration understood the
bombing of Serbia at the highest level
says this is the authoritative account
all right take a look at the book and
you find that Norris says can't quote
the exact words but something like this
I said that the the fundamental reason
for the bombing of Serbia in 1999 was
not concerned not humanitarian concern
for the plight of
albanians it was because Serbia had not
undertaken the appropriate social and
economic reforms meaning it was the one
holdout in the region that had not
accepted the sort of Washington
Consensus type programs well you know
part of that was already obvious I mean
if there's massive evidence from the
State Department NATO OSCE and others
which shows the British parliamentary
inquiry which shows just overwhelmingly
that concern over the humanitarian
concern was lacking they knew perfectly
well there was a ugly level of
atrocities pretty low level kind of
shared between the government and the
guerillas maybe actually the British
government thought it was mostly
guerrillas but they understood that when
they were undertaking the bombing that
was going to escalate the atrocities
sharply in fact that's even clear from
the militia vich indictment made during
the bombing if you take a look at the
indictment it refers with the single
exception to crimes committed after the
bombing yeah that's consistent with what
was reported in great detail by the OSC
in the State Department and others so
it's clear all along that a humanitarian
concern could have been that most very
marginal but it's interesting to hear a
confirmation from the highest level of
the Clinton administration not only that
that's true but that the real reason was
unwillingness to accept the social and
economic reforms as they're called
roughly neoliberal programs so and I
think that was the policy the Clinton
administration on a there but elsewhere
and it continues to be the policy of the
Bush administration I mean there are new
issues coming up like what to do about
Kosovo for example it's a new issue well
you know can take my own opinion but I
don't know what they're planning is Evan
said but I think an not unreasonable
answer is one that was proposed by the
president of Serbia in
I think 1993 kozuch I think his name was
he proposed and I think that's probably
what's going to happen ultimately that
Kosovo should be partitioned with the
Serb mostly at that time mostly Serbian
part most of the Serbs have been driven
out but at that time mostly Serbian part
assimilated through Serbia on the mostly
Albanian part either independent if they
want are probably assimilated Albanian
my guess is that sooner or later his
proposal from 1993 is or some version of
it is what's going to be implemented but
I haven't seen any policy statement from
the Bush administration on this mist
