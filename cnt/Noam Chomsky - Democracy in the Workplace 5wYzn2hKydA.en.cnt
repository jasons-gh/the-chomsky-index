can you have say worker self-management
in industry I don't know of any law that
says you can you know law of nature that
says you can't or a law of history and I
think that'd be like better than
management control can you have
something better than the state
capitalist institutions that we have
yeah we can design a lot lots of others
in fact we can go back to the workers in
the mills and Lawrence mass who was a
took for granted that those who work in
the mills should own them and should run
them and should run them democratically
is that so outlandish and you can say
the same both communities and so on
business is a tyranny okay it's like
it's like the Soviet Union
it's got control from the top if you're
in the middle you take orders from above
and you hand them down below at the very
bottom you're allowed to rent yourself
to it no it's not obvious why things
have to work like that could be
democratically controlled by the
participant no owners no managers just
those who participate and in fact it
could be a broader participation so it's
in it somewhere it's in a community and
the community should have some say in it
so you have community participation and
participation on the part of the
workforce that's perfectly feasible in
fact there are plenty of ideas that have
been around like that for a long time
and some of them and worked out so is
the question we have to ask ourselves as
well it's not is that an alternate is a
possible alternative sure it is is it
the kind of possible alternative we want
to work for if it is it would dismantle
capitalism but we have to decide is that
what we want is that what other people
want I mean is that what the workers in
the plant one my guess is that most
people are ready for it this minute and
that if the opportunity arises they leap
at it I mean I think they need us to
encourage them it's just that you know
the options aren't there for an
individual in a plant to do it means
taking a very serious risk
so first risk will be that the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police or whatever they
counter
where it is we'll come in and beat the
 out of them you know that's a risk
and unless they have community support
they're not gonna get away with so it's
a struggle that's class struggle but if
you ask you know if you talk to workers
in a plant I don't think maybe I'm going
to find this very hard to understand
that they ought to run it themselves I
mean they can understand that as much as
the you know factory girls in Lowell and
1860 I think that's just below the
surface in all groups that I've ever do
