they told me the lights would go and
that was my cue but some of them have
remained yeah so noam chomsky thanks for
coming along here to Chatham House we've
got just about an hour ok and Noam
Chomsky has some stuff that he has to do
later on were incredibly grateful to you
for finding this little space and the
conceit is that we have a conversation
now I think we should perhaps talk about
American foreign policy and not just
gossip so it does allow with that that's
what they announced swimmers will talk
but I'm hoping we can move fairly
briskly into a question and answer
session so we maximize our time this
requires a degree of restraint on the
part of us all not least myself you will
not even be told my name much less my
record in a boring cherish kind of way
it requires restraint on your part and
you will forgive me in advance if I stop
you in or do anything wrong yeah a
family man my my children Apple a line
that they used if they asked a question
as kids do they'd sometimes they just
the five minute lecture please and over
time it was four then three them me too
and it required to fill in your parts as
well please and I might be quite tough
on that and no speeches I'll repeat that
general later on say who are if you feel
you can the more concise the questions
the more enjoyable the event is for us
all and i have here we do say tweet
questions and since we say this we
should nod in the direction of twitter i
have a twitter guru where is my twitter
guru where is my expert
she's lurking close to the exit instead
will be Stephanie will be asked perhaps
to produce a twitter tweet and also you
guys can tweet so as we are proceeding
if there's something that strikes you
want to say all you have to do is tweet
if you do tweet and all you've to do
this hashtag ask CH but people who are
outside the whole people are not here
can do it as well so it's a nice way of
broadening the audience know the I guess
crudely the Snowden stuff a surprise and
I mean by that I surprised it quite how
extraordinary it was or not a surprise
at all I think the scale was at least to
me very surprising it is in fact
phenomenal after there's a new book by
glenn greenwald i don't know if it's
come out here which surveys a lot of it
brings it together and it's really a
colossal campaign I was very clear that
they want to pick up everything
everything that anyone says who they
meet who they see anything you can think
of it's a hundred percent the goal is a
hundred percent collection of all
information about all of the enemies of
the state and what this reveals pretty
dramatically is something we all ought
to know that four states one of their
main enemies is a domestic population
they have to be kept under control
they're dangerous if you look at policy
decisions it's pretty consistent that
you have to control this dangerous enemy
this isn't this carries it way beyond
anything that's been done before of
course there's been plenty before I mean
I was during the 1960's I was very much
involved in resistance activities
against the war in Vietnam and we
understood that you can't talk on the
telephone
and if there's anything serious
something that would involve the
particular human beings let's say a
dessert or something you couldn't even
talk in a group of friends because
there's probably a government Informer
there so everything had to be done with
affinity groups so that this is well
understood and goes way back but nothing
like this scale has ever happened and
Britain agrees as you probably saw the
British government requested the NSA to
provide a detailed extensive information
on cell phones and social media other
forms of interaction for British
citizens who are an enemy of this state
in the United States it's it's kind of
dramatic because of the Fourth Amendment
of the Constitution Fourth Amendment to
the Constitution part of the Bill of
Rights it guarantees the security of
citizens in their persons homes papers
and effects and bars what are called
unreasonable search and seizures as a
reason for that has to do with England
the British rulers demanded before
demanded the right to break into homes
to search them and there were pretty
bitter confrontations red in boston
where i live in fact citizens organizing
to bar the entry of the british officers
under what were called writs of
assistance that they could just enter
wherever they like this was one of the
things that sparked the american
revolution and shortly afterwards when
the Bill of Rights was introduced in the
Constitution they made sure to put a
barrier against any such practices on
the part of the state well now the
practice the Fourth Amendment is being
violated in a way which is so dramatic
that it takes your colleagues in the
legal profession to try to
you're out how to make them consistent
but then they can always find professor
who can do the other work the role of
lawyers wait wait is that what I
wouldn't I wouldn't I wouldn't go that
far but they'll find a way to say that
knowing everything that you do is a
reasonable search search and seizure
when you compare it all when you compare
the response to water gauge which when
you look at what's happening today it
seems small beer and yet it brought down
a president now maybe just cover up
maybe it wasn't but how's the house the
culture in America changed markedly in
what is now 50 years since that time
well I have to tell you that I was a
minority of maybe one in thinking that
Watergate was a kind of a tea party
actually was asked to write about
Watergate right away by the New York
Review and I agreed but I said I would
write only if I could explain that it
didn't amount to anything in fact it was
pretty striking the Watergate exposures
came out at the very same time as the
exposures of COINTELPRO same time
COINTELPRO was a massive government a
criminal operation directed against the
population two went through four
administration's mainly Kennedy and
Johnson and Nixon started a little
earlier and it targeted a virtually all
critical thought and action for not only
surveillance but for disruption it went
way beyond the Snowden case it went as
far as a literal political assassination
in fact right at the time of Watergate
there was an exposure of the fact that
in 1969 and one of the cointelpro
operations this is an FBI operation
FBI's the national political police so
the target they were trying to destroy
the black the black movements and that
really decimated them most of the
the peak the worst case which had just
appeared I've Watergate was the
assassination of Fred Hampton Fred
Hampton was a black panther an organizer
a very successful organizer no chart
criminal charges nothing like that he
was organizing in the Chicago ghettos
the FBI under Cohen tell pro wanted to
assassinate him they tried at first to
incite a criminal gang in the ghetto the
Rangers Blackstone Rangers to kill him
they sent false letters to the heads of
the Rangers written and kind of fake
black dialect which they decoded
instantly the FBI's not very smart to
try to tell them that you know that Fred
Hampton was going to go after them so
they'd react but they didn't kind of
come in on this though and then the gone
for ya goin I want to ask a general
question about this if you will enter
them when what happened is that it the
FBI had implanted an informer who was
Hamptons bodyguard and they gave false
information to the Chicago Police about
guns in the apartment for I am the
police broken really pissed off of style
raid and just murdered him his bed oh
that that alone just swamps all the
Watergate exposures and interestingly it
was barely reported and that's the only
one I mean they went a lot of other
things under Cohen velcro which was far
more serious than Watergate and I think
more serious than the NSA is this in its
modern form the use of drones to kill
people abroad so I want it the drones is
that a modern equivalent and I want to
ask a sub question about that which is
the nature of American public opinion
you paint just now and you do in your
writings a picture of a kind of a really
easily led amorphous community which can
be misled by this and led by that and so
on I mean well takes a cointelpro I'm
it's hard to say that people were missed
they didn't know about it there is
something called journalism which is
supposed to have the task of presenting
to the public things that are
significant and important for them to
play a role in a Democratic Society but
that role is sometimes fulfill Wednesday
0 but to a very limited extent in the
case of COINTELPRO there was virtually
no coverage of the Hampton assassination
people couldn't protest because they
know about it what take grams Tech Talks
the drone campaign is a global terrorism
campaign run by the Obama administration
which has absolutely no counterpart
there's a new there used to be some
notion lawyers will remember is this old
thing will the Magna Carta which will be
commemorating and its death in the next
year 800 years 800 years don't don't
that's a Robert Worcester he'll be very
but it establish true in a narrow form
but it established the notion of
presumption of innocence pretty narrow
that it was extended over the years
that's been torn to shreds by now guilty
means that Obama decided on Tuesday
morning to kill you that's the
definition of guilty Tuesday morning
there are these sessions in the white
house where they read a little st.
Augustine on just wars and then decide
who we're going to murder today and
they're called they're recognized to be
suspect there's and its massive you know
it's a all over large parts of the world
and they can be American as I happen
well it's interesting there are few
cases I think for we're American
citizens were killed now that has caused
a lot of debate and discussion which is
curious the tacit assumption is that if
you want to kill non-americans it's free
do it whatever you like but murdering
American city
you know raises some constitutional
questions so that's debated but a bit I
mean suppose say that Iran let's say
with this I had the capacity to murder
people in the United States and Israel
earth who they regard as a threat I'm
they have good reason to regard them as
a threat like leading figures in top
leaders in the United States and Israel
are regularly saying that all options
are open which means if we want to carry
out a nuclear attack against you will do
it John McCain during the last campaign
is when here and as his line was just
mom bomb bomb don't wait let's bomb them
so they're plenty of people who they
could regard as a threat suppose they
decided to assassinate them would we sit
here quietly as I was fine they're not
Iranian citizen so why shouldn't they
assassinate them but when we do it it's
considered legitimate and it's pretty
striking that the u.s. government
recognizes as two things that are
important one is there not only killing
suspects they're generating terrorists
they know very well that these campaigns
are generating terrorists when you start
murdering people in tribal societies
which have a culture of defense and
revenge they respond that takes a 911
and turns out that 11 of the 19
apprehended hijackers were from a tribe
in Yemen that had been bitterly
repressed and attacked first by the
center and then by the international
supporters of it and they were taking
revenge there's a very important book on
this by Akbar Ahmed is a Pakistani
anthropologist teaches in the United
States is one of the leading experts on
tribal societies and he just calls it a
war against the tribal that traveled
Islam than tribal societies generally
which react
the thing is that they it's it's it's
than it is really massive terrorism
large-scale terrorism and the fact that
we accept it is pretty remarkable and
the acceptance is limited the former
head of the CIA Michael Hayden pointed
out recently that there isn't a single
government in the world which accepts
Washington's legal basis for the drone
campaign he said with two exceptions
Israel and Afghanistan and I suspect
he's wrong about Afghanistan that's the
support so you generate terrorists you
kill whoever you like and there's no
support for it what it continues what
about what about the argument that yeah
we're going to alienate a few guys but
we we take out the leaders you know we
take out to use that sort of military
image and secondly you may call it
terrorism but it's our tourism you know
the famous clash of civilizations stuff
that was you know copyrighted in the
American think tanks and books about
lesser evils and so on I mean anyway we
have democracy we ever with law we're
the good guys this you have absolutely
contempt for that but I wonder whether
there isn't at its core some basic truth
that the fact that these societies are
different sure we're much more violent
aggressive and infected when this
happens in a Democratic Society citizens
are much more culpable than when it's
done in an authoritarian state alexia
suppose Iran was murdering people who
were threatening it in the United States
and Israel and probably Britain well
Iranian citizens couldn't do very much
about that it's a harsh authoritarian
state it's different here we're pretty
free and if we accept that and tolerate
it that is morally very culpable you may
recall I hope you've read or wills
introduction to Animal Farm as you
probably know it was not published film
three years later in his unpublished
papers but it's interesting in it he
addresses himself to the people of
England free England and he says you
shouldn't feel too self-righteous about
this satirical denunciation that
Altarian enemy because in England action
quoting now he said in England unpopular
ideas can be suppressed without the use
of force and one of the mechanisms that
he mentions is a good education if
you've gone to the best schools lse
thank you for that clock a rather
ambivalent then you have instilled into
you the understanding that there are
certain things it wouldn't do to say and
I think we can add it wouldn't do to
think that's a significant element in
free societies and carries with it
severe moral responsibility much more so
than people who suffer in authoritarian
or totalitarian states I think that's
something we take much too little
attention does it mean you end up
watching we'll say something like to see
the Russian taking of the Crimea what's
going on in Syria possibly people might
take China and Tibet you end up a kind
of spectator because you've taken away
the power to intervene is that a logical
position that you go to well take
remains interesting case the Russian
takeover of Crimea is undoubtedly a
criminal act so it violates the UN
charter or it violates specific treaties
in which Russia agreed with others to
observe the boundaries of Ukraine so
it's a criminal act is it the only such
act in the world for example how much
have you read about a much more severe
case the u.s. takeover of southeastern
cubit 110 years ago us took over
southeastern Cuba at the point of a gun
technically that was a treaty but under
military occupation you know what that
means it was a treaty in which is what
we call Guantanamo that includes Cuba's
major port US has absolutely no claim to
it whatever one thinks about Crimea
there is a claim popular support the
history horse chefs handing over of
crimea to ukraine without even asking
the population a referendum in 1991
which came out with about the same
results as the recent one the major
Russian warm water port naval base of
theirs considerations in the case of the
u.s. take over south eastern Cuba there
is nothing since Cuban independence in
1959 the Cuban government's been trying
to get it back us of course refuses the
only justification is that this severely
hampers the economic development of Cuba
for 50 years the United States has been
engaged in a significant war against
Cuba under Kennedy it was a large-scale
terrorist campaign we don't talk about
it here who it was a very serious
terrorist campaign which continued
crushing embargo taking over the
southeastern cube of course severely
hampers Cuban development that's the
point this is much worse than the
Russians though their actions are
criminal have a much stronger case how
much have you read in the press about
this and it's not the only case I
totally taped that one but I met the guy
who the China guy who is equivalent of
our press guy Alastair Campbell it used
to be and they used to publish this
report about how dreadful America was
orbital who died who were killed the
rapes the race killings and whenever you
raised human rights with them they'd say
it with respect kind of what you said
you know America look at all the
violence look at Rodney King is it sort
of all was an appropriate response
because it seems to me all that happens
is you just say Oh what Russia does is
bad what China does bad but my goodness
look at America does I mean
it seems to be kind of Dodge of the
criticism is that I don't see why it's a
Dodge we accept that we accept that
principle uniformly with regard to enemy
states so for example if Serena body
criticizes Iran but doesn't criticize
Israel or if I way way criticizes China
if it doesn't denounce the United States
or suffer of Havel anyone we admire them
for that that's what they should be
doing they should be concentrating on
the crimes of their own countries and
for us that's even more significant for
the reason I mentioned we can influence
these policies I weiwei can't do much
about the policies of China we admire
him for condemning them we don't want
him nobody wants him to write about you
know the US and British crimes wasted
his time he should he should be doing
exactly what he's doing and we have a
far greater responsibility to do it
because we are responsible for these
policies in a way which dissidents and
harsh states are not and we can
influence them but it's pretty striking
that we recognize this principle
reflexively with regard to enemy States
and we can't see it with regard to
ourselves where it's much more
significant yeah yeah if you take say
that example of critiquing from the
inside Marcia and Walt made a huge
splash with a book about the power of
the Israeli Lobby in the United States
in a way it resembles what piketty's
doing at the moment with the the book on
Capitol what do these books gain
traction in American society they are
published in America America they talked
about in America or do they disappear
what happens to dissent strong dissent
within the American political tradition
well the pickety book has been well
received lots of comment on it mostly by
economists in the business press and
undoubtedly the important book the
resurrection be
mearsheimer well it's a little bit
different for one thing there there's to
question number questions to ask about
that you know the book i'm sure you know
the one thing has to do with the quality
of their claims the other is about its
reception and notice that there is the I
think it is well received I think the
reason is it Xcal Capades the US
government it says look we're fine what
but what can we do is this powerful
jewish lobby that's controlling us so
we'd be delighted to be benevolent and
you know helping people are natural
instincts but we're trapped yeah by the
Jewish lobby well that's a pretty good
reason I think why it is exactly the
second question is about the thesis and
it can it really be that a small ethnic
lobby controls US policy I mean if
this'll if anybody believes that thesis
is it there's a tactical suggestion that
follows immediately put on your tie and
jacket go to the executive offices of
Lockheed Martin General Electric Goldman
Sachs JP Morgan Chase and explained to
them that your interests are being
harmed by a little lobby which you can
put out of business in five minutes ok
that's the tactical suggestion that
follows does anybody pursue it no
because it's absurd I mean the claim is
this actually is an interesting
mearsheimer world are very good scholars
there we're called realist I are
scholars according to realist scholars
scholarship states pursue what is called
the national interest with primarily
security that's it's an anarchic world
when states try to preserve their own
security well-being you the wrong
asians and the national interest there's
a lot of questions that are open their
first of all what is the national
interest I mean is the national interest
of the CEO of General Electric the same
as the interest of the janitor who
cleans his floors know their interests
are quite different so what what's the
national interest well you know in
practice it turns out that the interests
of state power and concentrated economic
power take a look at the formation of
policy that's what it defends is the
national interest in that sense harmed
by US policy towards Israel well pretty
hard to argue that certainly centers of
American power don't think so like sake
takes a Lockheed Martin which are the
military love the industry altogether
big Lobby they think it's great I mean
when the United States gives Israel
couple of billion dollars to buy
advanced armaments that's a gift to
Lockheed Martin in fact it's a double
gift because it's what in the retail
trade is called a teaser it means that
Saudi Arabia comes along and says wait a
minute we want sixty billion dollars
worth of second-rate equipment which we
don't know how to operate and so defense
industry can sell it to them you know so
that's wonderful and furthermore Israel
tests the high-tech equipment on live
targets you learn things from that there
are very close relations of intelligence
very close if you took a look at it goes
way back actually this one of the
interesting Snowden revelations is that
Israel is the only country that gets raw
data not what's called minimized and
most data and the NSA supposed to be
kind of checked so you know things that
are really improper and illegal or
thrown out and that's the way it's given
to the so-called five eyes you know
England Australia the close ally
Israel they get straight data and the
intelligence relations are extremely
close military relations are so close
but you may have seen one of the
interesting WikiLeaks exposures was a
list of stress super strategic sites
sites that are so important that the
United States has to defend the middle
costs not many of them one of them was
right outside Haifa Raphael military
industries that's one of the super
significant us sites that has to be
defended it's a military industry
high-tech military it's one of the
places where they did a lot of the drone
technology their relations with the
Pentagon are so close that they actually
move their management offices to
Washington where the you know where the
money is you take a look at say US
investors morn Buffett the Intel they're
investing in Israel all over the place
Buffett recently spent on billion
dollars or something to acquire some
Israeli company and announced that
Israel is the best place for us
investors outside the United States
until set up their biggest new factory
for new generation ships in Israel I
mean do these people think that their
their interest is being harmed by this
relationship kind of kind of come in
there because I have to go to the
audience grudgingly on my part in a
minute John Kerry rings you up tomorrow
he says this this to state thing it's
failed norm I'm fed up with you telling
me what to do I'll do whatever you tell
me and he's only got a minute you know
the aides are circling what what you
know what what's next once day well I'm
sorry to be a minority of one again but
i think that the entire discourse on
this is highly misleading the usual
discussion almost universal on the part
of Israeli authorities Palestinians
international commentators almost
everything is that there are two options
either tuesday
or if that's gone one state and in fact
a lot of Palestinians support that this
okay let's have Israel it's given the
keys they take the whole place over
we'll run a civil rights struggle con
fanatic part I'd struggle that's all
high in the sky those are not the two
options there are two options one is the
international consensus on two states
the second option is Israel continues
doing exactly what it is doing now with
us support Israel doesn't want to take
over the in the Palestinian population
in fact what they're doing it's right
before your eyes they're carrying out
settlement and development programs
which carve up the West Bank and Gaza
kept as a prison carve up the West Bank
in a way which integrates into Israel
the parts of the West Bank that they
want that Pleasant suburbs of Jerusalem
and Tel Aviv the Jordan Valley where
they're kicking out Palestinians the
corridors that go through to the east
mala de meme in South I real in the
North break up the region into sort of
can't downs and it take over the major
resources include water but leave out
the population it's designed so that
they will not there will be very few
Palestinians in the regions that are
integrated into Israel ultimately be
annexed to it so in fact there won't be
what's called the famous demographic
problem too many too many Arabs in a
Jewish state's not gonna happen what
will happen in fact is that the
proportion of Jews in Greater Israel
will go up when they bring in the
settlers because they're there first of
all there aren't a lot of Palestinians
in those areas and the ones where they
are being kicked out that's the second
option so if you don't have a two-state
solution this is what's going to happen
as long as the US and Britain supported
of course yeah that's
fantastic I mean already a lot of people
caught my eye and I do deploy a
geographic gendered youth ageist
approach to cues you have to stand up
this gentleman called my about two hours
ago he's been in a camp bed since
yesterday but I'm looking at the back
for the lady is that a lady I am
applying agenda is very good so this
gentleman this gentleman in blue I'm
afraid and then the lady in the mid you
have to wait for the microphone you have
to stand up you have to give us your
name and you have to be incredibly
succinct James thakura's the Cooper
Union with you two weeks ago and
couldn't ask the question I'm a novelist
of work since the Tet Offensive in this
country with seven human rights groups
and almost all the issues you mentioned
I deplore and was alarmed to see garry
Wills comment just after Obama was
elected that given the War Powers Act in
41 the military we have in 120 countries
the 1.2 million top security cleared
spooks in the Washington area if Obama
had 36 years he couldn't just remember
this do you feel as an American that our
Constitution our government is beyond
recall do you think there's any way that
we can actually get back to what the
founding fathers intended I'm going to
take a couple I want that's Thank You
Jen's that's a model actually slight
comment question sir you're gonna
emulate that scale at concision and
there's a lady who's going to have a
microphone whose which ever needed yes
that lady whose hand is up in the
foreground yes sir right now is mike
harvey very simple question can you
envisage anything changing Americans
America's supported policy towards
Israel thank you very much there's one
more to come on this wave madam have you
got the way wiggle Yelena bombilla cover
master of public administration at
London School of Economics in 2010 and
your interview to Democracy Now he
supported a statement expressed by then
in financial times that the major
problem for problem of foreign policy of
Obama's administration back then was
Iran do you think it shifted nowadays to
rush I due to the failure to rein in its
imperialistic ambitions or it's too too
simple to narrow down it just to one
country thank you okay to get Daughtery
this is I can i stop at and you tell me
if I'm wrong basically Iran was the big
in 2010 you said a major policy
challenge for America the United States
and now it's shifted to Russia would
that be about a fair summary of it so
that's that one and you heard the other
two I think we let's take the last
actually 2010 was an interesting year in
us-iranian relations as you may recall
that was the year i think in which a
deal was reached between brazil turkey
and iran which would have pretty much
settled whatever the issue was supposed
to be the basic principles of the deal
were that iran would ship its low
enriched uranium out of the country to
be to be kept in turkey and in return
the West would provide medical isotopes
for the Iranian research reactors as
soon as that deal was reached it was
bitterly condemned by the White House
and reflexively by the press I don't
know what happened to hear you tell me
the Brazilian government was pretty
irritated by that the foreign minister
I'm a rim released a letter from
President Obama to present Lula in which
Obama had proposed this presumably
because he assumed that Iran would turn
it down and they get a propaganda plane
whenever an accepted it they denounced
it it was pretty much ignored in the
United States there's all kind of
pretext for why they had to turn it down
but what happened is interesting this
remain here on remains we may ask why
Iran is regarded as the way they put it
the greatest threat to world peace the
President Congress of the press
regularly describes I ran this way
incidentally it's not the way the world
perceives it there was an interesting
international poll that came out in
December run by leading at us British
polling agency
I was written that she was reported in
BBC I don't think was reported in the
United States the pole my other
questions asked which country is the
greatest threat to world peace the
United States was so far in the lead
nobody was even close second way behind
was Pakistan and that was probably
mostly because of the Indian the vote
but Iran is way down but in the United
States much of Britain too much of the
West Iran is the greatest threat to
world peace we may ask why why is he ran
the greatest threat to world peace well
there's an authoritative answer to that
it's the US intelligence agencies and
depending on give an annual report to
Congress on the global security
situation it's public not classified and
then get reported but you can find it on
the internet and they explain of course
they have a section on Iran and they
explain why it's a threat what they
point out is that Iran is not a military
threat it has very low military
expenditures even by the standards of
the region let alone the u.s. it its
strategic doctrines are defensive
designed to deter an attack long ago
long enough for diplomacy to set in
that's it strategic doctrines then they
say well if Iran is developing nuclear
weapons and of course US intelligence
doesn't know they say that would be part
of their deterrence strategy that's
quite significant aggressive states like
the US Britain Israel cannot tolerate a
deterrence strategy it's too dangerous
you have to be free to use military
force whenever you want and it's true
that Iran
be a deterrent if it had they also
accuse Iran of terrorism terrorism in
support for forces that the US doesn't
like so Iran sports Hamas supports
Hezbollah we could discuss exactly what
they are but let's get on to the other
two because i want it i want to go round
woman has caught my eye ear and may on
the guys called a problem come on back
to your yeah quickly decide we change
israel you brought the situation up the
fact that the US has about a thousand
military bases around the world rapidly
extending this incidentally particularly
in Africa Africa you know the Africa
forces greatly expanding putting bases
all over the place no other country has
anything remotely like this this is
unique to the United States and it's
part of a whole system of global control
can be changed very easily go back to or
will I mean if people in the United
States and secondarily England which is
significant in this respect if they sit
passively and quietly and da soli
unintimidated and accept what's going on
then it can't be changed but we have
enormous options of course we can change
it I mean the British Parliament for
example voted to block a strike against
Syria well that pretty much compelled
that the United States go along just one
indication of what can be done across
the board so sure we can change it but
not if we sit quietly and passively and
say let's blame the enemy but not look
at ourselves then nothing will change
the this is well understood by leading
American scholars so for example the
professor of the science of government
that Harvard I love that title the
science of Government at Harvard Samuel
Huntington again leading that figure
civilizations guy right but he pointed
out it in interestingly in 1981
year he pointed out that he said states
the state authority the United States
government has to impose a system of
force which is felt but not seen power
remains strong when it's in the dark
when it when it's hit by sunlight that
evaporates and then he expanded on that
this is 1981 he said when the United
States engages in military or other
intervention in the world we must create
the misimpression that it's the Russians
were fighting that way we intimidate the
population into passivity and of course
it was a misimpression could go on with
1981 but its point is accurate if people
will remain intimidated and passive then
there's no way to change it and this
applies to Israel to the US policy
stores Israel I not graven in stone and
in fact interesting developments are
taking place in the United States I've
been writing and speaking about this for
50 years I literally used to have police
protection when I gave a talk on it even
at my own University literally MIT if I
gave a talk on this topic the cambridge
and MIT police would be there they
insist on taking me back to my car and
so on all over the country and now it is
radically changed it's one of the
leading topics on campus thousands of
people show up for talks you can't get a
hustle question literally that's part of
a change that's taking place among the
population will it affect policy that's
up to us it can change its by now just
there's no time to talk about that I'm
glad do it if you want but I think you
can easily show that for the last 35
years the barrier to a diplomatic
settlement has been in Washington and
its allies that continues today and
can change okay twigs I'll pull in there
you may want to come back to it I'm
moving moving on the aisles there's a
lady you caught my eye earlier download
woman excuse me they're over there
somewhere there's a younger man whose
hand was up in there it was it you yet
to chop with the hand off now and
Stephanie are we getting ready for a
tweet interlude where are we where are
you going I will take one from you these
tree and we try and rattle through them
okay do you want a glass of water I'm
time that you've got the microphone name
stand up and concise okay concise hi my
name is Denise ruda to my member of
Chatham House the US is known as having
a very strong unilateral sanctions
regime can you maybe speak and give us
your thoughts on the use of sanctions to
advance foreign policy objectives and
then post extraterritoriality
effectively and do you think that the US
will be able to continue using these
unilateral sanctions in the long run to
have an impact look okay you mean kind
of smart sanctions knees against
individuals financially economic
sanctions financial and economic
sanctions against we r tronic Russia
Russia the natives whatever it is Cuba
ya un stuff like that brilliant thank
you sir thank you John Al Gore member of
Chatham House professor Chomsky I just
wondering your 1967's a in the new york
review of books on the respected custom
of of intellectuals has anything
significantly changed since he wrote
that essay how has the role of the
intellectual in public discourse changed
and to what degree has it become more
influential or less in your opinion
thank you k the role of the intellectual
has it changed the stunning 67 you
recall that article and you'll need to
update it briefly but you've got you've
got a minute because stephanie is going
to come in Stephanie how are we looking
it's like the eurovision song is from
the tweet barometer okay so i've got a
twitter-based question and chauncey says
domestic population is enemy of state in
other forums he said social media
atomizes society she died delete twitter
and i have another one and
she's bish and Blair face trial for
their conduct of the Iraq war okay thank
you and these are from yeah I i would
have typically repeating the first it's
sort of should we abolish social media
stephanie is that more or less it
basically yes i love these done with
great vulgarity and the other is should
we impeach player and bush should it be
legal processes to establish retribution
league retribution for actions well i
don't know where that is retribution but
just punishment for crimes yeah i mean
the worst crime of the 21st century has
been the bush blair invasion of iraq
totally without any credible pretext if
you notice the protective Cup changing
every time the facts changed the it's a
textbook example of aggression supreme
international crime under international
law differing from other war crimes and
that it includes all of the evil that
follows that's the nuremberg judgment on
and that you'll recall perhaps that
robert jackson us prosecutor at
nuremberg who warned the tribunal that
as he put it we're giving these
defendants a poisoned chalice and if we
sip from it we must be treated the same
way or else the nuremberg tribunal as a
farce Victor's justice so sure they
should be subjected to international law
now in the United States that can't
happen because the United States
uniquely is self immunized against law
when the United States supported the
International Court of Justice and
practically initiated in 1946 they had
it a proviso that the u.s. cannot be
charged with violation of international
treaties they meant specifically the UN
Charter which bans the use of force or
the OS charter that's been accepted by
the court
in fact if you look at the record just
about the u.s. rarely ratifies any
international agreements but when it
does is almost invariably a reservation
which says what's called non self
executing technically that means doesn't
apply to us unless there's specific
legislation and that's accepted by the
courts like for example when Yugoslavia
brought charges against NATO the u.s.
appealed to the court ins and we can't
be charged and the reason was that they
had mentioned the word genocide and when
the u.s. signed the Genocide Convention
ratified it 40 years later there was a
reservation saying inapplicable to the
United States so this is across the
board us is immune self immunized to
international law Britain not quite that
much but these are really things that
are in the hands of the public again if
we permit our leaders to be major war
criminals sure that's what they'll do
power tries to achieve whatever can and
if its domestic enemy allows it to do it
they'll do it so in case is a case in
point sanctions may be quickly sanctions
well I think we as in many of these
cases we should try to look at it from
another point of view imagine that Iran
or Cuba had the power to impose
sanctions on the United States should
they do it they certainly have plenty of
justification for it and I've mentioned
a couple of cases should they do it you
know I wouldn't I don't think that's the
way they should deal with these problems
I don't think it's the way we should we
are much more culpable I mean we're the
ones who are carrying out attacks on
them I'm it takes a Iran the United
States in 1953 the United States
overthrew the parliamentary regime in
Iran imposed the harsh dictatorship from
that day until two
day there has literally not been a day
in which the US has not been punishing
Iran supported the Shah harsh
dictatorship up till 79 immediately
turned to supporting Iraq's attack on
Iran which was murderous and brutal us
supported it all the way through with
such enthusiasm that it denied the
attacks on the Kurds pretended that Iran
had done them soon as the war was over
the u.s. is the Bush administration
invited Iraqi nuclear engineers to the
United States for advanced training in
nuclear weapons production another
threat against Iran immediately
sanctions were imposed on Iran and then
we come up to the prison this goes on
literally not a day in which Iran has
not been subjected to pretty harsh
punishment by the United States should
they impose sanctions on us assuming
that it is conceivable well you decide
and I think that gives the answer to
that question Orville Jones was about
the intellectual 1967 I mean well
intellectuals is an interesting concept
I don't want to go on for too long but
the the word intellectual in western
languages and the current sense you know
it really comes pretty much from the
Dreyfus trial before that time the word
people we intellectuals but it wasn't a
category of dissidence at the Dreyfus
trial you had decent intellectuals
animals all of the Dreyfus ours and so
on but take a close look they were a
small minority and they were persecuted
azolla had to flee the country the
mainstream intellectuals you know the
Immortals of the academie francaise and
so on they strongly supported the state
and condemned the Dreyfus arts for
daring to criticize the majesty of the
army and the state and so on that's
typical there's very rarely an exception
to that through his
way back two periods you can you know he
takes a the Bible there were people in
the Bible who are pretty much what we
call intellectuals the people who
condemned the King for criminal acts
gave you a political analysis charging
them with threatening the population
calling for mercy for widows and orphans
and so on we call them prophets they had
nothing that that's just a bad
translation of an obscure Hebrew word
they were what we would call dissident
intellectual how are they treated they
were imprisoned they were driven into
the desert persecuted and announced
there were intellectuals who were
honored the flatterers at the court
hundreds of years later they were called
false prophets not at the time that
continues right to the present the term
dissident in the United States and
England refers specifically to critical
intellectuals in enemy States right we
don't call critical intellectuals in Our
client States dissidents even though
they're treated much more harshly than
they were in Eastern Europe so for
example the right after the fall of the
Berlin Wall the Salvador the high
command of the Salvadoran government's
us client close contact with the US
Embassy ordered Brigade the avocado
Brigade to invade the University and
murder six leading Jesuit intellectuals
Latin one among leading Latin American
intellectual zombie Jesuit priests they
did they blew their brains out do we
call them dissidence does anybody even
know about it I mean can you mention
their names you know I'm just imagine
that this had happened in Czechoslovakia
or something I mean probably had a
nuclear war but it happened in u.s.
domain so it just didn't happen and this
I can go on and on with this but if you
take a look generally the people who we
call intellectuals people is fine
category but people who are sufficiently
privileged and have sufficient resources
so that they can speak about articulate
articulate Lee about issues of public
significance roughly when intellectuals
are overwhelmingly they're supportive of
power statement private power absolutely
overwhelming there's usually a in every
country some fringe of critical
intellectuals if they're in enemy States
we honor them if they're in our own
client States we blow their brains out
and forget about it but that's pretty
much the way it's been through history
there's a few exceptions few and very
interesting ones which we can think
about later but I'm determined to get
another round in can we stay another
five minutes do you want a vision and we
have got four sorry I've got four I've
got this gentleman here I've got this
lady here I've got the gentleman yes
whose hand put it up higher so I know
what to you not you sadly you yes you
you put your hand up yeah you yeah and
then this lady here but these have to be
ridiculously succinct almost to the
point of merely your name sorry I Ronan
Tynan it's just under question of human
rights I agree with you the United
Kingdom played a major role in stopping
the kind of intervention in Syria which
would have been wrong but unfortunately
some people seem to think the problem
was solved and egregious human rights
violations Assad's barrel bombing
campaign I mean it's grotesque what's
happening and the root of the problem I
put it here and it's where the elite
universities in particular been a
disgrace is the issue of human rights as
you outlined as usual in very eloquent
terms the egregious nature circle is the
first us conscious one of these things
you're not given dictators plenty of
opportunity to continue campaigns
Apatow's against their own people and
surely for people who are interested in
progress that puzzle it's called a
leading question thank you very much in
the law your honor we don't got another
19 20 minutes I think it's a statement
we can come back to it about human
rights and the success of the change no
microphone this is a disaster for the
Chairman don't apologize i don't i know
it was asked for a poor natural
natural it ain't words because the
United States has chosen a pattern of
the war on terror that violates
everything the United States
Constitution is supposed to stand for it
is given comfort to dictators everywhere
to violate your rights and we see that
the results everywhere and really thank
you thank you that is laughter of
appreciation it's absolutely no you in
to comment you can come take it I want
to get this United State years given
support for dictators to violate human
rights yeah where the war on terror yes
Polly yeah it's a statement instead all
right God rollin that was hard that was
hard work over to this lady who will now
be succinct I'd soon a young farmer on
the main road chatham house quick quick
questions regarding recent Japan's moob
tolls the rather right-wing political
well they are clearly manifested in
their view and particularly in a way
called their attempt to amend their
Pacific Constitution the meanwhile
they're refusing to acknowledge they are
military past regarding the under
neighboring country to the question so
what was your viewing it in dead last
article 9 yes and also the obamas Elvis
seems to be bucking up okay so we said
you got that one and this woman here and
then there's a chap at you yeah you
gotta my point yet we go yeah I'm Polly
I'm a reporter for RT in London and 48
horas RT know Russia today and I wanted
to ask how you see though that we get it
a lot actually I don't I was just after
the performance I was a fact I wanted to
ask how you see the conflict in Crimea
playing out both in the short term and
in the long term the conflict in and
over Ukraine and whether that's changed
the balance of power or whether there's
anything stay about the balance ruin
your change yeah yeah that's a quite
specific one and sir no it was actually
the man right in front of I'm afraid
yeah I'm really sorry but he added much
earlier but you're enormously kind to
give it up so quickly sir koji yamamoto
King's College London just your comment
on to risks I think which are being
underlying throughout the talk one is
the supporter of repressive government
in a way jumping on your Banda bandwagon
and join your criticism of the United
States how do we prevent that the other
one is a discount of you as as some
someone over more of an idealist rather
than realist how do you think we can
prevent these risks in addition to our
individual conscience or our aspiration
to follow your inspirational example so
this is a question of how do we go
through or disseminate your view in
addition to individual and Lightman life
okay thank you add two questions not one
well let's take the first one we did
actually about China and so on are you
an idealist am I saying marginalized
because an idealist all there's norm
Chomsky isn't he marvelous he keeps us
all he keeps his all in good form but
he's he's a fantasies to moral fantasies
would that be more like that's that one
would you say the same but I way way
sure in a body that's love Havel Martin
Luther King people who've tried in their
own countries to move towards a greater
freedom and justice the other idealist I
mean they're trying to achieve something
that's appropriate and in other states
we honor them for not in our own of
course and it's it's the same I way way
is not honored in China only in the
United States and it's a that's natural
and understandable and it shouldn't
happen but we should be aware of it but
I don't we should apply I mean we it's
they simply have to apply to ourselves
the standards we apply to others that's
a pretty elementary moral principle
pretty hard easy to say hard to live up
to but very valuable Holly on I think
crimea changing the strategic balance ?
not in any significant way I mean Crimea
was in the Russians look at this part of
the Soviet Union in 1954 without asking
the population first Jeff who was
Ukrainian handed it over Ukraine every
reason to believe that the population
and want this as I said there had been a
referendum in 1991 which came out pretty
much the same as the recent one they
didn't want to be part of the Ukraine
but they were just handed over for a
Russian state Regent reasons and it's
Russia has its major naval base warm
water naval base than festival it's
generally it's been part of the Russian
kind of the general Russian system the
takeover of you of Crimea by force as I
mentioned is a criminal act at one of
many I mentioned one worse one but there
are plenty of others and yes we should
not be in favor of criminal acts but in
terms of the strategic balance it
amounts to essentially nothing if you
take a look the the United States has
what are called red lines lines you
can't cross if you cross those there's a
threat of war just take a look at where
those red lines are there at the borders
of other states so one of the red lines
is the word of Russia another red lines
of the border of China there's a
conflict developing in the Pacific not
in the eastern Pacific it's not off the
coast of San Francisco there's a
conflict developing and the waters off
the coast of China where China is
attempting you can argue whether it's
right or wrong to gain control over its
major trading routes of the waters off
its coast which Japan had pretty much
taken over in the course of imperial
conquest I mean Japan has
claims vast areas of the Pacific during
because of its Imperial conquests China
this was its century of humiliation they
don't have them they're trying to get
some of them back you can like it and
dislike it but that's where the red line
is and that's the way it's been all the
time I mean it's very interesting to
look at the way American foreign policy
is described the way we describe it so
there's a lot of talk about American
decline what's rarely noticed is that
this decline began in 1945 in 1945 the
US had overwhelming power there's
nothing like it in history security well
and of course planned to use it to
organize the world system it began to
declines very quickly there's an event
in the West called the loss of China
1949 the loss of China took place big
attack on big step in American decline I
can't lose your cell phone I could lose
my cell phone like they do it all the
time but I can't lose yours right how
could we lose China well there's only
one way if we own it and after and
that's taken for granted the loss of
China is a huge issue in American
domestic policy who was responsible for
the loss of China and if he have to go
after them in a McCarthyism and so on
when Kennedy escalated the war in
Vietnam we know from internal records a
lot of the concern was that he might be
blamed for the loss of Indochina how do
you lose Indochina you know and it's the
same all over there's a premise in the
United States accepted in British elite
circles that the u.s. owns the world and
Britain is it's supposedly its partner
actually is an interesting comment on
the partnership
right at the peak of the cuban missile
crisis when britain's existence was at
stake literally could have been wiped
out by us decisions the US was refusing
to provide information to Britain
McMillan was trying to get British
intelligence to figure it was going on
and there was a discussion in high-level
circles about what was called the
special relationship between the US and
Britain and one high officials probably
dean acheson said to find the special
relationship he said Britain is our
lieutenant the fashionable word is
partner in Britain and Britain they like
to hear the fashionable word the big
guys use the word that counts so this is
the US attitude written as lieutenant
goes along and it's a conception of
World Order that's pretty striking if
you think about it we're nearly out of
time we dealt with article 9 or do you
want to but yeah article 9 yeah well
it's quite precise so yeah okay it
doesn't it in a sentence nearly Japan
know happens to be in the hands of a
very kind of an ultra nationalist
government prime minister who is clearly
trying to whittle away at article 9 like
the pacifist article in the Constitution
I think it's a very bad thing I mean
people in Asia have some memories of
Japanese Imperialism there's also for a
long time in Japan there's been kind of
an under playing of Japanese crimes in
Asia so the anagha was one historian
visit an historian who fought hard to
try to get the Japanese textbooks to it
at least include the facts and there was
some progress now it's going back again
you know like denying the Nunchuk
massacre things like that this instantly
was abetted by the United States when
the United did after the war the United
State
simply took over Japan there was
supposed to be a Far Eastern commission
of all the countries that were involved
in war they were all kicked out the u.s.
ran it unilaterally there was a peace
treaty with japan san francisco history
1951 the peace treaty charged japan with
crimes take a look at it the crimes
began on december 7 1941 there were 10
years of horrendous crimes before that
but they didn't count because they were
crimes against asians which order will
called on people december 7 1941 was
different that was against people the
structure of the peace treaty was so
outrageous that independent asian
countries simply refused to attend like
india wouldn't attend salon attended
because it was a british colony
philippines attended to add to but any
independent ages refused well okay thats
it's the basis in fact you know this
famous reverse course in japan in 1947
the u.s. essentially restored the
traditional order and undermined the
Democratic elements in society and that
helps that lays the basis in which Japan
has been able to maintain these policies
and I think it's a pretty bad thing it
doesn't mean we should you know praise
China for what it's doing a lot of
what's doing is I think pretty
outrageous like and with regard to
Vietnam but that's a different question
the but as far as Japan's backing off on
its pacifist Constitution I think that's
extremely dangerous I think we're we're
nearly there what are there there's a
question that occurs to me might be even
an unfair one but sometimes when you
listen to you here get the impression
you you you began life fully formed with
the clarity of vision I mean it's
amazing and a consistency and I want to
ask you you don't have to answer fifth
amendment but do you think you've ever
been wrong about an issue you know not
know they're laughing their
think they're laughing nervously it is
not a lot of thought it is not it is not
a koi root in a subversion know plenty
of times I can think of a case after
case I'm gonna take the worst crime of
the post-war era post World War era the
worst crime was the US attack on
Indochina really horrendous crime it
destroyed three countries they may never
recover millions of people killed you
know that's devastation chemical warfare
destroy crops every atrocity tan think
of the time to have become opposed that
was nineteen fifty I did I didn't do
anything in the 1950s it was pretty
clear what was going on it was until the
early sixties when Kennedy sharply
escalated the war that I started trying
to talk a little bit about it and not
enough and that was a bad mistake and
there plenty of others liked it yeah
okay look he's people waiting for him
I'm at this point I want to just plumb
Chatham House you know it's fantastic
venue there are lots of events I don't
know any of them but go on the website
you will see them there looks to be a
camera down there which means the if you
want to watch this catch sight of
yourself when they're looking for
questions but more to the point revisit
it it'll be I presume on a web will it
be on a web or the web so you'll be able
to see it again thank you for being a
very disciplined audience Aaron and I am
sorry about giving you a hard time over
that question that's fine but it was a
statement which norm agreed with so I
think he answered every single one it's
a prodigious display and it's also from
ISS for a very entertaining one I think
my name is Connor gear to your work a
jealousy I feel very lucky to have been
able to share this event I wonder
whether you might now want to join with
me in show your appreciation of
professor Noam Chomsky
