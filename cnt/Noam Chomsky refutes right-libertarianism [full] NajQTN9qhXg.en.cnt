what has been created by this half
century of massive corporate propaganda
is what's called anti politics so
anything that goes wrong you blame the
government well okay there's plenty to
blame the government about but the
government is the one institution in
which that people can change
so one institution you can affect by
participation without institutional
change right that's exactly why all the
anger and fear is directed against the
government the government has a defect
it's potentially Democratic corporations
have no defect
they're pure tyrannies so therefore you
want to keep corporations invisible and
focus all anger on the government so you
don't like something you know your wages
are going down blame the government you
know not blame the guys in the fortune
500 because you don't read the fortune
500 you know the thing you just read
what they tell you in the newspapers so
you don't read about the dazzling
profits and this dependence this and the
wages going down and so on all you know
is that the bad government's doing
something so let's get mad at the
government that's obvious why big
corporations we're fighting the
everlasting battle for the minds of men
would want that to be the picture you
had if the government is your enemy and
you can let's say when people when 83%
of the population think the economic
system is unhear n't leon fair that's
supposed to mean they're angry at the
government if you can take that view
then those who run the private
institutions are quite well-off any
politics is a very scary phenomenon it
can take the form of that it is taking
you know forming what shouldn't be
called militias because remember
militias are things raised by States
these are just private armies forming
private armies to defend the country the
people against you know the UN forces
being brought in on the black
helicopters by the Council on Foreign
Relations to commit genocide or whatever
story alike or else it's you know fight
against Lucifer and beast 66 who's doing
this that and the other thing
and that's what if you take a look
across the country that's what people
are worried about and fighting against
aliens you know the devil the UN forces
the Federal Reserve I mean everything
except what's real mainly private
private tyranny private corporate power
the guys who are listed in the fortune
500 well that's an achievement
that's a propaganda achievement and
while the anger and the fear is real and
it's based on something and you got to
sympathize with it because it is real
when your wages have dropped 25 percent
roughly and say 15 years and you know
your wife has to work and your kids
can't eat and so on and so forth you
have no future and everything's rotten
you know a lot to be angry about but
people are not focused on what's doing
that's the difference between the days
in which there was a live functioning
labor movement that was organizing these
people exactly these people work
together to change things
libertarian throughout modern European
history meant socialist anarchist I'm at
the auntie's and the socialist movement
the workers movement and socialist
movement I sort of broke into two
branches roughly one statist one a D
status the statist branch led to
Bolshevism and Lenin and Trotsky and so
on the a D status branch which included
Marxists left Marxists Panico because
Luxembourg others it's kind of merged
more or less into an amalgam with big
strain of anarchism into what was called
libertarian socialism so and libertarian
in Europe always meant socialist here it
means ultra get on in Rand or Cato
Institute or something like that but
that's a special u.s. usage the u.s.
sense is quite different here every word
has become has taken on the not the
opposite of its meaning elsewhere so
here libertarian means extreme advocate
of total tyranny that's what libertarian
means here it means power ought to be
given into the hands of private
unaccountable tyrannies even worse than
state tyrannies because there the public
has some kind of rule the corporate
system especially as it's evolved in the
20th century is purity really completely
unaccountable you're inside one of these
institutions you take orders from above
you hand it down below you're outside
the institutions under what the
libertarians want there's Noth nothing
you can say tyrannies do what they feel
like their global and scale I mean this
is the extreme opposite of what's been
called libertarian everywhere in the
world since the Enlightenment and that's
what's called libertarian here
but if you have private ownership of the
means of production it means that first
of all the people it's not just one
person it's a institution so you get
like maybe it's a corporation or private
business or something
first of all internally it's essentially
a totalitarian institution almost
necessarily there's a group at the top
maybe a person or a group they make the
decisions they give orders people down
the hierarchy
get the orders transmit them at the very
bottom you get people who are permitted
to rent themselves to survive that's
called a job wage labor and you get the
outside community who's allowed to
purchase what you produce and of course
they're very heavily propagandize to
make them want to consume it even if
they don't so that's the nature of the
system it's kind of about as close to
the tell Terry anism as you can imagine
it's well-known among economists that
markets are inefficient from the
narrowest perspective so to make it
simple suppose you and I use suppose you
sell me a car okay we may make a good
deal for ourselves we're not taking into
account the effect on him that's what's
called an externality and there's an
effect if you sell me in a car a car it
increases gas prices increases pollution
increases congestion and that extends
very broadly these so-called
externalities could be very large now in
financial institutions it's far worse
they are in the business of taking risks
suppose a bank lends money it cares
about one thing its own profits now
there's a property called systemic risk
the risk that if you if the market say
crashes somewhere it's going to be
contagious okay and there is that
phenomenon that's monstrous in fact but
the investor doesn't think about that
can't you know you think about your own
risk it's you cannot think about the
cost to others of the fact that
contagion may destroy a system that's
not part of your calculations that's
another externality so the system is
sort of built to magnify extremely
dangerous properties and this happens
all over the place I mean what are
called the externalities that just you
know dominate life the systemic risk is
it externality this up consider which
would bring down the financial system
repeatedly if you didn't have state
power intervening well there's another
one that's even bigger
that's destruction of the environment
destruction of the environment is an
externality in market interactions you
don't pay attention to it so if you're
say take Tarzana if you're a major
energy corporation and you can make
profit out of exploiting tar sands you
simply do not take into account the fact
that your grandchildren may not have a
half a possibility of survival that's an
externality that in the moral calculus
of capitalism greater profits in the
next quarter outweigh the fate of your
grandchildren of course it's not just
your everyone's markets are supposed to
be magnificent because they increase
your choices actually they restrict your
choices you think about it for a minute
suppose I want to get home from work at
night ok the market offers me a choice I
can have a four-door Toyota it does not
offer me the choice of a subway what I
want what's good for me what's good for
the environment what's good for my
children but that's not offered in the
market markets offer individual
consumption and the enormous stress on
the importance of markets is part of the
way to drive people towards looking for
yourself amassing as many commodities
you can forget everything else in fact
if you think about it for every one of
you picking an economics course or read
about it then you know what markets are
supposed to be markets are supposed to
be systems in which informed consumers
make rational choices right I'm sure
every one of you is turned on a
television set what do you see when you
turn on a television set you see that
there's a huge industry public relations
industry which began in the United
States and Britain incidentally huge
industry which is designed to undermine
mark
it's every ad is an attempt to create an
uninformed consumer will make an
irrational choice right a huge effort on
the part of the business world the
undermine markets but to keep the aspect
that's useful for profit and power
namely separating people from one
another focusing on individual choices
not working with your neighbor private
enterprise works just the way Milton
Friedman says you give the worst
possible service at the highest possible
profit that's what it means to be in the
business if you try to be benevolent
you're out of the business because
somebody undercuts you so the nature of
the system is to be as mean and rotten
as you can to try to maximize profit and
market share and give the worst possible
service same with HMOs and everything
else
I mean what are human beings I mean in
your family for example it's not the
case that in the family every person
tries to maximize personal gain at the
expense of others or if they do it's
kind of pathological I mean if the
society is based on control by private
wealth it will reflect the values that
in fact does reflect the value that the
highest the only real human property is
the desire for covetous green and the
desire to maximize personal gain at the
expense of others now any society made
that small society based on that
principle is ugly but it can survive a
global society based on that principle
is headed for massive destruction
do you support Ron Paul I mean Ron
Paul's a nice guy if I had to have
dinner with one of the Republican
candidates I'd prefer to have it with
him but his policies are off the wall no
I mean sometimes I agree with them
you know like I think we oughta end the
war in Afghanistan but if you look at
the other policies I mean it's kind of
shocking so pretend the principles that
lie behind them you know know what to
say about them so look today you
probably saw or maybe read in the
Republican debates at one point and this
kind of brought out who he is he was
asked he's against federal involvement
in health and anything he was asked
there's something like well what about
what if some guys in a coma and he's
going to die and he never took out
insurance what should happen well his
first answer was something like it's a
tribute to our Liberty okay so if he
dies that's a tribute to have free we
are fine he kind of backed off from that
active huge applause when he said that
but after later reactions from elsewhere
back home he said well the church will
take care of him our charities will take
care of them there's nothing your other
so it's not a problem all right I mean
this is just savagery and it goes across
the board in fact this holds for the
whole so-called libertarian ideology I
mean it may sound nice on the surface
but if you think it through it's just a
call for corporate tyranny takes away
any barrier to corporate tyranny it's a
step towards the worst but weak but it's
all academic because the business world
would never permit it to happen since it
would destroy the economy I mean they
can't live without a powerful nanny
state they know
frankly I there's a lot of feeling about
that but I really think it's misguided I
don't think the problem is printing fiat
currency that's I mean just in a my I
mean if you eliminate capitalism you
know okay then there are other options
but in a but then but that's but that's
not on the agenda we have a state
capitalist economy you know maybe in the
long term it can be burnt away maybe
overthrown hope so but the issue now is
how do you function in a sensible state
capitalist economy and you cannot do
that without a central bank that
controls currency in fact if it wasn't
for the Federal Reserve's ability to
print money we'd be in a deep depression
right now worse depression than a 1930s
and what's at you know since the
sensible thing isn't being done for
political reasons the sensible thing
would be creating demand by government
investment but for reasons that we can
go into that's not being done in our
state capitalist economy the only
alternative is the one that Bernanke is
used and if it wasn't for their option
we would be in a deep depression now
what's the debt debt ceiling issue well
that's first of all it should be
recognized that the debt is not a
serious problem
certainly the deficit is not a serious
problem there are long-term problems
about the debt but they are so remote
they don't bear on policy as far as the
deaf it is concerned deficit is
concerned remember that's not the same
as a debt as Clinton left office it's
not that long ago we had a surplus no
deficit and it's not a deep structural
problem the current deficit is the
result of bush's tax cut the crazy wars
the virtually criminal behavior of the
corporate system that led to the
financial the housing crisis finally
financial crisis all of that has
increased the deficit but not out of
sight the deficit is chrysalis declining
and it's it would be overcome by actual
growth I mean the the government
economic officers Bureau the budget and
so on they calculate that there's about
a trillion dollars of unused capacity I
mean the real problem of the economy is
not the debt and the deficit it's the
fact that the economy is so kind of
grotesque that you have tens of millions
of people wanting to work and not able
to you have huge financial resources
corporate the corporations that you
don't know what to do with their money
huge profits huge bank profits there's
an enormous amount that has to be done
just walk around any city you can think
of a million things that have to be done
and all kind of you know they're just
the numerator at will so a huge number
of idle hands enormous resources
tremendous amount of work that has to be
done and the economy is so dysfunctional
it can't put them together that's the
problem and it's destroying a generation
of young people it's harming severely
harming the economy under current
circumstances the way out is pretty well
known it's to stimulate the economy
through government demand since
corporations aren't doing it and to
devalue the dollar so that we import
less than export more
