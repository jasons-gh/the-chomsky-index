i define well-being in traditional
philosophical terms and i say that
because of course there are now
empirical inquiries well-being studies
and happiness studies economists
surveyed said in this question now about
how you quantify well-being but the
traditional philosophical debate says
that well-being is a state of
flourishing of feeling that one is
living in a way that is satisfying that
it has movement towards really
worthwhile goals and the achievement of
them making progress towards that and of
having satisfaction in things that are
very central to a life that feels good
to live and that is good relationships
good relationships with other people and
you will notice that that traditional
definition and that's one which in many
many of the classical philosophical
texts you you will find doesn't say very
much about money or about material
possessions although very astutely
hospital did point out that there is
always an element of what he called
moral luck associated meaning that of
course if you're not in a war zone if
you're not starving if you're not
struggling every day to find clean water
then of course you have a much better
chance of having a sense of well-being
so well-being would have to include
those fundamental material resources
that liberate you really to seek and
find some of those other satisfactions
emotional intellectual and social that
make for a life that really does feel
good to live and that's what well-being
is well-being I think is in ours are
below Blinn's terms defined in terms of
pluralism the whole variety of
incommensurable activities some of them
are economic some of them are to do with
personal freedoms of various kinds
others are to do with relations in the
society in which you live I'm an
economist
I think most people think that most
economists think that well-being is
about economic growth the number that
politicians obsess about is GDP gross
domestic product rather technical
measure actually which is what
economists and national account
statisticians following them go about
measuring but I don't think anyone has
ever really thought or an economist has
ever really thought the gross domestic
product GDP was a measure of well-being
it's a measure of material output and
material output is one part of
well-being but only a part of well-being
along with all the other things we're
describing what's also important I think
is that a lot of people are not
economists think that more economic
growth is always about having more stuff
and it's not actually in modern Western
Europe what economic growth is very
largely about is not more stuff but
better stuff you know better food better
lifestyle better clothes better
everything and that's and that's why it
is the resource content of output is
diminishing eveness output increases I
think well-being is a sense of comfort
in your own skin too many people are
going to elevate well-being to be an
absence of any kind of pain at all and I
don't think that should be the test I
think it's about being comfortable
within yourself and that inevitably
involves being comfortable within your
society within your community and that
means that your community has to be a
place that is tolerant and compassionate
I worry about the concept of well-being
because I feel that it's a it's a way of
concentrating on the I on the individual
on this sort of narcissism that
sometimes is an indicator of the
predominant view in our society and
forgetting the the sense in which the
individual only thrives in a situation
in which there is a degree of
consolidating and and a communion of
people coming together to make society
better
I is a concept that I'm leery about but
I would say well-being is about feeling
at one with yourself and and I think a
lot of people can't feel that if they
are fearful and fearful of poverty
fearful of their own security fearful of
old age fearful of feeling feeling want
and I think our society is becoming less
concerned about well-being it's kind of
like love or anger and you understand
that if you feel it but you can't really
define it it's the sense that what
you're doing somehow satisfies your
inner needs whatever they happen to be
well I was thinking that Dante after he
goes through hell climbs the mountain of
purgatory and at the very top in the
earthly paradise he finds two rivers one
river is Lethe forgetfulness and when
you drink of that river you'll forget
everything we know about that the other
river is one that Dante invented and
it's called you know II you know means
good mind and when he drinks of that all
that's left to him are good memories
what I choose to think of these good
memories is not simply retrospective but
as good knowledge so well-being is also
good thinking good doing and it's a need
that obviously comes after the
fundamental needs that are covered by
the Charter Unit United Nations Charter
shelter nourishment peace and quiet like
protection from harm all these basic
needs of human nature but but not
exactly after that but bound up with
that is the need to be able to express
yourself to do the things to develop
your capacities and for that you need
access to learning skills and you can
take the word art as the in its largest
extent the idea of doing
something well the satisfaction that
follows from that and it's also a mutual
responsibility it's our responsibility
to pay attention to others and help them
from the moment they start tying their
shoelaces to the more complex tasks
later and for that it's not just we pay
attention to those who are learning but
they're there we must also be attentive
so attentiveness a general relation of
absorption responsiveness to one another
in the world seems to me to be essential
to well being and what can follow from
acts of thinking and doing and making
undertaken with full attentiveness is
self-forgetfulness
and there is no more contentious state
than to be so involved in something
you're doing that you actually forget
yourself this idea of good knowledge
good making or good doing needs material
to work with and that to me of course I
think of literature a great deal that to
me is actually having a community of
stories of songs possibly ballads but
something that is shared that builds the
common ground and gives you material to
work with
when this act of working and making has
happened
recognition is needed the encouragement
that your effort has been recognized and
that your identity is as it were opening
up and being accepted by the world and
for that there's also needed a sense of
possibility and that means that for well
being we need to have optimism now
optimism can be false hope but it can
also be a refusal of despair and the two
things are different
so optimism in general is needed for our
well-being
well actually Karl Marx once made a
distinction between animal needs and
human needs the Society of well-run
society community should make sure that
people's animals needs are satisfied you
should have I don't need to have to
quote it take a look at the article 25
of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights spells it out pretty well after
they it should provide the opportunity
for people to discover who they are what
their inner nature is to have an
opportunity to pursue it to a degree
which is maximal which allows them to
create their own future and realize its
potentiality well I think there's a very
small thing that could be done in this
country for example and that is I think
that music and dance and the arts should
be restored to the core school
curriculum and secondly related I think
the youth centers that used to offer
nondenominational access to skills
trades arts general potentialities they
should be reopened at the larger level
the sort of universal level I think that
we need to add the work of a narrative
imagination as expressed in all the
media the work of narrative imagination
as a central staple of human
consciousness in the communities that so
many are suffering from stress are
suffering from displacement and the
various ills of our contemporary world
from an economic point of view I think
there's one thing we should do that
would increase well-being which is to
stop talking about the economy and
having this idea that there is something
out there called the economy that needs
to be kind of fed and propitiated and we
should ask whether things are good for
the economy we should stop asking
whether things are good for the economy
we should ask whether
good for citizens and people I think one
of the problems we have naman era is
people want to quantify a whole range of
things that are really very difficult to
quantify or actually impossible to
quantify which is more fundamental so
there is this idea out there that we
could scrap GDP and have some kind of
measure of well-being index of some kind
or another I think that's a doomed quest
actually the United Nations prepares
human development indices in which in a
countries like Canada Norway always come
talk but the truth is the index isn't
telling us anything if Canada Norway
didn't come top or close to the top of
these kind of rankings we think there
was something wrong with the index
rather than wheedled that we learned
something we didn't know about Canada in
Norway I think we ought to accept in the
terms I was describing earlier that
actually well-being is made up of a
whole variety of components which are
not commensurable with each other and we
can't find some weighting scheme that
enables us to add them up to get a
single measure for me well-being is only
going to be preserved for the individual
if you actually look at all individuals
in society and I think our societies are
turning into much harder places we're
taking the heart out of our societies
particularly in in well developed
democracies we are absolutely elevating
the individual at the expense of the
community and at the expense of
solidarity and I find this preoccupation
one that's actually to the detriment so
I would say that the best leaders are
going to be ones that actually care
about the individual but also care about
community and care about solidarity and
we are missing that bus now there aren't
leaders who are speaking loudly enough
about the fact that the individual only
thrives in the context of a healthy
community when people wonder what it is
that governments could do that perhaps
societies as a whole in collaboration
with their governments
to try to increase well-being among
their people probably chief among them
is to give people the the freedom and
the opportunities to use that freedom to
make choices for their own lives and to
pursue things that seem valuable and
good to them now the important point
that lies behind that thought is that
there is a great diversity in human
nature and human interests and needs and
desires there's not a one-size-fits-all
answer to the question what would make
people happy what would help people to
get this sense of flourishing and
therefore to give them the opportunity
the space to pursue that opportunity to
make a life that feels purposeful and
meaningful for each individual to create
those relationships which are really
crucial to well-being that I think would
be the key thing now obviously as a
background point to a society needs to
be just it needs to be fair it needs to
be one in which people feel that they
have a place a role that they can
participate in decisions about their own
lives all these things are very
fundamental but I think most least of
the advanced countries of the world the
democracies of the world have already
enshrined those aspects of our thinking
about well lived lives and so the key
thing remains opportunity and the
freedom to pursue those opportunities
and the resources to do that with it
