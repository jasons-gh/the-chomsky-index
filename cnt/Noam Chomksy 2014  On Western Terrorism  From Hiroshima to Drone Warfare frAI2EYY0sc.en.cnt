this is ongoing discussions for many
years with Andre we've had common
interests concerns or has of crossed
many times this gave us an opportunity
to provide a series of parallel
responses to a series of queries and
comments about matters of common
interest and the common commitment over
many years
his part is mostly direct involvement
he's a very intrepid correspondent has
been all over has explored many of the
most difficult conflicts in the world
right at the peak moments of
confrontation and violence I've done a
little of that nowhere near to the
extent that he as my own research is
mostly a secondary using sources that
are available to write and comment about
it with occasional direct interactions
with people's struggling around the
world
well we have recognized for many years
that the major sources of terrorism in
the world are the Western powers
primarily the the greatest of them the
United States and its immediate allies
and in our inquiries simply deepened
that recognition and we tried to provide
significant evidence for it from many
corners of the world and many domains of
research and inquiry
well there's great concern in the West
and elsewhere are about the rise of
terrorism and it and what we can do to
limit this scourge and that's quite
appropriate and there are some simple
answers so one way to sharply reduce
global terrorism is to stop carrying it
out that's the easiest way and that
would already have a big effect we don't
have to keep this abstract the most
extreme global terrorism campaign now
underway is President Obama's global
assassination campaign that's sheer
terror drone attacks terrorized
populations they murder suspects not
people shown to be guilty but suspects
others who may be unfortunate enough to
be nearby they traumatize communities
terrorize tribal societies they also
engender terrorism which is well
understood at the highest sources you
carry out a drone attack on a village in
southern Yemen killing somebody who
don't like and maybe you lots of others
and you create a desire for revenge and
reaction that's engendering terrorism
probably faster than they're killing us
people they don't like that's one
example hardly the only one of the if
take a look at major acts of terror
probably the the single greatest
terrorist act was the 911 destruction
ask yourself who did it it was mostly
tribesmen from Yemen who had been
subjected to bitter persecution and were
dedicated to revenge that's the way you
engender terrorism and carrying it out
consistently just expands it of course
that's only a small part of it Western
terror it's a other just say out just
under Ronald Reagan was extensive in
Central America southern Africa he was
the last supporter of apartheid and the
atrocities of the apartheid regime at
home and abroad at least these these are
massive operations of violence and
aggression and often terror and there's
a very good reason for the world to be
deeply concerned about them
