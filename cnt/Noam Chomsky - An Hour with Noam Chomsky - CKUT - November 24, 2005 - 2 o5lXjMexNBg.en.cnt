and now we will hear from mr. Scott born
who's been with the C key ck UT news
collective for one year mr. Boren
professor Chomsky president Chavez has
stated in a speech and at the people's
summit in Mar del Plata that the peoples
of the Americas have killed the proposed
free trade area of the Americas what are
your thoughts on this and on the
prospect for free trade agreements in
the Americas as they've been envisioned
for example by the US government
well I think Travis is correct they
killed the proposals however if you know
you asked me I'm not his advisor I would
have told him not to call them free
trade agreements because they're not
they're not free trade agreements very
far from it the agreement like NAFTA and
FDA World Trade Organization rules have
highly protectionist elements in fact
they have one core part of them is
guarantees for monopoly pricing rights
for major corporations at a level that
has never existed before that's the
so-called trip's intellectual property
right if there had been a rules like
that in place you know while today's
wealthy countries we're developing the
United States would be pursuing its
comparative advantage in exporting fish
and fur certainly it would have
developed an industrial economy and nor
would anyone else but those are the
rules that are placed put in place and
those are to ensure very high profits
for a long time to come for the private
tyrannies which is basically what
corporations are which relied very
heavily just to make it more ironic rely
very heavily on research and development
in the state sector state sectors the
dynamic or the economy and yes then they
pick it up and market it now they're
given monopoly pricing rights
think of anything that's more opposed to
free trade quite apart from that a large
part of the trade agreements has nothing
to do with trade it has to do with
ensuring the rights of investors so
trims major port has what it ensures is
that save Canadian company if it invests
in wherever Argentina will get or called
national rights it will be treated like
a domestic company the human beings
don't have those rights like a Mexican
can't come to Canada and demand national
rights but a Canadian corporation could
go to Mexico and demand national rights
well you just take a look at this
disparities and power and you know what
that means
it means that governments cannot carry
out programs who that will lead to
sustainable and meaningful development
for their populations which would mean
targeted investment may be that you know
preferences for women and minorities
regional concerns I mean all kind of
things it is civilized country would do
those are barred because foreign
corporations meaning primarily us and
rich countries their corporations are
just have to be given every right they
want all right know as Canada has just
learned there's a qualification on this
if there are disputes between the United
States and say Canada and the NAFTA in
this case the NAFTA board rules against
the United States the United States
tells him to go lost get lost that's
what just happened with other Canadian
us negotiations on the lumber Washington
didn't like the results of the board
ruling so it said you know do something
about it they said essentially what all
on once is supposed to have said how
many divisions has the Pope yeah that's
the answer but these are not free trade
agreements I mean they're deeper reasons
what is
world trade is just an ideological
instruction it's not an economic fact
it's important to understand that it
takes a the old Soviet Union I mean if
the Kremlin decided to produce parts in
Bulgaria and have them assembled in
Poland and then the product sold in
Moscow all of those operations crossed
national borders but we didn't consider
it trade when I was internal operations
within a totalitarian command economy
it's not true
well in fact that's a good part probably
close to half of what is called trade in
the international system it's you know
all computers produces computers in
China and sells them in the United
States that's called it's called exports
to the United State fact if you call
that what it ought to be called and
they'll exports from the United States
turns out the trade deficit declines
radically but it's not trade I mean if
parts are assembled in Indiana sent to
Mexico produced Indiana sent to Mexico
to be assembled and then sent back to
the United States to be sold in Chicago
we call that trade between Mexico and
the United States it's all internal to a
command economy with a General Motors
internal which is a totalitarian system
of course so it's internal to with
totalitarian command economy now that's
not a small part of what's called trade
I mean since these are you know private
tyrannies basically mostly unaccountable
to the public we don't close information
but the general estimate of economists
is that this may amount to maybe 40 50
percent of so-called world trade
so isn't trade in the first place alone
free trade remote free trade I mean the
things people discuss like the
agricultural subsidies now those are
real but they are at the margin and this
is all quite apart from the fact that
the core of the economy is the state
system
I mean you use computers and you use the
internet and you fly in airplanes and
you buy goods from that are produced in
China and come over on container ships
you use medicines and so on
most of the basic research and
development on that is paid for but
public instead of the state system I'm
often for decades computers and the
internet we're in the state system for
about 30 years before they became the
public it paid enough to make them
marketable and they're handed over to
private corporations we're very remote
from anything resembling market
societies or create or anything like
that so it should be called free trade
in the first place
or trade even it's it's just another
mechanism for guaranteeing the rights of
the powerful which is not very
surprising rights the rules and the
whatever these things are they're
certainly not agreements they say NAFTA
and it's called a the only true words
correct words in the phrase north
american free trade agreement or in
north america it wasn't about free trade
it certainly wasn't agreement at least
if people are part of their countries it
was proposed chavez also stayed in the
same speech that he knows the US
government has plans to invade venezuela
and that if it carried out these plans
100 years war would begin can you
comment on the significance of the
statement not paranoid
i mean the US did support a military
coup in 2002 to overthrow the government
it attacked was the only country in the
hemisphere supported and the washington
had to back down first of all because of
an enormous protest in latin america
were people who regard democracy a
little more seriously than in washington
and partly because the popular response
in venezuela restored the government
after that the US has moved to
subversion again it's pretty open I mean
the u.s. is carrying out what it calls
democracy promotion initiatives that
means spending
or if for anti Shabbos organizations
I mean suppose just going back to the
media again suppose that he ran had
supported a military coup in the United
States and then you know after who
failed it turned to subversion in the
United States by funding anti-bush
organizations in the United States I
mean with the Globe and Mail think
there's something funny about this would
it be commented huh well does anybody
comment on what's happening in Venezuela
I mean the u.s. decided that it's
officially it's charged as being a non
democratic country
it doesn't matter mcwhat equal venezuela
thing I mean Chavez is running about 80%
approval records a Venezuela leads the
Latin America in support for the elected
government by a considerable margin
democracy is regarded as the
preferential preferred form of
government in the Andean region in one
country Venezuela about seventy five
percent the others it's all about the
forty five percent this just doesn't
matter I mean what do people matter
we're the ones who decide whether it
said the right government so sure he has
plenty of reason to be concerned and
what the consequences would be and I
don't think it's going to happen because
you know this isn't much too weak a
position now but the problems are quite
serious I mean the US has tremendous
problems all the way from Venezuela down
to Argentina and in fact getting the
Bush administration has even succeeded
in alienating Canada that's quite a
trick I mean Paul Martin the other day
said something about how if the United
States doesn't honor its enacted
requirements a candidate might start
shipping oil to China that would mean
which Venezuela is already doing that
would mean the Bush administration
exceeded in losing it partly its two
major oil suppliers in the hemisphere
and it's also in serious danger
the losing control of the oil system in
the Middle East these people really have
a talent for self-destruction
problem with that is that apart from
what it means for everyone else
a wounded monster can be more dangerous
than a healthy monster you thoughts on
the upcoming elections in Haiti and the
events leading up to them
Haiti is such a disgrace mainly France
in the United States but Canada too and
others that you just can't encapsulated
in a work I mean Haiti did have one free
democratic election in 1990 the United
States didn't like the way it came out
because the wrong man won and it really
was democratic there was a man elected
from the people working not large really
active civil society and organized in
the slums and the hills and so on and
against overwhelming odds they elected
their own candidate everyone expected
the u.s. candidate to win former
thankfui World Bank official US moved it
once to undermine the government to give
the details was very explicit couple
months later came military coup the us
effectively supported it there was an
organization of american states embargo
but Bush number one immediately
announced that US firms were exempted
trade continued under Clinton went up
even higher turned out both Bush and
Clinton were authorizing the Texaco oil
company provide oil to the military
hunter in violation of presidential
directives meanwhile there's terror
there was unbelievable I was down there
for a while it was just horrible
finally Clinton decided that people had
been punished enough so he allowed her
stayed the elected president to return
but on a condition namely that he accept
the program of the defeated American
candidate in the 1990 election obvious
at once that this very harsh neoliberal
program was going to destroy what was
left of the Haitian economy as it did
and the
that's called democracy promotion a
noble effort to restore democracy and
you know the countries me walk laps
English made it worse by effectively
cutting off international aid from spun
into chaos I finally kind of imploded
and now it's a total disaster I'm in a
monstrous atrocities going on mostly
against the poor as usual the former are
