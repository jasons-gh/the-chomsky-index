Marx himself complex figure the early
Marx so you read the philosophical
manuscripts and so on do you know this
is coming straight out of the French
French and German Romanticism so the
kinds of ideas you find expressed in
Humboldt and then the more libertarian
side of Rousseau Rousseau himself was
very split but if you take the
libertarian as part of Rousseau the
second discourse on inequality and
Humboldt and so on all of this was
that's the background that which Marx
grew up and if you read the
philosophical and manuscripts of the
early period they're immersed in this so
his theory of alienation comes out of
this work coerced labor is alienating
and counter to human nature precisely
for these reasons for the Humboldt II
and reasons when you get to the later
marks you know it's not it's it's sort
of like a scholarly debate about whether
he changed his mind or just started
talking about other things but that
anyway you don't find it any longer and
by that time Marx Marxism does become
exactly as you say very detrimental to
this so you get this idea which you you
do find it Marx but it couldn't have
believed that human nature is just a
historical product and people are just
malleable they're made with their
culture turns them into you get this
even people at Gramsci it was one of the
more libertarian Marxist but this idea
that humans are simply formed by the
environment and they are nothing but
clay you know passive clay in the hands
of their molders that's an idea which is
very attractive to radical intellectuals
because they think they're going to be
the molders of course and that leads
right to the Leninist version of Marxism
and it does become a kind of orthodoxy
and the earlier views of are either
forgotten or marginalized although
there's certainly there in Marx and they
certainly are in the tradition that he
came from there's a lot to be learned
for Marx that is what well for example
what he wrote about a Russian peasant
society which is not none but it was
pretty interesting but his analysis of
the basic character of kind of an
abstract form of
ilysm which is his main work that's
pretty enlightening I think it doesn't
describe actual societies it's quite
abstract as he insisted but there are
ideas there that can be applied could be
applied then still can be applied very
effectively to the nature of capitalist
society for example to things like the
environmental crisis which Marx and
Engels wrote about in their terms
there's plenty there to learn from he
was also a great reporter on his
commentary on ongoing events in Europe
and India and elsewhere is extremely
revealing it was very penetrating
analyst of social systems
