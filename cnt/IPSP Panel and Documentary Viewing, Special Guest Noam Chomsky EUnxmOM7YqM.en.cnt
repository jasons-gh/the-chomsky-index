but welcome my name is Tom Cristiano I'm
in the Department of Philosophy and
welcome to this wonderful afternoon
we're going to show you this wonderful
documentary about this international
panel on social progress and the themes
that we did I want to thank first just
to start the loft theater the Tucson
Festival of Books which has helped us
organize this the philosophy department
and it's just wonderful to see so many
people coming out to watch this film and
to discuss the ideas we're going to
first have a showing of the film and
that will be about 50 minutes and then
we'll have a panel here we were
especially excited to have Professor
Noam Chomsky here and then we'll be mark
Fleur Bay Lesley OB hora myself elder
Shaffir and Sophia Walter this
documentary so just to start off right
away I'd like to introduce you to Sophia
voltar's who is the the director of the
documentary and she's going to say just
a few words about it hi everybody I'm
Sophie I'm so happy to be here I came
all the way from Amsterdam
I wanna tell you a little bit about a
new society which is the documentary
you're about to watch it's about the
international panel on social progress
IPSP for short we have some of the
panelists here today but it's a panel
made up of about 300 of what I like to
say the world's brightest minds have
come together over the period of four
years to devise a document to help
change the world for the better they
kind of assess where we are today
how we got here and what we can do to
avoid future catastrophe so I thought
their work was extremely important but
it is an academic panel so it was in the
realms of academia it's becoming quite
known but I wanted to make this
documentary so I could bring their work
to a wider audience so we can get more
people to listen to their their findings
and hopefully get some government
officials to make some changes so that
being said I hope you enjoy it feel free
to ask me any questions after I was a
wonderful film
Trude I enjoyed it immensely this is the
first time I've seen it actually I was
part of the IPSP but right now I'm gonna
go right quickly to a discussion I'm
sure you guys have a lot of questions to
ask but let me introduce the panelists
for you I'm Tom Cristiano I'm in the
Department of Philosophy at the
University of Arizona and we have mark
Fleur Bay who's an economist at
Princeton University a Sophie Sophie and
the other thing about mark is that he
was really the guide to the guiding
light of the ipsps the one who got it
going supervised the whole process he
does absolutely
and then we have Sophie voltar's who was
the director of this wonderful
documentary let's give her another hand
[Applause]
fear is here to join us and then we have
professor so what we thought we'd do is
I thought we could start maybe with a
few remarks from Marc Fleur Bay and just
to maybe just frame the whole IPSP
project one more time and then some some
of us will perhaps ask questions of
professor Chomsky what his reactions to
the the film are the book that he's been
looking at and then we'll just go from
there and then we're gonna open it up to
this more general discussion thank you
yes so it's really a privilege as you
can guess to have worked with all these
wonderful colleagues it was quite a
human adventure we had been motivated we
started in 2014 we've been motivated by
a sense of alarm at recent trends
developing in society inequalities and
politics a lot of troubles in many
countries arise of authoritarianism but
also the environment going in the wrong
direction and so we were really afraid
that all the successes and progress
that's been made since especially since
the middle of the 20th century could
unravel and that is new are these new
threads and we felt that as academics of
course we are not philosopher kings our
job is not to make decisions and the
instead of the people but we thought we
could make a contribution to the public
debate we could share our knowledge and
we could try to perhaps
elevate a little bit from the debate and
just share ideas throw ideas so that
people can seize them and and we do
believe that there are many good ideas
around and that need to be experimented
with much more so I won't be long but
just to give you a sense of the film is
it's already a very good description of
the mood the spirit and some of the key
ideas of the the work we've done
I'd really like to invite you to
consider our group as a resource we have
a website
IPSP dot-org where you can find a lot of
the text that we've that we've made the
report itself as the chapters are all
there and an access to the little book
and so on so you have this as a resource
and you can also consider the film as an
interesting resource so we have people
now using it and showing it to students
and students including in high school so
it's an interesting resource as well
just to say a few things about the
content of this of this report and the
book that goes with it so when we
started that I was personally very
curious to see what this large group
about 300 people from all over the world
and all the disciplines of society
what kind of vision what kind of mood
they would convey for their work would
it be all doom and gloom as we see in
some recent books by a pundit 2014 that
was the time of the pickety book if you
may remember so sort of dark vision of
where we are going with capitalism and
so in fact what we have is a sort of
mixed message so it's a message that
very optimistic on the possibilities of
humanity we have a lot of good ideas as
I were saying we know how markets and
governments and other institutions can
succeed or can fail so we have lost
illusions in in all these institutions
so the old ideologies are now gone and
it's in a way it's good we are at a
crossroad of humanity of history and we
can really make good decisions from now
on in a much less ideological way than
used to be done in the previous Center
so that's a very interesting moment
and I think we we see a vision of a
better society or better societies
emerging in the report in the little
book that's called a manifesto for
social progress we try to make the
vision a little more consistent because
this big report which is which is really
three big volumes it's a four pounds of
paper so it's it's a lot it explores all
aspects of society as Sophia summarized
in the in the film so we try to convey a
vision of the sort of post capitalist or
post capitalist socialist struggle
vision it's a sort of Third Way but the
key question that remains unanswered I
would say and that was something that
was really a big question mark for many
authors of the report is who will be the
change makers who will be the movement
to bring that because the vision that's
emerging is a vision which is
essentially a vision of a more
participatory society where people are
more in control of their life and that
more access to decisions that determine
their faith we cannot imagine the change
coming clearly in a top-down way it has
to be a bottom-up movement and one
interesting thing that is said in the
report is that the new actor that's
emerging is is not a very simple actor
through to analyze its civil society and
civil society is full of of lots of
movements going in many directions and
focusing on sometimes very specific
process so it's not a consistent
movement it's not pushing a unified
vision but it's pushing overall very
often good causes and sometimes it's
quite successful in changing the
conversation and changing real real
institutions so that's where the
investment has to be made help civil
society get ideas and push for for
causes we hope that our little
contribution the text we've produced and
the film that Sophia's made will help
pushing in that direction but a lot more
needs to be done we would need I think
now we would need something like a big
platform that would our multiple
platforms that would
not just be the place where people can
deposit can put their advertise their
work but also something that would be
more proactive and would go out and
reach out to the various movements and
and help them coordinate we need to have
now we have transnational corporations
operating of the global scene we have
governments now retreating from global
corporations unfortunately but they are
also operating on the global scene there
is very little of civil society on the
global scene so we need to have much
more there is so but but not enough so
we need to have more we need to have to
see an emergence of of an international
civil society that could really talk to
power talk to these big centers of power
so let me stop here and so that we can
have I'm really good to have a
conversation with you so I'm a scientist
bill economist at Princeton
yes 30 years ago when I was a young
Israeli graduate student at MIT an
enormous influence on my vision both
intellectual in terms of the cognitive
sciences and political and as a social
scientist so it's a special honor and I
was asked to bring up some points that
my children conversation political and
on the cognitive science II side of
things and it touches on things that
both Sophia and Mark have said already
always perplexes me is how much of what
we are seeing is a function of a sort of
malice and calculation and selfishness
and how much is sort of confusion
naivete blurry thinking and blurry
vision that company now of course it
could be obviously a combination of both
but that to me has always been a very
interesting issue and what I found the
report particularly compelling about is
that so much of it looks like it's not
just strategic evil it's just not
getting it most people don't get the
idea that cities were built from men
very serving purposes today people don't
see it that way it's but you know it's
the water they swim in they're not
really aware of what's happening and
that to me is a really interesting issue
in the work that we do I was in the
inequality chapter you take the most
fundamental concept in development
economics Pareto optimality Pareto says
if there's a world in which some of us
are better off and nobody is worse off
that's a good place to go now it may not
be true in dollars or or marks or yen's
what I mean by that I mean that if I
make these ten lovely people here are
getting 100 percent raise and the rest
of you I'll give no raise there's plenty
of evidence to suggest the world being
in this room will have gone down so
nobody's making less this is a deep
issue it basically says if written at
GDP and ignore inequality you're missing
up the whole point I don't know how much
of it is now how much of it is
misunderstanding clearly some people
benefit from what I see people running
offices and Treasury and DC not sure I'm
not sure they understand this issue I'm
not sure the many of our millionaires
understand but if they gave up gave up a
couple of millions and in return could
go to the theater without having to stop
over homeless people they'd be happier
not sure they know so those are the
issues that I think are kind of
fundamentally very profound in this
report and this is exactly what I think
Chomsky's had some deep thinking before
take it from there so first of all
shout-out to Tucson you might with my
the people who I called avatars of the
spirit of my village in the Sonoran
Desert
Linda and Alex who were part of hosting
Sophie when Sophie came Sophie did not
know not that Linda and Alex know you
know that that was the most challenging
perhaps week of my life my entire life
and I had on what I had to do the show
had to continue
and I guess all of this just brings me
to the point that Elder had made and to
what accounts for my bias for hope you
know and the reason why I jumped on
board for this he talks about how the
politicians may not necessarily know
perhaps the pressures of the political
calendar that doesn't even allow them
the luxury of trying to care right but
we are the people that are there to
govern for and we are the ones there and
who are going to be the breath drivers
of change this is why I wanted to just
add my own few cents to how we can
figure out what then now how we can
individually and collectively exercise
our agency to be able to take back this
patrimony I talked about the fact that
you know the politicians have been in
government before I was the I was
Minister of the Federal Republic of
Nigeria for mines and steel development
you know when you are there you do your
part you move on you're trying to
optimize whatever your time is you're
not necessarily thinking about the
future
so our politicians really the ones that
we should entrust responsibility for
sustainability and stuff like that too
you know shouldn't accountability be
something that we outsource to something
that would be much more enduring and
there ways that we can figure out how to
improve on this and you know for me
really the attraction the appeal of the
project was as I looked around and I was
reminded of I think it was Charles
Dickens that in The Tale of Two Cities
that talked about those being the best
and the worst of times you know as you
see all the darkness that seems to be
prevailing you also get so much you know
of the possibilities that enhances your
passion for those possibilities and
makes you keep trying to figure out how
I think none other than Lady gaga
actually talks about the discipline for
passion you know that you just have to
keep at it you have to figure out what
you're what matters to you what your
core values are what you're not willing
to compromise what you're what you must
keep on fighting for and maybe for you
Americans all of those strange for me as
a Nigerian I came here as a 23 year old
precisely running away from what you're
experiencing 32 years after
I stay in the United States I think it
was Cynthia Dickstein who reminded me of
what I told her when George Bush was in
office that I said that Americans lack
imagination about what could happen to
their country what this is a today
what's happening and does that mean that
we just we throw up our hands in despair
and say woe is us no we just we have to
exercise our agency and figure out how
to do it and this is why though public
outreach the public engagement that is
happening at the loft is so important to
me and why I'm very grateful to all of
you who took the time to come despite
those shot noticed because we didn't
stop mobilizing on time and even
regardless of the constraints of time
you are still king so we're looking
forward to your feedback about this
single blog which is very much worth
reading you get the sense of it from the
documentary but this goes into much more
detail and importantly with constructive
suggestions as to how to move forward as
somebody said in the film it opens a
conversation most of all the issues that
the film and the book touch on just
about every aspect of life but what is
pointed out correctly is that for almost
all of us most of our lives we spend in
a working environment that's the large
part of our lives and the fact of the
matter is is we spend most of us spend
most of our lives in dictatorial
environments
political a recent book calls
private governments
which are more totalitarian than
totalitarian states when you're in a
workplace you're under total control
you're abandoning yourself completely to
the next higher level of control than it
goes up to the top level of control and
if nothing say about it at the bottom
you can choose to rent yourself to one
of the dictatorships or to starve this
is taken up in the book and interesting
ways of suggesting ways to make the
system more participatory and since this
opens our conversation I'd like to carry
a little folk forward so one of the
sources cited I'm sure the three volumes
go into this and much more detail but
here it's brief is John Stuart Mill a
very significant figure
so mil is quoted as saying that as an
alternative to capitalism an alternative
capitalism should involve the
replacement of capitalist relations by
real partnerships in which workers would
have a say and the governments of
productive associations in their
capacity of work providers not as owners
of capital not as managers and in this
form labor with higher capital that's
okay as far as it goes but actually a
mill went considerably farther in
important ways important enough so that
I picked it up and quoted it this is
from mill the form of Association which
if mankind continued to improve must be
expected to predominate is the
Association of the labourers themselves
on terms of equality collectively owning
the capital with which they carry on
their operations and working under
managers electable unremovable by
themselves notice that in this picture
there is no distinction between workers
managers and owners those who work in
the in the enterprise are the managers
and the owners of course a broader
picture which is richly developed in
much of the left literature over the
years is that these would be in
associations with self-governing
communities but as far as the workplace
itself is concerned there is no
distinction between worker manager and
owner that's an important idea to pursue
and in fact it's related to another
point that's brought up in the book
which is probably the most radical con
comment here but not pursue but it could
be I'm sure is in these volumes workers
who sign a labor contract sell their
dignity as stakeholders when they accept
the subordination stipulated in the
contract and they sell it for nothing
given that the pressure of unemployment
makes them accept working for almost any
kind of organization in other words the
work contract itself is illegitimate
it says illegitimate as selling yourself
into slavery and it's worth noting these
two notions interrelated if the firm not
just the corporation but any firm is a
dictatorship in which for most of our
working lives we subordinate ourselves
to tyranny with no choice there's a real
problem if the idea that workers and
stakeholders meaning people in the
community should have a voice in this
dictatorship is a step forward but John
Stuart Mill went far beyond he said
there should be no dictatorship there
should be just the association of people
who are doing productive work whatever
it may be they choose their managers and
can recall them if they don't like them
and are constantly in control over them
no division no managers no workers no
owners that's a much more extreme
position and it's the illegitimate of
the labor contract which is pointed out
in the quote I just mentioned leads us
in that direction and in fact it's worth
mentioning as this probably discussed in
the volumes that this is classical
liberalism it's not just John Stuart
Mill begins with John Locke goes to
Smith Thomas Payne Abraham Lincoln the
whole of classical liberalism until it
was pretty much destroyed by industrial
capitalism but the whole tradition of
classical liberalism holds that the work
contract is illegitimate
so for Abraham Lincoln and believe it or
not the Republican Party a major
principle was that wage labor is
distinguishable from slavery only in
that it's temporary they have a chance
to get out of it pretty soon and being
the person who is not under the control
of a master and much more interesting
this was the dominant view of the
American working class there was a very
lively label crust in the mid 19th
century one of its crucial ideas was
essentially this so they pointed out
that the press discusses working people
some of them many of them women from the
from the farms factory girls they were
cold who were forced to go into the
mills had their own publications
artisans blacksmith and hours blacksmith
and boss and so on eastern Massachusetts
they pointed out when you go into the
capitalist system system of dictatorship
but you're moving from as a system of
price to wage when an artisan sells his
work for a price he retains his person
when he sells himself to a master he
loses his person in his dignity
this is a fundamental infringement on
human rights in a free society it should
not be expected these are directions I
think that can be pursued much further
probably are pursued in the volumes
and it's one of the many points where I
think this material offers a very good
starting place for a conversation as was
mentioned that can proceed to real
serious rethinking of the nature of
society in many respects I've picked
just one but the same could be said of
the many other dimensions that are
brought up in this quite impressive and
very humane approach to how to deal with
the severe problems we face so to son I
bragged about you I said you all would
have questions and we have a lot of time
to show up
Thomas were going to use this bat one
because a battery died on the other one
I have a willing participant well I
recently heard a discussion about the
surveillance capitalism and Democracy
Now which was something we all are aware
I think in this audience are aware of
but to hear it talked about was just
uncanny that's just a comment my
question is very simple is this film
available for sale and could you tell us
about the cost restrictions or you can
buy it online you could rent it online
you can Google search new society for
rent or go to Wilma's wishes calm and
it's there available to rent and buy and
how much is it I think it's like $7.99
or $8.99 okay tell your friends well I
think it's great I mean it was a
marvelous marvelous very compassionate
simple seemingly simple but I'm just so
pleased I came today thank you thank you
thank you so much please if you have
questions just come to out so that we
will save some time that much and the
loft has also been kind enough to us to
give us some extra time so we would
really appreciate your constructive
feedback hi thank you all for being here
first of all I'm just I'm wondering how
does the panel and the ipsp generally
view the issue of mass incarceration and
specifically the disenfranchisement of
felons as a barrier to social progress
and how can we move forward in this
regard
so I happened to teach love and teach
human rights and I think that that what
we see happening today in the society is
actually an expression of how far we've
moved away from our fundamental or our
visions so for the human sorry folk the
preeminent law system there are various
guiding principles it's not just about
punishment
it's about rehabilitation and then we
focus so much on punishment to the point
now that it has become in fact an
industry that has taken us even further
away so in terms of trying to reclaim
pass the conversations and the light
that's being shared on the abuses of
that system is actually quite
encouraging and hopefully some more
could be done in that direction as well
and maybe others come back to this again
just pushing the behavioural research we
under appreciate small contextual stuff
we're not even talking about sort of
Michele Zander everyday stuff banker is
nice to you and I tracking and the
teachers are looking at the black kid
when he or she does something wrong the
teacher sees it the black the white kids
could be beating each other up to death
she's not even looking at them so
there's these contextual nuances that
have an enormous impact us on us above
and beyond the legal system is
problematic which is again back to this
idea of how do we fix naive people who
misunderstand their everyday society and
you know who do we educate the president
the mayors of the governor's the
teachers what level do we go to have
impact that this report
to say that if we look at the history of
the judicial system we find that there
really are opportunities to move forward
the United States happens to have a very
regressive system particularly since
1980 go back to 1980 the level of
incarceration in the United States and
about the same as your slightly higher
but within the main framework now it's
five to ten times as high as any the
reason is pretty much a highly punitive
and very racist drug war which was
initiated but take another Society takes
a Norway one of the great criminologist
happens to be in Norwegian Neil Christie
he reviews the history of criminology in
Norwood you go back to the 19th century
it was one of the most punitive in the
world they didn't have that they didn't
have to have prisons wasn't necessary
because if someone was accused of
robbing a store you just drive a stake
through the sand I happened to be in
Norway one or two couple of years ago
you may have read that there was a
terrible mass murder there there was a
guy named Anders Breivik who went into a
youth camp and murdered 80 people
he was found the apprehended went on
trial by just coincidence I happen to be
there right at the time when the when he
was apprehended and at the time when the
judgment was released a couple months
later he was he was sentenced of course
to the maximum sentence possible in
Norway 21 years with possibility of
rehabilitation and if not then another
added sentence he is imprisoned in
circumstances which you just can't
in the united states he has a room
television set he's being treated as a
human being who can be returned to
becoming a member of society this is so
radically different not only from our
conception but what from Norway was not
that long ago that it does give a sense
of what can be achieved dr. Bergeron
this hopeful notes because there is a
movement for an alternative form of
criminal justice which is called
restorative justice and it has some
roots in various parts of the world
South Africa has been this one to to was
mentioned in the film right so that was
it that evoked in the film I wanted to
mention that even though the the US
society is the one with the highest rate
of incarceration in the whole world now
right so we talked about villains in
other countries but this is where we
have the highest rate all over the world
in spite of that the restaurant if
justice movement is actually in strong
roots also in the u.s. and so it's very
interesting to see that you have good
ideas sprouting in many places including
here Book Festival yesterday we talked
about the importance of you know trying
to really figure out how to invigorate
our roles as stakeholders and to go back
to conversations about civic virtue
virtue and all that so that it's not
just at the problem stage that we begin
to talk about incarceration and all that
but how do we begin to inculcate again
some of these values how do we even
begin to clarify what the core values
are and then you know use them to a
socialization system to make sure that
at the end of the day that we as voters
know exactly what our role should be
in a democracy that we can return people
to office who can go there and serve
those values that we are interested in
so this is all part of the system and
it's not just about trying to figure out
how to reform the preeminent justice
system but it's also you know trying to
figure out what some of the drivers for
the need for inform at that end is yeah
my name is Adam Christian you know each
other I am very excited to hear this but
most of you are in ivory towers you're a
philosopher in your department and I
consider every child with the exception
of anomalies as philosophers they are
born as philosophers and they are mostly
shared there there is healthy dose of
selfishness in them but they share with
others they don't have color they don't
discriminate based on color and stuff
but they are getting corrupted by two
forces one is religion the other is
nationalism and both of them use emotion
in order to suppress the reasoning and
to manipulate and throughout history
sometimes religion is major dominant and
leader nations and this is I have been
teaching 20 years philosophy and I am
perhaps the most social very active in
social media when I see a person whose
mouth is mess from hunger and that
person praises the guy who made the
biggest mansion in the world for himself
1150 rooms in Turkey and this guy talk
about religion about how we should be
content with what God has given us he
talked about the saints who had -
clothes and this guy stole so much how
he waved the holy walk and another if it
was not enough wave flag this - enough
for making people to become enemy of
themselves I have seen in my classes
when I say three people in the United
States three persons have more wealth
than 50% of American people whatever you
have there is something wrong in the
system and I see the guy beyond man who
not afford by a hex book he he's the one
who is trying to defend the system
because the system from the school
destroyed the critical thinking and I
think that very important thing to in
vulture to raise concern about education
system create kind of memories
spectacles holding their brain
memorization of things not critical
thinking and therefore I hope that we
have more awareness about making
critical thinking as a core curriculum
in our education so that our children
will see when there is problems and I'm
glad you Lindo you're an educator so
hopefully you're doing your part in that
to that extent all right thank you so
much for your observation I don't know
if anyone has any thoughts to add to
what you deep just passionately
underscored the importance of making
critical thinking part of the education
system we also come just look around us
and see that the educational system that
is being increasingly developed is one
that is oriented towards regurgitating
what was poured into you in a test I
mean I don't know the Arizona system
very well have been here long but I
lived in Massachusetts which supposed to
be very progressive state I spent I did
spend time talking to teachers and what
they say is increasingly that they
cannot teach student let students pursue
their interests if a kid comes up in a
sixth grade class and says you know that
was interesting what we talked about I'd
like to do something about it the
teacher has to say sorry you can't
because you have to study to pass the
end Casa clown test that's given and
this teaching to test system that's been
imposed
and of course as we all know I'm sure
we've all had the experience of studying
for a test and some subject we hadn't
the slightest interest in passing the
test and two days later forgetting what
the subject was that's what it's like
that's the kind of education that's been
imposed increasingly it was bad enough
before but increasingly by state
authorities independent of party it was
the Bush administration of the Obama
administration of developing programs of
trying to cut back of course they won't
say this but having the effect of
cutting back critical thinking by
training students to repeat what they
learn put it in the test they have to
have have to pass that test for their
own benefit and even for the benefit of
the teacher if the teacher doesn't get a
good enough scores on the MCATs they're
in trouble so it's a whole system of
doing exactly the opposite of what the
person had just asked the question
brought up one maybe further comment on
religion the woman who was speaking I
didn't catch her name on the religion
have pointed out that religion can be
used for oppression it can be used for
liberation and it's very interesting to
see what has happened in our lifetimes
about this something very interesting
happened you all know I'm sure about the
famous School of the Americas now
there's a different name which trains
Latin American killers basically they
have talking points advertising their
achievements one of the talking points
is very interesting it says the US Army
helped defeat Liberation Theology what's
Liberation Theology
well it was something that grew out of
an attempt
the Vatican 2 pope john xxiii initiated
an effort to return the church to the
gospels
that was very radical the gospels are
radical pacifist
that's why Christians were persecuted
before Constantine took it over and made
it the religion of the Roman Empire so
he wanted to say let's go back to the
Gospels to the principle of preferential
option for the poor Latin American
bishops took it up priests nuns of
laypersons went to poor communities had
them to start reading the Gospels think
what it actually is saying that begin to
try to organize their own communities
recognized as whoever made the point I
said it's not just God has given this
accept it change your lives
take control of what you're doing I'll
try to move forward and create a decent
life for yourself that set in motion a
massive war against the church run from
the United States it lit horrendous
atrocities few of which are even known
here I doubt that there are many people
here who could even name the six Latin
American intellectuals Jesuit priests
who had their heads the brains blown out
in November 1989 right after the Berlin
Wall fell ending a series of vicious
persecutions of the church because it
was trying to be a Liberatore Church
well these are things we should know
about ourselves these are things that
should be taught in the schools you can
have the Liberatore element in religion
in other aspects of social life
but there are power systems that don't
want them and until we get truly
participatory systems that's going to
continue today I do most organ on the
poor and the poor have an image problem
very often and we have a problem
ecologist called attribution basically
you know if I lose my temper with my
child it's because I haven't slept well
and Trump is president and your child
it's because you're a bad parent that's
how we tend to think we attribute what
we see to the person this is a nightmare
for the poor because they end up being
late and forgetful and how many coal is
washed exactly don't speak well it's a
real real problem there's a whole
attempt so the budding attempt to work
on that on basically narrative change
how do you change what people think when
they see the poor the Europeans by the
way do a better job with us you know
there but for the grace of God go I
emerges in the European brain faster
than Disney America but this is the
narrative changes an interesting issue
there probably the biggest success of
narrative change in modern America has
been the LGBTQ this is really a group
that met glad ways met meets four years
ago decides to make a difference on the
success position has been enormous and
here is an interesting fact the LGBTQ
agenda was is it going against the
Christian Church in the US and massively
Christian nation and they did fairly
well when you look at poverty we should
have a church on our side this is the
number one player and what you find is
in the streets of America today when
people need food it is still a friend
but in the greater scheme of things we
now have the prosperity gospel which is
basically the opposite it basically says
you know everything Jesus said in this
short life forget it it's if you're rich
that's the song that God loves you and
all of a sudden the church is not
helping the agenda of inequality in the
u.s. today
I also in my observation in the film I
talked very empirically about the role
of the church in Nigeria I talked about
how it is a best evolved not just the
church but faith-based institutions are
best involved infrastructures you know
in my country that there are networks of
churches and mosques in places where we
don't even have roots the government has
not built roots the government does not
know that those roots that those
communities quite frankly substantively
exist so that at the end of the day you
can talk about social service delivery
and the effectiveness thereof without
taking into consideration you know what
the church is doing what the church has
done yes we have a very complicated
history from colonialism with what the
missionaries did as the handmaiden of
colonialism but the legacy thereof as
well is that you know the church still
keeps giving back to these societies so
you cannot talk about social progress
regardless of your disappointment with
the church
without really looking at what they are
doing in other places in the world yes
my name is Patrick deal I'd like to ask
what ideas have emerged from your large
assembly of people about combating the
very strong human tendency to groupthink
and here I have in mind both the
tendency to form a group that's defined
by a set of beliefs police the group in
terms of those beliefs if a person
deviates from them they risk their group
affiliation the previous questioner
mentioned a couple of areas in which
this tendency has been very strong
religion and nationalism I think there
was a series of lectures by Doris
Lessing in the late 80s called prisons
we choose to live inside which addresses
the issue of how hard it is from within
a group to find the guts to disagree
with group okay another point she made
is that people are very resistant
then and unfortunately still now 30
years later to paying attention to the
findings of social science which you
folks are representing specifically
human cognitive defects like the
confirmation bias the tendency to apply
very crude heuristic rules of thumb and
third the tendency not to recognize how
powerful group pressure is on you
personally and what a difficult thing it
is to deal with it so there's that
innate I think tendency in us primates
to form groups but there are also large
groups in the social system that benefit
from enhancing the tendency to
groupthink
put a lot of money and power into
keeping us in these prisons this
blessing called them so the cokes for
instance in this country their donor net
worth in one example so I'm just
wondering what in the three volumes or
in the short version you have to say
about that obviously if we could go back
to kindergarten and change the
educational system get critical thinking
supported which obviously disfavors the
power groups in our society they don't
want critical thinking okay if we could
do that then we could create people who
could escape the prisons that I've been
describing yes but in the meantime we've
actually existing people who have gone
through this system including me and all
the rest of us have been damaged by it
to varying degrees and you know it kind
of flummoxed as me what to do for us
who've already been through the mill to
help us get out of our own limitations
to break out of the prisons that we're
in this seems to be a really fundamental
problem thanks for listening
to point out so you ask you are asking
about where in the report this issue is
advanced its address in a few places I
guess one will say more about democratic
institutions and the political debate
but there is one chapter about the media
and the role of the media and the social
media so it's about communication more
broadly which is I think addressing some
aspects of the problem you are
describing it very well especially the
polarization of society and the role the
social media have played recently in
fostering these emergence of bubbles
where people live in different universes
of thought and don't listen to other
other sources of information and so
what's interesting there is that and
that's really a general thread in the
report not separatory mechanisms or it
can play a role there as well so we need
the democratic governance of the media
and the social media system in the sense
of checking the role of money you
mentioned the Koch brothers that have
indeed a very important source of
changing the conversation in the US over
the last three decade but also the role
of the state you have states which have
a role which is also very murky in the
in the in the sphere of the media and
communication and if you look at what's
happening in China now it's it's going
in the direction that's quite amazing so
but so we need to have so we cannot
trust either just the market of five
years and money we cannot trust the
government so we need to have additional
watchdogs and that's where civil society
can play a role and they give the
example of Brazil I mean Brazil is
perhaps no longer an example since the
last months but they have done very
interesting things there are many
participatory innovations that have been
really coming from Latin America and in
Brazil they had a really a big sort of
discussion about how to deal with
Internet governance and they had a sort
of charter to define how to involve
civil society watchdogs in doing that
and that is perhaps not a blueprint that
can be used everywhere but but it
certainly shows some of the direction
where we need different watchdogs to to
guarantee the independence the quality
of the the media system and the social
media system of course the social media
system is very complex
and it's something that's hard to
monitor because the contents are moving
so quickly but now artificial
intelligence is fighting against that so
it's fighting back in a way so we have
now ways new ways apparently that are
able to identify fake sources of
information very very quickly it's a
matter of seconds and that's that the
speed that you need to have to react to
this sort of thing so so yeah so there
are there are different ways of dealing
with that and so there is I think we can
we can be hopeful but of course you have
vested interests that will push in the
other direction and you are very right
that this is a key source of worry yeah
I mean I think what I'm gonna say is
just an extension of what Mark was
saying but I mean the whole idea of
democracy in some sense is to counter
groupthink I mean that's that's its
major supposed to be its major advantage
right because I mean you have groupthink
and lots of different societies you have
propaganda and lots of societies you
have polarization group polarization and
lots of authoritarian societies use
these mechanisms all the time to advance
the interests of the state or whatever a
particular group that is the key thing
about democracy is supposed to be that
well what happens is you if you have a
group that may be somewhat insular but
there are other groups around and so
once you mobilize of the larger
constituency to inter intervene in some
sense like in the case of these media
like in a fact checkers and the press
and so on these are all democratic
devices that occur when you somehow get
out of the group and that the connect
the profit group processes I think the
one major challenge though for democracy
right now and I don't know exactly how
it's going to be overcome so it's a
uncertain about this is there does seem
to be an increasing segregation and in
the insularity of various kinds of
groups making them somewhat less a
responsive
to the larger society to criticism the
law of the larger society on the grounds
that oh we can't trust these other
people you know you can't so you know
the New York Times as a fact-checker
thing when they when somebody gives a
speech well if you're in favor of that
person you say oh we can't chop trust
the New York Times because it's you know
it's biased and so on and of course it
is biased I mean everybody's biased
that's a natural thing the whole point
of course is of a system like democracy
is that you bring all these people who
have biases but I have different biases
in different directions and then you
hope to sort of filter out the less
desirable ideas and you know modify and
improve the ideas but I think we have to
we have to overcome a problem that we're
experiencing more and more of of a kind
of insularity and a lack of large-scale
social solidarity and social trust I
think in part it's up to us to do that
as individuals in part I mean that's
part of the job of each Democratic
citizen is to try to extend the area of
solidarity and Trust to try to you know
to check facts but also do it in a
respectful way and try to get debate and
discussion going with people who we
don't agree with and not demonize them
that's I think you know a part of what
we have to do here to break the
insulation insularity that can happen
that it seems to be happening more and
more in democracy so in some sense up to
us as citizens to do that I think I just
wanted to bring something to the table
that I do think that things are changing
for the younger generation if we just
take a simple example of the LGBT
community and how they don't necessarily
want to be considered part of the LGBT
letting now its LGBTQ X Y Z you know
there's you can be anything now but
there's of many people
all that they say well I don't want to
be a part of a group I don't want to be
a part of a label because I am Who I am
and that's all that matters to me I
don't need to be in a certain category
so that's like a trend in society that's
happening now where people feel like
they don't they don't need to be
necessarily a part of a group because
they don't have to have a certain label
and that's coming out in different
aspects of society as well so I just
think that's an interesting interesting
thing to think about well just add a
thought let's not try to develop we
could start with the famous Delphic
Oracle know thyself we can ask to what
extent all of us virtually are
susceptible to groupthink so look across
the whole media landscape major media
political landscape let's see if you can
find someone who questions some of the
verities that are taken for granted and
very serious ones I'll just pick two
because they might lead to major
terminal wars one of them is Iran is the
greatest world threat we have to do
something about Iranian nuclear weapons
does the world agree with us on this the
world thinks we're insane you know and
there are very simple ways to deal with
the problem of potential Iranian nuclear
weapons like for example establishing a
nuclear weapons free zone in the Middle
East is that hard to do well the Arab
states are in favor of it Iran is
strongly in favor of it the non-aligned
countries which most of the world are in
favor of Europe's in favor of it either
happens in one country two countries
that block it
most recently Obama namely the United
States and Israel
because if you had a nuclear-free zone
in the Middle East the United States
would have to acknowledge what it knows
but can't say that Israel has nuclear
weapons which automatically means
cutting off all aid to Israel and
inspecting Israeli weapons so for that
reason we have to have a nuclear weapons
threat in Iran does anybody say this
well
trickles here and there but let's take
the other major one North Korea there
right now is uniformity across the press
as far as I can see that Trump walked
away from a bad deal that what was the
bad deal that North Korea would
partially denuclearize and we would
partially reduce sanctions that are
strangling the country you might ask the
question whether there's any
justification for the sanctions but
we'll put that aside
oh that's uniformly regarded as a bad
deal there's anybody question is it a
bad deal would it be a step towards
moving towards resolving one of the
worst threats that in the world for many
years is it what the Koreans want well I
think they told us what they want to
move step by step towards
denuclearization and integration on
their own accord without interference
that was the declaration in April 2017
important declaration is anybody raising
this question I mean the fact of the
matter is we go case-by-case we all
subject ourselves to groupthink on issue
after issue of extreme importance and I
think there's a kind of a good rule of
thumb that's worth keeping in mind if
anything is accepted almost universally
and the issue is significant and might
have two sides that we should worry
about
we should be recognizing that we're
subordinating ourselves to very
dangerous groupthink
it's not just the others but we still
have some more time so to honor your
time I know that there are a number of
people who want to ask questions why
don't we take the questions and then
we'll see how many of them we can reach
especially since your questions are also
feedback for us yes I'm really happy to
be here there is a well that's a good
pitch for alternative media so that's
this is often the only source we have
for for going outside of the box with
information that comes out of the
mainstream but I haven't I'm looking for
some advice on very kind of local local
parochial politics here I sit on the
Executive Committee of the Democratic
Party and one of the things we're going
to be in Pima County and today let's see
it's this evening we're gonna be
considering let's see maybe it's
tomorrow we're going to be considering
[Music]
endorsing Tucson as a sanctuary City
yeah so this is an issue of like what is
their political calculations and doing
this kind of thing you know there's
we've got so the question is so we have
a choice many people will say well this
is going to a lien eight people right
and we need to and there are it'll
alienate people that are kind of more
centrist and more interests you know
they and that we need to choose our
battles I'm kind of of the opinion
personally that we need to teach we need
to declare our values and we need to
educate people and teach people about
this
so I'm just wondering you know this this
is kind of it's a very parochial matter
but also it has much you know I mean
nationwide implications really so I have
the technology to do this now already
decentralized new media that goes
through the internet you can find
information whether you're on Facebook
Twitter it pops up shows you if there
are other alternative ways to look at
any particular issue its issues base it
pulls together facts so everything
that's facts is vetted it shows who you
are and anonymizes people we've got this
the ideal participatory global democracy
means for anybody who can reach the
Internet and also there on the grounds
means of getting people's votes either
pass to someone who knows or direct
voting so there are lots of details to
this but let's say we already have this
how do you as academics then trust the
populace knowing that they would have
full information we know what facts you
can analyze information the relations
between you do you think that that would
work and even if it did do we have
enough time so many thoughts first my
name is Oliver I'm a school teacher I've
taught kindergarten through twelfth
grade social studies and it seems like
the core thing we're all speaking about
is education there's a crisis in America
educators across the country are going
on strike demanding more paid and it
seems like if there's one place where we
could collectively put our efforts it's
in appealing it's a tearing or appealing
to those causes
I work a second job simply to afford my
lifestyle the critical thinking
standards that you want teachers to
teach there there
part of the issue is we are so
overworked and challenging we're
fighting the social media system every
student begins every single day in my
classroom looking at this device I have
to overcome that challenge simply to get
from point A to point s in the process
of giving them the fundamental knowledge
they need to understand to get to that
level of critical thinking and if
there's one place I would suggest
focusing the effort is empowering
teachers in America by increasing pain
increasing working standards you're
going to bring teachers who can afford
the opportunity to think for themselves
as Noam Chomsky mentioned or were just
slaves to our master because we're so
schooling as an institution is a huge
contributor to keeping the status quo
and the systems of inequality systemic
chemical inequality in place right so my
question is about what responsibilities
do we have to our future generations to
unpack some of these issues that are
presented here around climate change
social justice issues things like
liberation and Liberatore education so
what is our responsibility to our
generations to unpack those in the
institution of schooling and
particularly in public schools which
presents a lot of challenges and how my
teachers navigate that I am Torbett the
film opened with the discussion of how
this company's conversations are not
happening
this is bridge building between academia
policymakers and NGOs as it's working in
academia the struggles with getting
getting policymakers that listen
academic work is part of the problem but
getting academics to do meaningful work
for them to be rewarded within their
department store that worked at Wilson
school certain departments really reward
this but a lot of academia does not
really reward as much relevant work they
can really make a difference in people's
lives did you talk about the struggle
that you all have seen you've obviously
found homes where your works rewarded
but someone inspiring it's it's been
been a struggle to find those types of
homes I just want to say thank you so
much and Sophie congratulations on this
amazing movie and I hope you know it's
not the enemy to make our generation
proud and I just want to make sure
everyone has the optimism that I share
with Leslie that there is so much to be
blessed in this country we're so
grateful for everything around the world
that this is the time in human history
that we should really be excited about
and so much on TV we see all this
negative stuff and it really impacts the
psyche of a lot of people and
unfortunately it shouldn't really
because at the end of the day your life
still goes on but these matters in these
people's minds feels like it's right at
the front door and I think it impacts
them in a negative way overall I think
we should have optimism and attack with
these problems with that optimism I
think we also shouldn't give hope on
politicians helping in this fight
I think campaign finance is a huge issue
and Lawrence Lessig a presidential
candidate he had a great idea for it and
I think there's opportunities regardless
of citizens united you know to overcome
that hurdle first before they can be
stakeholders in that cause and what Noam
Chomsky said about the the paradigm of
corporations and how we should view it I
think that's that's something to think
about but I also think you know wages
have stagnated in this
for a very long time and that's maybe
the very big issue that no one's really
talking about on other side and if we
can tie those wages of the hard workers
to the profits of a company in the top
executives that we can see a dramatic
increase in a lot of things and we got
to focus on myself in education I was
clapping loud when Norma Thomas we
talked about it was a product of many
years of education and it is short-term
memory a lot of it and it's a crisis
right now in student debt and we need to
be tackling this in many different ways
urgently but thank you so much everybody
for doing this thank you I know there's
been great importance placed on creating
discourse and I just want you to know in
what particular ways what kind of care
we can take with the language we use um
to kind of prevent alienation and
isolation of particular groups of people
we're talking about social progress
my name's Ben my question is as far as
indigenous people how how has the panel
and others address communities that have
in the past looked at you know
structuring their law and their social
structure in the way that respects the
earth this is just my own quick outline
of the question is that I heard
unfortunately I didn't hear the second
one because I was seeing afar
distinguished guests but the very first
one had to do with advice on the
sanctuary City the second one maybe
Sophie and Mark and elder would remind
us of the third one I just abbreviated
as read for ED the importance of you
know rema narrating educator since
really they are the lifeline of always
or aspirations then responsibility to
future generations to unpack some of
these complexity
bridging the gap in the struggle how do
you is this thankless work you know or
can we have what to do it because we
come from institutions they actually
acknowledge this kind of service and all
and thus these are my own destinations
of what you said so they may not be that
accurate then by us for hope I really
want to commend Yaya and I'm going to
speak to that as well
the young man who wants to figure out
how we can you know improve on our own
emotional intelligence quotients and you
know be more caring about the language
you use in trying to reach out if we are
blaming other people for good thing we
also have a responsibility to figure out
how we can take on some of these
challenges and then the indigenous
people and their own worldview and that
has stood the test of time quite frankly
and how do we begin to honor some of
those traditions and insights thereof so
the second one was a challenging
question it was about if you imagine but
if we have the democracy going through a
lot of freedom to access information and
to create information and messaging and
communication how would that work and
with the academic I think the question
was indeed by with the academics trust
the populace so I think yes we can trust
the populace but we cannot trust and we
cannot trust people
people's whims because people are very
irrational but if we put people in the
right circumstances then we can have
something more interesting and so there
have been a lot of experiments of
participatory democracy and so you don't
I mean the immediate referendum for
instance it's not something that works
very well because people vote
essentially on the wind at the whim of
the day or just they dislike the
politician will call for the referendum
but you have mini-publics you have
citizen juries you have forms where you
really gather people together to gather
them and you give them information and
you put them in the right context so
that they can think about it and discuss
that with other people and what you
obtain from these mini-publics and civil
authority groups is much more
interesting and once you have groups
like that
it becomes really something that can be
a great contribution to the public
debate so we've seen many examples and
and the producer of the film I did enjoy
it was worked with with Sophie has been
very closely associated with something
similar that happened in Iceland when
they redrew their constitution it was
done through a sort of mini public it
was first a large mini public and then a
real small public but it was done openly
with ordinary people who were completely
selected at random in the first stage
and then elected on a wide basis in the
second stage but it was ordinary people
not politicians right and not not
Supreme Court justices or people like
that and they made a constitution that's
really worth reading
unfortunately the politicians have
blocked the process so the Constitution
is not yet endorsed is not yet ratified
by the Parliament there but it has been
a big battle so yeah so we can trust the
populace provided that we give them the
right the right conditions if I could
say something about countries and
indigenous countries very briefly this
has been the fascinating it's not my
topic of research I'm an economist but I
really enjoyed reading the the work of
my colleagues in the report because they
really talk about the fact that this is
this story about multiple modalities
it's really you see a sort of
convergence of the country right so the
different cultures are different and
they come from different views of the
world and the universe but what's
interesting is that we can have a
constructive dialogue across cultures
something that's not like imperialism we
have the light and we'll show it to you
but something where people can really
confront their views and come up with
some convergence and one interesting
thing for this is precisely our relation
to nature so the Western had
post-enlightenment attitude which was
really a sort of hubristic attitude of
we can exploit nature we are the masters
of the world was not the vision of many
other countries and now we are learning
we Westerners we are
that we should really go to war with
them because they were right and we were
wrong and so this kind of evolution is
very interesting okay I think we just
have to be empathetic towards each other
and see each other as as people and
humans not specifically wool so I think
that's key that's the most important
yeah so there are a lot of wonderful
questions and we can answer it all of
them but there's one theme that I want
to pick on that I think was common to
many of them and I think the teacher
actually gave part of the answer
democracy when the big segment of the
population is worried about losing their
home and can't eat people cannot be
informed citizens and and so that my
quick answer to that question is no I
wouldn't trust the word about you know
their lunch for Friday and kids school
fees so no the Void groupthink is a lot
of work it doesn't come easy the reason
we're all group thinkers because you
know with deep understanding of the
world
good luck you need time you need
information to do that and then the
people who are gonna be in your meeting
the Democratic Party I think Muslims
don't know enough about immigration in
Arizona I don't even know if they know
that you don't allow them on the
undocumented to drive to drive ahead how
honest ed at Arizona a hundred degrees
in no subway if you can't drive do you
do anything I think if people had a
deeper understanding of the issues they
might have more empathy so I think if
citizens look um if you when you read
that 46 million Americans are poor you
might know all this but you're reading
about the number report below the
poverty line which is kind of an
anachronistic silly measure about 110
hundred twenty million cannot finish the
month this is not even better months the
money runs out before the month these
are people who don't have time to become
informed deep anti groupthink voters
they aren't struggling and so the
democracy again as a result is a very
messy arrangement and there's a reason
why it doesn't always go well I think to
me the number one thing is every
well-intentioned intelligent American
which is most needs to be able to sleep
give the kids home food in the morning
be able to see a doctor and then they
can vote or be informed one last comment
we're not then talk about the the green
No Deal the green No Deal how much you
know about it has been criticized partly
because if instead of focusing only on
the environment there's other stuff to
me that is the most brilliant element in
the entire story the gree the green No
Deal says we're gonna do things that
help environment but we're also gonna
make sure that America is a guaranteed
housing health care and living wage
think about that now if you are somebody
who's worried about feeding your kid and
finishing the month or getting evicted
how much time are you gonna spend
worrying about the environment 200 years
from now it's not your problem now what
they're doing is saying to you you go
after the environment because then it
will solve your food and housing next
week
that's brilliant you're active issues
that are burning to you now while also
taking care of something in the long
distance which you'd never have time to
think about otherwise so anyway that to
me the number one was cognitive load you
have to liberate people let them live a
minimally acceptable life so they can
become so I also want to come back to
what elder had talked about changing the
narrative we have a president who is the
master of changing you know the
narrative that lists visa vie though the
media you know though Democrats are
complaining about how they can't even
get much visibility on the incredible
work that some of them are doing because
you know it's you know one fire after
the other you go from going to the
summit in in Vietnam and then you have
those seat back whatever it is so from
that perspective perhaps even the
question about sanctuary City
perhaps we can begin to approach it from
a history the fact that
is that Toussaint play played an
incredible role in the sanctuary
movement so it doesn't really have to be
a partisan issue this is a historical
fact and to that extent I don't think
that it would be you know we run the
risk of when I probably would would
guess that we run a lesser risk of
alienation and then we began to yaaaa
and the bias for hope I really applaud
you I don't know if many of you know who
you are you excel is his little young
man who was leading in the in the Surrey
he he was running for office right and
then he ran into some difficulties and
had to withdraw and for him to stand
here and still stand as optimistic as
he's you know as he sounded I really
commend him and he happens to be my
student interestingly when I came to
Arizona in 1997 to teach at the law
school in Excel was in my first class
and 20-something years later his son
yeah a user who was four years when when
it was in my class became my students as
well and graduated and went on to other
stuff so yeah I think the best is yet to
come for you just you know what I got a
birth whatever the lesson for you in
that experiences own it and that goes to
my response to the teacher in my
worldview I happen to be an e Bowman
from Nigeria there is more to capital
than finances for us we actually say
that a good name is better than money
the children you have as much is a
greater wealth form of wealth than
finances yes I know that it would be
very important for the government to
acknowledge invaluable you know an
indispensable work that we do as
teachers but when I reckon my blessings
when I reckon my my forms of wealth my
forms of capital it's not just the
salary and paint
it's the AIA excels it's the IDI puke
cells whether or not they fall or rise
or or whatever it is those are part of
both things that I celebrate and part of
what keeps me going as a teacher
I am able I have the privilege and the
opportunity to be able to engage with
these minds and see them at the end of
the day go out beyond the Falls or our
classrooms and continue the good work
day so as we draw the panel to a close I
want to give my co-panelist the last
chance to make some remarks and then
we'll thank you when Kalitta D yeah just
do your part everybody and if it's
convenient it's probably bad for the
environment just continue on this on
this line indeed I think talking about
hope is great because we need hope and
when people have hope in a vision that's
when they are active they they don't act
out of fear and I hope will confirm that
they are more when they they see a
vision they see they can make a
difference and in the in a small group
we've tried to write the last chapter
with suggestions about what everybody
can do and so there are many things
everyone can do to change the situation
to make society more just wherever you
are that's possible and so therefore
please follow the advice that Sophie
gives here and also at the University
I'll finish with the George Carlin line
you know either called the American
dream
