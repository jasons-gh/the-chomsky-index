come to a different kind of corn corn
for people is going to be very less of
it and this point one of the few
conclusions of economics actually works
the price will villa ok so you out price
goes up that made mesit of the price of
feed for cattle goes up the price of
those products goes up and you see it at
the supermarket and goes up in Mexico
you can't eat and it's worse than that a
part of the goal of NAFTA was to drive
Mexican farmers off the land so that the
Mexico would become dependent on the us
agribusiness experts agribusiness means
highly subsidized agribusiness exports
so the government highly subsidizes
agribusiness and of course Mexican
campesino can be as efficient as they
want they can't compete so they have two
choices either switch to specialty crops
which is what economist tell them you're
supposed to do foot comparative
advantage because that's what you do if
your mind is distorted enough but become
dependent on us agribusiness Leslie so
you end up crossing the Mexican border
is not coincidental that Clinton
militarized border in 1994 same years
and after they militarizing because they
could predict the effect I've been an
open border briefly and now that our
militarizing even more big debate in
Congress the position that when the corn
for even active losing food independence
you're dependent on what the big guy
besides and if the United States decides
to increase the price of corn because it
wants an ethanol industry Mexicans are
no longer able to produce their own
even if they do industrial producers in
Mexico by because it's cheaper for the
industrial producers then the US corn
that's going up so then you don't have
corn for tortillas say after to your
rights and then the is expected to
happen the whole ethanol thing is mostly
scanned it's probably not even fuel
efficient but it cannot exist unless
there's massive state intervention and
the effects are very widespread could
become much worse for example it could
be happens it's already happening but in
the poorer countries of the world that
they're shifting production from say
palm oil or cassava which is the staple
and much of Africa to ethanol okay plus
then you know it produces agribusiness
will buy us producers will buy it you do
that it could be massive starvation this
is not a radical view incidentally you
can read about it than the current issue
of foreign affairs you talked about when
the Dodge Brothers suit for for want to
make more portable car and I think part
of forced perspective logisti
self-interest he wanted to have
consumers still to be able to afford to
buy the product um you having
speculation on these guys because they
won remember yeah yeah he says if you
use it on the obviously forced
perspective didn't last two today it
didn't last till nineteen sixteen
because Supreme Court shut it down it
was prima truth of what happened is it
was nineteen sixteen or roughly then
food which was individually owned was
producing cheap cars and paying workers
were by those standards decent wages and
the for company was sued by two of its
stockholders the dodge brothers who were
planning to the starter car company
dodge
Freud was sued because they were
producing cheap cars and paying high
wages and that they won at the court
supreme court ruled that word along was
a corporation that Ford was incorporated
for the corporation must have only one
goal maximizing profit and market share
they are not permitted by law to do
anything decent there was an exception
if the television Kenneth anachronistic
if the press is there today the
television cameras are there then you
can do something benevolent because it
improves your image but you can also
again it indirectly increases profit but
otherwise the corporations which were
given personal rights have to be what we
would call pathological persons in fact
the courts have gone so far as to the
cases in the United States were saying
Britain really but this cases in the
united states where the courts have
urged corporations to carry out some
benevolent acts because otherwise i'm
quoting it now otherwise an aroused
public may discover the benefits that
the state is providing to corporate
entities and i'll take away those rights
so to prevent an aroused public from
learning about the scan you better do
some good works that's delaware court
1969 or so so they say yeah the dodge
where there's one that case but you know
that that remains the core principle of
corporate law I have a question as far
as
discuss earlier where the fifties were
common containment we had the culture of
conformity you know you into the sixties
and seventies liberation and awakening
of sorts ladies on the lapel a generic
and so today I mean no seriously and
common sense with the 15 year old when
they pay that it's just common sense you
know why he cannot pick up again
regarding corporate media do you think
that it is so efficient now because they
don't even use the traction with a case
of like Alberto Gonzales end and go to
the hospital bed Olivia Ashcroft I mean
he will read that you're so blatantly
against the Constitution the people read
it they believe the White House's call
before so that's okay no personal
liberty some can argue more complacent
or as corporate media winning or people
just release I don't think people are
stupid few people do feel helpless so so
yeah to an extent the propaganda systems
work and I things with that will and you
can tell that by popular attitudes which
are quite different than they were in
50s and 60s and as I said there's plenty
of activism now you have eaten anything
YZ media institute the 50s or anything
that you know eating I was in the sixth
in the 70s made now these are all new
things so yes people do feel helpless to
that extent to the corporate media are
succeeding but I think that you know
it's a pretty hard thing to measure but
my feeling is they're better than they
were 50 or 60 years ago more open
because the country's changed and you
know the media change just the way the
country does and so do the educational
institutions they're not even in a
totalitarian society you cannot totally
ignore the public mood if it kind of
they to it and then we're free society
the more sure but of course they look
you know that the remember cattle is
constantly fighting a bitter class war
they never stop a constantly fighting or
on their very class conscious the United
States happens either a highly
classified just business class for any
unusual extent it's a business run
society always fighting a bitter class
work to everyone else let's and get away
with it they'll get away with what the
can but I think it's harder now than it
was for them easier for us let's go free
