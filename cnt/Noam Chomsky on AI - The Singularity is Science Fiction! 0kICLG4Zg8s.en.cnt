my name is Nicola aka Socrates and
you're watching singularity one on one
singularity one on one is a regular
podcast feature of singularity weblog
where you can go and listen to it or
download it in full today my guest on
the show would be faint linguist
political activist prolific author and
public speaker dr. Noam Chomsky dr.
Chomsky thank you so much for being with
us today
Loosli with you fantastic so my goal
here today is to hopefully ask you a few
questions that perhaps you don't get to
be asked very often so let's jump right
in in our very limited time here with
this one imagine that you meet a person
who has never heard of you before and
they ask you to introduce yourself and
what you do how would you do that in a
couple of sentences let's say um I teach
it MIT I've been there for 60 years
sideline my main work is in on language
cognition thinking philosophy I also
have another life which I'm a political
activist and writer on the contemporary
affairs social political issues
historical questions and so on so two
lives
is there a dominant what life there one
takes over the other or they kind of
fairly balanced depends on the period
depends on what's happening the
political life tends to be more urgent
their urgent issues all the time so that
tends to take priority mm-hmm you have
been at MIT for about 60 years perhaps
and among other things mit is very
famous for research in artificial
intelligence what in your view is
artificial intelligence in what are our
chances of ever creating it well it's a
strange notion I mean in a certain sense
what I do is or
until the what is the term is usually
used for is the effort to programme
machines maybe computers maybe robots
and so as to mimic or approximate
certain aspects of human behavior that
can be understood as a scientific
project namely trying what you might try
to construct a model of say insect
navigation to try to understand is it
navigation better to be as an effort to
produce something of the utility like a
robot that will clean your house for you
and those are basically the two thrusts
of artificial intelligence AI they do
not they work in the fields now but also
about 60 years has not really given any
insight into the nature any speak of
into the nature of thought and
organization of action and so on and I
don't think that's very surprising even
to understand the insect navigation is
extremely difficult
in fact even to understand how the
neuron of a giant squid distinguishes a
food from the danger even that's a very
difficult problem but to try to capture
the nature of say human intelligence or
human choice is a colossal problem way
beyond the limits of contemporary
science so ething is a colossal problem
does that mean it's insurmountable we
don't know we never know how much how
far science can reach the human beings
are organic creatures we're not angels
and there's a it's generally believed
often believed that humans can solve any
problem but that would be true only if
we were angels
since we're organic creatures like all
others we have
certain capacities and the capacities
have scope and they also have limits and
the scope and the limits are tightly
related if we didn't have limits we
wouldn't have scope the limits determine
what kind of a cognitive creature we are
and that gives us the capacity to
explore to inquire and create in certain
ways but not necessarily in others now
there will be problems that are simply
beyond our comprehension and in fact in
the history of science and philosophy
there are quite interesting examples
that have come up now this may be a very
long journey and you have been in the
past very critical of the approaches
taken by many or most of the researchers
working in the field of artificial
intelligence would it be fair to say do
you think that AI research is still
headed in the wrong direction in your
view well some of the leading
researchers in the field and colleagues
of mine I do believe and have said that
the pressure to create commercially
viable and useful devices to achieve
certain ends has somewhat overtake
overcome the field and driven the more
science oriented aspects of it into the
margins and I suspect that that's
correct actually if you look at the what
I call the science oriented parts like
the say analogous to developing a model
of the navigation that's the kind of
work that I and many others do it's not
called artificial intelligence but it's
basically an effort to develop a
theoretical understanding of the nature
of fundamental elements of human
intelligence and human cognitive
capacity my cabins Li primarily on
language which is central to many such
much of which makes us human but the
same would be true people studying
vision or the children's acquisition of
concept the other problems of the choice
and the conditions that under which is
undertaken and reasoning zone so in
other words it seems that you think that
project such as for example the Google
autonomous self-driving car or IBM's
Watson have kind of hijacked the
research to produce other products like
those and and and are in that way
costing the research into the more
proper artificial intelligence it's not
a question more proper but which one do
like I have nothing against self-driving
cars yeah could be make it easy to park
my car so far they want to do that it's
ok just like I have nothing against a
bigger bulldozer
they're probably better so applied work
that you did to achieve some humanly
sensible goal is perfectly fine either
right or wrong Watson I think it's
somewhat different story I think that's
mainly of PR gimmick frankly I don't see
what's changed by the acceptor maybe
selling computers by showing that if you
spend a lot of time packing it's a takes
a deep-blue
it was perfectly obvious sixty years ago
that sooner or later if you get 50 grand
masters together to plan to take as much
time as they want planning strategies
for more you know imaginable occasions a
sooner or later that will reach a point
where they can do better in there than a
particular a single grandmaster who's
restricted is a 45 minutes that's almost
obvious from the nature of the game so
having
shows nothing except that you did what
is known could be done nothing that's
learned from it in fact this was pretty
well understood by the founder of the
field
Alan Turing great mathematician who was
also the one of the founders of computer
science but he did write a famous paper
back around 1950 on can machines think
some kind of like that a very short
paper I think it's eight pages and that
basically set off the field of
artificial intelligence there still to
this day our prizes every year for a
hundred thousand dollars or something
like that of he asked what's called the
Turing test he called it his imitation
game now however touring in that paper
did point out as a sentence in which he
says the question whether machines can
think is too meaningless to deserve
discussion so let's put that aside let's
not talk about thinking machines of
course machine to your means program it
doesn't mean the computer on the
physical object on your desk
it means the program that's written for
that's what the term machine means so
question whether the program in your
computer can think is too meaningless
deserve discussion annex quite variety
deals so but nevertheless thought this
was a useful project for two reasons the
one he said it might be an incessantly
imitation game test notes called the
Turing test might be an incentive to
construct better machines and I suppose
that could be true about deep blue I
don't know the details but it's possible
that in constructing deep blues and
ideas were developed about how to create
your memories or more accessible
memories and so on if so it's fine it's
like your bulldozer but and he also said
that he thought maybe in he said in
fifty years past
we would change our concept of thinking
well that hasn't happened and I don't
expect it to happen in the foreseeable
future
we haven't gained that kind of insight
into the nature of whatever it was on
thinking so you believe that what's on
his symbolize no progress or embodied no
progress whatsoever I mean one potential
application that's been trumpeted lately
in the media was the medical
applications in Diagnostics where Watson
would be supposedly much more accurate
than any number of experienced doctors
from a number of variety of fields and
thereby would potentially democratize
medicine by uploading the water Watson
in the cloud and then allowing access to
its knowledge or to its Diagnostics
ability via a simple smartphone for
example anywhere in the world no that's
fine it's certainly objection to that
just like developing a surgical
techniques which change a gallbladder
operation from something that used to
hospitalize person for a week to
something you do well in a walk into the
office and walk out that's great and if
collecting a lot of data what you're
referring to is a system that collects a
lot of data it has a rapid search
procedure and so that it can discover
for - and algorithms that enable it to
discover particular things in the data
that's fine you know it's like a it's
like a program that searches a document
to find a word you're looking for
I have no objection to that check that
hangs nice idea but that's different
from understanding something about the
nature of diagnosis let's say it's not
telling you that it's simply
accumulating the understanding that has
been achieved and running through it
rapidly
comprehensively moreso than say a single
individual do in particular individual
without much Fran so for example
something like when I look at an x-ray I
don't see anything if a trained
radiologist looks at it they see
something no it's conceivable that
whatever a trained radiologist is doing
could be programmed in such a way that I
could put it into my computer and then
it would enable me to see what the
trained radiologist see that's fine that
could be useful not for me but for a
doctor somewhere it's not a training
video but what about everything else
that that trained radiologist is doing
is it not conceivable that we can
program that everything else that they
are doing could be potentially
programmable one way or another just as
it's perfectly possible that robots can
replace human labor on assembly lines if
they can it's fine
frees humans up to do more creative
things and isn't that the sign of
progress in some sense or another it's a
sign if it depends what it's used for
safe let's take robots on assembly lines
if it's used to free up the workforce
for more creative work say controlling
production making decisions about it
finding creative ways to act and so on
Dennis to the good if it's used as a
device to maximize profit and throw
people into the trash can then it's not
good mm-hmm I hope I have the chance to
comment back on that topic a little
later but let me just rush through here
and ask you what's the what's the
importance of reverse engineering the
human brain is perhaps arguably a way of
getting insights into making more
progress for artificial intelligence as
for example another famous alumni of MIT
records were almost notably argues
records were made some useful device
and he's a future who's what's called a
futurologist he develops elaborate
speculations about what might happen but
if people find that stimulating okay I
don't particularly but I don't see any
particular achievement there other than
creating the devices are used that's fun
that may be a speech analysis device all
right let me just tell you a personal
story when I was appointed at MIT in
1955 160 years ago I basically had no
recognized profession but I was they're
willing to appoint me and in the
research lab electronics but to work on
a program on machine translation in my
interview with a director of the
laboratory in Durham Wiesner we talked
about work I was doing thought that
project I told him happy to have the
position like the research there but I
told all not going to work on machine
translation because this is totally
pointless the way to do machine
translation I said is just by brute
force and talked about some ways to do
it by brute force they were still a
belief at the time that if enough was
understood about what a translator does
you could program it and that would get
you to do machine translation I felt
then as I feel now that that was the
pion sky just illusions we didn't
understand that much and over the years
that I think is turn to have be true at
Google has a translator which is kind of
useful if you want to get the rough idea
of what's in say some scientific
articles in some language you don't know
it's kind of helpful but it's done by
brute force it doesn't give any insight
into the nature of translation that's a
hard problem just as it's a hard problem
to figure out how a bee can navigate
these are not trivial questions and for
humans the problems are much greater
that
for insects for a lot of reasons that
one reason is that we're just a lot more
complex you know be say has maybe eight
hundred thousand neurons we have ten
billion to be different the other reason
is that with other organisms we allow
ourselves to do invasive experimentation
with humans we don't it's not a short
distinction but significant distinction
so there are plenty of questions you can
ask about say the kind of problems I'm
interested in let's it language
acquisition make your mind up fill ins
Maddox or plenty of questions you can
think of asking but you can't and you
can even design an experiment to pursue
them and if you were say Mengele you
could carry out the experiment that but
fortunately we're not all Nazi doctors
so you can't carry out the experiment
which means you have to study human
intelligence you bring it in much more
indirect ways and that is a added
difficulty over say setting beat there
you can do an experiment Eli
so what's your take generally speaking
about race technological singularity
it's science fiction I don't see any
particular reason to believe it you want
to play games with it okay because they
are Co Institute's fearing for example
the creation of artificial intelligence
like the machine
Meiri machine intelligence Research
Institute previously the singularity
Institute who are fearing that once
there is a artificial general
intelligence smarter than humans that
would pretty much signal the end of our
species we shouldn't be concerned about
that possibility in your view I think we
should be concerned about the end of our
species without the batteries it should
be concerned about it because we are
very busy dedicating ourselves to
destroying the possibility for
in survival I think we should worry
about that but could most recent IPCC
report but the singularity stories are
science fiction for one thing there's
knowing that we remember when people
come when you talk about machines kinda
misleading people have a feeling well
it's this cute little robot that had in
Star Wars r2d2 a machine the reference
to machines is a reference to programs
the program that you put into a device
that's ping on your desk the device
itself is of no use for anything other
than maybe holding down papers and said
paperweight but it can execute the
program now what's a program the program
is a series as a theory it's a theory
written in a and an arcane complex
notation designed to be executed by the
machine but about the program you ask
the same questions you ask about any
other theory does it give insight and
understand it well in fact these
theories don't they're not designed with
that in mind and not surprisingly they
don't not much maybe marginally so what
we're asking is can we do that design a
theory of being smart and we're Yeon's
away from that no we only have probably
a couple of minutes at most so I just
want to ask you do you think you've
mentioned the sort of fundamental
challenges that we're facing as humanity
different in your view than the
technological singularity do you think
we've made any progress as a
civilization plenty of progress in all
sorts of ways I mean things that were
taken for granted as normal in the 18th
century would today be considered as
utter Barberton in fact we don't to go
back that far
it picks a half the species women and
when the American Constitution was
established women were not people they
were property
and took over British common law which
was the most advanced of the day and
which a woman was the property of her
father transmitted to her husband that
continued until pretty reasonably in
fact it was as recent as 1975 that long
ago that the US Supreme Court granted
women the right the right to serve on
juries meaning of their peers that's
what a jury is supposed to the jury of
your peers people like you that's a
generation ago and that's progress very
slow progress agonizing and in many ways
is regression but over time the the
tendency is towards progress
like I mentioned animal experimentation
before until very recently if the atom
mammals a cat's primates monkeys were
subjected to just about any kind of
experimentation you wanted to do that's
no longer the case they're pretty sharp
restrictions on ethical restrictions on
animal experimentation okay I think all
of this whether it's the women
african-americans immigrants whatever
there's a slow expansion of the moral
sphere slow but detectable so for
example just a couple of weeks ago the
state of California agreed to allow
undocumented immigrants to serve on
juries that's a little bit like allowing
women to serve on juries it's beginning
to admit them barely into the category
of human beings well one way to go on
that now but these are small steps of
progress there's also a regression so
take say the climate destruction which
are talked about but not only are the
are we carrying out the process of
destroying the environment for decent
existence but we've become aware of it
so she go back say 250 years
it was happening but there wasn't it's
very little awareness of it I remember
myself very well in the early 1970s two
friends personal friends one of them
happened to be the head of meteorology
at MIT the other the head of earth
sciences at Harvard both of them at
about the same time started warning that
there's a problem developing that we
hadn't recognized with regard to the
lesson about global warming that could
be very serious in future but twenty
years earlier that was not known then it
was beginning to be understood now any
rational person that recognizes to be
extremely serious and unfortunately any
rational person doesn't happen to
include a large part of the US Congress
so that when the leading commentator on
the television recently done when asked
about this said well we'll leave it in
the hands of God okay then Rickon we're
saying let's consign our grandchildren
who were kind of living that's
substantial but there's a long way to go
and not much time to do it that's all a
lot more significant than idle
speculations about some potentials in
you Larry in my view if said that there
has been some slow but still notable
progress does that make you cautiously
optimistic about our future despite all
the difficulties and challenges that
we're definitely going to face
putting aside the singularity from
environmental degradation from nuclear
proliferation and things like that I
think an objective observer from Mars
let's say looking at the human species
it would conclude that they're they're
an evolutionary error that that they're
designed in such a way that leads them
to destroy themselves and probably much
else along with them
the irrational conclusion we can decide
whether that conclusion is right or
wrong the fate that choice is in our
hands
so I don't think it's a question of
optimism or pessimism but do we make the
choice the effort to show that what
looks like rational inclusion is
nevertheless mistaken that's up does
last two questions do you think that a
resource-based economy and The Venus
Project for example or the zeitgeist
movement provide an alternative
structure where as you say perverse
short-term incentives for maximizing
profits will not end up making otherwise
good people being forced to make bad
choices its pleasant ideas when I read
it I think that would be nice but there
are many other suggestions about what
would be nice for spin them offering
with your favorites yeah my favorite of
the ones I talk about the Democratic
control of every aspect of social life
the production consumption distribution
represent political representation long
way to go on that and simply the
creating the expanding sphere of human
and in fact animal rights all of that's
important the ending there are very
specific things that have to be dealt
with which is why I'm not much
interested in these kind of Airy
speculations one of them we've talked
about so the destruction of the
environment which is extremely serious
the other you mention it's kind of a
miracle that we've escaped a nuclear war
literally a miracle and you can't expect
that miracle to continue so something
quickly and urgently has to be done to
eliminate this curse yeah dr. Tomsky
my last question is what is your most
important message that the most
important thing that you would like our
viewers and listeners to take away from
this conversation with you today I'd
like them
I think people what
take a clear-eyed look at the world
around us where it's going where it's
likely to go if we are remain passive
and obedient and conformist and that's a
grim future that's the conclusion of the
observer from Mars and then to decide
what we can do to avert that interaction
thank you very much dr. Chomsky really
appreciate your time today thank you
