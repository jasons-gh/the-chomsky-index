he put it an enlightened statesman and
benevolent philosopher the Senate would
be a chosen body of citizens whose
wisdom may best discern the true
interests of their country and whose
patriotism and love of justice will be
least likely to sacrifice it to
temporary or partial considerations they
would just they would therefore refine
and enlarge the public views the
guarding the public against the
mischiefs of democratic majorities so
rather like the noble Roman gentlemen of
the fantasies of the day actually Adam
Smith before him had a sharper eye well
it didn't take long for Madison's and a
shift is thinking about this as he
viewed the early results of the
Democratic experiment he had second
thoughts in fact by 1792 a couple years
later by then he deplored what he called
the daring depravity of the times as the
stock jobbers become the Praetorian band
of the government at once its tool and
it's tyrant bribed by its large esas and
over eyeing it by clamors and
combinations which isn't a bad
description of today's political system
and its social and economic correlates
well today in the richest country in
human history the twenty percent of the
population qualify for food stamps the
real unemployment today is at the level
of the Great Depression for much of the
population manufacturing workers for
example and in fact their actual
circumstances are much worse than in the
Great Depression which I'm old enough to
remember most of my family were
unemployed working class
and the country was of course far were
than it is today but it was a hopeful
period in many ways there was a sense
that people were doing something about
it and the times would get better and I
mean they did thanks to act very active
organizing CIO other things and then an
immense government stimulus first during
the war and continuing through the
post-war decades well that's not true
today the jobs that are being lost are
unlikely to return at least under the
current programs of the Masters of
mankind not graven in stone but that's
their programs well while the population
suffers the Goldman Sachs which is not
at one of the main architects of the
current crisis there now richer than
ever and they have just quietly
announced 17.5 billion dollars in extra
compensation for last year with the CEO
Lloyd Blankfein getting 12.6 million and
while his base salary more than triples
and exactly as borovsky said they're
poised to play the same game again why
not they can rely on the government
insurance policy that enables them to
safely engage in risky transactions make
huge profits and they don't take into
account what in the jargon of economics
are called externalities the effect of a
transaction on others crucially in their
case what's called systemic risk that is
the likelihood that the whole system of
collapse as a result result of their
risky and hence profitable transactions
and when it does collapse as
anticipated that's not a big problem
they can run to the powerful the nanny
state that they nurtured clutching in
their hands their copies of Hayek and
Milton Friedman and nine Rand and so on
and they can demand the bailout to which
they're entitled because they are too
big to fail as its put and as one
commentator added Riley also too big to
jail for quite serious crimes it's a
pretty impressive scam of course it's in
radical violation of capitalist
principles but the Masters of mankind
believed in those principles only for
others not for themselves and that
stance has a long pedigree that's
another matter that's important to
understand if we want to grasp the
nature of the world in which we live
actually lies in the background of a
very revealing interaction that's taking
place right now between two countries
that are quite different in terms of
Independence and economic development
the United States and Egypt the
democracy uprisings in the Arab world
particularly in Egypt these are events
of a truly historic importance and
they're very frightening the Western
power for very simple reasons the West
is certainly going to do whatever it can
to prevent authentic democracy in the
Arab world to see why it's enough to
take a look at the studies of Arab
public opinion which has certainly known
the planners even though not to the
Western public at least to those who
keep to the media what they show is that
for example in Egypt the
about ninety percent of the population
think that the United States is the main
threat that they face maybe ten percent
think Iran that as a threat actually
about eighty percent think the reason be
more secure if Iran had nuclear weapons
and those figures haven't be high in
Egypt but they're pretty much true
across the Arab world so it's obvious
that the West is not going to do
whatever it can to prevent those
opinions from entering into policy which
means to prevent any form of authentic
democracy well the these are extremely
important events and important to take a
look at how they're developing so the
first all of these have long histories
incidentally so for example the Egyptian
movement you probably saw was led by a
group of young tech-savvy people who
called themselves the April sixth
movement the why April sixth well that's
a reference to major labor action that
was prepared planned on april sixth 2008
at one of the major industrial
installations in Egypt mahalo textile
installation were supposed to be big
strike a lot of support activities and I
was crushed by the military dictatorship
that we were supporting forgotten here
who cares but not forgotten there and
the same is true in the other countries
the things that have been that if
suddenly burst forth are not coming from
nowhere that's true of the first one to
which doesn't even get reported the
current wave of uprisings actually began
in the last
african colony one of the two countries
of the Arab world that is was invaded
and occupied and settled by an outside
power that's Western Sahara technically
a UN dependency supposed to move on to
decolonization it was invaded in 1975 by
Morocco brutal invasion like most
settled a lot of the Moroccan population
there illegally of course I have been
repeated protests there was another one
in November an effort last November and
efforts set up tent city Moroccan forces
quickly crushed that since it's a UN
responsibility the issue didn't come to
the Security Council but France made
sure that there would be no inquiry into
what happened it has to protect its a
Moroccan client that was the first the
other occupied country as you know
nothing so far the lid has been on
tightly that's Palestine plenty to say
about that but I think most of you are
familiar with it or should be at least
not least from the very courageous and
important work done right here by the
late Jim graph well whatever is going to
happen it's not clear that's all it is
is still work in progress but despite
the internal barriers and external
constraints these popular movements have
achieved substantial success and they
have a pretty exciting prospect one of
the most dramatic recent moments was
last februari of every 20th when Kemal
abbas sent a message from Qatar square
in cairo to wisconsin workers they
saying we stand with you as you stood
with us Abbas is a leader of the years
of struggle of Egyptian workers for
elementary rights
that lie in the background of today's
Arab Spring as I said brutally crushed
by the western-backed dictator he's also
a leading figure in the current uprising
and our bosses measure a message of
solidarity to Wisconsin workers evoked
the traditional aspirations of the labor
movements solidarity among working
people of the world and the populations
generally well right now the
trajectories in Cairo and Madison are
intersecting but they're headed in
opposite directions in Cairo towards
gaining elementary rights denied by the
dictatorships in Madison towards
defending rights that have been won and
long and hard struggles and are now
under severe attack and each of these is
a kind of a microcosm of tendencies that
are underway in global society and
following varied courses and they're
sure to be far-reaching consequences of
what's taking place in the decaying
industrial heartland of the richest and
most powerful country in human history
and in what President Eisenhower called
the most strategically important area in
the world namely the Middle East a
stupendous source of strategic power
that probably the richest economic prize
in the world in the field of foreign
investment those are the words of the
State Department in the 1940s I was a
prized that the US intended to keep for
itself and its allies and the unfolding
new world order of the day that they
were organizing and implementing and in
fact still do well it's normal for the
victors to consign history to the track
can and it's normal for the victims to
take it seriously and if we might
understand the world we should follow
their example today is in fact not the
first occasion when Egypt and the United
States are facing similar problems and
moving in opposite directions that was
also true in the early part of the 19th
century in ways which are quite crucial
for both societies and generalize across
the world and are crucial for
understanding of the creation of the
divide between the rich first world and
the poor third world much less sharp
back in those days well at that time
early 19th century Egypt in the United
States were both well placed to
undertake rapid economic development
both of them had rich agriculture that
included cotton which is sort of the
fuel of the early Industrial Revolution
although unlike Egypt the United States
had to develop cotton production and a
workforce by conquest extermination and
slavery with consequences that
reverberate to the present there was one
fundamental difference between Egypt and
the United States and namely the United
States had gained independence and it
was there for free to ignore the
prescriptions of economic theory which
were deliberate much the same ones as
today at the time they were delivered by
the greatest economist of the day Adam
Smith in terms similar to those preach
to what are called developing societies
today so Smith urged the American
colonies to keep through what was later
called their comparative advantage that
is to produce primary products for
export and to import superior British
manufacturers and certainly not to try
to monopolize crucial
goods and I meant particularly cotton in
those days kind of like oil today any
other path he warned or quote him would
retard instead of accelerating the
further increase in the value of their
annual products produce and would
obstruct instead of promoting the
progress of their country toward real
wealth and greatness approximately what
you study in economic courses today and
the advice given to the world by the IMF
and the World Bank well having gained
their independence the colonies us
colonies were free to ignore the laws of
sound economics they were free to follow
England's own course of independent
state guided development with high
tariffs to protect industry from
superior British exports the first
textiles later steel and others and a
wide variety of other modes of state
intervention in order to accelerate
economic development and the independent
republic also tried and came pretty
close to try to get a monopoly of cotton
for a good reason the purpose was to
place all other nations at our feet as
the Jacksonian presidents put it at the
time when they were the neck singh in
texas and fo mexico they were
particularly concerned with england
england was the big enemy in those days
it was the deterrent and they figured if
they monopolized cotton they could bring
England through its feet that's pretty
important for example it's one of the
reasons why Canada wasn't conquered
British the third in several times maybe
it's being conquered in other ways but
that's another matter but it wasn't
militarily conquered they also couldn't
conquer Cuba much as they wanted to
because the British fleet was in the way
they did finally conquer it later in the
century 1898
under the pretext of liberating it but
actually conquering it but the idea was
if they could monopolize control of
cotton they could overcome this a
deterrent that was in the way of
expansion actually it's kind of
interesting that that's that's
essentially the policy that was
attributed to Saddam Hussein in 1990
ridiculous at that time but if you look
back at the propaganda at the time of
the invasion the pretext was well he's
trying to monopolize oil and you know to
bring us all to his feet and it's
totally outlandish but the what was
charged the crime attributed to Saddam
Hussein is in fact one of the main ones
that led to US economic development it
happened and had a big effect one of the
reasons it's out of history except that
it's in history well that was the United
States what about Egypt Egypt couldn't
follow a comparable course because it
was barred by British power it wasn't
independent so British Lord Palmerston
declared his words that no ideas of
fairness toward Egypt ought to stand in
the way of such great and paramount
interests of Britain as preserving its
economic and political hegemony and he
expressed what he called his hate for
the ignorant barbarian the Muhammad Ali
the developmentalist leader who was
trying to direct Egypt on an independent
course and Britain's fleet and financial
resources were deployed to terminate
Egypt's quest for independence and
economic development after World War two
the United States displaced Britain as
global hegemon and it adopted the same
position the u.s. made it clear that
Washington would provide no aid to Egypt
and the whole
old badly needed eight at the time in
the US would provide no aid to Egypt
unless it adhered to the standard rules
for the weak ones I cited which of
course the US continued to violate
itself imposing high tariffs at the bar
Egyptian cotton and causing a
debilitating d'etre dollar shortage
actually that's the usual interpretation
of market principles that's fine for you
fine for disciplining the week and
controlling them but not me please i
want the nanny state to make sure I'm
okay that applies at home to the way the
goldman sachs and its colleagues and
their representatives and government
understand very well these are really
leading themes of modern history they're
the basis for the sense of the basis for
the first third world distinction this
generalizes all over and for what's
happening internal to the rich societies
as well well as these kind of quite
simple principles predict elections are
increasingly just becoming a charade run
by the public relations industry which
tries to mobilize populations to vote
while making sure that issues are
marginalized for the reason I mentioned
public has different opinions about
issues than the Masters of mankind so
you want to keep them aside I should say
that well I'm talking about the United
States is not true everywhere so if you
go say to the poorest country in South
America Bolivia they actually have
democratic
actions pretty remarkable ones the Latin
special in the last ten years so in the
last 10 years the most repressed
bitterly repressed segment of the
population the indigenous population
have actually entered the political
arena press their demands took part in
elections won the elections elected
someone for their own ranks a poor
peasant you know not somebody from the
skullenbones at Yale and and won the
election on real issues serious issues
like control over resources cultural
rights how to handle it problems of
justice in a complex multi-ethnic
society and then in a another election a
couple years later they even better well
that's democracy you have to look pretty
hard to find anything like that in the
industrial world what's happening in our
societies is something quite different
the public relations industry which
essentially runs the elections it's
applying a certain principles namely the
same principles as applying certain
principles to undermine democracy which
are the same as the principles it
applies to undermine markets the last
thing that business wants is markets in
the sense of economic theory take a
course in economics they tell you a
market is based on informed consumers
making rational choices anyone has ever
looked at a TV ad notice that's not true
in fact the industry of if there was if
we had a market system and I had safer
General Motors that would be a brief
statement of the characteristics of the
products for next year that's not what
you see you know you see some you know
movie actress or a football hero or
somebody you know standing driving a car
or up a mountain or something like that
but the point is to create an appointed
s through all advertising the goal is to
undermine markets by creating uninformed
consumers will make irrational choices
and the business world spends huge
efforts on that and the same is true in
the same industry the pr industry turns
to undermining democracy it wants to
construct elections in which uninformed
the voters will make irrational choices
it's pretty reasonable and it's so
evident you can hardly miss it and it's
another one of those things that ought
to be taught in elementary schools kind
of embarrassing to talk about something
so obvious to a university audience well
all of this is second nature to the
Masters of mankind so for example after
his 2008 victory as perhaps you know
Obama immediately won an award from the
advertising industry for the best
marketing campaign of 2008 he beat out
Apple computers and if you look at the
business press where people talk more
openly executives were euphoric they
said they'd been marketing candidates
like toothpaste ever since Reagan but
2008 was the greatest achievement they
said it was so great it's going to
change the style and corporate
boardrooms the 2012 election is now
expected to cost two billion dollars
it's going to have to be mostly
corporate funding so it's not at all
surprising that
selecting business leaders for top
positions the public is quite angry and
frustrated but unless the western
populations can say rise to the level of
Egyptians and they're going to remain
victims in the United States the
Republicans long ago ceased any pretense
of being a traditional political party
there are so deep in the pockets of
corporate america if and the super-rich
do you need a telescope to find them
Democrats who incidentally by now are
mostly what used to be called moderate
Republicans so the Democrats there is
not too far behind Obama's choice of an
economic team which I mentioned is an
example actually I didn't put it quite
accurately there was one exception in
his economic team namely Paul Volcker he
was the Secretary of Treasury under
Ronald Reagan but the spectrum has
shifted so far to the right that Folker
was the last liberal calling for some
kind of regulation it was incidentally
not is and he was kicked out and
replaced by Geoffrey ml he's the CEO of
General Electric that's the nation's
largest corporation and his special
responsibility if you look back at the
rhetoric was to create jobs actually
more accurate comment again by Tom
Ferguson is that what we actually have
here is the disappearance from the scene
of the best known and most visible
critic of the excesses of the financial
sector and his replacement by the
sitting CEO of a company that is heavily
dependent on government aid of all sorts
including diplomatic assistance to
invest more in China and to shift jobs
there this is not about jobs it's about
political money the White House knows it
will need to raise about a billion
dollars for its reelection can
pain that's the context in which this
and Obama's other recent appointments
need to be judged and the business world
not surprisingly was quite pleased the
London Financial Times reported that
mystery melts appointment was applauded
by the US Chamber of Commerce major
business lobby which they said has been
among the president's harshest critics
and funded many Republicans who ran
against Democrats and last November's
election but maybe that will be over and
the last barrier to business rule could
be out of the way well if you look at GE
general electric more than half of its
workforce is abroad and more than half
of its revenue comes from overseas
operations although most of its revenues
come not from production though it's
regarded as a manufacturing enterprise
but from financial operations for which
incidentally had received a hefty
bailout when Wall Street tanked while
the appointment was proclaimed to be for
job growth it actually has little to do
with that and more accurately it's
what's called follow the money more than
a century ago the great political fit
and sear mark Hanna said that two things
are important in politics and money and
I forgotten the second one
another thing for elementary school
that's far more true today especially
with the radical changes of the past 30
years and they're important to
understand these developments roughly
the last 30-odd years they followed one
of the major changes in World Order in
the modern period namely the dismantling
of the post-second World War economic
system so-called Bretton Woods system
which had been designed by the victors
of the Second World War the United
States and Britain basic designers were
John Maynard Keynes for Britain and the
New Deal economist Harry Dexter white
for the United States one central
component of this system was regulation
of currencies in fact I was part of the
basis for the huge economic growth of
the next couple of decades of highest in
history well that was dismantled about
40 years ago that was one factor that
led to the huge explosion of financial
speculation and the vast growth of
financial institutions at that time
there were small components of the
economy and they were mostly doing what
the banks are supposed to do in state
capitalist systems namely to direct
unused funds like the your bank account
to some kind of productive investment
that was then by 2007 just before the
Great Crash they gained about 40 percent
of corporate profits in the US their
profits come mostly from complex
financial manipulations the actions that
have little or if any social or economic
utility and are harmful to the economy
and also to people in many ways these
practices would be sharply
if capital principal capitalist
principles were to prevail they'd be
curtailed by crashes and you know losing
your money but thankfully there's no
fear of that at least for the rich
another factor in the financialization
of the economy was that the rate of
profit in production was declining so it
was easier to make money by the
