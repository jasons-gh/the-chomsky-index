welcome to the real news network I'm
Paul Jay we're in Cambridge
Massachusetts with professor Noam
Chomsky thanks for joining us again so
let's talk a little bit about the the
global situation President Obama
campaigned he said for a new mindset in
u.s. foreign policy but the underlying
assumption that the US needs to project
power around the globe really doesn't
seem to have changed so talk a bit about
the state of things and particularly if
you've done a lot of work and been in
the Middle East recently well you're
quite right i mean there are policies
actually going back to the Second World
War which have been very stable now if
you go back to say the years of the
Second World War 39 to 45 there were of
course high-level planning meetings
State Department Council on Foreign
Relations and so on they took four and
the interesting discussions there
publicly have been for a long time they
recognized that the United States was
going to come out of the war in a
position of overwhelming power like
nothing like it in history which was
true at the end of the war the US had
half the world's wealth incomparable
security and so on and they plan to use
it the US had not been a major player in
world affairs before that had the
largest economy by a long shot but the
leading players and world affairs were
Britain and second early France and the
u.s. is going to replace that and they
knew it and they plan to construct the
world which would be open to US economic
penetration and political control and in
which no exercise of sovereignty would
be tolerated that we'd interfere with us
designs who said pretty frankly no part
part of this which doesn't get talked
about too much as this was very much
FDR's vision it wasn't something that
came like from right-wing Republicans
this came out of the Democratic Party
I'm talking
about the early 40s he's a Roosevelt's
planner I mean they sort of had you know
soft version of it this will be for
everyone's good and will be in charge
but of course we were working for the
benefit of others and so on usual story
wasn't totally false but partially no
propaganda anyway they had had plans and
they even designated the area for which
these plans would apply what they call
the grand area which would be dominated
by the United States and it would
include of course the Western Hemisphere
taken for granted the entire Far East
the former British Empire which includes
crucially the Middle East and one of the
leading figures a early result advisor
and on through later the rural
administration's he pointed out that if
we control the Middle East we can
control the world that's where the
energy resources are as the Russians
ground down the Nazi arm is after
Stalingrad division extended to include
as much of Eurasia as possible crucially
the commercial and industrial centers
Germany in France so on so that that was
the picture and the plans were then in
the late forties when war was over now
they were implemented in pretty
sophisticated ways you look at the
planning documents in the implementation
that was quite rational creating this
kind of world world in which the US will
be dominant it will not tolerate
exercise of sovereignty that interfere
with that dominance the world will be an
open society to free economically which
is the natural position for those who
expect to dominate the world so when
Britain finally became the world
dominant power and had maybe twice the
per capita level of capitalization as
anyone else and hence thought it could
win in trading they came they cannot
favor free trade yeah that's natural
plenty of restrictions on it so in
too but in the US case yeah let's have a
society free trade you know no
government intervention except for us so
in the United States this plans at the
same time especially the late forties
were to develop massive government
intervention in the economy the business
world understood and you can read it in
the business press in the late forties
that unless there's a massive government
intervention in the economy kind of a
stimulus will go back to the depression
high-tech industry was understood cannot
flourish in a free enterprise no war was
essentially a massive stimulus money the
war was a huge stimulus which put the
cut which virtually quadrupled
industrial production ended the
depression laid the basis for the
post-war expansion left a huge debt far
higher than now but which was overcome
by the Lord skill birth of the economy
we expect an entirely through the
plunder of the rest of the world to
there's plunder of the rest of the world
but the main thing was that's a
complicated issue because the United
States wanted the former imperial
countries you know Britain particularly
but to be able to recover control of
their former colonies so that they could
then develop and purchase the huge
manufacturing surplus of the United
States one of the big economic problems
after the Second World War was that most
of the industrial world had been
demolished or seriously harmed US
economy had bloomed we had this huge
manufacturing surplus somebody's got to
buy it Marshall Plan and other devices
were another stimulus life yeah and but
domestically what it meant was at what
pretty much was that of our bush
proposed and was that later implemented
that the government should have a major
role in developing and protecting
high-tech industry the building were
sitting in happens to be right above a
former electronics lab which is where
one of the main places where
for the development of the computers the
internet micro electronics and so on and
so forth on pentagon money I mean
gorgeous for in case people don't know
where we're at MIT yeah okay but happens
to be right below where we're sitting I
was there at the time the and beyond
that when other government initiatives
like take just procurement I mean when
IBM finally learned enough from the
government labs so that they could make
computers they made him but they can
sell them because they're too big and
clunky so the government procured them
and in fact it was decades before you
could make money selling computers the
internet was in the state sector for
over 30 years before it was handed over
to private industry when you fly on a
commercial airline are it's sort of a
modified bomber and this run through the
economy now large expenditures in the
biology based sector because that's the
growth part of the economy and plenty of
other state intervention substantial but
free enterprises and for everybody else
like in the third world can't do this no
it's quite traditional Britain was the
same in its heyday but that it was a
system that worked you know quite well I
mean for through the 50s and 60s huge
economic growth by historical standards
then you get to the mid 70s and for a
lot of reasons you get this fundamental
change the international economic system
the so-called Bretton Woods system was
essentially dismantled capital controls
were the technically permitted that they
were basically abolished there was a
huge rise in speculative capital flows
enormous rise and you get the kind of
financialization in which we're now
living and a quite a significant decline
in macro economic indices almost all of
them that but ending sharp disparities
of growth and the attacks on democracy
and so on well that's this kind of large
terms but going back to it you said
before that the same principle toll
that's true I mean the government still
holds to the principle that we must
dominate basically the world you know
expanded grand area and we should not
tolerate exercise of sovereignty that
interfere with us now the world has
meanwhile become much more diverse it's
not as easy to implement these plans as
it was in say nineteen fifty or even in
1970 so by now you know the traditional
backyard the western hemisphere a big
piece of it South America it has become
much more independent thrown out all US
military bases they're moving towards
some degree of integration they're not
following us orders and we just saw that
when Brazil joined with Turkey to
arrange for a mechanism for Iran to
enrich substantial parts of its uranium
outside of Iran actually the Obama
administration had to encourage that
initiative they were Obama wrote to the
president of Brazil saying yes good idea
go ahead with it presumably he did that
because he thought it would fail that he
ran wouldn't agree and you'd have a
propaganda point well it worked and the
US was irate immediately rammed through
UN resolution which in fact was much
weaker than the Turkish Brazilian the
right an arrangement but at least kept
the US running things the the issue of
sanctions on Iran is a very striking
illustration of the increasing
limitations of us power that's connected
that they read the foreign policy
literature government statements this is
the big problem this is in fact called
the year of Iran and Iran is described
as the greatest threat the world order
come back in a moment to what the threat
is but part of this is the u.s. effort
to try to get the world to accept the
harsh US sanctions not the UN sanctions
devices are pretty much toothless so
China and Russia and others go along
with them willingly
the US sanctions are much quieter they
have no international legitimacy other
than the force that lies behind them and
the u.s. is getting desperate about the
fact that the rest of the world isn't
following them so Brazil has an Turkey
neighboring power leading power in the
third world have just essentially
rejected them that of turkeys announced
its going to triple its growing trade
with Iran stop the pipeline Brazil says
look we go along with the non-aligned
countries and most of the world and
supporting Iran's right to enrich
uranium but the big one is China that
they can't push around and they're very
upset about it a couple of weeks ago the
State Department issued a warning to
China and said that if you want to join
the international community in meaning
what we run you have to meet your
international responsibilities namely
follow us orders follow our sanctions
probably listed laughter and the Chinese
Foreign Office they cannot force them to
do it and this is indication of an
erosion of the ability to coerce you can
have eight hundred military bases and
spend as much as the rest of the world
combined on the military but you can't
force China or even turkey or even
Brazil to follow your orders that's
quite different from the early days of
the Grand area I talked to Larry
Wilkerson and we interviewed him a few
days ago you know Colin Powell's former
chief of staff and he says that he and
many people in the intelligence
community are convinced that the sort of
neocon access the same people that were
that bush-cheney represented are very
committed to an attack on iran and they
you know within three to four years they
think they're they're preparing the
conditions for this how serious a threat
to you think this is how much a very
serious threat but the threat is Obama
to you know be better than EO guns I
mean Obama has significantly increased
the US military threat to Iran so take
say the island of Giga Garcia
portant Island major US military base
one of the major bases for bombing the
Middle East and Central Asia the British
was a British island they kicked the
population out so that the u.s. could
develop a military base there it's big
Obama has substantially increased it
I've been reporting about this
unfortunately but he had a year ago
established facilities for nuclear
submarines which means with if we're
mistltein nuclear-tipped missiles to be
there he's sharply increased the number
of vertical deep penetration ordinance
is unless what bunker busters the
biggest bombs in the arsenal short of
nuclear weapons which are designed to go
deep underground to destroy targets I
sent hundreds there in fact that was a
bush program but it kind of languished
as soon as Obama came into office he
very sharply stepped up production now
deployment of the I think about a
quarter of the world's aircraft carriers
almost all of the big ones were almost
all US are in the Arabian Sea that's a
that's a fact Iran is completely
surrounded by US military bases and the
threat of attack is constant the phrase
that's used is all options are open you
know we can attack if we like well
that's a serious threat now US military
and the US intelligence understand this
they wiII the question what is the
Iranian threat is one that everybody
should be asking which would be the
headlines in the newspapers if this is
the world worst threat to world peace
what is it they keep saying even the
Arab countries are afraid of all this
but I see yesterday Qatar just had a big
cultural event with Iran yeah where they
call them together but in fact if you
look at our public opinion if anyone
cares that is now so outraged by US
policy Obama that a majority the public
Arab public says they're in favor of
Iran having nuclear weapons I mean I
doubt that they really are but I think
that's a sign of outrage so what is the
Iranian threat well we have enough
tative answered it ought to be in the
headlines of the newspapers every year
the Pentagon and US intelligence provide
an analysis to Congress of the global
security situation last one was last
April of course there was a big section
on Iran what they say is interesting
they say there is no military threat
Iran has limited to passages deployed
force as some of the lowest military
spending in the region obviously nothing
like the United States it's a strategic
doctrine is completely defensive to fend
off an invasion they say if they're
developing a nuclear capability that
would be part of their deterrence
strategy well you know you look at the
world see nobody needs it more than a
rat so that's the threat so what is the
threat then they go on to say yes it's a
major threat what's the threat they're
trying to expand their influence in the
neighboring countries they're exercising
sovereignty our regional power they want
to have influence in countries that are
occupied by the United States on their
borders now when we invade and occupy
those countries that's not a threat
that's called stabilization well no one
whatever critique US foreign policy is
being guided by intelligence thanks very
much for joining us in thanks and thank
you for joining us on the real news
