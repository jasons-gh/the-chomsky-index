to look into the question of language
design it's useful to think of how human
beings evolved we don't know a great
deal about it but we know some things so
for example it's fairly clear from the
archaeological record that modern humans
modern Homo sapiens cognitively modern
Homo sapiens developed quite recently in
evolutionary time and maybe within the
last roughly hundred thousand years
which is a flick of an eye that's when
you get the enormous increase explosion
of indications of the creative activity
complex family structures symbolism and
so on all of this develops roughly in
that period and interestingly there has
been no detectable evolution of these
capacities in roughly the past 50,000
years that's the period since our
ancestors left Africa a small number of
them and pretty quickly spread over the
world so all humans are pretty much
identical with regard the cognitive
capacity linguistic capacity and so on
which means that there's been
essentially no detectable evolution so
there's a small window there where
something happened and it's generally
assumed by paleoanthropologist people
who study these topics that must have
been the emergence of language because
it's hard to imagine any of these
basically creative activities without
language and that language does provide
the mechanisms for them so it seems as
though the core of human sensibility and
a creative and cognitive capacity is the
development of this completely unique
capacity
there's nothing analogous to it anywhere
in the animal world
there are animal signaling systems but
they're completely different in design
and use in just about every dimension so
something strange happened roughly maybe
a hundred thousand years ago not very
long and language emerged in humans and
the question then is well what kind of a
system is it on the surface languages
look very different from one another so
if somebody walks into the room and
starts speaking Swahili I'm not going to
understand a word though I will
recognize that it's a language I won't
understand it but I know it's not noise
no as soon as you look more deeply you
find that these languages are basically
mold into a pretty similar design may be
an identical design the large parts of
the length of what we hear is just the
sounds but that's a very superficial
part of language the core of language is
principles that determine actually an
infinite array of possible expressions
structured expressions which have
definite meanings now all of that is
well beyond what we can just observe but
I say looking at the texts and when a
child is learning a language the child
doesn't learn those things there's no
evidence for them almost no evidence for
them nobody can teach them we don't know
what they are these are just part of our
nature the core principle so-called
syntactic principles that form
expressions and that provide specific
interpretations for them that's
apparently just all part of our nature
and then there are various ways of
externalizing it in sound or in sign
which is about the same but it but
that's a kind of a superficial
manifestation of an internal uniformity
and the really exciting and it almost
has to be this way if you think about
the way the system developed it
very suddenly in evolutionary terms
which meant that there were very limited
selection Alisha's so it probably was
designed as a computational as it is a
computational system so many explanation
for this array of capacities
computational systems have certain
optimal characteristics that some are
more efficient than others and there's
every reason to believe that this
developed pretty suddenly as an optimal
communication system essentially
following laws of nature very much the
way a snowflake assumes a very complex
form and not because of experience or
training but just because that's the way
the laws of physics work and there's
every reason to believe that language is
something like this now to try to show
it is a trivial matter you have to try
to show that the superficial variety of
languages actually reduces to principles
of a common character which approach
notions of optimal design and there has
been I think no notable progress in that
process is a long way to go to try to
demonstrate it for but then of course
then one wants to go beyond tried maybe
ultimately to discover the neural basis
for whatever this unique capacity is and
it's a very hard problem the study for
humans so we know a lot about the human
visual system because of direct
experimentation with cats and monkeys we
allow ourselves to do direct
experimentation you know sticking
electrodes into the brain and so on
controlled experiments but we don't do
it with humans and humans have about the
same visual system as cats and monkeys
so we know about the human visual system
you can't do that for language there are
no analogous systems
so you can stand watch you studying
other animals we're unique in this
respect and invasive experiments with
human beings are of course barred so
it's a very complex and intricate matter
to try to find clever ways of getting
around the barriers to learn something
about these topics and some progress is
being made I think we can look forward
to a period when there will be
convergence of various modes of inquiry
into design of language neuro basis
acquisition of our possible varieties of
language and so on that's crucial task
for the future which in fact is directed
to the core of human nature the core of
cognitive of human nature the most
intriguing question I think is the one
that I have basically just mentioned
there's reason to believe that the core
of human intellectual nature cognitive
nature is a computational system which
probably has something like the
properties of a snowflake it simply had
to develop this way given biological and
physical law and special circumstances
and the most intriguing question is to
try to see if that's true but if it is
to show that it's true
