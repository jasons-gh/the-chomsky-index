I'm just an ordinary mum who just thinks
in terms of I don't want to someday be
holding my grandchildren and watching
something horrible happen and feel like
I didn't do anything and I mean it's
obvious what what you're doing and my
question is on a practical level where
do you see the most practical place to
put your energy I mean tonight I feel in
overwhelm like I feel like it's too big
it's too much to even make a dent in the
way things change is because lots of
people are working all the time and you
know they're working in their
communities in their workplace or
wherever they happen to be and they're
building up the basis for popular
movements which are going to make
changes that's the way everything has
ever happened in history you know
whether it was in slavery or whether it
was with Emma Craddock revolutions or
anything you want you name it that's the
way it worked you get a very false
picture of this from the history books
in the history books there's a couple of
leaders you know George Washington or
Martin Luther King or whatever and I
don't want to say that those people are
unimportant
Martin Luther King was certainly
important but he was not the civil
rights movement Martin Luther King can
appear in the history books cost lots of
people whose names you will never know
and his names are all forgotten than who
may have been killed and so on we're
working down in the south
when you have active activists than
people concerned and people devoting
themselves and dedicating themselves to
social change or issues or whatever then
people like me can appear and we can
appear to be prominent but that's only
because somebody else is doing the work
and I work whether it will see giving
hundreds of talks a year or spending 20
hours a week writing letters or writing
books is not directed to intellectuals
and politicians it's directed to what
are called
ordinary people and what I expect from
them is in fact exactly what they are
that they should try to understand the
world and act in accordance with their
decent impulses and that they should try
to improve the world and many people are
willing to do that but they have to
understand that in fact as far as I can
see in these things well I feel that I'm
simply helping people develop the
courses of intellectual self-defense
what did you mean by that what will go
with such a course well I don't mean go
to school because when I'm going to get
it they're all right it means you have
to develop an independent mind and work
on it now it's extremely hard to do
alone
the beauty of their system is it
isolates everybody each person is
sitting alone in front of the tube
that's very hard to have ideas or
thoughts under those circumstances you
can't fight the world alone some people
can be prettier the way to do it is
through organization so courses an
intellectual self defense will have to
be in the context of political and other
organization
