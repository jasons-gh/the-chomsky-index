well unfortunately that may doom us all
not in the long-distance future that
just overwhelms everything the first
time in human history when we nori we
have the capacity to destroy the
conditions for decent survival and it's
already happening I mean just take a
look at species destruction a species
destruction now is estimated to be at
about the level of 65 million years ago
when an asteroid hit the earth and ended
the period of the dinosaurs wiped out
huge numbers of species same level today
and we're the asteroid and if and you
take a look at what's happening in the
world anybody looking at this from outer
space that be astonished I mean there
are sectors of the global population
they're trying to impede the catastrophe
there are other sectors that are trying
to accelerate it and you take a look at
who they are those who are trying to
impede it are the ones we call backward
indigenous populations the First Nations
in Canada you know aboriginals in
Australia tribal people in India all
over the world are trying to impede it
who's accelerating in the most
privileged advanced so called advanced
educated populations in the world US and
canada right in the late and we know why
they're also and here's an interesting
case of manufacture of consent and does
it work you took a look at international
polls on global warming Americans are
who are the most propaganda has done
this some of these huge propaganda
efforts to make it believe it's not
happening they're a little below the
norm but to the some effect of the
propaganda its stratified if you take a
look at Republicans their way below the
norm but what's happening in the
Republican Party all along all across
them spectrum is very striking so for
example about two-thirds of Republicans
believe that there were weapons of mass
destruction in Iraq that and the all
sorts of other things you know so so
it's it stratified but there but there's
some impact of the propaganda but not
overwhelming most of the population
still regards it as a serious problem
that there's actually an interesting
article about this in the columbia
journalism review with just a period
current issue you know the lead critical
review of journalism they attribute this
to what they call the doctrine of
fairness in the media doctrine of
fairness says that if you have an
opinion piece by 95 ninety-seven percent
of the scientists you have to pair it
with an opinion piece by the energy the
corporation's does that be fair balanced
there isn't any such doctrine like if
you have a an opinion piece of
denouncing putin as the new Hitler for
the neck singha Crimea you don't have to
balance it with an opinion piece saying
that a hundred years ago the united
states took over southeastern cuba at
the point of a gun and is still holding
it though it has absolutely no
justification other than to try to
undermine cuban development whereas in
contrast whatever you think of putin is
reasonable you don't have to have that
when you have to have fair and balanced
when it affects the concerns of private
power period but try to get an article
in the columbia journalism review
pointing that out although it's
transparent so all these things are
there but they can be overcome and
they'd better be on let this isn't
unless there's a sharp reversal in
policy unless we hear in the advanced
achill advanced societies
can gain the consciousness of the
indigenous people of the world we're in
deep trouble our grandchildren are going
to suffer from it and I think you would
agree that's not going to come from the
power elite certainly it's up to us
absolutely and it's urgent it is thank
you very much
