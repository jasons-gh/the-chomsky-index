good morning now hi hi thank you so much
for agreeing to participate in this
video conference with our students we
understand you coming especially on your
day off and so thanks very much and
without further ado I'd like to get
straight on to the questions if that's
okay with you sure okay okay hello what
question is how effective do you feel
civil disobedience was during the civil
rights movement and do you feel that
it's still relevant today when
considering mainstream media blackouts
of such events like march against
monsanto and protest the bradley manning
i'm sure i didn't care i couldn't care
to it could you repeat it okay how
effective do you feel the civil diff be
sorry civil disobedience was during the
civil rights movement and do you feel
it's still relevant today when
considering mainstream media blackouts
on such events as march against monsanto
and the protests were badly money well
the civil disobedience during civil
rights movement was highly effective not
because of media exposure and didn't
really get my most of it got very little
but just because the effect of civil
disobedience if it's done properly is to
encourage others to undertake actions
that they might not have considered
otherwise and it had a kind of a
steamroller in effect in that way and I
think there's every reason to expect
that it still will of course you have to
catch the imagination of the public and
reach the understanding of the public
the civil rights move activities like
others like say sanctions boycotts any
means that are taken can only
be effective if they are intelligible to
the audience you're trying to address
meaning they're based on educational and
organizational activities and they
inspire actions which can then escalate
and develop but I don't I think it's you
know it's a tactic it's been effective
when properly carried out in the past
carrot can be today okay another
question hello how effective do you feel
the brown versus the Board of Education
was in improving education in the civil
rights movement it was a very important
decision and there's no doubt that it
had a great impact on the other hand
that it did set off the counter
pressures which in many ways have
undercut its effectiveness so for
example it led to white flight and end
result does schools are probably as
segregated today as they were in the
early 1950s statistically speaking it
also schools in the united states are
funded by us pretty much buy property
taxes back if you go back 100 200 years
that was still not to inegalitarian
because so wealthy and poorer people
tended to live in more or less similar
places but as the as there's a sharper
and sharper division between the
communities of the very rich and the
urban ghettos of the very poor that
leads to radical differences in school
funding oh and of course it means that
the
close race class correlations of the
poor communities tend to be more the
black and Hispanic communities and their
school systems tend to be underfunded
and decline whereas in the wealthy
suburbs which tend to be overwhelmingly
white the funding is much greater there
are many greater opportunities the
schools are better so it leads to a
highly segregated school system based on
class and but nevertheless playing out
in terms of of race so the the educated
the brown the brown decision was itself
extremely significant it broke many
barriers that opened many opportunities
but it's only one thing happening in a
complex society which is going in quite
different directions in 1954 you could
not have predicted the neoliberal
assault on the population that's taken
place since the 1970s in the United
States and England particularly
partially in the rest of the developed
world and that that's had a huge effect
do you believe the assassination of
Malcolm X stifled the D radicalization
of some of the civil rights movement
groups the assassination of Malcolm X
was one case but remember not the only
one there are others that in my view
were more important than less publicized
the most significant assassination in
that whole year of assassinations that
was probably the assassination of Fred
Hampton in 1969 that was a very
significant case the Fred Hampton was a
Black Panther leader in Chicago a very
effective organizer the Panthers were
divided roughly into groups there were
pretty much criminal gangs and others
that were serious activists and
organizers the former nothing much
happened to them the latter were
decimated Hampton was the most probably
the most energetic and effective leader
he was killed the FBI had there was a
government a government repression
program COINTELPRO the worst government
repression program in American history
ran through several administrations
primarily the Kennedy Johnson and early
Nixon years it was it targeted virtually
everyone it started with the Communist
Party were touring an Independence Party
moved on to the black movements all the
black movements the entire new left the
women's movement if but the most lethal
parts of it were aimed at the black
movements especially the Panthers were
practically wiped down the Hampton
assassination was the most extreme case
he was he had been targeted for
assassination by the FBI national
political police
they tried to at first they tried to
encourage to incite and he was in
Chicago another Chicago gang Blackstone
Rangers they tried to incite the Rangers
to kill Hampton the circulated fake
letters to Rangers leaders written and
kind of fake black dialect you know
black brother I want to let you know
that Fred Hampton is trying to
assassinate your leaders of zon attack
that didn't work the Panthers and the
Rangers were too closely integrated so
the FBI then set up a essentially just
stop of style assassination they managed
to have his chief bodyguard be an FBI
Informer they circulated lies to the
Chicago Police that the Panthers were
stocking arms in Fred Hamptons apartment
set up a early morning raid on the
apartment by the Chicago Police in which
they shot their way in and murdered
Hampton who was sleeping in bed maybe
drugged another Panther Mark Clark was
also murdered that was the depths of the
government repression of the civil
rights movement and it was very
effective this was with a serious blow
to the significant organizing efforts of
the Panthers and other black
organizations it took years of effort by
the family in by a very dedicated group
of lawyers of small law firm they
finally won limited compensation from
the city and a kind of an
acknowledgement of gift but the whole
thing that disappeared under the radar
ver few people even know about it that
but that Malcolm X assassination and in
fact the killing off of much of the
Panther leadership that had a really
serious effect on the salon of the
liberation movements the Panthers were
pretty small organization maybe 800
people according to the FBI but they
were enemy number one and they went
after them in ways which are really
quite grotesque Hampton assassination is
the worst what's even worse is it isn't
well known should be do you believe the
n-double-a-cp relied too heavily on the
sympathies of the supreme supreme court
well I think they they were right to try
to appeal to the Supreme Court and they
won some victories at the cut
considering the kind of group they were
basically a middle-class mixed race
organization I think they followed
tactics that were appropriate to them
they didn't do other things which would
not have been appropriate for their
membership and the groups to which they
had outreach and there were some fairly
significant Supreme Court cases not all
pushed by the NAC p in fact it was
during the 1960's that the United States
reached a level of protection of freedom
of speech that is unparalleled in the
world certainly far beyond England or
any other country that I know of that
was supreme court cases and the most
important one was nineteen sixty four
that was actually a case involving
Martin Luther King and the civil rights
movement and azp was involved in it and
they did 11 a signet win a significant
ruling it essentially struck down the
law
of seditious libel the law that says
that it's a crime to attack the
sovereign in words which a law that
holds and just about every country
including England and in many ways
sharply inhibits freedom of speech but
that was struck down in a case involving
civil rights movement there were others
later on and in general the sixties
courts the Warren Court did achieve some
significant steps and advancing civil
liberties and civil rights a lot of its
being reversed now under the reactionary
courts of the recent years but that's an
avenue that ought to be pursued in a
society in which the legal system has
any significant standing at all and it
certainly does in the United States
hello how important was Martin Luther
King to the civil rights movement I
didn't hear the first part how important
was my Luther King Martin Luther King I
smoke it's almost like asking how
important was Nelson Mandela to the
anti-apartheid movement after all he was
in jail all his life but it was
undoubtedly very important as a symbol
of honorable and courageous struggle and
the same is true of King King would have
been the first to tell you that he did
not organize and lead the civil rights
movement but he did very effectively and
very courageously yeah a ride on the
ground swell that was developing carry
it forward and symbolize it too it went
way beyond the civil rights move
in fact if you take a look at the
accolades to Martin Luther King on his
unease anniversaries it is a king on a
national anniversary for King in January
the accolades typically stop with his
famous I have a dream speech in
Washington 1964 which did at the
forefront of a huge civil rights
demonstration which had helped Lyndon
Johnson push through voting rights
legislation which was quite significant
but King didn't stop there actually he
gave another I have a dream speech which
is in many ways more significant but is
virtually unknown in 1968 the evening
before his assassination he was in
Memphis Tennessee he went there to
support a strike of public workers
garbage workers strike sanitation
workers strike he was there to support
the strike there were big demonstrations
and he gave a very effective speech in
which he used the biblical rhetoric that
came kind of naturally to him he
described himself as being like Moses on
a mountain who can see the Promised Land
the Promised Land would be one of equal
rights justice end of exploitation end
of wars brought in strong class issues
he said he could see the promised land
he knew that he himself would never get
there but you the people who are
struggling you'll be able to get there
if you continue and the next day he was
murdered he was on it who was on his way
to he was organizing a poor people's
movement there was going to be a mass
uh kind of kind of a caravan from
Memphis Tennessee where he was to
Washington DC he was killed but was led
by his widow Coretta King and they went
through the main of places of civil
great civil rights struggle during the
1960's Home Alabama and others and they
finally ended up in Washington where
they set up a tent city resurrection
city they were calling for Congress to
pass legislation with a class nature
that would deal with a fundamental
problem of poverty with housing
discrimination the United States portal
is substantially black but not entirely
plenty of white poverty with you know
proc poverty so they set up the tent
city the police allowed them to stay
there for a little while then nothing
had no legislation in the middle of the
night the police were sent in by the
Congress Congress runs Washington that's
the most liberal Congress in American
history probably sent in the police
smashed up the tent city drove him out
of town in the middle of the night that
was the end of the Poor People's
Movement King didn't end his work in
1964 but the liberal establishment was
not going to tolerate any more of it as
soon as he turned to class issues and
began to move towards the north and also
turned the opposition of the Vietnam War
which he did very strongly and that was
intolerable at that point the white
liberal establishment turned against him
and he kind of more or less disappears
from history official history but not
actual history his achievements which
were significant in the civil rights
movement continued in the years that
followed up until his assassination if
that's been blanked out of history it's
kind of like blanking out the
Hampton assassination there are things
that a way to stab liberal establishment
elites just don't want to be part of
history but it's there and it's there
and the minds and hearts and actions of
those who continue the struggles that he
was part of so sure he was very
significant between the timeframe
nineteen forty-five to sixty eight what
are the most fundamental breakthroughs
in your opinion sorry I didn't get it
between the times became nineteen
forty-five to sixty eight what are the
fundamental breakthroughs in your
opinion what were the fundamental
breakthroughs yeah domestically or
internationally domestically in the
United States yeah domestic I assume you
mean domestically within the United
States well probably the most
significant up to nineteen sixty-eight
up to the mid-1960s it was in fact the
civil rights movement after all there
were after bear in mind that in American
history there are two major original
sins now this is typical incidentally of
the what's called the Anglosphere the
expansion of England through the world
the colonies that were settled by
England Canada the United States
Australia and New Zealand all of them
this entire Anglosphere was based on a
first expulsion or extermination of the
indigenous population that's one huge
crime unrequited still exists different
forms in different places and the other
specifically in the United States was
slavery first slaves came
16-20 along with the earliest English
colonists and the history of state
slavery continues literally without a
break it still continues today in other
forms well the civil rights the
technically still slavery ended at the
end of the second of the Civil War 1865
but that was only technically now there
was a roughly ten year period in which
there were rights given the freed slaves
but about ten years later or 1877 there
was a compact between the North and the
South which essentially permitted the
South to do it essentially what it
wanted and what they wanted what they
did was reinstate a form of slavery it
was done through criminalizing black
life so for example laws were
established which meant that isn't it
which had the effect that say if a black
man was standing on a corner he could be
arrested for vagrancy and charged maybe
ten dollars when she didn't have and
sent to prison and wasn't able to pay
the debt and stayed there forever or if
he was if somebody claimed that he'd
been looking the wrong way at a white
woman he could be charged with attempted
rape and given a much more serious
sentence that he could never get out of
and through a combination of corrupt
judges corrupt sheriff's racist
institutions plenty of violence Ku Klux
Klan was famous but a lot more violence
what was called Jim Crow through these
mechanisms that much of the black
population was was was imprisoned mostly
men but later some women that created a
workforce which was far superior from
the point of view of the owners to
slaves slaves remember our capital you
have to you have to keep your capital
surviving if your slave owner but if you
can use in prison labor that's perfect
the state's keeping them alive you don't
have to pay a penny furthermore they're
very disciplined they're not going to
strike there's easy to punish them in
all sorts of ways so you get a
disciplined extremely cheap labor force
that you don't have to pay for and
that's the basis for a large part of the
American industrial revolution u.s.
steel coal industry mining industry and
what the familiar familiar part of it is
agribusiness the chain gangs but that
was only a small part there was a whole
part of the whole industrial revival of
the late 19th early 20th century was
based on essentially slave labor
reinstitution of slavery that went on
until the Second World War literally
during the Second World War there was a
need for what's called free labor in the
war industries so the this
criminalization system eroded and black
especially black men but also some black
men women were able to work their way
into the labor force in the war
industries then came to two decades of
substantial economic growth 1950s and
60s that was the highest growth period
in the country's history and also
egalitarian so the lowest quintile did
about the same as the upper quinta
unions permed they were strong and the
black population was able to begin to
work its way into the general society
black man could get a job in the auto
industry they had a pretty good union
UAW buy a small home make a little money
and send his kid to college just begin
to be part of the society and in the
course of those 20 years the civil
rights movement took off
in the early 50s reached a very
important development in 1960 when
several a couple of black students in
Greensboro North Carolina sat in at a
lunch counter which was illegal and of
course where North Carolina were
immediately arrested it could have been
the end of it but the next day most more
black students came pretty soon it
turned into a kind of a flood you got
the organization of snake the Student
Nonviolent Coordinating Committee
Freedom Riders in the south pretty soon
a burgeoning movement developed it led
to the great events like Birmingham
Selma and others finally the march on
Washington civil rights legislation all
of that was extremely important then and
those were major developments I mean
they've changed the society undoubtedly
but we shouldn't overlook what happened
afterwards in the 1970s the the liberate
liberating effects of the 1960's went
well beyond the civil rights movement
for example the women's movement really
took off in the late 1960s was its
incipient stages it had a major effect
that's probably the most effective most
long-standing effect on the society of
any of the activist movements it kind of
was inspired in the 60s took off mostly
in the 70s the as far as the black
movements were concerned they hit a
limit as soon as it turned to class
issues there is a class 'close class
race correlation and as the black and
increasingly Latino issues and
incidentally it's included many women
many women workers as they began to
strike the to reach up against the class
barriers there was a big reaction part
of it was reinstitution
of the criminalization of the black
population that in effect restored a
kind of slavery in the late 19th century
so if you take say the incarceration
rate in the United States take a look at
it around nineteen eighty it was
approximately the same as the rest of
the developed societies which societies
little on the high end but not much
within the spectrum by now it's out of
sight it's 52 times 5 10 times as high
as the next of the wealthy societies I
think actually England a second and but
way beyond the level it's overwhelmingly
black males increasingly black black
females Latinos it's not based on crime
has nothing to do with increase in crime
the device that was used to
recrimination that was the drug war drug
wars a total fraud has virtually nothing
to do with drugs the price of drugs done
change after 40 years of drug wars
availability doesn't change and what the
drug war has succeeded in doing is
providing a device to criminalize the
poor and the poor the United States
happen to be overwhelmingly black and
Latino mostly males so by now huge this
is a it's a race work almost entirely
from the first moment you know police
the orders given to the police as to how
to deal with drugs so you know you don't
go into the white suburbs and arrest
some stockbroker who says sniffing coke
in the evening but you do go into the
black ghettos and if a kid has a joint
in his pocket put them in jail so it
starts with police actions not the
choice of the police themselves but the
orders given to them the sentencing
which is grotesquely disproportionate
and on into the
huge prison sentences and then the
highly punitive system that's instituted
after if anybody ever gets out of prison
the prisons aren't for rehabilitation
not in the United States therefore
punishment when you get when somebody
spends a large part of his life there he
knows only one thing how to be a
criminal when they get out there's no
jobs there are conditions that bar them
from getting jobs under Clinton they
were kicked out of public housing the
other such devices end result is
something like reinstating Jim Crow at
the black population now is they don't
call it slavery but it's under
conditions of impoverishment
impoverishment and deprivation that are
extremely severe and if you take a look
at the whole 400 years of American
history 1620 up to the present it has
been about 20 maybe 30 years of relative
freedom for the black population that's
a real score on the society and the
great achievement of the civil rights
movement can't be denied it did change
the country but we shouldn't overlook
the fact that it as I said before it's
set in motion forces which try to
reverse those changes and essentially to
protect class privilege that's the
crucial thing that has to be protected
other things you can sort of deal with
okay we have time for some more
questions any more questions here okay
hello in the past you've described
yourself as a libertarian socialist a
conservative and an anarchist based on
these specific perspectives how do you
see the British model of state
capitalism compared to American state
capitalism today British form a kind of
a wealth kind of a kind of a gentle
welfare state society with strong unions
kind of a generally decent relations
among human beings I used to like to go
to England in the 1950s and 60s
especially since Thatcher has become a
much harsher society its following the
American model which has also become
much harsher and more punitive Britain
isn't quite there but its following
along back in the 1940s when the United
States was displacing Britain as a
global power the British Foreign Office
didn't like it obviously they weren't
happy that the United States was kind of
elbowing them out all over the world and
when commentators in the British Foreign
Office said look we gotta face it we're
the junior partners in the American
Empire and that's expanded into the
domestic situation too I think England
is succeeding in picking up many of the
worst features of American culture and
society and they're finding its own ways
to implement them speaking of the
educational system higher education if
you haven't done so I'd strongly advise
you're reading a very good article on
British higher education by Stefan
collini that appeared in the London
Review of Books a couple of weeks ago a
comprehensive review of what the
coalition government
Cameron government is doing to the
higher education system again taking the
most vulgar elements of American culture
thee and trying to institute a business
model on the colleges and universities
and he goes through the details I'm sure
you're familiar with it his bottom line
is that the coalition government is
succeeding in taking and turning
first-rate universities into third-rate
commercial enterprises and I think that
captures pretty well a lot of what's
happening in England today it's a it's a
real shame and disaster there should be
it's not irreversible but it's going to
take hard work
it's been covered okay what we're of
time no I'm how much time have we got I
want okay yeah okay I'll hand over to
this questioner just five minutes very
very briefly then what do you consider
the most important civil rights issue
today and how should we combat it a
couple of years ago Amnesty
International the head of Amnesty
International came out with a book in
which he said that the worst human
rights issue in the world is poverty and
I think you can say the same about civil
rights the worst civil rights issue in
the world is poverty it shows up in all
kinds of ways over and above poverty
there are levels of racism which are
awful discrimination sexism
unfortunately somewhat declining many
other things but poverty is a
fundamental attack on elementary human
rights which blocks prevents develop
human development in all sorts of ways
and feeds directly into other human
rights and civil rights issues so my
feeling is that that's the core issue I
agree with mr. national on that okay
thank you so much no I'm yeah thank you
you
