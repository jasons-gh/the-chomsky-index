oh yeah public broadcasting well public
broadcasting is an interesting case in a
lot of countries public broadcasting is
I mean how free public broadcasting is
public broadcasting is not subject as
much at least to business and to
corporate and advertiser pressures
however of course it's subject to state
pressures and how free and independent
public broadcasting is depends typically
on how free the state is not like in a
free society public broadcasting will be
free for many years the BBC was very
independent with Thatcher another
anti-democratic reactionary the BBC has
been become much more constrained
because of the British government is
also imposing harsh constraints on
freedom of expression under Thatcher
another's mislabeled conservative but
turning to the United States public
broadcasting is very weak as compared
with virtually any other country any
other democratic country you know any of
the you look at the industrial
democratic societies they all have
public broadcasting some of them about
only public broadcasting for example in
Israel there's only a state TV in
England until recently there was only
state TV and now there's another channel
to other channels I think in Canada if a
till recently there's only CBC there may
be another one now I forgotten but it's
common I mean those are major channels
and that's true of most countries and
how free they are depends on how free
the country is in the United States
they're very weak because here things
are run by corporations this is a
business run Society and things supposed
to be under corporate control so public
broadcasting is very limited and in fact
it survives to a large extent on
corporate donations which is a
constraint Gulf and Western and one
famous case forced wnet TV in New York
to cancel a program on hunger simply by
saying they remove their sub engine and
they submit and Public Broadcasting is
is you know it varies across the country
in the major centers like Boston and
Washington and New York it's very very
narrow it's in fact it's I think it's
more tightly censor than corporate radio
on television in other parts of the
country like you know Laramie Wyoming
and Des Moines Iowa and maybe here it's
more free and that makes sense the same
is true of the commercial media because
in the ideological centers it's much
more important to control what people
think what they think out and the sticks
doesn't matter so much because there's
not much they can do about it
and as a result it's more open I mean I
can see that myself if I go to Laramie I
get interviewed on public television on
public television but the same can see
virtually inconceivable in Boston you
know maybe a minute now and then or
something in the interests of you know a
fair answers but that and the reason is
that you know well the main centers like
save lost and are subject to what's
called a liberal bias meaning tightly
controlled by ideological managers who
know their business and don't let things
get out of hand I think it's possible to
put the kind of pressures on public
broadcasting that can't be done on
corporate media but to that that
requires organization and real
participation there are other forms I
should say one of the most some of the
most interesting and important things
are listener supported radio now that's
usually a small-scale operation you know
fly-by-night operation but they're very
important that's really out of corporate
control or state control and you can
tell you travel around as I do to
communities and the ones that have
listener supported radio are quite
different there's just an independent
culture that can sustain itself there
with people participating and you know
involvement of the community I mean it's
just much more democratic and but you
can see the results but that's you know
very limited resources because resources
lie essentially in the business
community
