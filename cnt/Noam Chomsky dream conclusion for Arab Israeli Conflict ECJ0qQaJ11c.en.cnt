well back in the 1940s I was very active
politically mostly on these topics I was
what was then called a Zionist what is
now called anti Zionist I was in favor
of binational arrangement based on
Jewish Arab working-class cooperation
left by nationalism and I don't think it
was an idle dream those are different
days from today
maybe we shouldn't look at things from
today's perspective anyway that was what
I was engaged and and I still believe it
I think the best kind of system would be
a libertarian Left libertarian not in
the American sense a system based on
cooperation of arab-jewish working
people developing their own free
institutions in a society in which
there's no national state that picks one
group over the other so I was very much
opposed to a Jewish state which was part
of the Zionist movement at the time
remember this is pre 48 is that
achievable well maybe but you have to
adapt your goals to existing
circumstances from from 1967 to about
1975 I think it was a position that
could have been implemented there was a
kind of a basis for it and in fact I
wrote about it at the time quite a lot
it was hated by everybody I just
announced all across the board
nevertheless I think it was correct by
the mid seventies it was no longer
feasible the Palestinian nationalism had
taken its position on the that
domestically and in the international
arena as far as I can see today the only
way of moving toward the
Oh or anything like it is in stages in
which the first stage is the
international consensus on a two-state
settlement which is blocked by the
United States and Israel but if that can
be implemented it could be the basis for
moving on to something much better I
can't think of any other way
and there are people who talk about one
state but I think that's idle
there's no way to achieve that except in
stages that just has no support anywhere
either in the domestic populations or in
the international arena so by calling
for one I mean we have to make it if
you're a serious activist you have to
make a familiar distinction to all
activists between distinction between
proposing and advocating you can propose
anything you like you can propose that
everybody live in peace and love each
other that's fine but if you're serious
you advocate a way to get from here to
there if you don't do that
it's vacuous and if there's another old
if there's an alternative I've never
seen it suggested
