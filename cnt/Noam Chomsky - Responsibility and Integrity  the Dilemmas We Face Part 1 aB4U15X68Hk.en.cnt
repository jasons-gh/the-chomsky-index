my name is Eric Roland and I represented
the organizers of this very special
event I am very pleased to see all and
it's a great privilege that Noam Chomsky
has agreed to come to Utrecht and
deliver a lecture to our students on
responsibility and integrity the dilemma
as we face the primary goal of our
humanities lecture series is to motivate
our students to look beyond their
displays become aware of broader
connections and to enable them to play
the role in society that our society
needs to be able to distinguish what's
going on under behind the surface this
crucial awareness is what we as
organizers are convinced non-toxic
lecture will help to develop an
awareness of what is hidden beyond the
facades of institutional Newsweek and
that's why we're here together what does
a brain of a Dean of humanities look
like when it's asked to introduce Noam
Chomsky an earring Roland asked me I
thought this is a chance of a lifetime
and immediately called my colleague at
the Medical Center with an ambulance
they took me to the seven Tesla and
started the MRI procedure clearly we
could see that there were several
functions in the brain activated at
different stages first of all the large
area of proudness in the left part
lightened up years later this Dean would
be able to say to everyone in the
nursing home time and again
I introduce Noam Chomsky the only thing
the Dean hoped for was that by then the
nurses would be so kind to believe him
then the brain activity moved to the
right part near the area of despair
introducing now Chomsky was a hopeless
and even impossible enterprise anything
that would come out of the deans mouth
would be hopelessly irrelevant for
everybody in the audience since everyone
knew who he was proved even before
eating the pudding was that it took only
two seconds before all seats for this
event was sold close to this area the
small spot of Hope flared up yes maybe
there was one listener who did not know
which on ski was the Dean would design
his speech exclusively for that one lost
poor and wondering sold as the skin
preceded the Dean started designing his
academic and therefore familien it
introduction he would give the audience
the titles of the books Noam Chomsky had
ridden for that's what all scholars do
with someone who needs to be introduced
first they name the title then they gave
a short description of the content and
finally they give a brief overview of
the impact the books had made lying in
the seventh Tesla the Dean took a cell
phone and called Eric how much time did
he have for his introduction five
minutes teeruk replied but I need at
least five hours the Dean cried out noam
chomsky has published 105 books between
1957 when syntactic structure saw the
light and october last year 2010 when
gaza in crisis appeared so one hour for
reading the titles and the second error
for giving in
description of the content not only
linguistics but also philosophy like
power and ideology from 1987 or the
Chomsky Foucault debate from 2006 but
not only philosophy but also political
theory like American power and the new
mandarins from nineteen sixty-nine to
failed States the abuse of power and the
assaulted and democracy from that 2006
and the other three hours the Dean
needed for discussing the impact they
would have to limit himself to only a
tiny part of this world the Netherlands
Europe the United States and the Middle
East when the scan was finished the Dean
walked out of the hospital like a new
man his brains felt clear and totally
blank like fresh fallen snow he knew the
opening line of his introductory speech
he would say dear professor Chomsky that
was the idea and then he would read a
poem by one of his most beloved poets
mark strand it was called the idea
for us to there was a wish to possess
something beyond the world we knew
beyond ourselves beyond our power to
imagine something nevertheless in which
we might see ourselves and this desire
came always in passing in waning light
and in such cold that ice on the valleys
lakes cracked and rolled and blowing
snow covered what earth we saw and seems
from the past and the surfaced again
look not as they had but ghostly and
white among false curves and hidden
AirAsia's and never once did we feel we
were close until the night wind said why
do this especially now go back to the
place you belong and there appeared with
its windows glowing small in the
distance and the frozen reaches a cabin
when we stood before it amazed at its
being there and would have gone forward
and opened the door and stepped into the
globe and warmed ourselves there but
that it was ours by not being hours and
should remain empty that was the idea
professor Chomsky welcome
not used to such eloquent introductions
that makes it a hard act to follow the
term intellectuals in the modern sense
in the sense in which we now use it that
pretty much came into the conventional
usage with the Dreyfus arts in the late
19th century and they're now very much
honored for their courage and standing
up for justice and human rights the
howard is worth remembering that the
Dreyfus arts were a small minority the
great mass of intellectuals in France
and elsewhere supported the state and
that's pretty typical in fact that helps
us distinguish two interpretations of
the common phrase responsibility of
intellectuals one interpretation has to
do with the functions the tasks the role
that they actually fulfill question fact
another question value of what role sure
they fulfill it would be nice to say
that the answer to these two questions
is the same but in fact what the rather
typical situation is what in fact was
illustrated by the by the Dreyfus art
example if you go a few years beyond
into the early years of the last century
World War one the intellectual classes
on all sides passionately supported
their own
days inn in the First World War there
were a few exceptions as there always
are in England Bertrand Russell Germany
Rosa Luxemburg and karl liebknecht in
the United States Eugene Debs they all
ended up in jail which reflects another
aspect of intellectual life those who
depart from the assigned task support
for power framing of issues to provide
justifications for power they usually
suffer in one way or another how how
they suffered depends on the character
of the state but it's it's pretty common
so for example in the Soviet Union in
the old Soviet Union in the post on Yura
did the intellectually we call
dissidents were treated pretty bad for
example in Czechoslovakia Vaslav Havel
was jailed house arrest insulted condemn
similarly in in the other countries of
Eastern Europe sometimes worse but that
was the typical situation well that was
bad but it could have been worse so for
example hvala and his associates could
have had their brains blown out by elite
check forces fresh from training in the
Soviet Union who already had
to thousands of bloodied victims of
their credit but that's not invented
that's what happened in exactly the same
time in u.s. domains that happened to be
in El Salvador one week after the fall
of the Berlin Wall the daily unit of the
Salvadoran army fresh from training at
the John F Kennedy special warfare
school in North Carolina on the explicit
orders of the government than the High
Command which has since surface broke
into the University Jesuit University
killed the rector six leading Jesuit
intellectuals major figures in Latin
American intellectual life blew the
brains out killed their housekeeper and
daughter because the orders were not to
leave any victims and then escaped the
this battalion had already killed that
had a bloody role of victims in the
preceding ten years there were ten years
of major atrocities beginning with the
assassination of an archbishop reading
mass called the voice for the voiceless
Archbishop Romero and plenty of
religious martyrs in between plenty of
intellectuals attacked and killed in
between many escaped many escaped to
Nicaragua which in the 1980s was kind of
like Paris in the 1930s the place where
people escaped from the terror states
surrounding them then it was Stalinist
Russia Nazi Germany in the 1980s it was
the various terror states that the u.s.
was funding supporting and participating
in their crimes the what happened in El
Salvador was bad enough it was about
70,000 killed almost entirely the
government related security forces
funded by the US trained and armed by
them but the other countries were even
worse Guatemala was about a hundred
thousand and Nicaragua maybe 30,000
altogether about 200,000 people killed
in the 1980s that was called a war on
terror ronald reagan came into office in
1981 and declared that the core function
of u.s. foreign policy would be to
combat the plague of the modern age
return to barbarism and air time namely
state-supported international terrorism
that episode has kind of been
disappeared from history the bar of the
latin american transitive verb disappear
it's been eliminated kind of wrong story
wrong agency not the right kind of thing
to remember it it goes back much before
that this war on the the murder of the
jesuit intellectuals in 1989 terminated
a long campaign of terror and brutality
that started in the early 1960s the it
started actually with Vatican to the
Vatican 2 in 1962 was a an attempt by
the Pope Pope on the twenty-third to
institute a really radical change in
church history as probably no he won't
he tried to restore the Church of early
Christian
the Gospels what they actually say a
message of radical pacifism which is of
course why the early Christians were
persecuted that changed in the fourth
century when the Roman Empire took over
the church made it the Church of the
persecutors not the church of the
persecuted in the phrase of
distinguished theologian Hans kung one
of those punished in the period of the
60s and 70s he he wasn't killed he was
just kind of kept from the genes on
these lucky in 1962 Vatican to the the
Pope declared the an effort to return
the church to its original mission to be
the church of the persecuted a very
significant change and it was taken
seriously particularly in Latin America
Latin American the latin-american
bishops had adopted that program they
adopted what was called the preferential
option for the poor message comes out of
the Gospels and priests and nuns
laypersons it went to the countryside to
try to organize peasants into base
communities where they would read the
Gospels think about ways to adopt
measures to survive somehow in the
extremely harsh domains of us power that
was a heresy that was not going to be
tolerated the u.s. very quickly launched
the war against the church at the church
and all social movements that were
participating in these similar efforts
it began very quickly in 1964 the
military coup took place in Brazil
overthrowing the civilian government
that had actually been prepared by the
Kennedy administration carried out
shortly after Kennedy's assassination
that established the what was called a
national security state kind of a
neo-nazi style terror and torture state
Brazil's a big country and big influence
a plague spread through the hemisphere
Chile Uruguay Argentina one country
after another similar phenomena plenty
of religious martyr because they were in
the forefront and it continued through
Central America in the 1980s it
essentially terminated with the murder
of the six Jesuit intellectuals in
November 1989 right at the time the fall
of Berlin Wall well it's well known to
scholarship that the terror and
atrocities and brutality and slaughter
in Latin America from the sixth from
1960 to the end of the century we're in
comparably worse than anything that
happened in Eastern Europe in those
years what happened in Eastern Europe is
bad enough but what went on in Western
domains was incomparable worse that's
known the scholarship for example you
can read it in the recently published a
Cambridge University history the Cold
War kind of comment on it but it's not
known to the public what's known to the
public is the suffering of the East
European byzance which was real and they
should be respected and honored but in
comparison with what was happening
elsewhere they were pretty lucky far
luckier than the Jesuits of El Salvador
Archbishop for many others during those
years well at the task one of the the
task of intellectuals is to reach to
ensure that we know about the East
European dissident and we pride
ourselves on our heroism and supporting
them but we don't know about the ones
who we slaughtered and tortured and
killed that's out of history not to be
remembered I happen to be in Europe in
November in november two thousand nine
at the 30th anniversary of the fall of
the Berlin Wall and that was a great
deal of euphoria self-congratulation
about our great courage and supporting
dissidents in the enemy's domain but
there wasn't a word about what happened
in Latin America primarily carried out
by the United States but with a strong
support of its European allies all the
way through well that's the typical task
of the intellectuals if you go back to
say the Vietnam War there was protest
and substantial protest I mostly on the
part of young people students people
outside the elite intellectual circles
there was some protests there but very
muted and quite interesting in its
character written about it if you want
the details up through the early years
of the war it was overwhelmingly strong
support for the war virtually no protest
in fact support for the war was so
strong that very few people even today
know when the war began actually began
just 50 years ago in 1961 kennedy
president kennedy at the time sent the
American Air Force to start bombing self
it
authorized the use of napalm chemical
warfare to destroy crops and ground
cover programs to drive the rural
population which was overwhelmingly
supportive of the guerrillas as they
knew to drive them into what amounted
the concentration camps called strategic
Hamlet's to surround him with barbed
wire to protect them from the guerrillas
who they were strongly supporting that
end up with millions of people being
driven out and off to describe what
happened to South Vietnam was virtually
destroyed the work expanded to the rest
of the of Indochina always with European
support and with virtually no criticism
by the about nineteen 66 or 67 there
were few voices of criticism in educated
circles on the grounds that it was not
working very well same kind of grounds
you here today in Afghanistan or he
heard a couple of years ago about Iraq
wasn't working too well you know maybe
it was a mistake in 1968 everything
changed in january nineteen sixty eight
there was an amazing uprising in south
vietnam there's been nothing like it in
history the country was saturated with
over half a million american troops over
a hundred thousand chi korean other
mercenaries a huge army seven or eight
hundred thousand people every village
penetrated informants everywhere all of
a sudden in january nineteen sixty eight
there was an uprising which no one knew
about everyone had kept quiet and it was
all over the country practically you
know went broke into the American
Embassy you know
this is the Tet Offensive I don't think
there's ever been a case of such
overwhelming commitment to a
revolutionary cause no one even talked
about it and it was a surprise
everywhere well that struck a chord with
the American business community the ones
who are decisive in determining policy
it got them to recognize that this war
isn't worth fighting any longer we've
basically won our objectives to waste
the money in time and they pressured the
government a pretty strong power play to
reverse policy and the government did
follow orders reverse policy started
withdrawing troops entered negotiations
of the president announced that he's not
going to run for a second term and so on
the intellectuals responded almost
reflexively all of a sudden everybody
became a long-term opponent of the war
without any trace that anyone can find
in fact the record says the opposite but
that was the new party line where
long-term opponents of the war got to
get out the state should have gotten in
and so on there there are a number of
leading figures in the Kennedy
administration who wrote memoirs Arthur
Schlesinger writer hillsman and theater
Soren's and others they rewrote their
memoirs literally the early memoirs the
ones written at the time if you look at
them we're fully supportive of the war
or often didn't even mention it was so
interesting the post 1968 story which is
the one that enters into history is
Kennedy was going to pull out of Vietnam
everybody was opposed you know never
gotten it in the first place it's the
bed Texan Lyndon Johnson who turned
everything around
and we the intellectuals were passionate
the opponents of the war couldn't make a
case that's the more or less official
story today there is a but by now the if
you go to 1975 when the war officially
ended it was quite interesting to look
at what was being written then and what
popular attitudes were then at that time
among the public about seventy percent
of the population in polls said that the
war was not a mistake it was
fundamentally wrong and immoral that's
seventy percent of the population not a
phrase like that in the educated
community in fact that the outside
limits of criticism say in the New York
Times of the most dissident journalists
anthony lewis wrote that began with
blundering efforts to do good efforts to
do good is tautological the US
government was carrying out it out so it
was efforts to do good blundering yeah
it didn't work so it began with
blundering efforts to do good but by
1969 that's after the Tet Offensive it
had become clear that the war was a
mistake and that we could not achieve
our by definition noble objectives at a
cost acceptable to ourselves so it was
really a mistake that's the critical end
of a leap educated dissident opinion at
a time when seventy percent of the
population said no it's not a mistake
it's fundamentally wrong a tomorrow
those are phrases that don't appear in
educated discourse wrong in tomorrow may
be wrong because it didn't work but not
tomorrow and that's very typical take a
look at current debate about say Iraq
the outer limits of
criticism within the educated mainstream
you have for example Barack Obama who's
very strongly praised and honored for
his principled opposition to the war
what was his principled opposition he
said it's a strategic blunder we're not
going to be able to do it at a cost
acceptable to ourselves it's kind of
like Nazi generals after Stalingrad
after Stalingrad that I'm sure there was
criticism and the German General Staff
of Hitler's blunders and why fight a
two-front war when you should have
knocked out England first and then going
ahead so you have a strategic blunder
that we don't call that principle
criticism I don't have records from the
german general staff but we do have
records from the soviet union if you
read pravda in the mid-1980s that's the
way they describe the war in afghanistan
it was a strategic blunder should never
have gotten into it again we don't call
that principle criticism we don't honor
and respect them for that stand but when
it's done on our side that's exactly
what we do well could go on and on about
this but this is this is the task of the
intellectuals overwhelmingly and the
task of they fulfil focus on the crimes
of enemies the fate of the dissidents
and Eastern Europe suppress totally your
own crimes even if they're in comparably
worse as they were in that the same in
the same years in Latin America for
example case after cases like this and
ensure that uncomfortable information
doesn't bother the general public so it
takes a Holland right now
as you know i'm sure a couple of days
ago a trial ended in the hague the trial
of Charles Taylor for terrible crimes in
Sierra Leone the case was narrower than
what the prosecutors wanted the
prosecutors who were one of them's a
distinguished law professor in the
United States the other well-known
barrister in London they wanted a much
broader case they had collected they
claimed massive evidence to implicate
Qaddafi in the crime he'd been massively
funding Taylor participating Zandi arms
so they wanted to broaden the case to
include Qaddafi well the US and Britain
blocked it and the International
Criminal Court of course takes orders
from the Masters so they narrowed the
case and no mention of Qaddafi and I
don't read the Dutch press but you can
tell me how much reporting there was
about this I'll be willing
