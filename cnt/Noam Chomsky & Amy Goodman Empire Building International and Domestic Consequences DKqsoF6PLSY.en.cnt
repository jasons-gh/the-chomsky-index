that kind of mean-spirited person to
keep those people under control I mean
that's one theory but now that there's
freedom over there right now the Sunnis
are now not the ruling party anymore
even though the majority of Muslim
religion so they and the Kurds up north
there is a possibility there could be a
civil war up there because the Kurds
want their freedom they want their
freedom from a turkey they want their
freedom from Iran they want their
freedom from they want to do a cur to
stand down in the South the shi'a which
is sixty percent of the country may go
to grips with the Sunni down there so
there is a possibility of those two
things happening if it doesn't happen
though there's a large amount of people
that want peace in that country and they
would if this even if it does happen it
may only be for a short period of time
but of course we don't want to be around
when that happens but it is it is a
possibility I mean according to the
people I talked to it is a possibility
that's the other thing I do in the book
is I went after the armchair
quarterbacks who caused us they were a
pain in the butt literally during the
war these were smart retired people who
were commentators for all the different
networks who were very talented people
in their days and I'm sure very talented
today but they had no idea what we were
doing and they were guessing of what we
were doing they were putting stuff out
if day one we didn't win the war we we
were we weren't doing it right if
whatever we were doing especially using
the Afghani army as our army that wasn't
the right thing to do but everything
worked out and so every day we'd have to
answer questions to the secretary about
what this commentator said what this
commentator said and so when I answer
questions when I left in jan or of sep
tember of 2003 I base my knowledge on
the people i work with over there now
because I quit getting information from
the military
because I don't want to be one of those
buttheads you know what's the here a lot
to talk about no weapons of mass
destruction found in have Iraq after we
went in what is your opinion of this
well in sep as of sep tember 2003 there
was weapons well i knew there was
weapons of mass destruction we had
intelligence sources multiple
intelligence sources that told us that
two days before march 19th the lar the
senior leadership of iraq took off for
syria with billions of dollars with
caravans of now we couldn't go after
them yet because the president promised
i'll give you 48 hours and so the
president kept his word and we're
watching these caravans with people and
things go into Syria we we knew stuff
had gone in there before then we knew
they had buried things other places Iraq
is the size of California about 56 of it
is arid desert you could bury the Empire
State Building 12 times and not find him
there if you could bury him so stuff did
go there will we find it someday
somebody will will give it away but the
people we captured I've been very
close-mouthed about it wake up captured
one of the lady scientists that there
they were thinking about letting go they
call her doctor germ by the way the the
funny thing about her I saw her in
prison and when she was out in public
she had just gorgeous long black hair
it's grey now they did color their hair
too but where was I love lost no I'm
with the gray in here Oh weapons of mass
destruction Oh God minute this stuff's
there I mean it was there we had and I
can't talk about where the Intel came
from but but it was there now a lot of
people ask me a question well why isn't
the administration
going into that that's kind of another
reason I wrote the book here's the
things I saw there's a lot of things
they're not saying don't know why so but
if I put it in there I saw it or or had
enough information that know what
happened I know thanks for your service
general senator Kerry has a refrain that
he keeps saying that we shouldn't have
to go to war when we want to but we
should go to war only when we have to
isn't that too late I mean Sunzu
Clausewitz everybody else says that you
pick your own battle and draw your enemy
to yourself isn't it better that we set
it up in Iraq and bring them all to us
and take care of the problem right there
again that's there's that that is a
theory the issue with is today is
terrorism terrorism is is not an army
it's a different group of people and and
how do you defeat terrorists your point
is do you want the terrorists on your
soil or do you want them on their soil
and the president chose and we agreed
that it's much better to be on their
soil why did the president go to war if
if people say you can't find the weapons
of mass destruction even though he knew
they were there he still knows they were
there but he had a list there's about a
list of 12 things that I listed in the
book if you went through those 12 things
and you knew that this was going on that
he had been testing his unmanned aerial
vehicles with sprayers which so you can
spray anthrax he was flying his probably
ten time or shooting at our airplanes
ten times more than he had been before
he was moving his armies around more
than he had been moving him before he
had just killed a large number of his
leadership he was working that we knew
there was a base on the Iraqi Iranian
border
that had the al-qaeda members we had
strong intelligent sources say they were
going in there that was a base that was
a dual-use facility for fertilizer and
chemical weapons what we didn't want is
we didn't want those things to end up
over in our shores and so given the list
of things that are there if you had
given that and he hadn't acted and we
had an explosion over here on our coast
there would now be an Iraqi
investigation just like the 911
investigation and they would be calling
for his resignation he had I would
venture to tell you anybody that was
given to what he was given you make the
choice to go to war on their soil sir
another issue terrorism it's a galley
what what do we know about terrorism
both al Qaeda and Hamas and not only
doll and just in general and Saddam's
links to various terrorist groups what
do we know about Al Qaeda associated
groups and just in general well I'll
tell you what I know and and of course
my knowledge of them ended back in
September of 2003 except what I get from
my Iranian and Iraqi people that I talk
to you over there right now the al-qaeda
had been going through meeting with
Saddam's inner circle for ten years
before nine eleven that's about all we
needed to know Zarqawi is in fact in
Iraq now the good news is it's sort of
like the marine motto if you know where
they are and you can keep them there
then you can kill them so but not all
the al-qaeda are there now why what's
going on in Iraq right now what's going
on in rock right now is there the
elections are coming up in January they
are trying to influence the elections
they don't want them to happen the
regional country
around Iraq would prefer Iraq not to be
a democratic country there's no
democratic countries around there it
affects is going to affect how they
govern their own countries they don't
want it to happen where is where is the
al-qaeda my guess is where who's the
head of the al-qaeda no bin Laden bin
Laden is up on the the border area
between Pakistan and Afghanistan that's
a no no man's country up there right now
they're in villages up there you can't
get to them and it's not governed by
Afghanistan or Pakistan and how do you
defeat terrorism the only way to defeat
terrorism down in Central Command in
Florida right now there are 70 countries
70 countries that are down there with
their senior military people and they're
fighting the war on terrorism around the
world they're using the police forces in
their country they're using the
financial institutions to freeze the
assets of some of these terrorist
organizations and the Intel that they've
never shared before they're sharing
around for around the world since nine
eleven and it's it's a classified number
so I'll say somewhere between 30 and 120
major terrorist events have been
thwarted people killed or captured
because of these countries working
together that's how you stop terrorism
well terrorism ever end my guess is
it'll be if we're lucky it'll be like
crime some places it'll be when you have
a great force it'll be lower than other
places but are you going to totally get
rid of it I don't think so
wondering how you felt about troop
levels in Afghanistan past and present
yeah the problem is it's it's it's a not
a simple question how did how did we get
the troop level we're in before nine
eleven secretary Rumsfeld said to all of
us in the military said we have all
these new technical ways of fighting
wars all these new information
operations and new weapon systems do we
need the large number of forces we
currently have for the wars we're
currently fighting he said I want you to
all go back and relook at all your plans
and see if you can make them better
smaller faster but take into account
that new technology we have so you can
make make smart decisions so that's what
we did the issue with with combat on the
ground is you've got to have troops on
the ground to take land you can't have
five thousand iraqis surrendering to a
b-52 won't happen they got to surrender
to troops on the ground the other thing
is when the war started in Iraq we
couldn't get through Turkey so we had to
feed all our troops through the south
through Kuwait so we got as many troops
in there as we could we got in at one
time we were probably up to over 200,000
troops was that enough it would have
been enough if if everything that we
were told was going to happen with the
Iraqis two days before we went in Saddam
let loose somewhere between thirty and
fifty thousand of the most heinous
criminals you've ever seen all the
political prisoners have been killed
these guys were murders rapists robbers
thieves and they were let go in the
country the day we attacked every one of
the members of the police force in all
the cities and iraq walked out of their
uniforms as we were moving towards
Baghdad the soldiers that weren't killed
or captured walked out of their uniforms
so now you have a country of 26 million
people and that's localized 50,000 of
the worst criminals in in the Middle
East no police force and no army if we
had stopped right there the country
would have collapsed so did we have
enough people with that happening no we
didn't have enough military police but
we nobody anticipated that the
expatriates we had talked to said that
would never happen so things happen that
nobody expected so your question is do
we have enough people there today it
appears we do I mean I'm not running a
war the issue is are we training the
police forces back again yes we are are
we plank training the army yes we are
are we training a National Guard to help
fill in yes we are back okay general you
can probably tell from my accent I'm
British why do you think George Bush and
Tony Blair have refused or have failed
to get the arguments that you've done as
to why the war happened as to all the
reasons you've gone into another what's
the damage say he was gone into why I'd
be constantly not mentioned all those
things I'm if used to defend themselves
on weapons of mass destruction well I
mean your questions a great question but
I will tell you that I think Tony Blair
has been fairly strong about it one of
the questions ought to be since Tony
Blair was such a great friend of Bill
Clinton which he was personal friend why
is he support the United States and
President Bush right now the
relationship between the UK has always
been good but during Afghanistan and
Iraq it was like we were brothers and
and Tony Blair stood beside the
president and said I'm going to support
I've got to support the president nited
states on what's going on right now and
they took he took on of course as you
know he's headed the Liberal Party in in
Great Britain I mean it's just it didn't
didn't make political sense it with
political death
but i but i think tony blair has been
fairly vocal on that he knows there's
wit there were weapons of mass
destruction there there's two other
people that were sort of heroes during
this war that were President Musharraf
of Pakistan we could have never gotten
in because Pakistan was sort of a
forsaken country the United States for a
long time and Musharraf went against his
people knew what he had to do for the
future of his country and has set a
course there I mean some people call him
the Gandhi of Pakistan in modern times
right now because he's done that much
the Indians now respect Musharraf the
other person is King Abdullah of Jordan
you know his father supported a rock
during the first Gulf War because he had
to to get along in the in the area King
Abdullah supported the United States he
didn't support him out front but
secretly and helped tremendously during
the war and sixty percent of his
population is Palestinian so there's
been there's been Arab heroes this war
and like Tony Blair he was also we
couldn't have done it without him
general DeLong could you comment on why
we didn't get bin Laden when he was
fleeing with his Taliban friends toward
Pakistan and if we didn't why not what
were some of the reasons and what was
the thinking behind not doing things
differently perhaps okay it starts it's
the Tora Bora story really what happened
is we had sort of captured maza Sharif
Kabul we're moving south we knew where
we thought he was and his henchmen were
they were in the caves the tour were
caves which were down in the south
between Pakistan and Afghanistan in
those areas were another another group
of people were these were the villagers
and they didn't like Afghani army they
didn't like Pakistani army we knew if we
had put US soldiers up there we would
have been fighting the Afghan people one
of the things that was one of our
tenants right from the beginning was we
were not going to kill civilians
unnecessarily and to put our forces up
there on the ground we would have been
fighting with the villagers because they
did not trust anybody except the
al-qaeda at that time so we used Afghan
soldiers to go up there and go towards
the caves and we put the best we could
Pakistani soldiers up on the border to
try to prevent people from getting
across but it's not much different than
our New Mexico Texas California borders
I mean people can get across when they
wanted to now we went up there and we
bombed those caves and and we know for a
fact that we bin Laden was injured
whether it was I can't remember was
armors leg was wounded but but he got
out he got out with a mean a whole bunch
of his people died were captured up
there but but he got out and that's
that's the story but what we didn't do
we didn't kill that the Afghani people
still respected us being there because
we used Afghans and Pakistanis not
u.s. troops on the ground I've heard it
mentioned one of the factors might have
been that Musharraf had he acted against
the Taliban would have been overthrown
that were fleeing with bin Laden no
Musharraf had to walk a tightrope there
and he to this day Pakistan has captured
of all the prisoners we've gotten
Pakistan has captured eighty percent of
them his people have captured eighty
percent of them so he he did the best he
could given that he without being
assassinated by the way he's had five
assassination attempts since 2001
against him general glum I just wanted
you to comment on the administration of
the war from Florida and if you have any
regrets or if there are any changes in
mind too because I've heard of some
problems you know communications wise
logistics wise if there's going to be
any changes ahead well good to be honest
I don't know what they're going to do
I'll comment on we fought the Afghan war
the leadership state in Florida for for
the same reason we did not want a large
footprint inside Afghanistan like the
Russians did so we we always kept our
numbers down and we kept our numbers to
9,000 stayed in two bases so we could
patrol outside and people couldn't rock
it or shoot mortars at our troops there
we also had communications that were the
best in the world at the time on our
tanks airplanes and ships we had devices
so i could sit at a pc at my desk and
watch all the ships move that we had to
there were garden different areas I
could watch troop movement and I could
watch where all the airplanes were by
numbers during the day and switch back
and forth or see them all together if
you wanted a cluttered picture you could
also we also had predators out there
with the soda straw type television
cameras and when if we were chasing
somebody I could watch the war as
good Tommy Franks make decisions on
whether you wanted to go after that
target or not talk to George Tenet said
what do you think because he would have
one up there at the same time I mean it
was that was a war that we didn't want
to have people on the ground now for
Iraq we put a forward headquarters over
in Qatar and fought the war from there
and that's where John Abizaid is right
now I mean he stays over there he
probably stays over there so he doesn't
have to deal with all the stuff that's
going on back here but but that's where
he's chosen to stay right now why I
don't know but the communications in
today's world unbelievable I'm a student
the George Washington University i'm
sure you're familiar with the idea about
a clash of civilizations and i guess my
question is regarding what do you think
about the idea that much of the problems
over there much of the terrorist attacks
and all of al Qaida's attacks are
relating to just the fact that they
don't like the American culture in
general and if we pulled out do you
believe that those attacks would stop or
they would not stop okay now I'll just
give you a comment from from what i know
not based on my time in the military but
but I've read the Quran twice I've spent
time and the reason I read the Quran not
because I thought that was something I
needed to do but I read it in order to
understand their culture over there and
why they do things it helped me a lot
working with I've got a lot of friends
over there that are their Muslim but it
also allows me to not that I understand
them much better than anybody else but I
understand them better than the people
who haven't read the Quran there are
radical people in in the in this
religion and there are radical people in
every religion but the radical people in
this religion don't care what the other
people in there really they're just soon
kill other Muslims they'll care kill
Hindus they'll kill Christians they
don't care what they want is they want
you know twenty five percent they think
they want the religion
to take over the world twenty-five
percent of the people in the world right
now Muslims and so that's some people
think that's what they want to do but
there are probably ninety five percent
of the Muslim Islam religion people that
are great people and if you read the
Quran you don't go after anybody else
you protect yourself all these if we
left Iraq and we left Afghanistan with
the attacks stop or where they still
continues still continue one of the one
of all the people that I deal with over
there right now and and bud couch knows
this if in fact you you you come up with
some sort of an answer to the
israeli-palestinian issue that's a start
you'll never fix it but if you if you
continue to work towards peaceful
coexistence or come up with some sort of
method that they can live together you
will help this a lot that is the the
spur in the horses side right there
right now they say if you fix that
everything will be fine after a couple
quick questions a certain I was glad to
know you were in charge when I was in
Iraq the first day thanks ray but the
question I had for you brought up George
Tenet and then also special operations
forces we were involved with a lot on
the Navy side of things as well so i
guess the view from below was it was
very well orchestrated in terms of all
of the different government
organizations working together to come
together for this operation so how that
happened and who was in charge of that
well it was it was unprecedented the
cooperation between the CIA and the
military it's never happened before and
the reason it had to get together is the
the Central Intelligence Agency had
people on the ground in Afghanistan they
knew the area we had people that had
that had were able to call in bombs and
we put teams together and we talked with
John McLaughlin and George Tenet
probably five times a week unprecedented
probably nobody down there talked to
anybody in the CIA at that leadership
level five times the last 20 years and
we work issues together that so we we
didn't cross every they they got their
information we got our information and
we work together was unprecedented thank
you very much for your service and I'm
too nervous to to be more detailed but I
was wondering what your thoughts about
general Powell and it seems that I
haven't heard anything about him
recently and I just wanted to ask you
about him oh that that's beyond I'll
tell you what I think and that's that's
all this is the current administration
is there's a group of people up there
that that work well together they're all
talented people there's a group of
people that are on the outside and i
would say that secretary Powell doesn't
have as much influence as other people
do today and so as a result you probably
don't hear a lot from him even though
that he's a great gentleman an
outstanding statesman and and has done a
magnificent job for the United States I
mean those are my observations that's
all I know do you think the court the
current u.s. foreign policy based on
preemption is sustainable policy as far
as resources are concerned international
opinion and domestic opinion u.s.
foreign policy on based on preemption
our policy of going into Iraq going into
Afghanistan perhaps going into Iran
Sudan okay that goes back to his
question in the issue is preemption is
is never a good thing unless
you're fighting terrorism and you know
what's going to happen we'll probably
end up on your Shores if you think
that's going to happen or you have
indication that's going to happen you're
going to have to make a choice you want
to wait for them to hit another tower
over here you want Disneyland blown up
which in fact has been a target before
Las Vegas blown up before you go over
there those are the decision cycles
you've got to go through because ideally
I mean nobody likes to do you're not
well accepted in the world if you do
preemption but terrorism is different
and so you have to make a choice of
whether by the way I I don't think
preemption is is a is the foreign policy
right now what they're doing is they're
judging every different event and they
look at do I need to do what I need to
do here by the way the next problems for
the United States and for the world are
probably going to be Iran in Syria thank
you very much a general a couple
questions I'll keep them short in Iraq
with our occupation there could you
comment on the argument that our
occupation may be recruiting as many
terrorists as many or more terrorists
than were then we're defeating second
question to what extent on terms of in
state in Iraq acceptable end state to
what extent are we aiming too high to
talk about broad participatory democracy
as a precondition for withdrawal okay
your first question are we recruiting
terrorists to capture terrorists okay
the people I talked to is that's not
happening now are there Iranians coming
across the border are they do they have
people that are double agents but i
don't know i mean i don't know the
answer that question as a precondition
for leaving iraq does it have to be a
democratic country i have no idea what
this administration or the next
ministration but my guess is that what
what they want to do is have the Iraqi
people satisfied that they that they're
secure that their infrastructure is set
that they have whatever the weather
their elected officials or that there's
some sort of government running Iraq
because I'm not convinced a democratic
government is going to work over there
but but it may but but some sort of
government that is going to run a rack
that they have an army that's good
enough to protect them from their
neighbors and they have a police force
it's good enough to protect their cities
if you check all those off and don't put
the democratic government in there I
think that would be I think that would
be enough to pull out and the timeline
it's not going to be months before this
happens we're talking years I don't know
how many but I mean that's my guess
talking to the Iraqi people now the
Iraqis don't want us over there they
don't want us there because we're we're
occupying their country so we need to
get this done as quickly as possible and
help them and then get out but the but I
would close right now saying the one
thing that it's troublesome the world
the one thing we cannot lose is the war
on terrorism if we lose the war on
terrorism then the United States and the
freedom as you know what today is gone
there's nobody else in the world that
can bring the world countries together
to fight something like this like the
United States and so the only thing that
I would leave with you is that's that's
something we cannot do think of what
happens if we lose the war on terrorism
I just leave you with that thank you
very much

panel is moderated by Democracy Now
radio host Amy Goodman
it's a great honor to be here tonight at
Trinity Church part of the American
Empire project introducing these three
authors who have written books as part
of that and it's I think particularly
appropriate that this is taking place
just before tonight's well I've heard it
referred to in different ways the
so-called debate or the presidential
presentations bipartisan news conference
the rules are so strict that they will
not personally engage each other but
most importantly I think what is being
offered here tonight and where we are is
a sanctuary of descent and dissent is
what makes democracy possible and that
is what we are going to hear tonight I
dare say the words that you will hear
words like blood and oil or crusade or
hegemony or survival will not be said in
those ways in tonight's presidential
discussion or in any of them which is
why it is so important also that we have
a media in this country that provides a
forum for the dissent that like trinity
church is a sanctuary for dissent
because I dare say at this point in this
country that that dissent is not just
that of a fringe minority or a silent
majority but the silenced majority
silenced by the corporate media so as
you listen to this discussion tonight I
hope you then go home and call the
network's call your newspapers
and asked where are these voices on the
national stage we begin tonight with
professor Noam Chomsky
it's very civilized be able to talk
sitting down I hope it's not a tribute
to my advanced age in the last week or
two a number of polls have been issued
from the leading polling agencies in the
world which have some quite interesting
results that they're rather directly on
the title for this evenings of
presentations the consequences of the
new imperial grand strategy as the bush
program was described by the main
establishment journal of foreign affairs
shortly after it was officially
announced in September 2002 the national
security strategy of the most obvious
effects of course are the international
ones which only were released a few days
ago turns out that in the Muslim world
almost everywhere substantial majorities
regard the United States as a military
threat to them that's over seventy
percent in Indonesia Turkey Nigeria
Pakistan other countries in Europe
majorities regard the United States as a
threat to world peace Holland England
France elsewhere they report that the
distrust and dislike of the United
States has doubled or tripled in many
countries over the past over the past
year well that is consequences people
who feel threatened tend to react and
sometimes they react violently that
we have already seen such reactions as
predicted was predicted in advance of
the invasion of Iraq that by independent
analyst by intelligence agencies a few
weeks ago we learned by the national
intelligence estimate of the United
States just before the war it was
predicted that it would increase the
threat of terror and in fact that's
happened another aspect of the new
imperial grand strategy which has been
less discussed but is far more serious
in its implications and has also had
extreme reactions is the what's called
the transformation of the American
military the rapid expansion of
offensive highly destructive military
capacity so few weeks after the national
security strategy was an ounce of the
Air Force Space Command announced its
plans for the next four years and they
intend to go from move from what they
call control of space for military
purposes Clinton's policy in violation
of the Outer Space Treaty they're going
to move from control of space to
ownership of space which which is
consistent with the national security
strategy no challenge tolerated anywhere
and they want to explain that means
instant engagement anywhere in the world
highly lethal destructive weapons from
space attacking unannounced anywhere in
the world world under close surveillance
if you continue to read these programs
they describe in detail how this
capacity can be developed and what it
will mean well maybe it isn't discussed
here but foreign intelligence agencies
read it they can find it on the same
websites or I did or where you can it's
not a secret and they react as expected
and as predicted so in the Pat said
during the bush years according to US
estimates Russia has maybe tripled its
military spending it's displaying new
offensive military weapons
nuclear-tipped missiles more advanced
aimed at the United States they've
adopted the bush strategy of first
strike without effectively without
pretext the these are on hair-trigger
alert many of them this means being
controlled by automated systems we know
that our systems have many many errors
which require human intervention to
prevent a missile launch there's are far
less sophisticated deteriorating as the
Soviet economy deteriorates we're
essentially asking them to set the basis
for an accidental war which will happen
to destroy us all furthermore we're
compelling the Russians to transfer
missiles all over their territory huge
territory to counter us threats being
opposed at all their borders these are
taken and trains that any intelligent
the Chechen terrorists can intercept
meaning advanced nuclear missiles
playing into the worst imaginable hand
China until recently has kept from
participating in this for the one
nuclear state that doesn't have a much
of an offensive military capacity but
that's changing they've just announced
that they're tripling their offensive
missile kapat nuclear missile capacity
and
moving towards a high-tech military with
offensive weapons very similar to I just
described within the next few years this
is not unnoticed by US strategic
analysts who predicted and it's
happening just a couple of weeks ago two
of the leading US strategic analysts
very responsible respectable not given
to hyperbole wrote that the these
policies these transformation the
military policies and of course the
expected reactions to them may lead to
what they call ultimate doom and they go
on to express their hope that China will
lead a coalition of peace-loving
countries to counter us aggressiveness
and militarism we've come to a pretty
pass when we read that and mainstream
journals other recently released studies
shed a good deal of light on the state
of American democracy might be worth
bearing in mind if you can get a strong
enough stomach to watch what's happening
later the Chicago Council on Foreign
Relations publishes regular careful
detailed report of popular attitudes on
international affairs and they always
make interesting reading and the latest
one which just came out does
particularly so so here's a few examples
majorities of Americans often large
majorities I believe that the United
States should support the Kyoto
protocols the nuclear test ban and other
disarmament treaties majority believe
that the United States should join the
international criminal court even if
are threatened with prosecution they
believe that the United Nations not the
United States should take the lead in
international crises and that the US
should accede to majority wishes even if
it opposes the decisions in fact rather
amazingly a majority even are in favor
of eliminating the veto in the Security
Council the US overwhelmingly is in the
lead and be doing resolutions in the
last 40 years this has applications in
Iraq other polls have shown that a
majority of the population in the United
States has about the same stand as the
Spanish voters who last March voted for
what was called here withdrawing troops
from Iraq but it wasn't withdrawing
troops unless they were under UN
supervision for a long time about sixty
or seventy percent of the american
population have felt that the UN at the
US should take the lead in iraq in
security matters of economic
reconstruction political changes and so
on large majority believe that the
united states should join the World
Court the International Court of Justice
the Reagan administration pretty much
the people in office now withdrew
jurisdiction withdrew both court
jurisdiction when it was about to
condemn the United States as it did for
an Internet what amounts to
international terrorism in its attack
against Nicaragua the majority believe
that the United led in this case believe
that the US should rely on diplomatic
and economic rather than mill
he means in combating terror and quite
strikingly a large majority opposed
preventive war that's the US official
doctrine held by both candidates in
gross violation of international law and
remember charter large majority think
that the United States should keep
within the UN Charter limits that about
twenty-five percent say the US should
any state should resort the force only
if attacked it's a narrow interpretation
of the Charter and over half say except
this slightly broader interpretation of
the Charter accepting the legitimacy of
pre-emptive war which means use of force
when you are an attack is imminent look
like a planes flying across the Atlantic
to bomb New York or something like that
so around seventy-five percent totally
opposed official policy of both parties
on a very crucial issue large majorities
believe that the United States should
increase spending on health education
and Social Security on specific issues
there are also stands are taken
radically different from the elite
bipartisan consensus so on Israel
Palestine seventy five percent believe
the United States should be neutral
seventeen percent think it should tilt
toward Israel well all of these things
are interesting in themselves they also
tell us a lot about the state of
American democracy because these
positions are off the agenda they're not
in the electoral agenda the positions
are barely advocated in anywhere near
the mainstream which means that most of
the people who gave those responses have
never heard them they they're making
them up for themselves probably
they're the only people who hold them if
these issues were a topic of live debate
and discussion I don't think there's
much doubt that the numbers would be
much higher well that is one
illustration of a serious democratic
deficit the technical term for countries
that have formal democratic institutions
but then I'll function substantively the
polls on the election reveal the same
thing a couple of week two weeks ago the
Gallup polls asked people voters why
they're voting for bush or kerry and at
a set of choices one of the choices was
favor their agenda ideas and platform
goals for bush that's six percent of
bush's voters for Kerry it's thirteen
percent of Bush's voters there was
probably nobody's Hank is voting for
them because of their stand on anything
and that's the way elections are
structured elections are effectively run
by the pr industry which constructs
extravaganzas and which would show up
come up every couple of years and tries
to focus laser-like attention on them so
that that's what people will think of as
politics personalized extravaganzas
intermittently where you focus on
qualities as they call them is he a
strong leader would you like to meet him
or something like that not on their
stands not on issues they have to be
kept off the agenda and if you look at
people's attitudes on issues you can see
why it's not an irrational choice well
much of the world perceives this even if
we prefer not to and it adds to the
threat couple of words about Iraq I
don't have to talk about the fact that
the pretext for the invasion have
successively eroded so their history but
as they collapse new ones come along
about a year ago
discussion fixed on the new standard
position that is the u.s. invaded iraq
to fulfill what the liberal press calls
Bush's messianic vision to bring
democracy to Iraq Middle East and the
world so on the reaction in the United
States was intriguing there was near
unanimous agreement that that was the
goal try to find an exception there are
critics plant critics the critics say
it's overreaching it's not going to work
noble inspiring but beyond our means
Iraqi culture is not advanced enough to
be able to accept such dramatic steps or
something like that with me more
realistic actually there's one sector of
opinion that disagrees Iraqis just at
the time that a Bush's messianic vision
was announced with great fanfare in
Washington the Washington Post happened
to publish a poll of people in Baghdad
who were asked why they think the United
States invaded Iraq and there were some
who agreed with near unanimous opinion
here one percent one percent said the
goal was to establish democracy most of
the rest said the obvious the u.s.
invaded Iraq to take control of Iraq's
extraordinary energy resources and to
have a position to reorganize the region
and it's interesting actually the result
was a little more nuanced fifty percent
said the US wants democracy but will not
allow Iraqis to make their own choices
within it us woman insist on influencing
it that's a sophisticated discouragement
on what imposition of democracy actually
means in the history of the West England
in the Middle East the United States and
its domains
so on well what is the evidence for and
against the view that the u.s. invaded
to fulfill wishes messianic vision if
the evidence for it is very
straightforward the president said so
try to find some other evidence to
support that conclusion well benign
statements of benign intent by leaders
are totally meaningless they are
completely predictable they carried no
information and I matter how grotesque
the monster is they make such statements
so we discard apparently not here it
seems that there's a hundred percent
near a hundred percent agreement even
among critics what's the evidence
against not going to run through it
because that would take a another power
talk but it's just about anything you
look at I mean they're on history under
the British which also had pretensions
of independence and sovereignty the
history of us domains long-standing US
policy going back to the mid-1940s which
were to control the oil of Middle East
because of what one historian of the
industry calls profits beyond the dreams
of avarice but more importantly because
it was what was called a stupendous
source of strategic power as speaking of
virgin ski put it a few months ago
control of the resources of the Middle
East gives the United States a critical
leverage over the economies of Europe
and Asia those have been the main
competitors and rivals now a
long-standing concern of US policy is
they might go in their own independent
way and it still is you have your
control the lever you get critical
leverage with George Kennan once called
veto power well actually five minutes
thought about what the policies of a
sovereign independent Iraq would be
suffice is to show that
it would never be tolerated I won't go
into that but think about it well all of
this is off the agenda and it's another
illustration of a very serious
democratic deficit something that should
concern us well if this conception is
accurate in other words the Iraqis
aspire to the same vision that's
described here and Iraqis agree that
there is a cultural problem social and
cultural problem blocking it but they
think that problems here not there and I
think they have a reasonable argument if
that turns out if that is in fact true
then that's actually a hopeful sign
because if this problem is here we can
do something about it a lot in fact
anything we're very free we're very
privileged plenty of opportunities we
don't have to pray that China will
rescue the world from us militarism and
aggressiveness we can take care of that
right here but that requires
understanding what the problems are
perceiving the democratic deficit and
not being trapped into a belief that
democracy means pushing a lever for
somebody you like whose stand you don't
understand every couple of years that's
not democracy everyday work to create
basis for a functioning democracy with
plenty of opportunities it is possible
for them to compel the government either
one no matter who wins because they have
the same policies in this regard to
compel them to abandon the major war
aims in Iraq which Iraqis understand
even if we prefer not to and that means
dismantling going on to dismantle the
global policies which are very deeply
rooted in
US history and institutions a lot of
work but within reach and if that
conception is anywhere near accurate I
think it is there are faithful choices
for us to make faithful for Iraq for
ourselves and indeed far beyond
I think no I'm understood that I was
holding his watch so if you were
surprised for the first time that he
held within his time as a New York Times
Book Review said he is a global
phenomenon perhaps the most widely read
voice on foreign policy on the planet
Noam Chomsky's latest book he has
written more than a hundred is called
hegemony or survival America's quest for
global dominance and for those of you

now turn to James Carroll James Carroll

well first I acknowledge it's a bit of a
dream to be introduced by Amy Goodman
thank you I'm among your Legion of
grateful fans and i also want to now as
the honor it is to be here you'll
understand first that i am edified to be
in a place where so many people
understand that there is something more
important than the Red Sox victory
tonight and of course seriously there
are two things more important one is
ending this abominable war in Iraq and
and the other is changing what made this
abominable war inevitable
and and you'll understand of course
having heard Noam Chomsky's succinct
summary of what this emergency were
faced with is and Michael Claire's
elaboration of whatever it is that gnome
and i will have added up to in this
contribution so I'm deeply honored to be
here and I just say personally I can't
help but acknowledge the space itself in
my life as a citizen of the city and a
person grateful for the magnificence of
this great church and its meaning for
this city and our country and speaking
quite personally more than 30 years ago
I was a young Catholic priest at a time
when Catholic priests weren't often in
the sanctuary of this church and I spoke
from that pulpit adding my timid voice
to the voices of so many who were
opposed to the war in Vietnam and if you
had told me if it had been somehow
possible for you to indicate to me that
I would be back here more than 30 years
later confronted with this war and this
drastic elaboration of the worst
impulses in our national life I would
have been even then as heartbroken
grease truck and angry as I am now a few
days after 911 President Bush
inadvertently accidentally used the word
crusade and I felt a kind of vertigo at
his use of that word not understanding
at the moment while understanding fully
the danger of it but being unable to
understand the absolute
pertinence of it since of course he
moved promptly to launch our nation on
nothing less than a crusade a perfect
match to jihad and if you had told me
all those years ago what when I left
religion resuming my life imagining
religion as a private part of myself
leaving what I thought of as my public
relationship to religion if you told me
all those years ago that religion would
resume its character as a public problem
in this country I also would not have
understood and if you had told me that
we would be embarked upon a religious
war in this great pluralistic nation I
wouldn't have understood I'm proud to
add my voice tonight to the voices here
and to add my presence to your presence
in manifesting urgent concern about this
emergency that our nation has
effectively presented to the world
having said all that I'm going to put on
the table my own considered reaction to
this crisis crusade this book is a
collection of the columns I published in
The Boston Globe assembled as a book as
part of the American Empire project by
tom engelhardt Sarah burst l and Kate
proofs of metropolitan books of hold
whom I acknowledge gratefully a column I
published on May 27 2003 bad weather
over America when will the bad weather
end why the distance between what is and
what ought to be
where r saddam hussein's weapons of mass
destruction if he was such a threat why
did his army perform so poorly does it
matter where he is if the war in Iraq
was not about oil why does the United
States insist on its indefinite control
if the war was instead about democracy
why are the Iraqi people including
Saddam's proven enemies excluded from
authority is Iraq to be like Afghanistan
where warlords rule and heroin thrives
are there more suicide bombers now than
ever how did relations between the
United States and its European allies
become so fragile will history recognize
the 21st century anglo-american combine
as a mere continuation of the British
Empire what do good intentions count for
if they leave a wake of wreckage and is
the bad weather the result of an
atmospheric low that will not lift
without the answers why are taxes being
cut when teachers and librarians are
being laid off what happened to the
campaign finance reform movement why is
the United States more divided by race
than ever when did its citizens ever
decide to forgo privacy how can low
income workers support their families
how much longer will the middle class be
able to afford health insurance why are
Americans eating so much bad food does
primetime television hold up a mirror to
our nation who teaches children to bring
guns to school what happens to teenagers
who fulfill every graduation requirement
except the test they can't pass how many
times will they fail that test because
their teachers were laid off
such impossible questions go a long way
toward explaining the American mood we
cannot answer them and so we do not ask
them and the emotional weather is lousy
thus the patently false false ebullient
of george w bush the doubtless man is
the perfect emblem of a nation so adrift
that it does not look twice at its real
condition whatever the technical reasons
for it the economy that refuses to
recover matches perfectly a broad
psychological stagnation why are
Americans incapable of looking directly
at what we are doing and what we are
becoming abroad the United States wages
war on such vapp respects that when they
dissipate in the first breeze of
mourners wailing Americans take no
notice an old liberal dream of world
federalism is replaced by a program of
American world dominance at home and
anxious sadness under rights the civic
life careers feel terribly uncertain
leisure is a forgotten luxury in America
each boon now seems to carry a curse is
our freedom secured yes by a government
that can eavesdrop on every conversation
or we well-fed yes to the point of
obesity is our medical care superb yes
to the point of bankruptcy are we the
most heavily armed people in history
frightening Lee so does the
unprecedented success of the national
project over the last generation bode
well for the next generation obviously
not can we dare to ask why an answer is
apparent this very day in Iraq the
distance between what is and what ought
to be there is so vast that only an act
of communal self blinding keeps
Americans from seeing it the dark
national mood has many causes but one
cries out to be reckoned with
immediately the Iraqi war is a pack of
lies and Washington's war on terrorism
is a cynical manipulation of fear for
the sake of power so far the United
States have willfully participated in
this bush lead charade we have done so
out of the very insecurity that they
tell us not to fear as if the charade
however much it wrecks the world will
protect us but our underlying sadness
indicates what we need to know America
was not meant to be like this we are no
longer ourselves the bad weather will
not end until we face that cold truth
and change it
james peril one of the things that my
brother David Goodman and I have written
about in our book the exception to the
rulers is the original name the Pentagon
came up with for the invasion of Iraq
you probably have heard what it was
Operation Iraqi liberation but they had
to discard it because of the acronym oh
I L so they came up instead with
Operation Iraqi Freedom well today
return to our last speaker Michael Clare
who's taken on that issue with blood and
oil the dangers and consequences of
America's growing dependency on imported
petroleum Michael Clare is the five
college professor of program peace and
world security studies at Hampshire
College and immerse the defense
correspondent for the Nation magazine

history this is his latest book Michael
Clare
thank you I do have to say it's a thrill
of a lifetime a once-in-a-lifetime
experience to be on the podium with
people who I admire so much Amy Goodman
Noam Chomsky and James Carroll so I'm
just moved to be here with them and
makes me a little nervous but anyway
I'll do my best well you all know that
this evening is sponsored in part by the
American Empire project of henry holt &
metropolitan books and i think you all
know that there's an intense debate in
America about what the nature of our
foreign policy is in our overseas
behavior some analysts say that we have
constructed an empire an authentic
Empire like the British Empire and the
French Empire and the Roman Empire of
the past others argue that we've
constructed something different
something new or some form of
involuntary a voluntary system of
protectorates and subsidiaries I suspect
that will be debating the terminology of
empire for a long time to come even
among those analysts who contend that
the United States has forged an empire
there's disagreement on its nature and
duration some say that the American
Empire is essentially benign aimed at
fighting tyranny in spreading democracy
around the world some say it is
essentially predatory designed to
exploit other countries for the benefit
of American elites moreover some
analysts contend that the new American
Empire will last for decades if not
centuries others say that it will be
short-lived that the experience of Iraq
will force a general disagreement
disengagement of American power I could
not possibly do justice to these
questions in the few minutes that I have
and I'm not sure that I have good
answers to them but this much I do know
insofar as America's overseas
arrangements can be described as an
empire this is an empire of petroleum by
petroleum and for petroleum and it is
the pursuit and extraction of the rest
of the world's oil
that is driving America's outward
expansion and determining its future
course why do I say this before I can
answer that I have to make some
fundamental points about the role of
petroleum and its physical reality first
of all the American economy American
society and American power rests to a
greater degree than that of any other
nation on the availability of cheap and
abundant petroleum I don't have time to
go into this in detail you may want to
consult annual Europeans magisterial
study the prize but ever since the
discovery of oil and titusville
pennsylvania in 1859 and the formation
shortly thereafter of the Standard Oil
Company by john d rockefeller oil
extraction has been the most dynamic and
arguably the most important force in the
american economy the development of a
mammoth petroleum industry in this
country made possible the development of
the internal combustion engine and then
the automobile industry the highway
industry the petro chemical and plastics
industry to the tourist industry
airlines at modernised agribusiness and
most of all the suburbanization of
america it is not surprising then that
the ups and downs of the american
economy have been largely driven by the
availability and price of petroleum when
oil is abundant and cheap the economy
the economy thrives when it is scarce
and expensive as it is now the economy
cools and contracts every major
recession since World War two has been
precipitated by a rise in oil prices and
if prices continued to rise as they are
now we could well see a collapse of the
current economic recovery but this is
not all American military power rests
entirely on the foundation of oil the US
military more than that of any other
country is a mechanized military and
virtually every combat system in that
force every tank every Humvee every
plane every helicopter every missile and
virtually every ship is powered by
petroleum the United States could
not deploy its forces to distant parts
of the globe like Iraq and Afghanistan
and keep them there or rain down death
on its adversaries if it did not possess
an abundant and a reliable supply of oil
and American leaders going back to
Franklin Roosevelt have understood this
so petroleum is essential to the
American economy and because the united
states with was blessed with the
substantial supply of domestic oil and
was able to exploit this oil in an
efficient manner the american economy
has thrived over the past 100 years for
most of this time the United States was
the world's number-one oil producer the
Saudi Arabia of the first petroleum age
this oil bonanza I argue is the
principal reason for America's economic
dynamism over this long period but
America was not blessed with the world's
largest petroleum inheritance just the
first to be exploited on a very large
scale and petroleum is a finite resource
there's only so much in any given
reservoir and after a certain point you
use it all up this is as much true of a
single field as it is of a country's
entire underground supply the United
States was the first country to exploit
its oil resources on a large scale and
so not surprisingly it was the first to
face the depletion of those resources we
reached the point of maximum domestic
output in 1971 and have been
experiencing declining yields ever since
but having organized our entire economy
around the massive consumption of
petroleum we have been unwilling to
alter our consumption behavior although
we are no longer the world's number one
producer where it's number one consumer
and we continue to consume petroleum as
if we were the leading producer and so
since 1971 to satisfy our oil habit
we've had to acquire more and more oil
from abroad we have preached the fifty
percent point of dependence on foreign
supplies in 1998 it's now fifty-five
percent it'll reach sixty percent by the
end of this decade
and then sixty-five to seventy percent
in 2020 and there's no amount of oil and
Anwar that will change that trend one
bit the other fundamental point to make
about oil is that there is a historic
shift underway in the locus of world oil
production initially as you would expect
oil production was centered in the
industrialized countries or their close
neighbors in 1950 fully two-thirds of
the world's oil was produced in the
United States Canada Mexico Europe and
the Soviet Union including Baku and
Grozny then the Houston of the soviet
oil system but these fields were the
first to be developed and I've said that
made them the first to face depletion so
by 1999 only two fifths of the world's
oil came from these countries and by
2025 their share will drop to one-third
meanwhile we've seen a dramatic
long-term shift in the center of gravity
of world oil production to the
developing world especially the Middle
East Africa and the Andean region of
Latin America these countries accounted
for only one-third of world oil supplies
in 1950 but will account for two-thirds
in 20-25 I know that some of you are
familiar with the phenomenon of peak
petroleum or the gradual depletion of
the world's oil this is an important
phenomenon but from a geopolitical
perspective it is the shift in the locus
of oil output that really matters to us
from the global north to the global
south the more we look into the future
whatever the day-to-day level of oil the
greater the amount of it that will be
coming from the developing world and
often from unstable or deeply unfriendly
countries these countries have all been
subjected to colonial domination in the
past Nigeria Angola Colombia Venezuela
Iran Iraq Saudi Arabia Kuwait
Afghanistan and Kazakhstan and for the
most part their public's Harbor deep
deep resentment towards any any
expression of colonialism
oil the pursuit of oil by American
companies is seen by them as the modern
incarnation of the Imperial empires so
it is the intersection of these two
factors America's growing dependence on
imported petroleum in the growing shift
in world oil output to unstable areas of
the developing world that provides the
impetus the engine of American imperial
expansion ironically the first American
leader to recognize this fundamental
reality and give it concrete form was
that great defender of democracy
Franklin Delano Roosevelt it makes me
very sad to say this because I admired
Roosevelt and think he did many
wonderful things but I've distressed to
learn of his role in this there's no
doubt that he's the one who laid the
foundation for the modern American
Empire recognizing that the United
States would become reliant on imported
petroleum and concluding that the most
important new source of oil would be the
Middle East Roosevelt decided to
establish a protectorate over the most
important new supplier the Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia now bear in mind that at
1943 the United States didn't even have
diplomatic relations with the kingdom
but when US geologists told FDR that the
kingdom possessed the world's largest
supply of untapped petroleum he
determined to place that oil under
American dominion and so in February
1945 his world war two was drawing to a
close he traveled to the Middle East and
met with King Abdulaziz urban salud the
founder of the modern saudi dynasty you
have to imagine the scene the President
of the United States and the
acknowledged leader of the free world
sitting next to a medieval potentate
accompanied by astrologers and slaves
together the two leaders agreed that the
United States would form a protectorate
over the kingdom of saudi arabia
promising to defend the king and his
male heirs in perpetuity in return for
privileged access to saudi arabian oil
this arrangement form the cornerstone of
us imperial power in the Persian Gulf
and can
used to govern US policy in the region
to protect the royal family in Saudi oil
fields the United States and military
advisors to the kingdom established
military bases there to play it deployed
a naval fleet and provided with the most
sophisticated weapons I obviously don't
have time to recount this history but
protection of Saudi Arabia and the
neighboring oil shikdum became American
protectorates was the essential impetus
for the Truman Doctrine the Eisenhower
doctrine the Nixon Doctrine and most
importantly the Carter doctrine of 1980
which states that oil from the Persian
Gulf is a vital interest of the United
States in that in protecting this oil
the United States will use any means
necessary including military force it
was a Carter doctrine that provided the
rationale for the first Persian Gulf War
of 1992 91 and i believe historians will
conclude it was the ultimate inspiration
for the second Persian Gulf War the 2003
invasion of Iraq and it was the
deployment of large numbers of American
troops in Saudi Arabia to enforce the
Carter doctrine that turned Osama bin
Laden from an instrument of us
penetration in the region into an
adversary of us penetration from a
historic perspective 911 must be seen as
a conscious effort by bin Laden to
forcibly dissolve the u.s. protected
protectorate of a Saudi Arabia
established by FDR and King Abdulaziz in
1945 so long before President Bush jr.
came to office the United States had
established an oil-based Empire in the
Persian Gulf and fought a series of
overt and covert was to protect it what
this President Bush has done what is his
distinctive mark is to globalize the
American oil Empire by extending the
Carter doctrine to other keep producing
areas in the developing world the first
thing that Bush did when he came to
office was to appoint an energy
commission headed by Vice President Dick
Cheney to study America's energy
requirements
I think you know that this commission
met in secrecy and relied on advice from
Enron ExxonMobil and other giant
companies what is less understood is
that they decided to perpetuate
America's oil based energy system for
another 20 years and to do so to
increase rather than diminish American
reliance on imported petroleum and this
could lead to only one conclusion the
United States must gain access to
foreign oil no matter where it is
located no matter how remote or
unfriendly the country where the oil is
located the Persian Gulf is not enough
to satisfy our ever-growing appetite the
United States must also extract the oil
of Africa Asia Latin America and the
former Soviet Union more and more of it
all the time there is no other way they
concluded to maintain the American oil
driven economic system as we know it and
because this relentless drive to exploit
the rest of the world's oil is certain
to invite opposition whether from
revolutionary guerrillas in Colombia
nationalistic populace in Venezuela
Islamic fundamentalists in Central Asia
or ethnic separatists in Nigeria the
Bush administration set out to establish
US military domination over all of these
other oil-producing areas this has led
to the commitment of American troops and
advisors to pipeline and refinery
protection in Iraq Colombia the Republic
of Georgia to the establishment of new
bases in the Caspian Sea and the search
for new bases in Africa slowly but
surely the United States military is
being converted into a global oil
protection service and so I return to my
original point the new American Empire
if that's what it is is an empire of
petroleum by petroleum and for petroleum
it is of petroleum because it is based
on the establishment of protectorates
over key oil-producing nations in the
developing world it is by petroleum
because it relies on a global military
force that is almost entirely powered by
petroleum and it's for petroleum because
its main purpose is to extract
of the world's oil to perpetuate a
petroleum intensive economy and way of
life in the United States where does
this leave us if my analysis is correct
the war in Iraq is not the first
american war over petroleum nor will it
be the last because America's need for
petroleum is growing and because we have
chosen to militarize our foreign policy
there will be more Wars for oil is it
worth it that's for you and the American
people to decide personally I do not
believe that we should sacrifice the
life of a single American soldier
without of any other country to provide
the United States with an abundant
supply of petroleum I believe that we
must demilitarize our foreign energy
policy and repudiate our blood for oil
Protectorate over Saudi Arabia this will
require a greater commitment to energy
conservation at home and a rapid
development of petroleum alternatives
such as wind solar and hydrogen this
will be arduous and expensive I know but
it's the only ethical and the only
patriotic course that we can follow I
hope that you'll agree with me thank
Oh
if a few people very quickly want to
come up to the microphone to ask a
question and you'll have to make those
brief I just wanted to observe that both
the president and vice president have
said that they would do again what they
did and that was invade Iraq that they
think they did the right thing and
that's the Republican ticket for 2004
what might have surprised many is that
John Kerry said something similar when
he was asked at his campaign stop of the
Grand Canyon if he knew now if he knew
then what he knew now would he vote the
same way which was he voted for the
invasion he said yes I think that
shocked a lot of people but his tune did
seem to change right around the time of
the convention maybe that's because on
Sunday the day before the Republican
National Convention the largest protest
mass protest in the history of US
political conventions took place outside
Madison Square Garden a half a million
people
as people line up I was wondering if
either of all of you would like to
respond very quickly to a most obvious
question which is do you see a
distinction when it comes to the issue
of American Empire and this invasion and
occupation between the two major party
candidates john kerry and george bush
and what they would do Noam Chomsky in
the case of Iraq I think their positions
are very difficult to distinguish they
might have done they might have
initiated different policies but given
what's there now they couldn't seem to
be much difference both seem committed
to the war aim that I think Iraqis
properly understand gaining control of
Iraqi oil which is indeed unique in the
world it's the last known huge basically
untapped even unexplored source of very
cheap and easily accessible oil so you
control that and establish a base in a
hope of the plant dependent client state
with military bases for a gain control
over the region both for the reasons
that Mike eloquently described and also
for the reasons that this big knee of
Brzezinski my greatest hero described I
think accurately it does grant the US
critical leverage over others and that's
been a long-standing problem they're our
rivals they might go on an independent
courts on empire generally I think there
are some differences I assume that Kerry
would follow roughly the Clinton
policies something these are not
elections between individuals but being
groups of
advisors and constituencies and his is
roughly Clinton's so in the case of for
example military militarization of space
and other aspects of the massive
expansion of offensive and destructive
military capacity the Clinton position
was more nuanced similar position but
there is a difference between control of
space and ownership of space for
military purposes and everything that
flows from it there are major
differences i think domestically would
separate issue the bush administration
would like Americans to think there's no
particular difference between John Kerry
and George W Bush on the war in Iraq
John Kerry stands in the middle ground
on this war he doesn't stand where I
stand I'm not running for president I
wouldn't get like the dog catcher in
this country I'm grateful that John
Kerry is addressing most of his
political thrust to people who are
undecided in this election but I also
think it's crucial to listen to the
whole man his whole life story and the
mantra of what he says which i believe
is is a credible position and one that
needs to be really affirmed in this
political season going forward he would
only go to war when it's necessary and
the bottom line is that the deception
about this war was its necessity there
was no necessity for this war and that's
a theme to which carrie has been
considered on which he's been consistent
into which he returns again and again
there's a there is a world of difference
between john kerry and george w bush and
the question of the war in iraq and on
that difference this election stands
in the interest of discussion i'll pass
because i share Jim's a few months ago
when you are asked in milton
massachusetts about how we get
progressive radio programs on such as
democracy now into the boston area you
talked about the tight grip that the
boston radio stations have over their
content today the executive director of
WBUR stepped down amidst a lot of
controversy about patronage etc in this
window of opportunity is there anything
we can do to help get a me on locally in
larger stations than Boston College's I
think there's quite a lot that we can do
walking in here today somebody told me
that they can watch democracy now on
Cambridge cable television that could be
done on every every town in the region
everywhere in fact there's plenty of
options there they're not exploited as
fully as they should be and the same I
don't know that wbur but the same can be
done on many radio stations let me think
I don't know that person by very good
point Democracy Now is broadcasting in
Boston on Cambridge community television
and Cambridge Boston neighborhood
network on wzb see Boston College every
day and it also broadcasts on both
satellite networks Dish Network every
day channel 9 4 15 which is free speech
TV and on direct TV channel 375 which is
linked TV we also video an audio stream
at democracynow.org where millions of
people access the program around the
globe and are broadcasting on more than
275 radio and television stations NPR
stations where we beat all things
considered in morning edition hands down
fundraising so maybe be you are or bgh
would be interest GBH should be
interested on public access TV anyone
can get us on their public access TV
station increasingly on PBS stations so
you can just call your stations these
are public radio and television you are
the public in order for dissent to be
effective it's helpful if the dissenter
gets heard and also it's helpful if he
or she doesn't get crushed after he or
she speaks out that's why it's so
important to have steam professors like
yourself at places like MIT or Columbia
representing the left who have the
ability to get hurt and also can't so
easily be crushed but who are your
successors I mean you know there are
vibrant lively popular movements all
over the country there many more of them
there have ever been in the past at
least in my lifetime they're
disorganized we're a disorganized
disunited atomized country but they're
all over the place and out of them come
speakers the speakers oh don't come from
nowhere they come from popular movements
that exist I mean for example I was
talking on the Vietnam War in churches
40 years ago but there were maybe four
people in the audience you know the
minister the organizer somebody who
wandered in because he was hungry or
something and another person would be
have been happy to kill me and this went
on until popular movements developed
they've expanded developed undertaken
all sorts of actions on every imaginable
issue sometimes quite effectively has
changed the country and it's created the
opportunity
should you know I gone tonight all it's
like every other night to spend half an
hour turning down invitations not
because I don't want to take him but
because I can't and there's plenty of
opportunity for others to do the same
and many are I mean just compare the war
in Iraq with the war in Vietnam I mean
the war in Iraq happens to be the first
time in the history of the West Europe
and the United States in which there was
massive public protest against war
before it was officially launched the
case of the war in Vietnam which was far
more destructive and violent and brutal
and a far more criminal act it took
years before there was any protest at
all literally on by the time protest was
visible South Vietnam and practically
wiped out and even then the protest was
mostly against a peripheral Court the
bombing of the north that's a huge
change in consciousness over 40 years
and that's where activists organizers
come from where the opportunities for
speakers to contribute what they can
come from so the groundwork is there all
that's needed is to use the
opportunities you can be a speaker for
but comment and then a question for
professor Chomsky I just want to thank
all the panelists wholeheartedly for
your healing and enlightening words this
evening thank you very much and for amy
goodman i watch your show every day
Monday through Friday and thank you for
helping to somewhat in my ignorance and
especially the coverage on Haiti was
really incredible and on Reagan as well
and my question dr. Chomsky is I heard
that there was a letter although I
didn't see it but there was a letter
written to Ralph Nader asking him to
drop out of the presidential race and
this letter had numerous signatures on
it from prominent individuals yourself
being one so I heard please correct me
if I'm me if I'm wrong am i incorrect
about that completely in ok I'm very
sorry well so then let me just ask this
question which is Ralph Nader was
interviewed on Democracy Now the other
day and I think it was kind of a
poignant interview where he stated that
he felt that many prominent individuals
on the left that had supported him
before now did not support him and he
felt that a lot on the Left had lost
their nerve so I just opened a question
to all the panelists then do you how do
you agree with that and how do you feel
about well I can't speak for others but
my position on this election is exactly
the same as it was in two thousand
namely that the election it's given the
huge Democratic deficit in the United
States and the fact that elections are
have become a marginal issue in my
opinion where issues are shunted to the
side insofar as they exist and the
massive focus is on personality
personalized extravaganzas given that
fact the most important thing reaction
to an election is to not pay too much
attention to it and go on with the
important work of building popular
organizations increasing activism
reconstructing a democratic culture in
which elections will be as meaningful as
say they are in
the second largest country in this
hemisphere Brazil however elections
exist can't ignore them takes a little
spend a little time thinking about what
you do in my opinion it takes should
take about five minutes to figure out
what to do in this one and my opinion
was the same in the year 2000 as it is
now in a swing state where the vote may
matter I think you should vote to keep
out the more dangerous and they are
dangerous of the two can of and not
candidates but groups personalization is
something we should ignore these are
just two different groups two different
constituencies and so on they're
different and the one around bush i
think is very dangerous so where your
vote matters i feel as i did in the year
two thousand one should vote to keep
them out in a safe state where your vote
doesn't affect things you got a lot of
choices and if you're interested in say
party building for the long term you
would cast the vote for those who are
day after day year after year working on
parting the party building if your
interest is something else that I vote
for that if you think a way to protest
the to express your opposition to the
personalized the quadrennial
extravaganzas is to abstain do that I
think that was the same position in the
year 2000 i think it is now i don't
think we should spend a lot of time
thinking about it are talking about it
if there are much more important things
to do I feel a rare not've disagreement
with noam chomsky and I just want to
register it I think is a huge difference
between the democratic party in the
Republican Party in this country now the
Republican Party is becoming a dangerous
party in the United States at every
level and it should be opposed at every
level and every opportunity there is to
vote against it should be taken
it always matters it always matters in
Massachusetts everywhere it always
matters on the whole range of issues
personal freedom questions of sexual
ethics even even if we chose already
determined absolutely a safe state is
the stage well we're by definition this
is this is a safe state only in
relationship to the presidential
election right and on other issues
that's a matter of party building as a
matter of public affirmation and it's a
matter of on a really really
understanding that there is a major
conflict in this country right now that
must be engaged at every level and and
the Democratic Party which is far from
perfect simply must be supported
wherever it's positive for Republican
candidate happens to be more progressive
one I mean in the past i voted for
republic well if you give me an example
on that when we could we could discuss
for example during the 1960's the most
outspoken opponents of the vietnam war
at the Congressional level happen to be
Massachusetts Republicans and I voted
for them it's certainly true that at the
local regional sometimes state level you
should do whatever is important to do
this the issue that was raised the safe
state swing state issues solely has to
do with presidential election solely
with that Michael Clare because this is
such an important topic and also bear in
mind that some people are voting for the
first time ever and there's been a huge
increase in registration by young people
and marginalized voters for whom this is
an existential act and in a more
important existential act even though I
understand noms analysis I think I think
it's it's such an important act and i
agree with james carroll that these
people are dangerous and just just think
where we are now compared to me where we
were four years ago imagine where we'll
be four years from now if the
republicans are still in power I shudder
to think where our freedoms will be then
and so even voting in a swing state
against the Republicans I think is
crucial a safe state a safe state I'm
sorry
even in a safe state as an existential
act of expression of opposition for
those for whom it is their first vote
and for others I think it's crucial
let's take one more question Amy Goodman
first I just wanted I just wanted to
thank you for talk that you gave it ever
green state college in 2003 it's what
brought me here and to listening to
these people and to you every day but
professor Chomsky the other day on the
vice presidential debate Dick Cheney
related his experience as an election
monitor in el salvador in 1983 and I was
just curious at the time and streamed
down to me that I wanted to have your
context what was happening in 1983 when
Dick Cheney was an election monitor
there seemed to bring almost a tear to
his eye in 1983 the US was engaged in
major wars throughout Central America in
some cases the u.s. controlled the
government and therefore was able to
rely on state security forces to crush
and destroy efforts at Independence and
democracy like was fighting a major war
against the church el salvador at that
time there was a what's sometimes called
a demonstration election an election
held under conditions of extreme terror
and violence and yeah Janie I didn't
know he observed that he could have it
was a pretty meaningless election there
was actually a much more important
election in 1984 in Nicaragua which was
a country that was under military attack
but where the state security forces were
not the terrorist force it was being
supported by actually bipartisan support
in the United States
on in various ways to try to crush the
independent government nevertheless they
had a an election which was monitored
very heavily it was the most heavily
monitored election I think in history of
may be anywhere certainly Latin America
Latin American Studies Association a
very hostile Dutch government official
delegation the British parliamentary
human rights delegation and so on and
they judged a pretty fair election by
Latin American standards here it was
wiped out of discussion across across
the spectrum because it came out the
wrong way so almost universally what is
said here is the first election was
nineteen ninety that one came out the
right way I under a gun I shouldn't say
nineteen eighty four election was pre by
regional standard certainly came out the
wrong way didn't take place that's the
kind of thing we should be concerned
about and that's bipartisan
unfortunately for fear of being accused
of flip-flopping we will allow in one
last question and then the authors our
speakers will be going into the bookshop
and or staying here and books are going
to be sold in the bookshop and I really
do want to encourage people to buy these
books I want to just stress and talking
about the politics of publishing what an
enormous difference it makes when books
like these make it when people in this
country start to read these different
points of view there is a proliferation
of conservative imprints at publishers
and when they learn that there is will
they call it markets but communities of
people which I would say represent the
majority of people in this country that
are interested in books like blood and
oil like crusade chronicles of an unjust
war and hegemony our survival America's
quest for global dominance that when
those books succeed for every one of
those books it make
room for another book and it is
extremely important message to be sent
and it also sends a message to the
corporate media in this country that
there are other experts out there
outside of that small circle of pundits
who know so little about so much to
start first first of all thank you for
the panel but I want to since we talked
about the I gonna home just feel right
address oh okay we talked about the
Empire making I want to know how Sudan
and question of Darfur fits in because
we are right now alcohol and power said
that there is genocide in darfur yet we
just ignore genocide in Palestine second
in we talking about Empire first of all
I disagree with mr. Carroll that there
is a lot of difference between John
Kerry and bush as we know what they are
doing a lot of people including in elite
disagree and about the invasion of Iraq
and the thing actually is not in the
interest of empire that's interesting
then i can mention many names the reason
is because they believe really this does
not serve the interest of empire rather
it served the interests of Israel and
one thing that you talk so much about
the foreign policy what I'm saying that
is not interests of the Empire I'm
talking about from foreign policy point
of view not about other issues education
or other things and you just totally
ignored a Justice somehow it push aside
the question of Israel many people
talking about Israel decision of the
foreign policy and the
neocon because even Jennifer Matthew
last night mentioned from Carnegie Hall
endowment that Bush did not go into
world with free will he was where she
was mentioning the rule of no car about
that otherwise why for example not only
in the Middle East we are looking for
oil but also in Africa they have the oil
of child for eleven percent tomorrow
probably Chad young people are going to
pick up you know the gun and fight and
dentists the question is I want to know
what is the role of Israel in there you
know culture Empire and Middle East
right now that pushing for invasion of
in other countries because that's you
are looking to eliminate their energy to
do that let us how that of you know to
the States thank you the question of
Israel well I'm glad to have the chance
to address this the implication of your
question because I didn't hear a full
clear statement but I would like to just
suggest that we should be very careful
of blaming the problem of the war in
Iraq on Israel this is not Israel's
problem this is America's problem and
there is a movement there is an impulse
there is a kind of instinctive reaction
that looks to blame Israel and it's
wrong having said that the struggle
between the Israelis and the
Palestinians is crucial and is clearly
involved in this centrally and my own
position is that the United States of
America has failed that struggle the
Bush administration by not pressing the
Shorin government to be what more less
reliant on overwhelming force less
reliant on the dead or alive impulse
that comes from Washington also the
United States of America has to
absolutely recommit to the peace process
the possibility of the realization of
the ambitions of both people
and it is simply not inconsistent with
full and complete support for the call
for justice for the Palestinian people
to also affirm the clear and absolute
right for the security of the people of
Israel and that note want to thank you
very much for coming out encourage you
to tune in to democracy now we will be
broadcasting at tonight's forum
