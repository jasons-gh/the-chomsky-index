there's also been no change in the
intentions which are openly announced
described by Barak's chief negotiator at
Camp David shlomo ben ami one of the
architects of the Camp David Accords and
a dove in the Israeli spectrum he
explained just before joining the
government in 1998 he explained the
intention of the Oslo process namely to
create a neo-colonial dependency for the
Palestinians in the occupied territories
with permanent dependence on Israel
meaning the us-israel alliance so banta
stands and the analysis is correct and
it should have also made headlines right
along with the unpublished maps and
along with the actions which were taken
at the time to drive the point home the
final Clinton Barack year in that year
settlement programs expanded to their
highest peak since 1992 pre Oslo under
Sharon well you take a look at history
at again reveals the continuity of
policy so right now there's a great deal
of interest in the Saudi peace plan
which was adopted by the Arab League in
March and this is regularly described
here as a historic opportunity if only
the Arab states will at last accept the
existence of Israel as in fact they have
repeatedly done along with the PLO since
January 1976 when they joined the rest
of the world in backing a Security
Council resolution which called for a
political settlement based on israeli
withdrawal from the occupied territories
with i'm quoting at appropriate
arrangements to guarantee the
sovereignty territorial and territorial
integrity and political independence of
all states in the area and their right
to live in peace with insecure and
recognized borders so that's in effect
UN 242 the basic document amplified to
include a Palestinian state as usual the
resolution was vetoed by the United
States which is a double veto it vito's
it from history similar initiatives have
regularly been blocked by Washington
right to the present
mine are a majority of Americans also
support the political settlement that is
now reiterated in the Saudi plan but
unless they undertake a research project
Americans cannot know that the primary
barrier to the diplomatic settlement
that they support happens to be the
Washington Israel alliance as it's been
for 25 years actually longer if we look
closely well unless this changes and
that means changes right here the
prospects there are for descent into
even more bitter tribal warfare with
ominous consequences that are likely to
spread well beyond well finally looking
back over quickly very quickly over a
longer stretch at the end of World War
two the United States had a position of
global wealth and power that had no
analogue in human history with the
reconstruction of other industrial
societies the u.s. share of global
wealth declined from about half after
the Second World War to about a quarter
by the 1970s that's the time when the
major critical change in post-war policy
took place namely the post-war economic
system was dismantled and the current
neoliberal framework was established
it's been accompanied for the past 25
years by deterioration in major macro
economic indices part from countries
that didn't follow the rules and a
notable attack on the substance of
democracy these are important topics but
I can't go into them now well by this
1970 the world had become economically
tri-polar with roughly comparable
centers in North America Europe and East
Asia but it was militarily bipolar US
and Russia and each of the superpowers
imposed constraints on the other and the
cold were conflicts which were of course
violent and destructive were within the
domains of the superpowers with a
collapse of the Soviet Union the world
became unipolar
literally remaining tri-polar
economically as it is now a couple of
years ago Harvard political scientist
Samuel Huntington wrote in the main
establishment journal foreign affairs
that much of the world he seemed to
imply most of the world considered the
United States to be a rogue state the
greatest threat to their existence
possibly a reasonable estimate and
possibly more so today it can also be
reasonably argued i think that the
evolving system of state corporate power
is a threat to its own based in
washington's threat to its own
population us there the tendencies that
lead in that direction are very real
they're not inexorable and there are
others that strongly counter them well
if you look over the centuries there's
been significant expansion in the realm
of freedom and justice there are periods
of regression but the cycle is generally
upward as always human affairs are
scarcely predictable very little is
understood and too much depends on will
and choice the emerging framework of
world power should not be an object of
detached contemplation but has to be
forged by dedicated work and struggle
always based on an effort to dismantle
doctrinal constraints to see what's
before our eyes which is not really very
deeply hidden
