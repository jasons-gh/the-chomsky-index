as you all know we are approaching the
seventh 70th anniversary of the founding
of the United Nations it's a good moment
to reflect on its origins its faith in
these your sins and prospects for the
future actually I was about your age at
the time of the founding of the United
Nations and the memories of those yet
hopeful days are still very much alive
the ashes of the most horrible war in
history were still smoldering the sheer
hideousness of the Nazi atrocities was
just coming to be recognized fully along
with the realization that human genius
had created the means for instant
destruction of the species and had in
fact employed those means to vaporize to
Japanese cities and those bitter and
frightening days the UN Charter and the
founding of the United Nations provided
a desperately needed ray of hope it's
worthwhile to recall the opening words
of the Charter establishing the united
nations of quoted to save succeeding
generations from the scourge of war
which twice in our lifetime has brought
untold sorrow to men
and to reaffirm faith in fundamental
human rights in the dignity and worth of
the human person in the equal rights of
men and women and of Nations large and
small and to establish conditions under
which justice and respect for the
obligations arising from treaties and
other sources of international law can
be maintained and to promote social
progress and better standards of life in
larger freedom the Charter is one of the
foundations of modern international law
it was soon amplified a couple of years
later by the Declaration of Human Rights
and over the years by numerous United
Nations General Assembly conventions and
designed to enabling conventions their
call to implement the principles and the
rights that are enunciated in
resolutions there's further
amplification in the judgments of the
International Court of Justice world for
and other international tribunals and by
Security Council resolutions which alone
have the full force of law the amalgam
is an impressive body of doctrine though
it also has fundamental flaws those are
recognised with some bitterness by most
of the world but often ignored by the
powerful the most serious flaw is a
pretty obvious one the body of law that
is established is enforceable only
against the week of the powerful
mostly immune that's a matter to
creative great importance particularly
to people like us to citizens the United
States a fart most powerful and
influential state in the international
system and also in many respects the
most free of the states of the
international system that combination
which I'll come back to a number of
times is of great significance the
United Nations can operate only insofar
as the Great Powers permit that's
obviously true for the five powers that
have defeat the veto right at the
Security Council to exercise a veto but
there of course many other forms of
influence and control the record of
vetoes is quite instructive were
thinking about to understand the record
it's necessary to look at how powered
relations have evolved over the years
and what you find is that the veto very
closely follows the course of
distribution of power in the
international system in quite revealing
ways so a couple of words on the two
brief Instamatic at a few words on the
evolution of
our relation since 1945 in 1945 the
United States was of course far and away
the most powerful state in the world in
fact in world history long before that
it had been the most wealthy state in
the world the greatest economy and of
course as unique advantage it's not that
duplicated anywhere else in fact by some
measures the American colonies even
before independence were the richest
part of the world by the end of the 19th
century the United States had far
surpassed other economies even the
combination of other great economies
World War one greatly enhanced its
relative power the United States was
however not a major international actor
wasn't the leading actor in world
affairs that Britain though by then
declining still had that role followed
by friends well world war two changed
all of that other industrial countries
were severely damaged or destroyed the
US economy boomed industrial production
in the United States quadrupled wartime
technologies laid the basis for rapid
post-war growth 1950s in the 1960s were
the greatest birth period of modern
economies and relatively egalitarian
group
so the lowest quintile that about as
well as the upper quintile let's change
the last generation pretty radically
their 50s and 60s are sometimes called
by economists the Golden Age of
capitalism capitalism but when the
United when the United Nations was
formed in 1945 the u.s. literally had
half of the world's wealth nothing like
that in the history and it had
overwhelming middle military
predominance that the United States
controlled the entire hemisphere they
controlled both oceans and for all the
opposite sides of of the oceans that is
unprecedented and of course the United
States alone at the time had the
ultimate weapon the atom bomb well
considering the circumstances no one
with any familiarity with history would
have doubted the outcome naturally the
US would largely control the United
Nations under those conditions and in
fact it did and it's also no surprise
that with the Cold War just beginning to
heat up the United States use this power
to employ the United Nations as a weapon
against its superpower enemy so the
Union that one direct result was Russian
vetoes like the US the Russians cast all
the leaders in the early years of the
United Nations by the 1960s the
situation was changing other industrial
powers were recovering from wartime
devastation and crucially decolonization
was underway the imperial systems were
collapsing new stage for the rising in
the former imperial domains and they
were beginning to become actors in the
international system diversifying power
to an extent the US power was still
uncomfortable but it was a client
infected again declining from the late
1940s there's much talk these days about
American decline but it's often
overlooked that the decline began in the
late 40s as engine continuing since
those the United States remains without
compare so by 1970 the u.s. wealth was
about twenty five percent still
phenomenal quantity but it's much less
than fifty percent as it was in 1945 by
1970 the world was understood to be what
was called truck forward three major
economic that areas industrial centers
north of an us-based North American
german-based Europe and North East Asia
which already was most dynamic
developing region of the world
was then Japan base later came to
include the advanced industrial
economies of Japan's former colonies
Taiwan South Korea or recently China
something Southeast Asian countries the
world was changed and the United Nations
was becoming more representative of the
nations of the world and that is
reflected in cracker to vitos which
changed corresponding to the
distribution of power of the United
States faces first veto ever of the 1970
it joined the briton be Tony a
resolution that condemn the white racist
state of Southern Rhodesia that since I
tired the United States has been far in
the lead in vetoing Security Council
resolutions freakin second and many of
the u.s. vetoes have been in defensive
Israel where the oil sands virtually
alone in the General Assembly where
there's no veto votes on Israel
Palestine issues are regularly passed by
enormous majorities something like maybe
150 23 with it I
they supposed sometimes joined by some
Pacific island dependency of the
pregnancy and much the same is true of
the annual votes on the condemning the
US embargo against Cuba passed similar
182 two states in Israel one of the
reasons why the u.s. recently moved to
the degree of normalization with Cupid
isn't the u.s. essentially becoming
totally isolated in the world and in
fact isolated in the hemisphere
practically barred from answer me kozel
position because they're all quite
important facts and they're vitas on
many other issues even is alone and
having vetoed a resolution and Security
Council two resolutions in fact calling
on all states to observe international
law the resolutions didn't mention any
hunger in particular but it was
understood that they were aimed the
United States which had just rejected a
World Court decision for the inversion
the United States to terminate what was
called it's unlawful use of force means
international terrorism against
Nicaragua
pay substantial reparations us responded
by rejecting the decision he doing to
Security Council resolutions calling on
the states to observe international law
and in fact escalating the attack us
international isolation then was already
quite significant increasing and that
was understood in high places there was
an official explanation from the State
Department as to why the United States
rejected the World Court decision and he
took the resolution it was given by the
State Department legal adviser Abram
some sherry pointed out all quoted that
the world majority often opposes the
United States on important international
questions so that we must reserve to
ourselves the power to determine which
matters fall essentially within the
domestic jurisdiction of the United
States as determined by the United
States in this case it was international
terrorism that practically destroyed the
targeted country but no other country in
the world can take that position even
our problems but that's part of the
prerogative of power that you can do
that that it remains almost unknown
well this combination of power and
disregard of public opinion is natural
those two things go together power
disregarded other opinion are very
natural partners and they are revealed
very dramatically when we consider the
most serious international crime of the
crime of the pressure concept well
defined in international law Assembly
resolutions signed by the United States
others it's understood a digression is
understood to be quote the supreme
international crime differing only from
other war crimes and that it contains
all of the evil that follows those are
the words of the Nuremberg judgment
which sentence Nazi war criminals to
death founding principle of modern
international law well there are clear
cases of aggression a radical violation
of the UN Charter international law
global opinion the cases where the
aggression itself is the supreme
international crime and the evil
followed his immense right to the prison
moment to the most extreme case
this let n is the u.s. british invasion
of iraq in 2003 but there is no thought
that the consequences are enormous it
aside from virtually destroying Iraq it
set in motion and sectarian conflicts
which had not previously existed which
are tearing Iraq to shreds and air to
the region two trips Isis one extremely
ugly consequences but there's a thought
of any punitive attached comment on such
an idea of photo and though official
condemnation impossible the perpetrators
are immune simply because there are two
power mu any action or even verbal on
that nation there is criticism within a
league circles attracted criticism of
the aggression of the most extreme
permissible criticism that you can find
articulated is the invasion failed so
President Obama is praised for being an
early opponent of the war but the
l'attention is paid often to the basis
for his opposition said it was a
strategic blunder that was the problem
which means that it
fine that's the most extreme criticism
that can be raised against a truly
powerful state other crimes of state of
treated pretty much the same way and
articulate a panel these practices are
quite common the world the sense is
commonly accepted within the violence
paying attention to us discourse in
recent years below the Iran has been
described regularly as the greatest
threat to world peace and her friends
government commentators back to the
world's these matters differently the
non-aligned movement of the global South
vigorously endorses Iran's nuclear
programs it accepts that they're aimed
at developing nuclear power so in fact
it's not unlikely that there are aimed
at least entertaining
capability of the capability to produce
weapons we'd enjoyed by a great many
countries which had a far lesser need
for d terms that Iran does remember that
for the US intelligence if Iran is
developing nuclear weapons but if it is
it would be part of a determined
strategy and no rational analysts
possibility that the paper but the views
of the non-aligned countries global
South our assembly which represent the
large in jar in the world the desert is
regarded in the West can barely find
okay and interestingly also dismissed is
international public opinion
the world was the beach it was not
Durant which ranked rather low it was
the United States Farley follow far
behind by Pakistan are not verily
dismissed the pole was not even reported
in the United States so the prerogatives
of power dictate that it's irrelevant
convenient well it is a considerable
interest of popular opinion in the
United States the bird is quite
significantly from that of the
decision-making classes so how could
support for the nomination strange very
high considerable majority of the US
population has generally held at the
United Nations take the lead
international conflict as home ard even
held that the United States should
abandon the veto and follow
international opinion improve incentives
are so remote
and they're articulated and something
similar proved the General Assembly
conventions denied the implement the
provisions of international law the u.s.
actually ratifies a very few of these
and those few are qualified by
reservations which exclude the United
States from their jurisdiction first the
ratification by others is typically
quite hypocritical accompanied by no
intent to live up that they find words
but us power and it's increasing
isolation in the world same are
illustrated symbolically by the fact
that the United States assumes the right
to be self immunized from international
law and thus publicly well it's returned
to the most severe harm threat the
atomic weapons the scientists who
created atomic weapons understood better
than anyone that humans now face the
prospect of self-annihilation and
they've all been in the lead and seeking
to avert the past they have a
publication Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists primary source of info
these issues it has a famous Doomsday
Clock which is established 1947 which
estimates how close we are to the
midnight of self-annihilation couple
weeks ago the Doomsday Clock dance
that's the closest it's been to midnight
for 30 years a moment to which I'll
return it's with such concerns in mind
that if all members shall refrain from
the threat or use of force narrow
exceptions that's the most fundamental
principle of international law it's
remarkably remarkable to see how
commonly the principle is violated by
the United States and lesser powers back
as an extraterrestrial observer were
watching what's happening on earth then
would marvel at our inability to
appreciate the risks that were
consciously taking and they would
realize that we survived for 70 years
literally by Blind Luck take a look at
the record is quite shut advise doing
that not only includes foolhardy
decisions choices of political leaders
but also just accident there have been a
huge number of cases we are very close
predicament that a nuclear attack was
taking place and a nuclear response was
stopped only but quick human
intervention with the systems operate
there's very little time well I
mentioned that the just given examples
like The Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists just published them a review
six years nineteen 677 1983 they don't
probably hundreds of such cases and the
article concludes that nuclear war is
the Black Swan we can never see except
in that brief moment when it is killing
us we delay eliminating the risk at our
own peril now's the time to read now
we're still alive by luck the finish by
quoting Lee I mentioned the Doomsday
Clock says it just been moved two
minutes closer to midnight closes to
spend in 30 years there was
serious were scared the reasons now go
beyond the increasing threat of terminal
nuclear war you look at the announcement
in the bulletin of Atomic Scientists it
reads as follows it says unchecked
climate change global nuclear weapons
modernizations outside of the arsenal
both the continued existence of humanity
and world leaders have failed to act
with the speed or on the scale required
to protect citizens from potential
catastrophe these offenders of political
leadership and danger every person on
earth the clock ticks now at three
minutes to midnight because
international leaders are failing to
perform their most important duty
ensuring of human civilization you'll
notice that this declaration false
political leadership without reason but
leaders do not act in a vacuum even in
highly authoritarian states they're
constrained with the public and much
more so to the extent that states are
more free and democratic and these
considerations bring us right back home
despite any abuses the United States
remains unusual among the states of the
world and the freedom that citizens
enjoy to speak and to act without fear
or state violence and oppression
furthermore the United States remains by
far the most powerful state in the world
further if that is
security of great power and great
freedom provides unusual opportunity and
also unusual responsibility for American
citizens more than any others in the
world we are in a position to act to
bring the aspirations of the united
nations to fruition and turn the
Doomsday Clock back far
Thank You professor Chomsky and now we
would like to introduce our charity
speaker when Grant veterans returned
home from work adjusting back to
civilian life presents many challenges
veterans are forced to find a job and
begin transitioning back to an average
American lifestyle often while coping
with psychological difficulties these
sharples regularly put newly returned
veterans in situations where finding a
stable housing is a daunting task the
New England Center for homeless veterans
works tirelessly to embed this issue in
our own community they offer training
program that prepares veterans to tackle
the job searches as well as a housing
program that covers several tiers of
need Bosman 14 is proud to be raising
money for this amazing charity
throughout the duration of this
conference it's my pleasure to introduce
to you Angela Colley the organization's
seoane president here today to speak to
you more about the work is charity does
well good evening folks i'm annie
macaulay i am here on behalf of the New
England Center for homeless veterans and
i do want to take just a couple of
minutes of your time to express our
appreciation my personal appreciation in
the appreciation of the veterans that we
serve for the support of your providing
to the center into the bed with you sir
thank you very much also we are based in
Boston so I do under welcome all the
delegates who may have traveled from
other locations here to this great
location and congratulations for for
coming here and participating in this
very very educational and I think you
will find enlightening for model un is
obviously modeled after United Nations
the United Nations is certainly an
institution and international
institution that is found was founded
and is dedicated to the ideals of
peaceful coexistence and I think that it
would be fair to say I'm certainly
probably biased in that regard because
people who serve in the United States
military citizens who like to join one
of the four services of the United
States are in fact a very strong force
for peace in our world they defend our
freedoms but i think they in a larger
from a larger perspective they are in
fact a very strong and effective force
for peace around the world that was my
experience in the 30 years that i served
and i think that that does reflect in
many ways the missions of the United
Nations so I think there is a synergy in
some overlap there that and I guess that
might be my perspective but I want to
take just a little bit of both of the
center does and I don't to take a lot of
time because this is obviously not with
the focus for this forum is but people
who serve in the military and then when
they return to civilian life are
considered veterans they are veterans
they have raised their right hand and
sworn to support defend the Constitution
of the United States and when you return
to civilian life they are very very
important and strong
in our society and our community in the
United States today there are almost 22
million veterans and their age an age
range in age from early 20s all the way
up into their nine reason into laundry
it is a very important but it is
actually a shrinking segment of our
society represents just a little under
seven percent devices of our society of
people who represent or serve in the
military and veterans are very
successful over the hall for a number of
different reasons people who serve in
the military I himself select to serve
in the military and they tend to be
people like yourselves who reach outside
themselves people want to be part of
something important people who want to
be part of an important mission to bring
good to the world and I think as a
result of that they bring those
qualities most Service careers and live
when they generally are very successful
I also think that some of the
characteristics some of the skills some
of the qualities that they gained
through their service their ability to
subordinate their own goals and needs
and sometimes safety and health to the
larger mission I think also serves them
well and they they do very well there
their overall more educated than the
general population and they are more
affluent and they actually do very well
but veterans are people and people as
you know throughout their lives and as
you as you experience that you will see
people that people just like nations and
people all of the world experience
complexities in their lives and
challenges in their lives and for
veterans who experience challenges
transition from their time in the
service following that when they when
they experience challenges and they're
not able to be successful on their own
in the past and unfortunately currently
now some of them find themselves facing
that disruptive and disabling condition
of homelessness and homelessness is
something that I have been able to gain
an appreciation but in the unit I work
with the center how disruptive the
disabled does not reflect their boy does
not reflect their take it reflects their
aspirations of order education other
intelligent but if it's a disabling
condition and the only ones Center for
homeless veterans goal in fact is the
end homelessness for every veteran who
may experience it and be part of a
larger national campaign a state
campaign in the city of austin campaign
to make homelessness for veterans in
this country something that is industry
works just like the united nations goal
is to make something we're open conflict
is something that's just in his peoples
and if we do that as was described for a
series of services to veterans so legal
services human services where it's
helping them have gained house helping
them gain the skills to be successful in
employment skills that help them
overcome the disabilities they couldn't
based on economic family estrangement
and many other factors that sometimes
combined the force veterans it's a small
percentage but on significant number of
those to experience that homelessness
and in any time of the year but most
acutely here this time of year when the
weather conditions in boston
in many parts of the country are so
severe homelessness it is something that
no person who has served their country
we feel should experience veterans are
no more deserving of any than any other
person but we think they are especially
deserving one of the advantages of
having a campaign end homelessness among
veterans is to in fact come up with the
broader templates of social services in
our society and even around the world so
that homelessness overall for all the
citizens of this country and the
citizens of this world do not have to
experience that also so thank you very
much for your support
oh now I like to welcome back
secretary-general to make closing
remarks
before it closed these ceremonies I just
want to take a moment and dedicated to
our director general cody smith cody
