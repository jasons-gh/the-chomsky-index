it was great benevolent
purposes was to shift Europe engine
from cold oil Europe and Japan both had
indigenous coal resources but if they
switch to oil in there under US control
so al are I think about 2 billion out of
the 13 billion Marshall Plan dollars
were four went straight to the oil
companies to try to give them free you
know make it make them able to help
convert Europe and Japan to oil based
economies and that makes sense to is it
a technique of path or power its
enormous significance to control you
know to control the resources and you
know this is expected to be the main
resource for the next couple of
generations I do they're interesting and
if you're interested the the National
Intelligence Council which is a
collection of the various intelligence
agencies published a projection in the
year 2000 it's called global trends 2015
you can pick it up in the internet it's
under the I think it's under the CIA
listing on the internet and it's nothing
terribly surprising about it but it's an
interesting document and they predict
for the next 50 years that the Persian
Gulf oil will be increasingly important
in the world energies you know
industrial system and that the u.s.
won't rely on it the US will use you
know Atlantic Basin resources but it's
got a controller of course and and they
expect instantly they also make the
interesting prediction that terrorists
want to increase and it's going to
increase as a result of globalization
and you know they really have it
straight they say what what they call
globalization is going to lead to a
widening economic divide and a lot of
just the opposite of what economic
theory predicts supposed to lead the
convergence but they're realists they're
not studying in MIT Economics Department
and that lead to a widening economic
divide and they say that's going to lead
to increase
disorder and tension and hostility and
violence a lot of it directed against
the United States in other words terror
because you don't have more people who
are dispossessed and you know gonna be
angry and who knows what they'll do so
you have more military planning
