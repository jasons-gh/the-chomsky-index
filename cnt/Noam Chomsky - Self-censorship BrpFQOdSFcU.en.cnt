why is why does the control the public's
feelings wonder what's the mechanism by
which the government influences the
media to control or I mean the
government has on my show but so how
does it happen like why I mean well
what's your like and it's like as
motivation is that this kind of
assessment how does the how does the
expose somebody ask how does the
government convince General Motors to
try to increase profit the media are a
huge corporations which have the suite
which share the interests of the
corporate sector that dominates the
government the government can't tell the
media what to do they don't have the
power to do it here let me give you a
simple example really simple when the
you know the current Intifada started in
how in the occupied territories started
on September 29th ok October 1st
two days later Israel started using US
helicopters there are no Israeli
helicopters they all come from here
started using US helicopters to attack
civilian targets apartment complexes and
so on killing and wounding dozens of
people that went on for two days no no
Palestinian fire stone torn from kids on
October 3rd after two days of this
Clinton made the biggest deal in a
decade to send military helicopters to
Israel the media here refused to publish
it to this day there has not been a
report that was a decision of editors
like you know I happen to know the
editors of the Boston Globe I've been
living there for 35 years I know all
these guys I actually went and talked to
them and they simply made it clear
they're not gonna publish it and the
same decision was made by every other
newspaper in the United States the
government literally everyone the
database search the only reference to it
in the country was a letter to the
editor in Raleigh North Carolina
now the government how long not to
publish it no if it had told them not to
they probably would have published it
just that I've been indignation you know
that happens to be an unusually narrow
and easily identifiable case but it
generalizes
