when I it's time for night waves with
Phillip Dodd yesterday was a day of
strange meetings full of unexpected
moments two interviews one with Noam
Chomsky to some commentators the world's
most famous public intellectual the
other with Anthony Selden historian of
contemporary Britain and master of
Wellington College a college founded in
1859 two very different figures one
profoundly skeptical of Authority
another by dint of his title its
upholder both interviewees up ended my
expectations at moments I had presumed
an explosive Noam Chomsky here to give
the Edouard side lecture on the Middle
East
spitting ly anti-american capable of
Manichaean judgments of good and of evil
it turned out rather different Noam
Chomsky is now 84 and he came initially
to prominence over fifty years ago as a
major new voice in linguistics but from
the 1960s onwards he has become a
perhaps now the dissenting voice in the
u.s. damming his country for what he
sees as its crimes from Vietnam to its
support of Israel Noam Chomsky comes
from an activist American Jewish
immigrant family so no surprise how he
has developed but what is arresting is a
sentence in an early 1967 essay
resistance where he speaks of his innate
distaste for activism odd for an
American whose global reputation rests
exactly on his activist writings and
actions I said when we met in a small
bedroom in some Pancras Hotel in London
yesterday if the world would go away I'd
be happy to do work this intellectually
challenging and exciting but the world
doesn't go away
so you're compelled to do things that
wouldn't be my choice I'm kind of
Herman basically was there a moment when
you made the choice how do you think the
choice was made for you do you think
history gave you this role whether you
like it or not I thought about it I mean
I first of all I hadn't been a youth
activist so I knew what was involved but
the period of the 1950's it was a kind
of a quiet period not much was happening
and I was mostly doing my work you know
writing and so on by about 1960 or 61
we're beginning to ferment in various
domains civil rights Vietnam War other
issues and I did make a very conscious
choice I mean I was aware that when you
put your toe in it pretty soon you're
going to be immersed so it's nothing
that you could do a little bit of if you
serious about it and I had a kind of a
nice life
you know I young family had a tenured
University position at a place that I
liked a lot feels was developing very
well and I understood very well that
things like you love things do what I
want to do it well I've made a choice it
was a very conscious choice
what was your instinctive distaste I'm
interested in that this is a kind of
psychological thing for you is it you
don't like it's the same distaste that
keeps me from going to parties I just
don't feel comfortable with big groups
you know rather be alone or the library
with one or two friends or something
like that goes back all the way I want
to talk about going back if we can in
two ways your linguistic work but also
in the way I think your political work
comes out of a loyalty to the
Enlightenment I know nobody more than
you who's committed yourself to the kind
of clear light of reason from this
sixties on what is that a fair
description would be happy to consider
myself a child of the Enlightenment if I
could go back to
some period in history and my next
existence it might be say hidden Berlin
during Scottish enlightenment be nice to
meet David Hume Adam Smith what would
you say to them that's a good question I
would tell him that as I say our
national character was terrible although
for the time not too bad I'd love to
hear humans response to that I suppose
what I feel is you know in those early
sixties I say so those mid 60s essays
you you planted your flag about reason
you've kept going with reason and one
way of reading the last 40 years and
some of the times were new writeable
they've been all kinds of defeats you
know in the occupied book which was
published last year you say the
objective conditions may be worse than
they were in the 30s how much has your
belief in reason been eroded by history
not at all whatever happens doesn't
affect the question of whether you
should try to deal with the world
rationally or irrationally I don't see
that as a choice but you know there is a
there's a response to that says if the
world does not respond to reason and I
always think you wouldn't I think you
were about 40 in 1968 so you're not a
sixty-eight guy you're not at all the
eruption of the surrealist unconscious
into everyday life is it wasn't fact I
didn't like the music didn't like the
noise I like the young people they're
good people but I couldn't be part of
what they were doing reason overrides
every moment in history does it your
loyalty to it it just it has to be if
you care about human beings and their
fate and you want to do something to
help them or if you care about
discovering significant aspects of the
universe or human nature or whatever it
may be you have no choice
it's either be rational and maybe make
some progress or be irrational make
things worse okay they know what to ask
one of the reasons I like the collection
of essays on occupy you bring into a
back into American discourse the word
that sometimes hard to find which is
class and you say very clearly that
occupy is arguably the first major
eruption of class feeling the 1% in the
99% in 30 years you were a child of the
30s in certain kinds of ways now I
suppose I tell myself reason didn't in
the first instance
make him feel loyalty a class you don't
feel loyalty class the rational reason
the reason I feel a duty and
responsibility to people who are
suffering and need help needlessly and
whom we can do something about now it
happens that that's a class related
choice but it need not be class and the
indigenous people I mean I've spent time
working with poor company knows in
southern Colombia whose lives are being
destroyed by mining fumigation terror I
don't know what class they are they're
just indigenous people that for
Colombians company knows and the same
elsewhere I go to a refugee camp and say
they root and see the conditions under
which people live the effort to do
something for them is not a class
related matter but it happens that in
industrial societies like air is
relatively rich ones there's there are
very sharp class differentiations which
are suppressed totally brought out so
it's not a matter your politics of what
I would call
identification of what Raymond Williams
might have called social consciousness
this is an individual he says when you
sound to a European most American it's
it's much more an individual rational
response to injustice I think you're
right about the distinction one of the
things I prefer about American culture I
wonder why I ask you now about something
else that you mention in the occupy book
which is a at one moment you say given
the decimation of American industry you
mentioned that Obamas sending its
Minister of State over to Spain to order
high-speed trains and you say this could
easily have been done in the Rust Belt
it was particularly striking because I
forget whether I said it there but this
was at the time when Obama had largely
nationalized the auto industry and there
were some choices one choice the one
that was taken was to reconstruct it
with public funds and support and hand
it back to pretty much the old owners
maybe different faces but the same class
and have it continue to do what it's
been doing in the past there were other
choices that one choice for example
would have been to hand it over to the
workforce in the communities and help
them produce things that are needed in
the country I'm it's an absolute scandal
that you can go from say China to cause
I was done in a high-speed rail but you
can't go from Boston to New York and I
mean real it's harmful to people it's
harmful to the economy it's maybe good
for car manufacturers and energy
industries and banks and so on but that
could have been done and that would have
also had in mighty other kind of a
revolutionary impact and bringing about
changes in the nature of the society
healthy changes there is another
response to that and I'm going to now
you're now going to play European and
North American for the mayor
however long it lasts the defense there
of American workers which is entirely
honorable neglects of course that one of
the consequences of the outsourcing by
capitalism it's what Marx as you would
know would call a contradiction
it's the raising of between three and
four hundred million Chinese peasants
from absolute poverty into some kind of
living standard and capitalism is very
complex I don't think it does that I'm
all in favor of raising the Chinese
workforce the decent standards but I say
that we should do with the way that they
want not the way the management of Apple
wants and it happens to be very
different so at Foxconn say there's
constant strike others labor actions
constantly huge number of strikes trying
to get decent working conditions and
they're getting no the barely twenty
percent in the last year he's basically
going from virtually from heart to
slightly less are so I'd say yes that's
what we should be engaged and it's not
capitalism into doing it it's the
struggle against capitalism and I think
yes we shouldn't be part of that but I
suppose what I'm saying is to send us so
much of your thoughts on the American
working class and I know you're American
I don't I'm just I've written about
Chinese workers and their struggles and
what we should do about them I mean I
from where I'm sitting in Boston I can't
do much about the labor actions and self
self western China I can write about
them talk about them and so on but I
think we should support them and there's
nothing to do with exporting jobs we can
historically it has been you and I may
not like it all you may not like it I'm
dispassionate because in my
circumstances but that's what's happened
well look a lot of things have happened
for example genocide that doesn't mean
I'm in favor of it but now that goat
analogy is a good analogy with there are
things there are things that are
happening all over I think we would like
to see them happen differently so we
should therefore
act in such a way as to help them happen
differently if there are massive labor
struggles in China yeah we should help
them and if it turns out that
rearranging the job choices will help
them okay
but there is a question who makes those
decisions I mean it's not up to me it's
not up to the management of Apple it's
up to the workforce and the communities
those communities not have to be global
that's where you and I fine that's why
that unions are called international
through that reason yes has to be global
and Wednesday the United Steelworkers
begins to make an arrangement with
Mondragon and the Basque Country I think
that's good idea who's going to make the
decisions and for what purpose
those are the questions I think the
decisions will be made democratically
not autocratically and they ought to be
designed not for profit but for need and
for decent human lives how do we get
from its two alt how do we get from
where we are because the problem for the
left of which distinguished plenty of
ways I mean we just mentioned one for
example if there had been a powerful
occupy type movement a popular movement
in the United States at the time of the
this nationalization of the auto
industry and they're going to Spain if
there had been such a movement a foot of
pressed for quite a different response
that happens all the time like I think I
forget whether I mentioned there but
right about the same time and the Occupy
there's a talk they were given in the
Boston Occupy movement and I brought up
cases right in bought near Boston towns
where workers were attempting to take
control take over a profitable
enterprise that the multinational their
own doesn't wanted to get rid of and the
multinational preferred to get rid of it
not to allow it to be worker managed and
I said look this is something we can get
involved in right now and I agree but
you've just used that most complex of
tenses and I now speak to a linguist
which is the subjunctive
okay if if so the big question therefore
let's construct the movements which
you'll be able to do it and they are
doing it you believe no I'm Unitas
that's really what I'm asking you
you know occupy is there but you really
believe it's doing it one of the things
that keeps tolling through your you're a
good thirties man because you believe in
hard work whenever you speak to people
you always say it's got to be hard work
it's got to be long it's difficult there
are lots of defeats on the way it's hard
to think from the time you began your
activism that we're getting nearer are
we getting further away history goes in
many directions so in many respects the
United States England other countries
are a lot more civilized than they were
in the 1960s that's because of activism
in some ways there's there's been a
reaction to that in some ways there's
regression okay that turns it backwards
but it's not a simple matter that's the
way progress is made the slow difficult
professional always if there's any other
way I've ever heard so revolution isn't
on the agenda slow painful complex
reform this revolution could be on the
agenda if great mass of the population
that's subjunctive again well you're
asking when revolution could be on the
agenda and there's a condition for it
the condition is if it's going to be a
constructive revolution not a revolution
towards some kind of dictatorship
orthography it can happen constructively
when a large mass of the population
understands recognizes that they cannot
achieve just goals that they want within
the current framework of instances that
takes us very nicely sometimes broadcast
to say that takes us very nicely to the
Middle East which is why you yeah here
in London do you think what is happening
in the Middle East is some kind of
transformative moment because you're
over here wearing effect you're still
saying
I want us to come onto that that the US
and its allies still play a very big
role enormous less than they did I was
going to say did they play now the
determining role one might argue that
they played 30 years ago no no in fact a
u.s. power has been declining since 1945
American power reached its peak at the
end of the Second World War the US had
half the world's wealth other industrial
societies were devastated the security
was unimaginable
and there were plans to reconstruct the
world under the American Aegis very
detailed plans they were then
implemented Marshall Plan was part of it
but by 1949 it was falling apart and you
know the response to that since American
powers been declining since 49 wise Noam
Chomsky spent the best parts of his life
railing against a declining power I'm
not really against the declining power
I'm the railing against the crimes that
he carries out buddy not in faith not
against the decent things that it does
and yes it's quite still by far the most
overwhelmingly the most powerful country
in the world and they take the Middle
East it's interesting to compare it with
what happened in Latin America over the
past ten years you go back 20 years ago
Latin America was what was called the
backyard completely under control if
anything got out of control
he was invaded put in a dictatorship the
major story the last roughly 10 or 15
years the Latin America has extricated
itself from the system of external
domination first European and American
to a remarkable extent actually it was a
striking illustration of that just a
couple of weeks ago even perhaps the
study by the Open Society Institute of
rendition called globalizing tortures
and globalised torture campaigns you
been running while other countries
participate and it was a study of the
countries that participated most of you
are a Middle East that's where the
torture was going on you sent them to
dictatorships Asia and Africa one region
was totally out nothing
Latin America which is remarkable
first because Latin America had been
just taken for granted as utterly
subordinate to the US but also during
this long period the Latin America was
one of the torture centers of the world
but now they won't participate that's an
uprising and the u.s. I'm sure of
British planners are deeply concerned
that the circle may not country's Middle
East North Africa might move in the same
direction what I was going to say when
you say it's it's the most important
player it's not the most important
player in Egypt as it was once under
Mubarak after all Obama took a long time
to sign up to the ante I mean there's a
standard procedure when your favorite
dictators in trouble dozens of cases
Somoza and Marcos so hard your long list
what you do is you support them as long
as possible when it becomes impossible
because say the army turns against him
you send him off somewhere you it
doesn't look at Barack is being sent
anywhere soon he's just as a person he's
gone and but the next thing that you do
of course issue ringing declarations
about your love of democracy but the
next thing you do is try to restore the
old order as much as possible and that's
just what's happening I didn't think the
Muslim Brotherhood anytime soon are
going to become a puppet for American
imperialism and you don't that's not
really true well you do believe it's not
what Mubarak wasn't a puppet for
American imperialism either he was
carrying out the kind of programs that
he wasn't approved of for example the
neoliberal economic programs and the
Brotherhood's doing the same thing
so yes Mubarak for example was punishing
the people of Gaza
morsi's doing the same thing so it's
it's not a matter of the you know
somebody holding a puppet by a noose
support harsh regimes or any kind of
regime if they're doing the kind of
things you like then it seems to me
you're still I liked what you said
earlier much better but that's my
privilege and yours to disagree which is
that American powers been declining it
Ranieri and then power it's not
different it's just it's declining and
it's still overwhelming there's no what
is he doing a what can it do or what
should be do in Syria in Syria well I
think it's clear what it shouldn't what
it actually is doing and she's not doing
in Syria it's probably pretty much the
right stand it could give humanitarian
aid like there been a lot of pledges of
humanitarian aid and they simply haven't
gone through and there's no
justification for that it's desperately
needed on the other end what Britain and
France are doing my view is likely to
make it worse
for the reasons that have been discussed
by just about everyone who knows very
well Patrick Coburn a couple days ago
Charles glass Jonathan Steele others
well this is one of those few moments
when America is preferable to Britain
and friends not the only one Britain and
France I have a horrible records I want
you to last questions if I may and they
relate to your stance more generally and
I one since you're here in London you
know you've made loyal the notion of
freedom of expression you've got into
all kinds of trouble because of freedom
of expression today the British
Parliament will vote on statutory
legislation for the media would you be
in favor of it I'm an American again I
do believe in freedom of expression
there's got no bounds oh yeah everything
has bounced there
absolute moral principles but I think it
carries any limitations on it carry a
very strong burden of proof and in
written in my view it's scandalous not
the lightest in in inquiry things like
the British libel laws or international
scandal in my opinion and they've been
used to shut down newspapers to silence
people I mean I can see myself when if I
have a book that's being published in
the United States and it's gonna appear
in England since it's going to appear in
England has to go through a battery of
lawyers to see if it's gonna violate
these crazy liable for so you can change
certain things but you wouldn't have
staked statutory regulation for the
media it defends your Americanism isn't
it you have to see exactly what the
regulation is I don't say I don't think
you can state an absolute principle but
there's some things that journals
shouldn't do with just how that should
be controlled is another question I
quote I mean because you know you've got
yourself into a lot of trouble in the
seventies writing an essay in a book by
someone who denied the Holocaust and the
reason you argue things you thought he
had the right to say well actually first
of all I didn't get into a lot of
trouble I got into no trouble secondly I
got into trouble with some of the
friends oh yeah they didn't like it
secondly I didn't write anything for the
book and thirdly the book didn't deny
the Holocaust so we should first get the
data correct okay but for Esau was a
Holocaust denier he at that time it
wasn't even raised in fact he came to
trial a couple of years later and he was
condemned was outrages but the issue of
Holocaust denial didn't even come up you
I suppose the issue I'm asking you okay
let's make it subjunctive okay say
suppose somebody else yes I do it all
the time right in the United States in
the United States in my view fortunately
there are the University professors with
tenure I could name I feel like who
write a big hardcover books widely
published denying the Holocaust and
nobody pays the slightest attention
I think that's pray and if there were
any attempt to suppress them of it
affected this individual but you can see
it sticks in the karora of the uu
European this commitment to a kind of
individual position I want to ask you a
last question if I may which is the
question of authority I dug out from
King Lear Leah's great quote when he's
only he's there thou mounts behold the
great image of authority a dogs obeyed
in office where does Authority life U is
it purely in the individual conscience
determined by rationalist it's very much
like freedom of speech Authority
hierarchy and domination I have a burden
of proof they have to demonstrate their
legitimacy they are not self-justifying
if there is any structure of hierarchy
and domination whether it's in a
patriarchal family and international
society anywhere in between it has to
justify itself sometimes it can so for
example if I'm walking down the street
with my granddaughter three-year-old
granddaughter and she starts to run into
the street and I grabbed her hand and
pull her back that's coercive Authority
but I think I can give a justification
for it most times you can't give a
justification and when it can't it ought
to be dismantled
one last question do we start by you
saying you have no choice
in the sense history determines that you
took the well you did you took a choice
but history kind of pushed you there one
of the things and this is the American
in you again I always feel your great
strength is that sense that you can you
can volunteer for things I think there's
less much less in you which is the
European of how your volunteered for
things how you're determined men make
history that's the first part of the
sentence which Americans understand but
not in the conditions of their own
making is the second part which
Europeans and
do you really think you can your role is
a voluntary one it's chosen for all of
us
the same in Europe if M L Zola wanted to
defend Dreyfus that was a choice he
wasn't forced to do it
if Bertrand Russell decided to oppose
the First World War and go to jail and I
was a choice a lot of things happen I
mean take the American civil rights
movement 1965 and voter rights I did
Lyndon Johnson lead the troops no did
Martin Luther King lead the troops no
what happened was there was things like
young couple of black kids sitting at a
lunch counter Freedom Riders young
Freedom Riders going through the South
to try to register voters or brutal and
bitter mass demonstrations and then that
created that a situation in which
individuals could appear who would
articulate what was happening as Martin
Luther King did very effectively
where is Noam Chomsky in the resistance
you see there towards the back is he at
the side is he at the front there was a
popular resistance movement going on I
participated in it the way I could I
couldn't do it the way I say an 18 year
old was I couldn't refuse to go to fight
in Vietnam so it wasn't the right age
but I can do other things and in fact
you know ended up pretty close to a long
prison sentence but not participating
the way the people in the league were
participating I didn't get exiled for
the rest of my life you know as many
young people did yeah Noam Chomsky and
if you want to see and here is Edward
side lecture you can find out details on
the night waves website the lecture took
place last night you're listening to
night waves with me Philip Todd in a
special edition where I consult
authorities about power reason
and ethics
