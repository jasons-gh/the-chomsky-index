have you been watching what Elon Musk
has been doing he's got a company called
neuro-link where they want to plug in
some electrodes into your brain and then
tap right into your thoughts and I'm
wondering if you look at this technology
would you ever think that language is
archaic technology and would you ever
think that maybe language is what
separates us from connecting with what
we all are which is humans having a
human experience is that ever something
you've contemplated because I know your
work has been in linguistics this is
complete science big forget about it not
within I mean almost nothing is
understood about how the brain processes
language you can there are things that
can be done and they're getting a huge
amount of publicity but they're
essentially meanings it's PR so for
example is a lot of publicity about the
fact that what's called deep learning
you know use of supercomputers to work
on huge amounts of data very quickly
then they can pretty well do things like
say making a good guess if you're
writing something they're predicting
what the next word might be if you have
there's some program for annoying
programs that you have on a computer
which tells you guesses what the next
word is going to be if you'd write
something and that's considered a
profound and discovery you know we've
invented discovered creativity exactly
zero significance totally insignificant
I mean you can if you tried this in say
it you looked at scientific experiments
if you looked at billions of scientists
a chemistry experiment and you take a
the sequence of events that take place
you could predict pretty well what the
next thing is gonna be you mix these two
chemicals might turn blue is that
chemistry I mean it's nothing no this is
public relations for them IBM
but you see or I mean their articles in
serious journals New York another great
discovery total the euro I mean almost
nothing is understood about how the
brain computes in fact we don't even
there's a good evidence that what people
are looking at isn't even the right
thing the models that are developed say
it Silicon Valley and those are based on
neural nets and of course neural nets
are there and they do something but
there's pretty good evidence that
they're not what's involved in retinal
computation this is at the moment
critical voices among scientists people
probably like there's a lot of reasons
to believe in it you know just looking
for any place
