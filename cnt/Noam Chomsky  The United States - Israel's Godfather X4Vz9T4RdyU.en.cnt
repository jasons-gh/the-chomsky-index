thank you all for coming together for
this now we are gracious to have an
excellent panel weather with us here
tonight and I'm going to turn over the
microphone right now to back to Tom
Arabia from the ISO to move on with the
program as I'm sure that we're eager to
hear what they have to say and not waste
any more time on this thank you so much
and of course professor Noam Chomsky
so I can go on with the introduction of
Noam Chomsky I in fact I'll just let him
take it from here thank you know there
are quite a range of topics to talk
about a lot of complex issues I have a
few minutes I don't speak too long and
I'll just pick two topics and try to
focus on them a couple of words about
something else the two topics are I'm
not going to talk about the atrocities
that took place in the last few weeks
I'm sure you're quite familiar with that
one question has to do with the
legitimacy of the US Israeli invasion
and we should bear in mind crucially
that it's a us-israeli invasion we're
critically involved at every level so
one has to do with its legitimacy the
second question has that I want to talk
about has to do with the reasons for it
now the two are intertwined so what I
say won't be entirely separate
segregated but i'll try to do it
systematically as far as the legitimacy
is concerned it's almost universally
assumed in commentary that us that the
invasion is legitimate it's criticized
as being a disproportionate but it's
legitimate because obviously estate has
the result to defend itself against
attacks from the outside well that this
certain level of truth to that argument
yes a state has a right to defend itself
from attack but this argument moves very
quickly to another position namely that
a state has the right to defend itself
by force
tax from the outside and nobody believes
that if that's supposed to be the
principal it's I think universally
rejected so no one agrees that say Nazi
Germany had a right to defend itself
against by force against the terror of
the partisans in occupied Europe nobody
i suspect very few people here or around
us would believe that the British had
the right to defend themselves by force
against George Washington's army and the
reasons are obvious in both cases they
had no reason to be there in the first
place so therefore I have no right of
Defense by force and there was there was
an easy way to defend themselves put a
stop to the atrocities and the invasion
and the aggression and when that option
is available you just don't have the
right to defend yourself by force or
picks a useful analog take the British
in Northern Ireland I mean I are a
terror was certainly criminal and the
British had a right to defend themselves
from it how not by violence not by
terrorizing the Irish Catholic community
but by addressing the grievances that
led to the violence when they finally
began to do so the terror stop and you
can think of case if the case like that
so the universal agreement that Israel
had a right to defend itself by force is
not only wrong but it's transparently
wrong wrong on the basis of principles
that virtually everyone accepts well
there's plainly a if that reasoning is
correct there's plainly in a crucial
educational problem to face bring people
to understand that by their own
principles their conclusions are
absolutely
and the reasonings not profound nothing
deep about it it's all on the surface
well this turn two reasons what were the
reasons for the attack there's an
official reason it was given for example
by a hood Barack that's minister who
said Israel's had lost patience with the
rocket attacks and therefore had to
invade that of course and that's
accepted almost universally then their
debates about proportionality but that
has the same fallacy you have to show
that reaction by force to rocket it you
have a right to defend yourself from
rocket attacks early but it takes
another step in the argument to show
that you have the right to defend
yourself by force against rocket attacks
as in the examples I mentioned the
numerous others and to show that you
have to show that there were no peaceful
alternatives to doing soon well but then
happily true there are plenty of
peaceful alternatives all come to the
mid a minute other there has been
further debate about the discussion
about the reasons one commonly proposed
argument which i think is accurate is
that Israel had to overcome the what
they call the lessons of the failed
lebanon war in 2006 when israel lost
what's called credibility its deterrent
capability to put that in simple English
it had lost the ability to intimidate
its adversaries into submission by the
threat of extreme violence and they had
to recover that capability it was
probably a factor as for the timing
probably had to do mostly with the
Israeli elections in fact it's coming up
in a couple of weeks one Israeli
commentator calculated at the
beginning of the war that for every 40
Palestinians killed Barack gained one
parliamentary seat I'm not sure his
arithmetic was exactly right but the
principle is to compare the poles and
the casualties comes out more or less
like that but none of that gets to the
reasons i think the reasons are
different and much deeper the reasons
have two are pretty much explicit they
were explained by a hood Omar homered
the prime minister but right here in the
United States and mate 2006 he gave a
speech to a joint session of Congress
rousing ovation when he explained two
points one principle and other
implementation of it the principal he
said is that the historic right of the
Jewish people to the Land of Israel the
camp is beyond challenge rousing ovation
as a corollary to that the the original
population doesn't have a right there
and in fact the US and Israel just took
that position formerly at the United
Nations once again at Lex last month was
in December their series of UN
resolutions that were passed mostly by
about the same vote something like you
know 172 3 or something like that this
one past 173 25 it was on the right of
Palestinians to self-determination the
five against were United States Israel a
couple of Pacific Islands you know
that's the usual usual vote in the
United Nations and as usual it doesn't
get reported so for example also
unreported was the fact that there was a
resolution on the right to food huge
problem billion people facing starvation
far worse than the financial crisis but
of course that you know deals with what
one British diplomatic historian called
the unpeopled the ones who are different
from us you know so not discussed much
the vote on that was unanimous with one
vote against namely the United States
there was a vote on arms traffic the
United States is by far the biggest arms
trafficker this was to regulate the arms
traffic in 2006 the united states voted
against that alone this time it had
company a zimbabwean so there's two of
us vote against none of this obviously
can get reported but the one in the
Palestinians is interesting no right of
self-determination and that's a
corollary to the conclusion that the
historic rights of Israel to the land of
the Jewish people to the Land of Israel
are beyond question to go together
actually if you look at the colloquy at
the United Nations there were various
excuse but rather pathetic excuses as to
why the US had the vote that way but you
can go into that so that's one that's a
principle then comes the question of
implementation and omair also at the
same time made 2006 explained the
implementation it's the program that he
called convergence Israel does not want
to take over there were sections and
still are sections in Israel that want
to take over the entire West Bank but
the more rational people understand that
that's a problem it's leads to what's
called the demographic problem there'll
be too many Palestinians and
in the state and if it's at all
democratic it won't be a Jewish state so
you have the problem of how to keep the
Jewish state while taking over what you
want in the West Bank and on the side
it's not in question that all of the
actions in the West Bank are illegal in
violation of the foundations of
international humanitarian law the
Geneva Conventions in fact the Israeli
government was informed of that in 1967
by its own top legal representatives
including Justice Minister so that it's
been ratified by the International Court
of Justice the World Court and a
unanimous decision including including
the US Justice so there's no real debate
about that everything that's going on
there is criminal and the US as a as was
caught with a high contracting party to
the Geneva Conventions has the legal
responsibility of acting to prevent it
not doing so is also criminal and
directly abetting it by economic
military ideological the means is
multiply criminal so the criminality of
all these actions in Washington and Tel
Aviv is not in question but it's
accepted universally that somehow that's
okay the in other words the United
States is regards itself as an outlaw
state it said the commentators
intellectuals media accept that and that
right of being an outlaw state is
inherited by its clients so the issue of
criminality is not off the agenda how do
you go about taking what you want in the
occupied territories without running
into the Democrats
problem well there's a way traces way
back to nineteen sixty-seven it's taken
various forms since all Marik's version
was that Israel should an X everything
within what's called the separation wall
annexation wall actually it should
proceed as it's been doing to take over
the Jordan Valley that's about a third
of the West Bank it'll that imprisons
what's what's inside versus really has a
total control the air and Shawn but
what's inside the imprisoned part has to
be broken up into Canton's you take a
look at the settlement map there are two
cents active three Saiyans that cut
through the West Bank from the part that
Israel annex within the separation wall
up to the Jordan Valley one goes east of
Jerusalem what's called Jerusalem is
illegally annexed but illegally annexed
by in violation of security council
resolutions that go back 40 years but
the US accepts it so it's okay by knotts
greater Jerusalem much expanded to the
east of it there's a town of the main
which was developed mostly in the
Clinton years with the purpose of
bisecting the West Bank and the North
third to other state ends one go to the
town of arielle the other thing that you
mean that breaks up what's left and then
there's what a complex network of
checkpoints and barriers and so on which
have no security function except in the
sense that they undermine the
possibility of any civilized life for
the animals that are wandering around
and the rest of the territory
well that proceeding in that way Israel
could take over what's valuable for it
in the West Bank the arable land the
pleasant suburbs around the Jerusalem
Tel Aviv the water resources have
control of the Jordan Valley fertile
area and also prisons everything and
everything else that goes through and it
doesn't have any responsibility for the
Palestinian what will happen to them
well as made pretty clear right at the
beginning of the occupation by actually
the person who was clearest was Moshe
Bayon who was the defense minister in
charge of the occupied territories and
among the leadership perhaps the person
most sympathetic to the plight of the
Palestinians he recognized it and
understood and his position was that
what we're doing to you the Palestinians
is very much like a Bedouin who kidnaps
the young woman and forces her to marry
him and ultimately she'll accept it so
ultimately you'll accept what we're
doing to you and you otherwise as he put
it you will live like dogs and those who
want to leave can leave and we'll see
where that goes nothing secret about
this public record from 1967 and it's
implemented since it's not words
repeated in one or another form and it's
implemented those are the settlement
programs the development programs which
you and I pay for in a lot of ways not
just financially but militarily
diplomatically in other ways well that's
the way to implement the historic right
of the Jewish people to all of Palestine
without running into the feared
demographic problem there's also the
problem of the the
Palestinian city the non-jewish citizens
of Israel mostly are that can be handled
in various ways that one way in fact was
just proposed by the Electoral
Commission a couple of weeks ago it
banned participation of the arab parties
in the coming election now that's
unlikely to stand the courts I think are
not likely to let that stand it's too
blatant to avert the violation violation
of minimal democratic practice but in
one way or another they can be
marginalized and kept out and this
further plan which is accepted it pretty
much across the spectrum and that is
that means have to be found to encourage
the Palestinian Arab citizens to leave
decisions of Israel to leave either by
direct transfer or buy weight with every
drawing borders so that the heavily
settled parts of say the Galilee will be
transferred into one of those segregated
Canton's that'll be could be called a
Palestinian state someday meaningless
for those are ways of practically
implementing the the program of the dual
program of recognizing the the historic
rights of the Jewish people are beyond
to the entire land or beyond question
and doing it in such a way that it can
be
free from the demographic problem the
dangerous problem of having non-jews in
a Jewish state those are not just
proposals and they're being implemented
every day going on constantly well those
proposals can be implemented only if
there's no resistance to them now in the
west bank by now there's very little
resistance because of Israeli violence
which which has indeed subdued
population and by now because of
collaborationist Palestinian forced I'm
sure you know Israel's the United States
with its allies the Arab dictatorships
that Jordan Egypt have trained security
forces Fatah security forces whose main
task is to subdue the population so if
Evan if they have a demonstration you
know against the atrocities and in Gaza
and instead of the Israeli army going in
they'll do it that's a typical colonial
pattern you know it's the whole history
of colonialism works like that won't run
through the details but it's absolutely
common very common so like say India was
the population was mostly kept under
control by Indian soldiers under British
command just a typical and natural
procedure it Chechnyan today for it's
kept subdued and quiet and developing
and so on under Chechen military forces
the Russians in the background in case
anything goes wrong it's routine and
it's being duplicated in the West Bank
well okay they've pretty much subdued
protest in the West Bank so they can
carry out the policies without
disturbance but they haven't yet subdued
gaza gaza you still have resistance
remember Gaza and the West Bank are one
unit furthermore there are both
occupied there is no question that jazz
is occupied you know even as sane as
early commentators point out that
there's never been a day that it hasn't
been under occupation there's talk about
you know the famous disengagement but
that that was a well-organized scan
hardline hardliners in Israel like Ariel
Sharon the patron saying to the settlers
understood that is completely senseless
to keep several thousand Jewish settlers
in the ruins of Gaza which they'd
already pretty much destroyed taking a
large part of the land and the scarce
resources like water and protected from
you know a million a half people by a
big component of the IDF the Israeli
army that's just crazy so what makes
sense is to essentially transfer them to
valuable territory they've subsidized to
go to Gaza so fine you load them up in
trucks and take them over to be
illegally subsidized in the West Bank
which you want to keep which is what
happened when they announced the
disengagement they also same time
announced new so on programs in the West
Bank most of them went there some went
to the illegally occupied Golan Heights
that's almost all of it this had to be
presented as a trauma a national trauma
because you had to have images on the
front pages of the newspapers about may
remember the Boston Globe pathetic
little boy you know
created pleading with the soldiers not
to take them away and destroying their
homes you can have cries of never again
it's kind of like the Nazis and so on
they all totally faked I mean if they
wanted to remove the settlers there was
nothing easier you could have simply
announced on august first the Israeli
Army's going to leave the ticket Gaza
two days later the people who live there
would have climbed into the lorries
provided for them and quietly gone to
their new subsidized homes and the
illegal the settlements in the West Bank
but then you wouldn't have had a
national trauma you wouldn't be able to
shout never again and so on there's a
lesson lesson in this because it also
has to do with the possibilities of
dealing with the settlements in the
occupied territories in the West the
rest of the occupied territories the
West Bank it's very commonly argued that
if the Israeli army that there's no
possibility of a two-state settlement
because of the Israeli army tried to
forcefully remove the settlers there
would be a civil war and that's probably
true the the religious nationalist
settlers have such a powerful role
inside Israel in particular in the
Israeli army that they might just refuse
to carry especially at the officer corps
many of them obey the rabbi's not the
state alone so yes they might refuse to
do it battles could be a civil war but
there's no reason for any of that to
eliminate the settlements in the West
Bank is a trivial move just withdraw the
Army and the settlers old divide though
many of them are just there because
they're paid to have a decent quality of
life okay so they'll go back and be paid
to be within the borders of Israel there
will be nationalist religious groups
that will fight to hang on to every you
know clod of Earth okay
they can be left to their own devices
they can stay in under Palestinian
Authority or they can leave to but that
doesn't have to be any civil war and
there doesn't have to be any force the
mechanisms are straightforward so that's
not a barrier to proceeding to a
political settlement and this has been
done and the many examples of this just
to take one recent one which was pretty
dramatic but can't be discussed here
because of what it implies the Indonesia
1975 invaded East Timor and it's about
us but what happens about as close to
genocide is anything in the modern
period they killed hundreds of thousands
people maybe a quarter of the population
strongly backed by the United States
also written when they throw cities
mounted others and they swore they were
never going to leave general said it's
part of Indonesia we're going to keep it
nothing the world can do about it well
in September 1999 under by then very
serious international and domestic
pressure Clinton decided that it's
enough he told the Indonesian generals
sorry friends the game is over and they
immediately were through you can't stand
up to the Godfather you know that's it's
just too dangerous so okay that was the
end of that now that's gone down in
history as a humanitarian intervention
by the United States look how
humanitarian we are firstly supported
the invasion of 25 years helped them
destroy the population and then when
just became too much what bothered to us
we told them to call it off okay and
they called it off okay international
affairs is there aren't many principles
of international affairs although
scholars will tell you there are but one
principle that works pretty well is that
international affairs are very much like
the
happy and there's a godfather and you
better obey him or else you're in
trouble and then there are the what are
called the intellectuals who explained
to you that what the Godfather's doing
is humane and just and divine mission
and so on and so forth is pretty much
the way it works and the same could work
in the rest of the occupied territories
well does let's go back to the question
of legitimacy of of the attack are there
peaceful alternatives for Israel when
they're under rocket attack well there
there are alternatives and narrow sense
and also in a broader sense the narrow
sense is sometimes discussed the narrow
alternative is just to accept the
ceasefire okay that would mean ending
the rocket attacks and opening the
border okay crucially opening the border
and there are agreements on paper effect
so in 2005 there was an agreement that
Israel would allow continuous flow
across the borders of the people can at
least survive and there would be no more
violent well a couple of months later in
january 2006 israel back to rejected the
agreement as did the united states and
the reason is the palestinians had
committed a really grave crime they had
Veidt voted the wrong way in a free
election and you don't do that The
Godfather didn't like that so therefore
you have to be punished and meanwhile
the intellectual community has to write
uplifting articles about our yearning
for democracy and so on and so forth
again that's the way international
affairs work and cultural system works
so Israel backed away from the agreement
and since then there's
no acceptance of that truth actually
right before the present invasion latest
invasion December 27th of the political
leader of Hamas halide ma sha proposed
that they go back to the 2005 agreement
ok no need for an invasion Israel didn't
even respond to the recruit to the
request was much better to attack then
you can eliminate try to eliminate the
last resistance to the atrocities that
continue every minute both in Gaza but
more seriously in the West Bank which
they really care about and want to take
over and the way I described so that's a
narrow proposal you can accept the
ceasefire the broader proposal is very
simple except except the accept
international law which is
straightforward you have no right to be
in the occupied territories withdraw and
allow Palestinian national
self-determination in the release
territories that would be the West Bank
and Gaza twenty-two percent of the
former Palace not now on that matter
there is an overwhelming international
consensus and there has been for over 30
years other topics that aren't discussed
here this proposal came to the Security
Council of the United Nations in
january's 1976 it was brought by the
Arab what are called the confrontation
States Syria Jordan Egypt to state
settlement on the international borders
incorporating all the wording of un 242
those of you follow this know that
that's the least in principle that's
what everyone except the right of Israel
and every other state to live in peace
and security within recognized borders
and so on and a Palestinian state and
the release territories well Israel was
bitterly opposed to the
actually carried out an action which
presumably was directed against the UN
its euro bombed Lebanon for no pretext
killing 50 people this kind of reported
here but like a footnote rightly it is
for them that was probably a message to
the United Nations don't fill around
with us and the u.s. vetoed it okay the
godfather two pair of that and there's a
record yeah i'll be over there's a
record ever since it's late i won't run
through it but there is one break in the
record and it's important to recognize
it because it's significant for the
future in january two thousand and one
there was one week of negotiations in
Taba egypt in which Palestinians and
Israelis negotiated top negotiators
dealing with the detailed issues about
borders jerusalem refugees and so on and
they came pretty close to an agreement
in fact in their last press conference
they said if they had a couple of more
days they probably could have reached a
settlement in terms of the international
consensus well israel called off the
negotiations prematurely at the end of
that but 2001 isn't that long ago now
it's not that it's reaching for pie and
sky I mean that can be resumed what's
required is that the Godfather agree to
what aggregate to and ended in Indonesia
1991 to say okay games over and you have
simple ways to proceed to achieve the
international consensus right now the US
and Israel are absolutely isolated on
this Hamas accepted Hezbollah has said
they won't disrupt anything that the
Palestinians accept
Iran is are the same the rest of the
world's in favor of it it's the US and
Israel and the u.s. is the crucial actor
all the way through because of its power
so it's really in our hand and that
means to say one more word on you know
there's a lot of talk about trying to
apply the kinds of tactics that were
used in the case of South African
apartheid but think that through you
know and it's tempting agree now boycott
divestment sanctions think it through
the South African boycott divestment
sanctions were effective after decades
of education and organizing in the 1980s
at a point when Congress was passing
legislation in favor of Boyka barring US
trade mayor's were getting arrested you
know protesting against apartheid the
American corporations were protesting
against it okay at that point people
understood what was going on and you
could have effective campaign and the
same would be true in this case if
people understood what was going on
what's doing you could have that kind of
campaign but this is different you don't
need the campaign if people understood
what was going on you could settle the
problem without that namely by getting
the United States to withdraw its its
rigid extreme rejection ism and I think
that focuses on the task that's really
in front of us it's an educating and
organizing task the one that was carried
out over a long time to lead to you know
overwhelming opposition to apartheid
okay then you can do things about it and
it's not easy and the apartheid case
indicates why so in the 1980s Congress
did legislate an end to us trade with
South Africa the Reagan administration
an in fact trade increased as late as
1988 the Pentagon declared the African
National Congress Nelson Mandela to be
one of the more notorious terrorist
groups in the world it's the 1988 it's
colin powell's Pentagon the in fact you
may know that Mandela was removed from
the terrorist list just a couple of
months ago I guess it was telling too
much of an embarrassment so you know you
have to I mean even if uh you know even
at the time when you really have the
basis for achieving something you got to
compel the US government to go along
with it they've got their own interests
in her own constituency but it can be
done and it was done and it could be
done in this case too but not without a
lot of work
