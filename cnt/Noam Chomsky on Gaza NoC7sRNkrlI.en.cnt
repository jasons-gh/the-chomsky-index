photo captioned a haunting photo Friday
May 11th left Mohammad MIG Dodd shot in
the right ankle Hassan Abu sada Terra
Klugh Bonnie shot in left and right knee
you mean seal me Yousef mom Luke Musa
Abu Hassan teens shot in the thorax and
killed volunteer unknown photographer
shot and wounded and he showed this
photograph that he had that he thought
he was just going to have for a
scrapbook and then realized these were
some of the last days of their lives
what's going on in Gaza right now from
your perspective now young Palestinian
woman a medic who was murdered by a
sniper far from the so-called border
when she was tending to a wounded
patient yes it's hideously ugly but
there's a background as always the
personal background is that Israeli
these Israeli stranglehold on Gaza which
has reduced the life to bear survival
has reached the point where the United
Nations other analysts predict that by
the year 2020 Gaza will literally be
uninhabitable that's 2 million people
half of children of being caged in a
prison carefully controlled savage
restrictions on food on anything that
comes to them to the extent the
fishermen are kept close to shore so
they can't fish the sewage plants have
been destroyed the power plants have
been attacked
the official program official was to
keep Gaza on what was called a diet
barely enough to survive doesn't look
good if they all starve to death notice
that this is occupied territory as
recognized by even by the United States
everyone but Israel so here's a
population kept in a prison and
unoccupied territory fed a diet to keep
them at bare survival constantly used as
a punching bag for what's called what
calls itself the most moral army in the
world now reaching a point where within
a couple of years it will be
uninhabitable yes and in addition to
that you have sadistic acts like highly
trained snipers killing the young
Palestinian woman medic when she's
tending a patient and what the doctor
just described what do we do with it we
actually react to that the United States
has reacted its reacted by very sharply
cutting its funding to the one
organization un raw UN organization that
keeps the population barely alive now
that's our response along with of course
overwhelming support for Israel
providing with the arms diplomatic
support and so on one of the most
extraordinary scandals if that's the
right word and the modern world can we
do something about it sure of course we
can the Gaza should be thriving
Mediterranean paradise has a wonderful
location has agricultural resources
could be marvelous beaches fishing sea
resources even has natural gas offshore
which is not it's not being allowed to
use so there's plenty that can be done
but we've US has preferred under
repeated administrations what much worse
no to as usual support the murderers no
Israel is threatening another strike on
Gaza like what they called Operation
protective edge in 2014 when they killed
well over two thousand people about Oh
around a quarter of that number
children yes they are threatening their
home if you look over the record there's
no time to talk about it now there's a
marvelous book that just came out
incidentally Norman Finkelstein book
Gaza which is about Gaza martyred them
as a definitive study of this but what's
happened since 2005 is pretty
straightforward in the previous
histories ugly enough but in 2005 or
else around other Israeli Hawks
recognized that it didn't make any sense
to keep a couple of thousand Jewish
settlers illegally settling in Gaza
using up most of its resources and
devoting a large part of the Israeli
army to protecting them that was totally
senseless so they decided to move them
from their illegal subsidized
settlements in Gaza to illegal
subsidized settlements and areas that
Israel wanted to keep in the West Bank
at the Golan Heights was framed as a
traumatic event but that was a play for
world opinions basically a joke could
have done it quite easily they pulled
out and I was called a withdrawal but
the remained under total Israeli
occupation just that the army wasn't
inside Gaza was controlling it from the
outside there was a trade agreement
reached in November 2005 between the
Palestinians in Israel on a ceasefire
violence opening Gaza's seaport
rebuilding the the
Airport that is really destroyed opening
the borders so that that could be free
flow between Israel and Egypt and so on
and that agreement lasted a couple of
weeks and that was November in January
of the Palestinians committed a major
crime they ran a free election
recognized to be free and fair only one
in the Arab world but it came out the
wrong way the wrong people one Hamas
Israel once escalated violence tightened
the siege increased the repression
against Gaza imposed the diet of the
u.s. reacted by standard operating
procedure started to organize a military
coup Hamas preempted the military coup
which was an even greater crime violence
u.s. Israeli violence increased the
savagery of the siege increased and so
on and then it goes on like that
repeatedly there's an episode of what
Israel calls mowing the lawn
smash them up they're defenseless of
course then there's a an agreement
reached which Hamas accepts and lives up
to Israel violates it constantly finally
an Israeli escalation of the violation
leads to some Hamas response which
Israel uses as a pretext for the next
episode of mowing the lawn I've reviewed
this Noor Finkelstein revisit and his
book others have that's been the history
since 2005 so yes there might be another
one but now we're reaching a point where
it's almost terminal repeat it's
expected that is the Gaza Strip having
been devastated so savagely over the
years will literally become uninhabited
now there are ways to deal with this
it's not a doesn't take a you know
brilliant scientist to figure it out
it's quite obvious I know the solution
that you say that is very
straightforward and simple very
straightforward live up to the terms of
the November 2005 agreement allow Gaza
to reconstruct open the entry points to
Israel and Egypt rebuild the Seaport
that was smashed destroy every build the
airport that Israel destroyed allow them
to reconstruct the power plants they'd
let them become a flourishing
Mediterranean site and of course permit
remember that the famous Oslo agreements
required explicitly that get the Gaza
Strip and the West Bank be a unified
terror territory and that its
territorial integrity must be maintained
Israel in the United States reacted at
once by separating them okay that's not
law of nature either Palestinian
national rights can be achieved if the
u.s. Israel are willing to accept that
