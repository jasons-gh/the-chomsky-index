there's this huge amount of grassroots
energy donations around getting people
elected who are believed to be able to
give us solutions of the problems that
we face know what do you think focusing
our energy on takes a the Bernie Sanders
campaign which i think is important
impressive he's doing good and
courageous things he's organizing a lot
of people that campaign ought to be
directed to sustaining a popular
movement which will use the election as
a kind of an incentive but then go on
and unfortunately it's not when the
election is over the movements going to
die and that's a serious error um the
only thing that's going to ever ever
bring about any meaningful changes
ongoing dedicated popular movements
which don't pay attention to the
election cycle it's an extravaganza
every four years you have to be involved
in it so fun will be involved in it but
then we go on if that we're done you
could get major changes
