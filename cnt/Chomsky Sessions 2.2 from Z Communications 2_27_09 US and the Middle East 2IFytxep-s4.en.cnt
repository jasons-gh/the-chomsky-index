of course Afghanistan spills over right
away into Pakistan in fact the
distinction between them it's just you
know Imperial decisions I'm in the
British when they were running the place
Pakistan its then part of India they
drew an artificial line the durand line
right through the middle of Pashtun
territory these are tribal areas and the
big tribe is the flesh tones and the
Durand Line just goes right through the
middle so now one side is Pakistan and
the other side is Afghanistan butts of
no interest to them have the same people
it's as if some foreign power drew a
line between you know right down the
middle of Massachusetts and say okay you
stay on this side will run the other
side that's the way they look at it so
they're in these so-called tribal areas
you know there's constant interaction
and if resistance forces are smashed in
the Afghanistan side of course it'll
come from the other side just as under
the Russians I mean under the Russians
pecho are you know main city up in that
Pakistan side was the center of
cia-backed operations that were
gathering radical Islamists from all
over the world to try to kill as many
Russians as possible and I was open at
that time in fact considered noble you
know because after what we're doing so
so if we support Google than Hekmatyar
Reagan's favorite who's gets his kicks
out of throwing acid in the face of
women who are allowed to walk on the
streets okay that's great we're fighting
for liberation now on the other side of
the border is still getting a support
for resistance inside Afghanistan and
Obama's measures are the same kill you
know so send drones to kill people and
it has a fact so the main fighting
recently has been in one province but
your province which is sort of fell out
of control of the Pakistani army you
probably don't care that much money
anyway but it appears from what a few
things we know about it that it may have
been instigated largely by a drone
attack there was a drone attack under
bush which hit a madrassa school and
killed 80 to 85 people I didn't make the
news here you know who cares but it did
in Pakistan and and of course in the
regions they know so yes that's exactly
what specialists predict night you can
sit in California or Las Vegas or
whatever it is and sent a drone to bomb
people but you're inevitably going to
kill civilians and it's inevitably going
to build up resistance an opposition in
fact opposition to us actions in
Pakistan public opposition is
overwhelming I mean the government is
sort of bludgeoned into saying well okay
we'll look the other way but that's
overruling the population and in fact
our man in Pakistan current president is
taking steps which are going to cause
real chaos his supreme court he refuses
to allow the old chief justice to come
back because if he does will be probably
tried for corruption on his main rival
Nawaz Sharif but his own Court has just
ruled him ineligible for running for
office and he's got more support than
Zardari has especially in the Punjabi
areas which are the main area so there's
a protest going on there of this
insurgency in Balochistan I mean the
whole place is kind of on the verge of
collapse and a very dangerous place
nuclear weapons strategic importance and
so on but the use of force I mean a lot
of this is the fault of the Reagan
administration who the Russians were
planning to with trying to withdraw from
Afghanistan we know though that from
internal records with the Reagan
administration one of them in as did
Brzezinski who was like the super hawk
from Carter and claims
pride in the claim that they said a trap
for them drew them in under guard well
maybe maybe not but he and the so called
Team B the group of hawks Richard parole
you know Richard pipes these guys they
wanted the Russians to stay in and they
said why I'm in the CIA chief and
Pakistan said we want to kill Russians
so let her stay in if it destroys
Afghanistan none of our business
meanwhile Reagan supported the dictator
brutal dictator in Pakistan zeal Hawk
who introduced radical Islam ization
through the country with Saudi funds you
know schools we don't teach anything
with the Quran and so on and so forth
that's a lot of the source of the
current radical Islamic based terror all
a lot of its traces right back to Ronald
Reagan whoever was making the decisions
in his administration thought this is
great it tears up Pakistan destroys it
but you know Afghanistan but side issue
well okay now it's there you can't and
you got to deal with it somehow and the
rational way to deal with it i think is
the way say Rubin and Russia suggest or
that's not a radical position this is
foreign affairs after all main
establishment journal and the way
Afghans appear to want from what we know
internal reconciliation moves and
integrate diplomatic initiatives with
the surrounding countries which of
course crucially includes a granite
which is very close relations with the
sections of Afghanistan the order on it
and has actually helped undermine the
Taliban because they hate them you know
but but of course the US strain isolated
rent so and Obama's continuing with it
you know
so I think it's a it's a prescription
for another catastrophe very likely it's
very likely going to escalate as snow
we're particularly go so that's the
centerpiece of foreign policy as far as
the other crucial issue in the Middle
East Israel Palestine is concerned Obama
has made it very clear that he does not
want to switch from us rejection ism he
made it so clear it takes real genius to
overlook it so again if you read
commentary there's discussion of hell
conciliatory he was he has made one
foreign policy declaration namely when
he appointed announced the appointment
George Mitchell as emissary and it's a
good appointment if Mitchell has any
leeway but he was made very clear what
his policies he's praised for having
brought up the Saudi plan favorably Arab
League plan but he was very careful the
way he brought it up the Arab League
plan calls for a two-state settlement
and accord with the international
consensus exactly what they've held her
decades and in that context says okay
we'd even move on to normalization of
relations with Israel Obama brought up
the savuti plan you know congratulated
the Arab League for accepting it then
urged the Arab states to move on to
normalization of relations with Israel
in other words eviscerating the plan
eliminating its contents and just
talking about a corollary well how clear
can you be what he's saying is he's
intelligent person fixes words carefully
so he and his speech writers doubtless
are saying we're not going to accept the
Arab League plan the international
consensus you we would like you to
normalize relations with Israel period
in fact you can see that again in
today's New York Times there's an
article by Ethan Brenner bronner who
onil regarded as a serious reporter he's
practically parents Israel's line most
of the time but it's a it's a laudatory
report on the training of Palestinian
officers in Jordan headed by a US
general and with you as funding and
there's a big picture of them you know
repelling up a building or something if
you read the article carefully he does
mansion but the one thing that these
Palestinian forces have done is prevent
demonstrations in the West Bank in
support of Gazans when they were being
slaughtered by the us-backed invasion
it's their role they're being trained to
be a collaborationist force which will
suppress the Palestinians in the West
Bank ensure that the u.s. chosen figures
will stay in power and that Israel be
able to continue to do it likes in fact
the even mentions there's an Israeli
officer fired the first gun and one of
their
demonstrations of book progress that
made could same steps let's continue
these are the these are the forces that
Bush tried to organize to carry out a
military coup in Gaza well they were big
back Colossus beat them back but
crucially we cannot accept the results
of the democratic election in one of the
few democratic elections in the Arab
world may be the most free instantly led
to punishment by the US and Israel again
a reflection of the extreme distaste for
democracy if it unless it comes out the
right way in which case it's okay and
now it continues we continue to try to
create a paramilitary force which will
somehow overcome the results of the
democratic election and that's hailed as
a great step towards peace I mean again
like I say it takes really genius not to
see what's happening
