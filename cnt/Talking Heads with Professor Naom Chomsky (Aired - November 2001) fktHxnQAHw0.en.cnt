this is NDTV and you're watching
classics hello and welcome to talking
heads as America launches wave after
wave of attacks against Afghanistan the
question many in India in fact all over
the world are asking is where are the
voices of dissent within America well at
a time like this were fortunate enough
to be joined in India by Professor Noam
Chomsky who some described is one of the
fiercest critics of American foreign
policy professor Chomsky teaches
linguistics at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in Boston but
it's really his writing and his lectures
on international affairs u.s. foreign
policy and his constant expose of media
manipulation that has won him a huge
worldwide following professor Chomsky
thank you so much for joining us on
talking heads let's begin with basics
America says that at the moment it's
fighting a war against terrorism I take
it you have problems with all the terms
of that definition well I'm quite happy
to accept the definition of terrorism
that the official definition that one
finds in the u.s. code and in Army
manuals in fact for 20 years I've been
writing about international terrorism
and I constantly use that definition I
think it's the right definition the
terrorism is defined officially as the
paraphrase as the calculated use of
violence typically against civilians
for the purpose of intimidation and
coercion to attain political religious
ideological or other ends that's
terrorism by that and that's a good
definition I agree with it there are
terrorist States there are terrorists
they're non-state terrorist actors and
in fact the State Department has a list
of terrorist States well if we apply
that definition that different
definition can't really be applied and
therefore it's not used so there's a
that's the literal definition the reason
it can't be applied is two reasons one
is it's a virtual paraphrase of
official US doctrine which is called
counterinsurgency or low intensity
conflict if you look at the same army
manuals you find that's defined in
approximately the same way but that's
official policy now the second reason
why it can't be applied is that if you
do apply it it very quickly turns out
that the United States is a leading
terrorist State exactly as you'd expect
of the most powerful state in the world
I mean it's a great analytic error to
describe terrorism as a weapon of the
weak like most weapons it's primarily a
weapon of the strong and always has been
elaborate on that for us professor
Chomsky because that's also being the
subject of one of your recent books
rogue states in which you forcefully
argue that in fact America really
emerges looking at the history of its
foreign policy interventions as a rogue
state in contradiction to the other
countries that America has classified as
rope whether it's Iran or Afghanistan
well I don't really think it's in
contrast in fact I think it's generally
the case that the most powerful states
are the most brutal and the ones that
are able to act as rogue states a rogue
state is after all a state that acts as
he chooses in defiance of international
law and international opinion and other
constraints and who's able to do that
well the most powerful states so if you
go back to the 19th century Britain was
one of the major rogue states in the
latter part of the 20th century the
United States is supreme in these
respects and not surprisingly it behaves
like others I mean Andorra would be a
rogue state if it could get away with it
but it can't you know and the record is
extremely clear on that I mean we can
just take one a ticket take a case
that's totally uncontroversial because
we have the we can appeal to the
decisions of the highest international
authorities the International Court of
Justice and the Security Council of the
United Nations so this is a none
controversial case it has the World
Court has condemned one state for
international terrorism namely the
United States the victim
agua this was not a minor act of
terrorism it left tens of thousands of
people killed and country virtually
destroyed may not recover the Nicaragua
took the case to the World Court they
won at the World Court now the United
States dismissed the decision with total
contempt immediately the US was ordered
to desist from the Terrorism and to pay
reparations reacted by immediately
escalating the war but some would argue
that no country least of all a
superpower like America would take an
attack like the ones of September 11th
lying down without any retaliation so
where do you think America has gone
wrong in the manner in which is
retaliated well there are many of them I
mean you could say the same about in the
garage and certainly Nicaragua but no
means the worst case far from it I
mention it because it's an
uncontroversial case given the decisions
of the highest authorities so how should
Nicaragua have reacted when it was under
terrorist attack that practically
destroyed the country and killed tens of
thousands of people well you know the
way it did react is the way it's
supposed to react it couldn't get
anywhere because it was confronting a
rogue state which happens to be a
dominant rogue state if the u.s. pursued
that course nobody would block there
would be in fact in this particular case
it's kind of striking because the US
could have gotten a Security Council
resolution not for very pretty reasons
but it could have the reason is that the
five states with veto power are all
terrorists eight strong powerful and
violent terrorist States and for their
own reasons they would have supported
the u.s. main in order to gain US
support for their own terrorism
I mean Britain follows the u.s.
reflexively France wouldn't raise any
objections and they have a terrible
record themselves Russia is delighted to
have US support for its massacres and
atrocities in Chechnya a China would be
quite happy in fact is happy to have us
support for its violent repression of
Muslims and the western part of China
there wouldn't have been any veto
but the u.s. didn't want a Security
Council resolution because it wanted to
act like a rogue state it wanted to act
without authorization so there was it
there's a way to proceed I mean I
wouldn't have approved of that Security
Council resolution because of the
reasons for which would have been passed
but there would there have been another
way which is perhaps not not the
airstrikes not the Security Council
resolution which as you say comes repeat
when its own hypocrisy is there the US
could have pursued yes you do what you
do when when it crime takes place and no
matter whether it's a small crime or a
huge crime like if it's a robbery in the
streets or an attack on another country
terrorist attacks like Nicaragua
you try to find the perpetrators you
find present evidence against them and
you try to bring them to justice
actually that's what Nicaragua did it
had no difficulty finding the
perpetrators and finding evidence I
couldn't bring them to justice the US
could do the same thing it chose to do
something different namely not to attack
the perpetrators the people are being
killed in Afghanistan are not terrorists
that's the population of Afghanistan
there's a lot of concentration on what
they call collateral damage the people
who get killed of a bomb goes in the
wrong place
all right that's bad but the reason
there's concentration on it is because
it's very small it's a trivial part of
the atrocities the main atrocities which
are well understood and I've been known
from the beginning are imposing a
conscious and the purposeful imposition
of mass starvation on the huge numbers
of people it may be millions of people
that was the initial decision instantly
these people are going to die of
starvation and already are are not
Taliban they're not supporters of the
Taliban and were victims of the Taliban
