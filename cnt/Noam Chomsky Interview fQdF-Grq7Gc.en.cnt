hi everyone I'm Giselle Fernandez and
I've come here to the University of
Arizona at Tucson to speak to one of the
most renowned philosophers intellectuals
in the world as well as leading expert
on propaganda politics media war and of
course I'm talking about the renowned
mr. Noam Chomsky I'm here specifically
to talk with him about the refugee
crisis on our borders those are the only
two options totally open borders or
criminal prosecution for lawbreakers I'm
here to speak with him about the state
of our democracy are we in a
constitutional crisis there's no one
better to address these issues in a
really meaningful and thoughtful way
than Noam Chomsky thank you mr. Chomsky
for sitting down with me I consider it a
real honor and a privilege to be able to
discuss these matters of such urgency
with you so thank you happy to be with
you thank you you have been a leading
voice on the refugee crisis not just
from central in South America but all
over the world for decades but this
moment in time with the thousands of
families from Central America at our
gates and being separated by the
zero-tolerance policy the children
jailed seems a very different moment
particularly for the United States and
its values and ideals are perceived
values and ideals and how we define
ourselves how dangerous is this moment
in your estimation and what does it mean
for the United States well I think we
should really regard the so-called
refugee crisis as a deep moral crisis in
the West
I've been tens of hundreds of thousands
of people it's going to be many more in
the future are fleeing from intolerable
conditions from violence terror
starvation
there's there of course fleeing to the
places which have wealth and resources
at which furthermore have a major
responsibility for their plight in the
case of Central America the United
States has a shocking record of support
for murder violence slaughter virtual
genocide the 1980s we practically
devastated the three countries that are
now the main source of refugees one the
fourth Nicaragua was unusual in that it
had an army to protect itself that the
population from the US backed terrorists
in the other three country the
terrorists were were in the army the and
now the end result of this people are
fleeing from the wreckage that we
created people fled young people fled in
the eighties came to the United States
Southern California and other places
that were caught up in gangs going back
and the gangs are devastating the
country still further quite apart from
our crucial responsibility just out of
plain elementary moral considerations we
should be welcoming these people but
given our role in their devastation of
their lands we have an enormous greater
responsibility actually we should bear
in mind that these people would prefer
to be in their own countries they're not
coming here because they didn't like
their countries since we made their
countries unlivable our primary
responsibility is to provide ways in
which the countries can become viable in
that case there won't be a refugee
crisis right now there's a moral crisis
because of our double refused
first of all to absorb the victims and
secondly to reconstitute what we've
destroyed and similar comments apply to
Europe people are fleeing from Africa to
Europe not from Europe to Africa and
there's hundreds of years of reasons for
that which we all know or should know so
this seems yes a moral crisis and I
would like to discuss that with you but
if the new media it's also a
constitutional crisis because these
refugees when fleeing peril persecution
violence have a constitutional right to
present themselves legally and apply for
asylum instead they're being separated
from their children and jailed
so does this finally constitute the
constitutional crisis will this refugee
kind of playbook to rally up the trunk
base backfire on him as we've seen it a
little bit or will it be as some
analysts say yeah he may lose the moment
but he's going to eventually win the war
you know against immigrants well the the
reason to the last few weeks treatment
of children separating them from their
parents they'll never see them again
they're scattered in places really they
don't know where they are
you think they'll not see them again
they will not be reunited I think it's
very unlikely considering the present
circumstances but this has been such a
scam that it's led to it compelled the
administration to try to backtrack
somewhat because it's a it's just beyond
description to see these children torn
away separate from their parents parents
effect the children are basically lost
the solution that's been proposed as
maybe marginally better than the
original crime but only marginally
essentially being caged these people
that all of them should have the
opportunity to present themselves for
asylum
according to record
international conventions to have
legally support honest honest courts not
the kind of course that exists where
which are simply a scandal with refugees
or have a an appointed lawyer who tell
that tells them to answer yes to
whatever the judge says which they don't
understand because they don't know
English so essentially they're saying
are you guilty of coming across the
border and they say yes then they're
sent back that's not a legal proceeding
Jeff Sessions has now said that using
gang violence as a reason to flee is no
longer justifiable and the Trump
administration is now saying there
should be no courts no judges to
interfere and that these people should
just be deported in fact there's a deal
being made to offer to the jailed
immigrants that if you want to have your
children back you have to agree to
immediate deportation I mean in the
broader sense you have been a leading
voice against the abuses of our US
government is this another level mr.
Chomsky how would you define the moment
it's another common it's hard to
evaluate crimes so take say there
happens to be a flood of refugees from
the Mayan areas of Guatemala to the
United States these are areas where
virtual genocide was carried out in the
early 1980s with enthusiastic US support
President Reagan praised the main
perpetrator of the genocide elack's
later many years he was condemned he
told them told us he's a wonderful man a
great believer in democracy
we kept providing aid and support we
enlisted other countries to armed and
trained the murderers when Congress
imposed certain constraints on the US
is that better or worse and now people
are fleeing how do you compare that with
taking children away from their parents
and putting them sending them off to
oblivion I don't know a metric that
compares these crimes they're all
horrendous so what do we do you in your
Instagram there's a wonderful quote I'm
not sure if it's yours or someone else's
I think it's yours where you said you
know that apathy basically is complicit
in the in the crimes if we do nothing
but we feel so unempowered we feel so
victimized by the media and the
propaganda that what do we do he's
hijacked both parties well the fact is
with all the flaws of the United States
it remains a pretty free country which
means we have plenty of opportunities to
do things so you remain hopeful I think
we should always remember Gramsci's
famous slogan of that we should have
pessimism of the intellect but optimism
of the will meaning which is very
particularly important for people like
us who do have opportunity and
opportunity confers responsibility which
means we can make use of of the
opportunities that are available to us
and they range from legal massive
measures like providing legal aid to
charitable acts to electoral politics to
civil disobedience we have a wide range
of opportunity of think of things we can
do to try to overcome shocking sadistic
violations of elementary human rights
and the news the other day there was an
analyst who said you should stop being
shocked and astonished by the daily you
know assaults of this administration and
the autocracy that's now why it didn't
open
you know framed as a democracy yet and
you know all of your writings you've
spoken about these abuses for years this
is nothing new it's just more out
the open and blatant would you assess
this on a scale of one to ten is the
worst you've ever seen it no I don't
think so where does not impair it with
killing several million people in
Indochina and destroying three countries
i these you know every sadistic horror
is has its own particular disgraceful
characteristics and you can't really
weigh them in scales they're all
horrible in the wrong ways we have a lot
to be to think about and do something
about first of all we can compensate to
some extent for atrocities that we've
carried out but we can certainly take
care of the victims with mercy and
humanity and in this case even in accord
with international conventions will
accept it violate it constantly but
nevertheless formally accepted we should
be taking the lead and accepting after
all the United States is the richest
most powerful country in world history
we have incomparable advantages and we
have huge territories that are unsettled
plenty of ways of bringing in these
miserable people for many of them we are
responsible of their fates and arranging
for them to have decent productive lives
contributed this we should think about
there are countries that are accepting
huge numbers of refugees so it takes a
Lebanon which is not responsible for the
plight of the people that fled there
about almost half the population of
refugees Kenya has huge numbers of
refugees Bangladesh extremely poor
country has been taking in tens of
thousands of refugees so why does
America and certainly we're seeing it
more in here but the why does
Amerika have this and even in the Latin
communities who said no don't come here
why is there such a sense of we're a
country of immigrants who hate
foreigners why are we not saying we must
bear this responsibility and if not for
children who what has happened to us
that we're closing our doors well first
of all it's not the first time
immigration we are a nation of
immigrants immigrants were brought on
very willingly not for pretty reasons
because it was necessary to settle the
areas from which we were expelling in
fact exterminating as the many nations
who we destroyed when we set up this
country worth remembering that the
United States is a settler colonial
society it's been a war almost
constantly since its founding I first
the wars against the numerous Indian
nations of 50 or they were effectively
exterminated virtually then Foreign Wars
many in the Central America Caribbean
reason and beyond well it's hard to find
a day when the United States has not
been at war and these are not words of
defense so immigrants were brought on as
long as they were white and in fact very
precise distinctions were made so
Benjamin Franklin who's among the
founders the leading figure of the
Enlightenment he argued that we
shouldn't admit Germans and Swedes
because they're too swarthy it's a good
indication of what these things mean
finally white immigrants were admitted
often treated with extreme harshness and
brutality like the Irish were called the
Huns from Europe finally and by the time
of about the first world war the country
was pretty largely settled they're not
densely by the standards of the rest of
the world and the first Orientals were
excluded entirely
but at the late 1880s 1924 the first
really harsh immigration law was passed
to block they didn't say it but
basically to block Italians and Jews the
way it was said was it was a National
Origins Act which was designed so that
Italian southern Europeans mainly
Italians and Jews from Eastern Europe
would be blocked that remained until the
1960s one of the consequences of that
was that millions of Jews were sent to
extermination camps my whole family for
example and because they couldn't get
into the one country in the world could
easily absorb there's horrible stories
from the late 30s in the early nineteen
forties about the USS Stewart when we
turn back the Roosevelt turns on the
back and sending them off to a fate that
you know although that lasted until the
nineteen sixties so what's happening is
not though it has its own unique
ugliness but as I say savagery of
different kinds doesn't alright it's not
comfortable wait so there's a long
history of and this is against a
background of extreme of white supremacy
by comparative in comparative studies
like George frederickson's of white
supremacy the United States ranks
highest in the world beyond apartheid
South Africa this is a very these are
very deeply rooted to fall social
pathology so this is not Trump igniting
this it's unleashed what was always
there and a white lash of what happened
with Obama well I think Trump has quite
consciously taken the cork out of the
bottle the things that were latent are
now Nora accepted but applauded and
social pathologies that have been there
and showing it awful ways throughout the
centuries are now becoming
there's other factors both here and in
Europe the same things happening in
Europe wealth in equity isn't what's
happening just today in fact Italy again
turned back ship full of migrants
fleeing from Libya
we're incidentally Italy carried out
literal genocide about a century ago
this is a history there look it's not so
pretty
the of eastern Libya the saranac maybe
half the population or so was wiped out
by Italian flourish they arethey ophea
in other places they're not extremely
don't have clean hands in this case and
the same is true for the rest of Europe
couldn't go through the history but it
should be well known it's horrendous but
I think we should bear in mind that
there are other reasons why these social
pathologies which is what they are
racism xenophobia white supremacy why
they're surfacing in this particular
moment we have been through a period of
about 40 years of a socio-economic
experiment
it seems we called neoliberalism meaning
business first everyone else's last took
off under Reagan statuary and it's had
effect the one effect is that for the
large majority of the population it has
led to stagnation or decline real wages
of male workers about what they were in
the 1960s productivity is increased not
as fast as before but it has increased
wages have not kept up with it in fact
they've stayed steady meaning the
results of the productivity go to very
few pockets there's an enormous
concentration of wealth very few hands
that concentration of wealth almost
automatically least
concentration of political power by
perfectly obvious means so the
government becomes much less responsive
to popular needs its these assume
something similar has happened in Europe
and they cost everybody that's anything
the effect of all of this is to create
anger fear disillusionment contempt for
institutions take a look at election
after election the centrist political
institutions parties others that have
been pretty much running the countries
are completely falling apart in
conditions like this in conditions of
anger or despair you do there is an
opening for pathological elements that
were late to service well that's what's
happened here and as a linguistics
expert and pioneer and propaganda expert
do you think Trump is consciously
strategically masterminding you know
what's happening he has mine camp at his
bedside according to a Vanity Fair
article or is this just him being you
know a wizard at ratings you know
television yeah tactics we have to
speculate about a person's thoughts but
there's looking at the evidence the
impression that's created is he has a
very simple ideology can be expressed in
two letters me the only thing that
matters is me now that has corollaries
means you have to keep your base loyal
in fact by now Worshipful he's a county
politician he knows what appeals to them
and in moments of periods like this
periods of anger fear and distress
what's going to appeal to people is is
playing to their fears xenophobia white
supremacy misogyny racism and he's doing
that very will incidentally this is only
half the story the other half which you
certainly understand
is that he's providing cover for the
most savage wing of the Republican Party
to step-by-step dismantle any part of
the government that's for the benefit of
the population and to concentrate all of
wealth and power in their actual
constituency which is extreme wealth and
corporate power you see this in step
after step so do you think we're you've
talked about the Doomsday Clock being
two minutes to midnight
what about unrest and civil war in our
own country there are analysts this
morning talking about we're closer than
ever to just an uprising of massive
proportions because of those that don't
have and finally fed up are we close to
a civil war I don't think the country is
a despite everything the country's still
an organized advanced society has awful
features but I don't think there are
armed militias running around but when
we are fractured like this does it make
us more vulnerable to foreign attack and
then does it also make us more
vulnerable to our own place is the most
secure country in the world in history
in fact it's the most frightened
countries in the world but as always
have enormous security just take a look
at American history the last time that
the United States was attacked was 1812
any other countries say that the United
States controls the hemisphere controls
both oceans controls the opposite sides
of both versions there are conflicts but
they're on somebody else's border you've
said though you know that you think this
is probably the most dangerous time
you've seen in a very long time
Trump well climate change and our lack
of addressing it and also know you're
serious issues that all this is a
distraction we're talking about all
these other things when those are the
main issues that may barely make
headlines well we are
but not now we're getting to it really
matters all of this is horrible and
significant but minor in comparison with
a question that is now being posed to
the human species for the first time and
it's a couple of hundred thousand years
of history namely are we going to
survive and that's a very serious
question we since the nuclear age late
1940s there's been a very ominous shadow
anyone who's looked at the record that
can only conclude that it's literally a
miracle that we survived this far
there's case after case when either by
accident or by reckless acts of leaders
that we've come very close to terminal
destruction turns out wasn't known in
the late 40s that not only was at the
beginning of the nuclear age but it was
the beginning of a new geological epoch
it's called the Anthropocene the
geological epoch in which human activity
is having extremely harmful destructive
effects on the general environment that
was happening before but it began to
escalate the late 1940s in fact the
world geological society has fixed in
the late 40s as the onset of this new
geological epoch and the concern by now
it's extremely serious do you think that
has anything to do with the volcano
eruptions in Hawaii and in Guatemala or
the tsunamis or is that just completely
this very it's very hard to pin
particular events on the general
developments that are happening but
there's no questions about the
tendencies there so here well when the
United States the leader of the free
world pulling out of the Paris Accords
and you've said accelerating not just
you know not doing anything about it
actually accelerating the problems this
was that call in my view one of the
to most astounding events in history the
fact that the leat the most powerful
wealthiest country in world history is
not only refusing to participate alone
uniquely refusing to participate in
efforts to deal something to do deal in
some way with the mounting catastrophe
but yes in fact is accelerating the race
to destruction
it's doing everything possible to make
it worse that's one the second most
astounding thing is we're not talking
about it this is just a shocking this
should be a screaming headline in the
newspapers every day what we're facing
in the near future a very likely simply
sea-level rise of several feet maybe
several meters and by the end of the
century
just imagine what happens if the sea
Rises let's say five or six feet
consequently utterly devastating
they're almost unimaginable maybe the
rich countries will be able to handle it
somehow but for most of the world it's a
total catastrophe the melting Arctic the
melting Arctic melting Arctic at the
melting Antarctic the rising temperature
which is the telfa creating its the
feedback effect this is a this is it's
simply astonishing but when you have
corporations owning half the world that
benefit by not stopping it how do you
come back that you said at the beginning
of this interview that the refugee
crisis is really a moral crisis how do
you awaken and this is really at the
heart of your expertise how do you
awaken a populace to care to care that
those children are not just those
children are brown children or criminals
or ms-13 or care that you know our
species is endangered when all these
authoritative forces are telling you
it's a lies
make news it's not real how do you
awaken a populace to care and do
something about it it's a real problem
we should recognize the scale of the
problem so as a recent study of voters
attitudes on this among the Republicans
about half deny that what's happening is
happening so we say there's no global
warming that's half of Republicans of
the other half and barely half a little
over half say maybe humans have
something to do it I don't think there's
anything like this anywhere in the world
outside of places were never you know
some peasant community where they never
heard of it this is unique and
horrendous so what do you do but you
work but wait a second the Democrats you
have said both parties are complicit in
all this measures but the Democrats fail
miserably in messaging they don't have a
platform we don't have a candidate the
only kind of message we seem to have
right now is antitrump which all the
political analysts say does not work and
will not work it's not done is it not
work it's it's it's divert attention to
what's important like paying it to take
the question of whether the Russians
played some role in manipulating the
election
I'm additive such marginal significance
you can barely find it with the
telescope in fact it's ludicrous because
there is massive interference with our
elections namely corporate funding
overwhelming do you think that
investigation will lead to Trump's
undoing I think that in here I pretty
much agree with Trump I think that
investigation was just a waste of wasted
time and energy what it's even if the
worst Chargers turn out to be correct
they will barely weigh in the balance
against the real crimes in the
administration
like for example driving the world not
just the country towards terminal
disaster because of climate change how
do you measure anything against that
the ideas that in fact you know the
Democrats are concentrated on revenge
for the fact that they ran a rotten
campaign and lost an election they
should have easily won that's not a
policy they're not focusing on the real
needs of people and the real needs of
the world and part of the reason is
they're complicit in these policies
where's Barack Obama complicit in those
policies well you know he made some
moves which were positive but nothing
anywhere near what should have been done
you can claim that there were too many
impediments from Congress and so on but
and it's not just the political
leadership that takes a the it takes a
the press coverage take a look there's
article after article appearing mostly
in the business for us
about the great prospects for the United
States to become energy independent by
increasing production of fossil fuels we
are now surpassing Saudi Arabia in
destroying the planet article after
article try I've gone through thousands
of them you can't find one phrase saying
that oh this is wonderful but we're
destroying the world that just doesn't
matter all that matters is more profit
more power the idea that we're racing to
destruction and this is accelerating it
isn't even mentioned so it's not just
talking to you know Republicans who deny
climate change we're talking about our
own circles educated liberal people who
sort of know it but meanwhile or
diverting attention to marginalia and
actually celebrating of the monstrous
atrocities that were carrying out
against future generations not far at
the distance we're talking about this
just doesn't seem like we learned we
didn't learn from the Holocaust we had
Rwanda Darfur
we're just way beyond the Holocaust
we're talking about the end of organized
human life so what are the Democrats
have to do to get on message well it's
not what they have to do it's what we
have to do to create popular movements
which compel attention and action on
these issues the party managers are not
going to do anything so it's the youth
potentially we saw what happened with
the school shootings the youth rose up
for a moment and yet the NRA and
Congress still batted them down means
you have to work harder that's not kind
the youth it's people like us who were
in a position to do something about it
all of our educated liberal friends
would be devoting themselves to this but
they don't and we have to get them to do
it
that's like saying people in Germany
under the Nazis that didn't do anything
so what do you do about it try to get
them to do something
the other great threat you talk about
and you talked about the Doomsday Clock
two minutes to midnight is the threat of
nuclear annihilation and proliferation
has your mind changed on this at all
with President Trump meeting with Kim
young-woo okay
well actually that's one of the positive
things he did but we should be careful
to see exactly what's happening the two
Koreas North and South producer had a a
remarkable meeting in which they
produced a historic declaration April
27th and it's worth reading carefully
it's the first time they have ever
agreed peacefully to work towards
improving relations peaceful settlement
denuclearization and gave detailed
proposals as to how to proceed stage by
stage but there's a framework they said
we intend for the two Koreas to
work towards this goal on their own
accord on their own accord and the rest
of it is an implicit message to the
world which means the United States
don't disrupt it to Trump's credit he
has not disrupted it his threats and so
on had nothing to do with it his
diplomacy to the extent that it exists
have nothing to do with it if he wants
to take credit for it fine nobody cares
but the one good thing he did is what he
didn't do namely disrupt it it's
happened before and there have been
agreements before the press of simply
falsifying the record constant picture
is you can't trust the North Koreans
they back off true but commonly when
they've backed off its after we
disrupted the agreement we should make
clear that that was the case now again
the trumps credit he has for the first
time not totally the first time but
practically the first time not disrupted
it yet and we should keep his feet to
the fire on that so that's to the good
we should let the two Koreas proceed on
their own accord as they're planning to
do to overcome one of the world's really
serious problems and give whatever
assistance we can for them to do it but
not to us do you think the disruption of
the Iran deal leads us closer to or it's
very well mine first of all that's I
think that again follows from the
principle of me and one of the
corollaries of that is that if Obama did
it I've did the opposite otherwise I
can't be in the limelight I can't seem
like I'm terribly important I can't
energize my face and so on and that was
another scandalous act that deal was
working very well even the US
intelligence concedes that Iran was
living up to it
incidentally not discussed is the fact
that we were not living up to it under
Obama control we were constantly acting
to disrupt Iran's commercial activities
its financial activities we blocked many
of them that's contrary to the explicit
wording of the agreement but our
violations of a dull matter we were
special country but breaking it was very
destructive if the Iranians react as
actually they were entitled to do by
returning to developing nuclear programs
that may be used by Israel in the United
States as a pretext for military action
and that could blow up the region the
region is disruptive enough anyway I
said there's more to say about this
there is a much more far-reaching
solution as possible namely establish a
nuclear weapons free zone in the region
you've spoken a lot about this why
doesn't it get any traction it did
everywhere in the world except one
country here why we've blocked it what
are the corporate interests no because
you have to protect Israel's nuclear
programs from inspection there's no
objection to setting this up Iran has
been in the lead and calling for the
Arab states have actually initiated the
program and many several of them have
threatened to pull out of the
non-proliferation treaty in which we
proceeded the rest of the world is in
favor of it
it comes up regularly at the review
meetings of the non-proliferation treaty
us vetoes last time under Obama
2015 everybody knows the reason you have
to protect Israel's nuclear weapons
programs and you have to protect
Israel's hegemonic role in the region
I should add I've mentioned before that
the United States has a specific unique
responsibility to proceed with this when
the u.s. invaded Iraq there was a search
for some legal pretext for which was
obviously it straight act of aggression
that what the US and Britain did was
appealed to a Security Council
resolution resolution by 1990s which
called on Iraq to and it's as it turns
out non-existent nuclear programs and if
you read that agreement it committed the
signers and we were the initiators of
the agreement committed them to work for
a nuclear weapons free zone in the
region now that again if we had media
that were concerned with informing the
public that should be headline 2 we have
a commitment to do what the entire world
except for the United States and Israel
wants to happen it would settle the
problem nuclear weapons free zone within
spectrum means you don't need a nuclear
deal with Iran you know if to worry
about it
we're blogging that's that's the third
headline we're missing it's another one
that we're missing do you see this great
ideal that we've all so many Americans
have had of who we are and many across
the globe of this humanitarian nation of
all these values and ideals bring us
your core and huddled masses do you
think this fine Mariza Rhodes that there
was information about this namely asked
what the world feels like has been done
once a Gallup polls take do studies of
international opinion regularly one year
2013 they asked the question which
country is the greatest threat to world
peace the United States was in the lead
with no competitors way behind and
second place was
Pakistan is probably inflated by the
Indians vote Iran North Korea others
were not even mentioned that's the last
time they asked the question well you
may ask why if you look at the coverage
almost no coverage I think one or got
tabloid covered it the make story was
look how crazy the world is but for the
rest we don't care we say we're the most
important humanitarian peaceful loving
power if the world says the opposite the
world is crazy a cover of der spiegel
this morning
there's a picture apparently of Trump
with Putin and Kim and leader of Turkey
I already did and it apparently says you
know autocracy you know do you see our
democracy heading toward like a real you
know what Germany wasn't 38 and all of a
sudden became you know this tyrannical
regime I think the circumstances are
very different I mean you can find
similarities and so for example when I
listen to the Worshipful crowd roaring
their approval of Trump I have to say it
does bring up childhood memories of when
I was six years old listening to the
radio and listening to the Hitler's
Nuremberg rallies I didn't understand
the words but there was no mistaking the
mood and it's similar nevertheless the
circumstances are radically different
I don't think comparisons to if I'm our
Germany are really appropriate we could
it could become much worse but it's very
much under our control when I do
terrible things are happening good love
like that do you think we'll lose the
midterms or the midterms we'll have a
wave of blue that could shift things or
not so much if the Democrats could get
their act together
the
could retake Congress do much better at
the state level should remember that the
party was practically destroyed during
the Obama years the DNC kept us from
Bernie Sanders oh you know the state
level legislatures just collapsed
there's a significant season within the
Democratic Party between the new
Democrat donor oriented party managers
and the popular base which is becoming
Social Democratic shifted the Sanders
you still think he's viable now I think
it's very viable but it's but they're
gonna have to overcome this very
significant gap and put forth programs
that are meaningful to the general
population not side issues like whether
the Republic had tried to manipulate the
election zonda technically real issues
what people care about our concerns
about and what they oughta be concerned
about that aren't like destruction of
the possibility for organized human life
those issues should be front and center
and if that were the case I think they
could sweep the election that's not
happening mr. Chomsky our time is up and
I so appreciate you spending the time
with me I consider it a real privilege
and honor thank you thank you
