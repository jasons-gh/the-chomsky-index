this week we're here at MIT in Cambridge
Massachusetts to interview
world-renowned linguist and philosopher
Noam Chomsky someone who's authored over
a hundred books on everything from war
to propaganda I wanted to get his take
on democracy and elections within the
context of American Empire as Extreme as
the political spectrum is right now in
the US there's still almost complete
uniformity on the war on terror the
stance toward Latin America sanctions on
Iran and there's really no anti-war
candidate despite popular opinion
agreeing on that why can no candidate
touch that the spectrum is broad but in
an odd sense the spectrum is basically
from center to extreme right extreme
right way off the spectrum so the
Republican Party about 20 years ago
basically abandoned any pretense of
being a normal political party in fact
distinguished respected conservative
commentators from the American
Enterprise Institute right-wing
think-tank like Norman Ornstein
described the Republican Party as a
radical insurgency which is abandoned
parliamentary politics they just don't
want anything to happen there are only
policies or don't do anything or bomb
that's and that's not a political party
it's that what happened is that the
party during the whole neoliberal period
both parties shifted to the right as
everywhere in the world and the
Republicans just went off the spectrum
they became so dedicated to the the
interests of the extreme wealthy and
powerful that they couldn't get votes so
they had to turn to other constituencies
which are there but were never
politically mobilized the Christian
evangelicals nativists who were afraid
they're taking our country away from us
people who are so terrified that they
have to carry
gun into a coffee shop and that's their
base essentially and when you when you
look at whatnot and take a look at the
primaries I mean any candidate who has a
semblance of rationality is not even
competing it's so that's the Republicans
the Democrats have shifted to the right
as well the today's Democrat mainstream
Democrats are pretty much what used to
be called moderate Republicans somebody
like Eisenhower for example would be
considered way out on the left so for
example Eisenhower strongly made it very
clear as he put it that anyone who
questions the program's of the New Deal
is just not part of American political
life well by now that's a left-wing
program it's basically Bernie Sanders
it's program that's eisenhower so the
spectrum just is it's true that it's
broad but in a very strange sense as far
as anti-war candidates are concerned if
they ask what it means so for example
Obama's considered an anti-war candidate
he described the Iraq war as a mistake
strategic blunder as he put it I mean
that's like Russian generals in
Afghanistan in the early 1980s who
criticized the invasion as a strategic
blunder that's not criticism of the war
saying you're making a mistake the
debate about the Obamas is running a
global terror program of a kind that has
never been envisioned before the drone
program it's now being discussed to an
extent because of recent leaks but the
the questions that are being raised
overwhelmingly not not by Jeremy scale
and
glenn greenwald but why most of those
were talking about it is are you killing
too many civilians what about just
assassinating people because you think
someday they might want to harm you
I mean suppose for example that Iran was
murdering the people in the United
States because they think with some
reason that they might want to harm them
for example the editors of the New York
Times in the Washington Post who publish
articles op-eds that calling for bombing
of Iran so suppose they said well this
is an event threat let's kill them would
we accept that these the idea that we
have the right to use force and violence
at will is accepted pretty much across
the spectrum that they say the Iran
negotiations virtually every one
president political leaders commentators
in the press dovish commentators almost
universally say that if we unilaterally
detect think we detect some Iranian
violation of the agreements then we have
a right to use military force to attack
them I mean that's just outlandish in
terms of international law and practice
but it's Universal virtually universal
you have to go way to the margins to
find somebody who'll question them and
there's not even a mild critique of the
assassination program or even the war on
terror the premise for many of these
candidates and every four years were
made to feel like we're playing this
great role this great democratic
practice you know in decision making
where we celebrate electing these
leaders who rule over us I mean how does
power really function in our society but
there's very good studies of this from
mainstream political science not nothing
on the edges so one of the main topics
that studied in academic political
science
the relation between people's attitudes
and public policy then it's a pretty
straightforward study you see public
policy is very good polling evidence on
what people think about things so for
example for about 40 years a
considerable majority the public has
thought that taxes should go up on the
rich taxes go down on the rich a
substantial part of the public often a
big majority thinks that we would have a
national health care program nothing
impossible in fact when the press
discusses this they call it politically
impossible
meaning the pharmaceutical companies
won't accept that the insurance
companies won't accept it and so on so
it basically doesn't matter what the
public thinks about 70 percent of the
public lowest 70 percent of the income
scale are pretty much disenfranchised
their attitudes have no detectable
influence on the policies of their own
representatives as you move up the scale
you get a bit more influence when you
get to the top policies made and the top
can mean a fraction of 1% so it's kind
of a plutocracy with democratic forms
and the elections I mean by now it's
almost become a joke but it's always
been true that campaign financing is
where plays a very substantial role in
not only who's elected but what the
policies are that goes back 100 years
the great campaign manager and hundred
years ago Mark Hanna was asked once what
are the important things that you have
to have to find it to run a campaign so
there are three things first one's money
the second one's money
I forget what the third one is no and
pretty much that's true it's been with
the current reactionary Supreme Court
it's just going out of sight campaign
spending is you know the billions and
billions of dollars and people have
argued it's just because of too much
government interference we need to widen
the market we need capitalism to be more
free I mean you've argued that in any
scenario of capitalism working it's in
congruous it than compatible with
democracy there was recently an IMF
study International Monetary Fund study
of the profits of the big banks in the
United States the financial sector has
become enormous during the neoliberal
period it's almost half the profit of
corporate profit where's their profit
come from
turns out comes from the taxpayer
through the largely through the there's
an implicit government guarantee against
failure it's not state something law but
it's understood that if a major
financial institution gets into trouble
the government will bail it out which
happens repeatedly only during the
neoliberal period incidentally there
were no major failures during the 50s
and the 60s when the new liberal
policies began to be instituted
deregulation and so on then you start
getting a series of financial crises and
every time the public bails them out
well that has consequences for one thing
it means that the credit agencies
understand that these are that these
corporations are high valued beyond the
level of what they actually do because
they're going to be bailed out so they
get good credit ratings means they can
get cheap credit they can get cheap
loans from the government they can of
course they get the bailouts they can
undertake risky transactions which are
profitable because it goes wrong
taxpayer will take care of it net result
is that that's amounts to practically
all their other
profits is that capitalism energy that
there was another IMF study of
government subsidies to energy
corporations around the world not just
the u.s. they estimated about I think
five trillion dollars a year which
includes the u.s. of course plenty of
subsidies agribusinesses subsidies but
it's not what the whole new libertarian
movement would tell you is that
precisely the government is being used
as an extension of the market to protect
this kind of like a regular form of
capitalism that's hand in glove with the
government we just need to kind of free
up government regulation and light
capitalism work on its own first of all
the business world would never tolerate
that they rely heavily on government but
if you did follow the libertarian
prescriptive what are called Liberty
remember what's called libertarian in
the United States is has nothing to do
with traditional libertarianism it's a
kind of ultra-right capitalist
anarcho-capitalism they call it if that
was allowed to function whole society
collapse and we turned the total tyranny
we would have tyranny of unaccountable
private institutions a private
concentration of capital it's totally
unaccountable to the public absolute
Tyranny the only thing that protects the
public from predatory capitalism is some
degree of state intervention so it's
true that the state intervention does
support the capitalist institutions it
also protects the society from total
destruction
predatory capitalist system just it
simply couldn't survive I mean for
example I mean for perfectly obvious
reasons for one thing it wouldn't care
about externalities effects on others so
within no time it would destroy the
environment simply by destroying
resources pouring carbon dioxide into
the atmosphere
who cares furthermore there would be no
public goods the markets
I mean there's an ideology that which
claims that markets provide freedom of
choice so they're kind of democratic
it's not true and we all know it's not
true so for example suppose I I want to
get home this evening the market does
offer choices a four-door Toyota doesn't
offer the choice I want which is a
public transportation system that's not
part of the market the market focuses
you on individual consumption of
consumer goods period that's is that
what you want in life just more and more
gadgets around there lots of other
things in life which the market doesn't
even offer so what's called
libertarianism is a prescription for
complete disaster I'm not I don't think
the people advocating it understand this
I'm not criticizing them but just think
it through and I should say it's very
anti libertarian I'm in traditional
libertarianism which was always on the
Left was opposed to the master-servant
relation people giving orders and other
people taking them that's libertarianism
and not in this version a few weeks ago
the US military intentionally bombed the
hospital in Cunha's Afghanistan I mean
the US government felt it enough to just
apologize and there's people leaping to
the defense of the establishment here
saying there must have been a good
reason either they did it on accident
even though that we know that they
didn't or you know there was Taliban
hiding in there and so it justified
obviously this human shield logic just
like Israel does I mean how does this
specific example illustrate how American
exceptionalism functions well we have to
be careful about the term American
exceptionalism
if either it's not at all exceptional
every imperial power has bathed the same
way sometimes worse so it's just normal
imperial practice
it's called exceptionalism but nothing
about that of course it's called it it's
supposed to be exceptional
that we have the highest ideals so maybe
we make mistakes but it's always with
the highest ideals that's American
exceptionalism except that too is true
of every just about every imperial power
so when the British were destroying the
world they were always doing it with the
absolutely highest ideals the leading
figures leading intellectuals and people
at count Stuart Mill estimable people
were describing England as an angelic
country beyond anything that anyone's
ever imagined people can't understand
how marvellous we are and so on the
French were the same that hard to find
an exception so there's no
exceptionalism the in the case of the
Kunduz hospital apparently I don't think
all the details have come out but it
seems that they were trying to kill some
people they regarded as Taliban leaders
or activists and they happened to be in
the hospital so they killed everybody
and there's a lot of credit there is a
lot of criticism of killing the others
what about killing the person they were
targeting I mean what right do we have
to kill somebody in some other country
who we don't like I mean I don't like
them either
you know don't like the Taliban at all
but does that mean we have a right to go
kill them I mean do they have a right to
go kill us if they don't like us
that's not questioned at all what's
questioned is and criticized is
attacking a hospital and killing the
staff and killing the patients and you
know it's not the first time so for
example when the when the u.s. one of
the lauded achievements of the US Army
in Iraq is the conquest of Fallujah in
November 2004 that take a look at it
just take a look at the New York Times
the days of the attack on Fallujah the
first day of the attack there's a
picture
frontpage can practically visualize it
which is a picture of the General
Hospital in Fallujah Marines attacked
the General Hospital through the
patients off their beds put on the floor
but shackles around them through the
doctors on the floor when attacking a
hospital is a gross violation of
international law but they were asked
and they were asked why did you attack
it they said because it was a propaganda
agency for the rebels how was it a
propaganda agency
it was releasing casualty figures that
was okay that's an achievement but even
beyond that what were the Marines doing
in Fallujah I mean are there Iranian
Marines and the in Cambridge what our US
Marines doing in Iraq the invasion of
Iraq is the worst crime of the century
it's had horrible effects but now don't
spawned sectarian conflicts that are
tearing the region apart but suppose it
had worked suppose it had pacified Iraq
and there was no disasters still a major
crime why do we have the right to invade
another country and in fact if you look
back the zenith is another crime which
is never discussed in the 1990s the
sanctions on Iraq were so severe that
they virtually destroyed the society in
fact the the sanctions were administered
by the United Nations and the the
international diplomats who administered
the sanctions were respected
international diplomats Denis Halliday
on Sons Boeing they both resigned in
protest on the grounds that the
sanctions were genocide 'el their terms
not mine they said the sanctions are
genocide 'el the destroying the society
the strengthening the dictator they're
forcing the population to rely on them
for survival and
probably they saved him from being
overthrown from within has happened to
one after another a dictator of the same
sort that was the 1990s that's
considered no problem you know that was
Liberal Democrats well I mean by the
time that bush and Blair decided to
invade Iraq the Society was half
devastated
so you hit a very fragile system with a
sledgehammer
you're gonna have horrible results and
but the very idea of invading is
criminal and try to find someone who
describes it as a crime right Obama is
praised because he describes it as a
mistake does he describe it as a crime
does anyone I'll accept way out at the
fringes there was the dumb war right and
dumb war John more dumb things because
you're good yeah we do smart work it's
like a German generals after Stalingrad
this is really stupid to have a
two-front war we should have destroyed
England first well our think is
interesting that people use the
rationale that we didn't find WMDs as if
that would have been a rationale to
invade and occupy a country finding
weapons of mass destruction the myth
we're saying in fact we're insane you
know if they won't if they're concerned
about weapons of mass destruction there
are ways to proceed the UN inspectors
are doing a fine job actually the same
pretty much the same similar questions
arise in the case of the Iran nuclear
deal so Iran according to the United
States poses a grave threat to the world
that's pretty much an American and
Israeli obsession that most of the world
doesn't see it that way but say let's
say it's a threat suppose you run poses
a threat how do you are there simple
ways of dealing with this in fact there
are and in fact very popular ones the
best way to deal with it would be to
work towards instituting a nuclear
weapons free zone the no beach
that's supported by almost the entire
world it's strongly supported by Iran in
fact they're one of the leading
advocates of it yeah when you're not
American Allah during that Israel has
done that's the problem the US won't
permit it because it does not want
Israeli nuclear weapons to be open to
inspection so therefore we block the
obvious way to deal with whatever
problem there is and it is supported by
virtually the entire world comes up
every five years at the
non-proliferation treaty review
conference and in fact the continuation
of the non-proliferation treaty is
actually contingent on doing this that
was agreed 20 years ago that's the most
important arms control treaty there is
if that treaty collapses we're going
everybody I'll have nuclear weapons and
be using them but the u.s. is so
committed to protecting israel's nuclear
weapons that it's willing to endanger
the non-proliferation treaty and prevent
the obvious beings from keeping nuclear
weapons away from Iran in case they have
any interest in developing do you see a
word of discussion of this outside of
the arms control literature I write
articles but way out of the fridges
nothing that could possibly make the
mainstream there's this huge amount of
grassroots energy donations around
getting people elected who are believed
to be able to give us solutions of the
problems that we face Noam what do you
think focusing our energy on take say
the Bernie Sanders campaign which I
think is important impressive he's doing
good and courageous things he's
organizing a lot of people that campaign
ought to be directed to sustaining a
popular movement which will use the
election as a kind of an incentive but
then go on and unfortunately it's not
when the elections over the
is going to die and that's a serious
error I'm the only thing that's going to
ever ever bring about any meaningful
changes ongoing dedicated popular
movements which don't pay attention to
the election cycle it's an extravaganza
every four years you have to be involved
in it so fun will be involved in it but
then we go on if that we're done you
could get major changes
you
you
