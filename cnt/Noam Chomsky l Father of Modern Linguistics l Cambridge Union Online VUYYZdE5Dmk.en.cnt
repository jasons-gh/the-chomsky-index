hi everyone um I'm Adam Davies president
of the Cambridge Union and thank you for
tuning in to this event we have
professor Noam Chomsky who if you're on
this call you already probably know who
he is he's a linguist political activist
writer probably when the world's most
prominent living public intellectuals
whether you remember or not whoever you
are thank you so much for tuning in
please subscribe to our YouTube page and
like us on Facebook for details on our
future events the way this event is
gonna work is that Professor Chomsky is
gonna give a 10 minute or so speech
about the current global situation then
I'll do a few minutes of questions and
then I will ask him some questions that
you all have submitted already so
without further adieu professor Chomsky
the floor is yours thank you well I
think I'll make a few observations about
current crises the one that's son
everyone's mind of course and
understandably is the pandemic one thing
to bear in mind about the pandemic is
that we will recover
perhaps that serious may be tremendous
loss that we're not going to recover
from the melting of the polar ice sheets
and other processes underway that may
are predicted to make much of the world
uninhabitable that within a couple of
generations maybe 50 years that's going
to happen if we stay on our present
course with much worse to come there's
lots to say about that and other
comparable risks to survival including
the very serious growing threat of
terminal nuclear war I'll put that aside
here and keep the demand emic come back
to it later if you'd like there are a
few things to keep in mind about the
pandemic one is it's very likely to
recur probably worse than this one
Jasser baited by the impact of global
warming if we don't come to terms with
the causes and prepare it could be much
more serious than this may be horrendous
the causes are known and it was known 15
years ago scientists are telling us
right now that they do know how to
prepare for the next pandemic if we
decide to do something about it was also
known in 2003 after the SARS epidemic
another coronavirus epidemic which was
contained scientists pointed out want to
recur we better do something about it
but it's not enough to just know
somebody has to do something well who
obvious possibility is the huge drug
companies they're bloated with profits
thanks to the neoliberal trade programs
which afford them exorbitant patent
rights of the kind that have never
existed before these are the highly
interventionist so-called free trade
agreements oh so they have plenty of
money they have all the resources but
they can't do anything they're blocked
by capitalist logic which says you have
to maximize profit if you listen to
Milton Friedman that's the only thing
you're allowed to do so they're blocked
there's no profit in planning for a
catastrophe at ten or fifteen years from
now
making a vaccine that if it works will
be used once a year you don't make any
money on so they're out well there's
another possibility though the
government could step in they have
extensive resources as the United States
the National Institute of Health they do
most of the work anyway so they could
step in and similarly in Britain another
time
oh they could step in and do something
about it but that's blocked its blocked
by processes that are personified in two
individuals the Margaret Thatcher and
Ronald Reagan who gave formally
initiated the neoliberal plague that the
world has been suffering under for the
last 40 years you recall Reagan's
inaugural address where he said
government is the problem not the
solution so the government's not allowed
to do anything at translating that into
English it means that decisions have to
be removed from the public arena where
the public has some sort of influence
and moved into the hands of
unaccountable private tyrannies where
the public has no influence at all that
curiously that's called libertarianism
in the United States and England put
that aside anyway with the version of
savage capitalism that was introduced
around 1980 the government's can't step
in and that has an effect so a recent
discussion of discoveries scientific
paper discussing discussing the vaccines
says the US military played a
significant role in developing more than
half of the vaccines invented last
century including 18 of 28 vaccines for
preventable diseases vaccines for flu
measles rubella are only the most famous
and why the military because the u.s.
system of industrial and educational
policy has to work under the facade of
the military because that's the way you
get appropriations approved by Congress
as nothing whatsoever to do with the
military anymore than the
the interstate highway system the
defense the highway system has to do
with the military so that means the
government have produced most of the
vaccines most gave and what's more did
the basic research the difficult part of
the work on the what was done picked up
and completed by pharmaceutical
corporations but they're locked by
neoliberal savagery so there's no way to
proceed in fact after those two major
and that we still live with it so that's
going to block work for the next block
the next pandemic they don't have to
it's not a law of nature but that's the
system we're embedded in well after that
comes the question of the reaction of
individual governments they vary so if
you look at the Trump administration's
been in office for four years it's more
than usually committed to the it's the
primary constituency of primarily the
Republican Party enormous wealth and
corporate power that's the prime
constituency there's a farcical pretense
of populism but we can put that aside
perfectly obvious from the legislative
agenda so from the first moment that
Trump came in he began to defund the
Center for Disease Control and other
institutions committed the public health
the rich and powerful don't make any
money from those so they can be
disbanded there were programs the
government programs working to try to
identify new coronaviruses
some of them were working in China with
Chinese scientists investigating bats
which are the source of many of them
that Trump canceled them all the
programs continued to cancel war after
the pandemic again so the US was
uniquely vulnerable
that's one extreme that has the worst
record in the world other countries
listened to the information coming out
of China by mid-january
shortly after pneumonia like symptoms
had been discovered the Chinese
scientists identified the corona virus
the sequence the genome sent it to the
entire world through the World Health
Organization countries that governments
that cared about their populations
reacted at once
now Asia Oceania and they have the
situation pretty much in control that
Europe dithered but finally most of them
began to do something very results I
don't have to tell you in Britain which
was the worst in Europe the United
States was way behind as the worst
writer you can kind of see the logic
that lies behind ultra reactionary
neoliberalism by looking at Trump's
budget he produced a budget for the
coming year Feb mid-february pandemic is
raging although he's telling everyone
it's just a cold pandemic is raging here
comes the budget
it calls for cutback in spending in some
areas increase in spending in other
areas cut further cutbacks for the
center of Disease Control and for other
health-related components of the
government increased funding in
subsidies for the fossil fuel industries
that are working dedicated to working to
destroy the possibilities for organized
life on Earth well that's that's the
situation they're not laws of nature
there are solutions but as long as the
public is passive conformist the rich
and powerful they are relentless in
pursuit of their goals are
no they will prevail the end result will
be even worse than now those are the
choices that people have to face I see
I've made my ten minutes all stops well
thank you very much for those 10 minutes
for us a Chomsky just picking up on them
one thing the beginning you said of your
speech you mentioned other sort of tail
risks like nuclear war or climate change
do you think this pandemic will mean
that kind of societies and governments
be more ready to deal with things like
this in the future or do you think we're
not going to learn a lesson from this
well we see how governments are dealing
with them actually governments very
thank you take environmental catastrophe
every government is doing something
about it not enough but at least
something the u.s. is actually doing
more than anyone else the u.s. is
dedicated to destroying the climate
repeat dedicated to destroying the
climate the Republican Party is the most
dangerous organization in human history
that is devoted to maximizing fossil
fuel use opening up new areas for
exploitation eliminating all regulations
that mitigated the threatening in fact
incredible consequences and it's doing
it for a very simple reason it is
serving its main constituency great
wealth corporate power they think this
is fine so therefore we race to
destruction
let's take nuclear war it's interesting
that it's very hard to get anyone to
think about it so during the entire
campaign and Britain in the United
States two campaigns and not a word
about barely a comment here and there
it's some along with global warming it's
the major threat to existence
anyone who has looked at the record for
the first almost 75 years
knows that it's kind of a miracle that
we've escaped this long and miracles
don't persist so what is the world doing
well Trump administration is tearing to
shreds the last remnants of the arms
control regime the Europe is sitting
there
clucking its tongue and saying that's
not nice mr. Trump but we're too
subservience to you to do anything so it
goes on I can't talk about it
nobody's interested it's a disaster in
the making
again I don't know if you want me to run
through the details but did you know
from just last August dismantled the
Reagan Gorbachev INF treaty which had
significantly reduced the threat of
nuclear war and to show that he was
serious he immediately launched before
us the military to launch missiles that
violated the treaty that's telling the
Russians please don't hesitate to
develop weapons to destroy US military
industries Ecstatic they're getting huge
grants to create new weapons to destroy
everything and a little bit down the
road they're salivating at the new
contracts that will come to develop some
hopeless means to defend yourself
against the new weapons were encouraging
everyone destroyed the next on the
chopping block is the Open Skies treaty
which lies in how our initiated
that again has significantly reduced
that of the threat of war next is the
New START treaty now the Russians have
been pleading for negotiations to renew
it it's due up early next year Trump
administration said we're not interested
okay that goes that's the end of the
arms control regime not everyone's free
to produce as many weapons as they like
and I should say them talking about
Trump but Europe's doing nothing they
could but they aren't the democratic
party is not that different frankly they
wouldn't do this for a button up that
crazy but that's another thing we have
know again there are all these solutions
in these cases but they're not going to
happen unless an energized organized
public gets directly engaged otherwise
those who are relentlessly pursuing the
interests of power and profit will
create the world they want
thank you very much that as well
so one thing that you discussed pretty
extensively in your introductory remarks
was how capitalism prevents the
possibility of creating new vaccines
something that has been discussed quite
a lot recently is on antivirals so I'm
Juliet pharmaceuticals have antiviral
called REM Deb REM deaf severe which
tries to target the corona virus do you
have much hope in these our private
secretary solutions disease or do you
think they're distraction we have to be
a little careful the first of all the
was like everything else was delay
developed primarily on the basis of
publics public initiative the tough part
initial research was done at the NIH
it's handed over to a corporation who
wants to sell it at an exorbitant price
huge price which they are permitted to
do by the the World Trade Organization
and agreements which provide them with
ridiculous patent rights in this
particular case after it seemed to show
some positive results the government did
step in and essentially order them to
make it available at a reasonable price
that's worth knowing
that since 1980 the laws on the books in
the United States require the federal
government to intervene to ensure that
drugs are available at a reasonable
price of course Reagan wouldn't do it
Clinton wouldn't do it successors
wouldn't do it they're not following us
law but it's right on the books so if
they want to they can do it then in this
case they did so maybe Gilead the
producer will make it available one but
reasonable terms meaning giving the
public back a small proportion of what
the public paid in taxes to have this
made available now that's the way
capitalism functions its massive
subsidies for the rich the penalties for
the poor the government it's true all
over the economy take what were not
using computers internet satellites
where'd that come from public spending
the lab where I was working at MIT in
1950s publicly supported created the
that that's the kind of place that
another research labs like it were
created computers the internet the
high-tech economy generally later it was
turned over to private enterprise for
marketing and profit the best way it
works pretty much the whole economy but
in this case big pharma has to the
extent that they are allowed to be in
control the drugs even if they exist
they're gonna be priced out of anybody
to reach of course that's what you do if
you're a business that's very
interesting thank you um something you
touched on there when you mentioned your
worked in 1950s it's kind of the
remarkable length and consistency of
your career you've mentioned the past
you've had kind of largely consistent
political beliefs since you were quite
young is there anything that's shaken
have you changed your mind about
recently either in connection to
coronavirus or some
anything that kind of something you
believe now you didn't believe a few
years ago nothing very profound one
sorry to say that my basic fans haven't
changed much since childhood
of course I've learned a lot more than
much more to discover I wouldn't have
predicted in the 1970s extreme savagery
of the neoliberal period that was a
surprise and it's both Democrats and
Republicans so it takes a I'll talk
about the United States because I know
it never put the same things happened in
England the 1980 Reagan first act
destroyed the labor unions introduced
scabs illegal in just about every
country that's Hatcher did exactly the
same destroy the labor unions that's
understandable
they're the way in which the general
public can advance their own interests
into the forefront of social welfare
programs decent conditions were working
people and so on so we gotta get them
out of the way that makes me but they
did other things which are a little
surprise take a Reagan right now is true
you know there are tens of trillions of
dollars not small change which robbed
from the public by tax havens and stock
up until 1980
they're worried in fact they were
illegal and the Treasury Department
enforced the war so no tax havens no
stock buybacks to enrich management and
rich shareholders Reagan eliminated
comes along Clinton made it worse
under the Rubin Summers deregulation
mania it just extended
and it goes on through the of this
millennium the trough that's getting
worse the the fact that the leadership
would so utterly subordinate themselves
to concentrated private wealth and power
that came as a surprise maybe I was
naive they had the opportunity so they
should have understood it now we're in a
situation where what you see is almost
indescribable to take the United States
again epidemic region we need of
excellence
everybody understands that how does
Trump react by firing the chief
scientist who's in charge of vaccine
production in the government why now
because he dared to make some critical
comments about the quack medicines that
Trump is advertising in his tweets just
recently a couple weeks ago now there's
a program government program which has
been working with Chinese scientists to
identify coronaviruses
the training scientists that are going
deep into caves to try to locate that
it's a very dangerous work but they're
getting the other main source of
coronaviruses they're finding thousands
of new ones us scientists are working
with them it's all stored and the Moulin
Institute of hydrology best in the world
the Trump cancelled the program why
because he's desperately flailing about
to find some scapegoat to cover up his
crimes against Americans which are big
and one of them is fast track so since
this program is working with China we
have to kill it to make sure that the
threat of coronavirus will be much worse
there's a lot more of it isn't amazing
to me as not being discussed one of the
ways in which Trump is trying to find
some way to cover up his
crimes is to attack the World Health
Organization the grounds are to the
raisa need to discuss but he's defunded
and his administration
beyo has made very clear that they want
to destroy the organization that's a
possible way to improve his electoral
prospects by saying these horrible
international people were Mormons as a
sector of the population advise them
what's the effect of the worst
humanitarian crisis in the world is in
Yemen before survey surviving in Yemen
because of the help given to them by the
World Health Organization physicians and
medical services so lot of the Africa
the World Health Organization is
providing the basic support for a
defense against the myriad of diseases
coronavirus comes will be worse let him
die okay it'll improve my electoral
prospects do you see a word of
discussion about these this is
concentrated sadism but since you
mentioned my childhood it does bring
back childhood memories they know that
in 1936 one of the Frankel's top
generals gave the slogan for Frankie
down with intelligence up with death
okay
that's what we're living with destroy
the sciences do anything possible to
improve your electoral prospects kill as
many people isn't one that's the world
there are others not too distant there
are others actually working to save
their population New Zealand and
Australia has pretty much controlled the
violence
Taiwan South Korea
[Music]
pretty much out of control you take a
look at Europe this mentioned lessons
there to the powerhouse of Europe of
course is Germany Germany did succumb to
the neoliberal they call it order
liberal flee but not entirely not to the
extent of Britain in the United States
not so Germany kept spare of capacity in
hospitals didn't keep to the straight
business model spare capacity and
diagnostic so they were able to deal
with the virus when came they have
things pretty much under control there's
a country right themself with Germany
his name is Italy as a pretty severe
epidemic raging in northern is it are
they getting help from Germany no
there's something called the European
Union does the Union mean Germany
provides medical resources was sort of
beleaguered Italy not so far as I can
discover that fortunately Italy can turn
across the Atlantic to the powerhouse
near Cuba under us terrorists and
economic attack for 16 years Detroit at
crushing the Cuba sending doctors to
work in northern Italy and other places
in the world were medical aid is needed
that's called internationalism it's the
one example of legitimate
internationalism you don't find it
internally with the Union in fact
Germany's been trying to block euro
bonds which might be a way to distribute
to risk and support those in suffering
but but there is a country that's doing
the one that's under sharpest attack for
60 years of any in the world by the
reigning Super Bowl is there a lesson to
learn from them
think of a few things so yes if we look
around this there's a lot to learn there
are solutions there in hand the global
warming is well but somebody's got to do
something about it just as someone had
to do something about the pandemic in
2003 someone has to do something about
the one that's coming down the road
right now the passive informants Toby
sit in the corner we know what's going
to happen so you say that we have
solutions in hand um something that's
been happening a lot in recent weeks in
the US and elsewhere has been a kind of
wildcat strikes at Amazon warehouses and
other businesses do you much hope for
this kind of new revival of organized
labor in times of pandemic or do you
think that the crisis is opportunity to
crush unions I think that's a very good
question the Amazon strike first of all
the amazon work workplaces are about
that the worst thing you can imagine
Amazon workers are under extremely tight
ultra terrorist sir provision and
control if somebody they're racing from
one spot in the warehouse to another if
they make a wrong turn and don't go on
the prescribed path they immediately get
a notice that's a demerit they're in
trouble now you stop for a second to
talk to a friend you're in trouble they
have horrible working conditions they
first and forced to work without
protection so that Jeff Bezos can make
the tens of billions of extra dollars
and he's doing and they did you on
strike before the Quran arrives about
the horrible working conditions and
strikes have an effect Beezus agreed
immediately that's to pay I think ten
billion dollars into a fund for global
warming not to try to make the company
carbon free and
the decades not huge for him it's
anything but it's significant actions
have effect and that's nothing else
where to go back to the 1930s let's take
the United States again in the 1920s I
was born in 1928 1920s the labor
movement had been crushed there had been
a very vibrant significant labor
movement in the late 19th early 20th
century that have been crushed mostly by
state and corporate violence
it was killed off finally by Woodrow
Wilson's Red Scare there was nothing
there the Depression hit in 1929 to a
couple of years by 1930 for five years
the labor movement was reviving now very
significantly beginning to carry out
militant actions CIO was organizing the
moving and scores sit-down strikes those
are very frightening to business that
sit-down strike is one instant before
the recognition that we don't need two
bosses we can run this place by
ourselves get lost
it's a fragile system based on obedience
and consent there was a sympathetic
administration Roosevelt administration
so it did lead to quite significant
actions I couldn't remember this very
well my family my extended family will
first-generation immigrants
working-class mostly employed and deeply
involved in the rising union movement
parties even the circumstances were much
more onerous than they are today
there was a sense of hopefulness because
we're doing something we can get out of
this but it might come back no teacher
strikes the worker strike spreading
often in parts of the country that are
most heavy labor many things could
happen could change that I was thinking
back to the 30s say my childhood
remember what eventuated there was a
huge crisis the depression terrible
crisis countries took different ways act
now one of them was the way I just
destroyed the United States after too
much presidency did move towards the
significant steps towards meaningful
social democracy you can't use the word
socialist in the United States and boy
it's a curse word but it's essentially
what in Europe was told social
democratic policy New Zealand's only
there were other countries that reacted
differently the most important one is
Germany look at what happened the
Germany in the 1920s was the peak of
Western civilization
in the sciences the arts literature
philosophy is regarded as one of the
world's leading democracies by political
sciences a model of democracy
the euro was born 1928 Germany had an
election the Nazis Iran and I think they
got three percent of the vote the next
free election was 1932 the Nazis were
the dominant Authority though they went
on from being the most the peak of
Western civilization to the absolute
depths of human history within ten years
now returning that's one way out another
way out is the move to social democracy
now the situation's not identical no the
plenty of differences but there are also
similarities there are basically two
ways out of the current crisis one is
the one that is being pursued by private
wealth like corporate power that is to
create a post world
which is a harsher more brutal more
cruel form of neoliberalism
to put the climate crisis Koufos I may
be doing a few things but not much
because there's not much profit and
working on it to put aside the threat of
nuclear war that's one way out not
identical to the Nazi way out but that's
imprisoned
the other way out is struggle for
people's rights for more democracy for
more control of institutions will move
towards programs that are oriented
toward the public nonprofit the way that
was taken by the United States under
Roosevelt for the country so those are
choices basically the same choices in a
simple phrase oversimplifying but not
too much it's what's called class war
one side and the class war is relentless
they never stop if the other stuff they
win
wonderful that's very interesting
now I'd like to ask you a few questions
have been submitted by our members and
some members of the general public so
one thing that few people curious about
so Lauren and maudlin and Sam Trudy were
curious about was how far do you feel
your political and philosophical writing
impacted your linguistic work and vice
versa yeah there's no logical connection
one can and many do dedicate themselves
to one strand and either take no
position in a position say totally
opposite to mind on the other either way
but that's perfectly possible there is a
kind of deeper connection of an abstract
sword
both in my own case at least both the
linguistic work and the political
activism worth traced back to a concept
that has deep roots in the Enlightenment
early modern science Descartes and
others the reckon the recognition that
the core of human nature core part of
human nature is a kind of an instinct
for freedom creativity you see it in
language the core of human language
recognized by Galileo and his
contemporaries by Descartes they later
thinkers were no both than others the
core of human language is what's been
called it's created us but the capacity
to produce the new expressions of
thought without limit having nothing to
do with virtually nothing to do with
training creative instinct in ways that
are appropriate situations but not
determined by them
if the Cartesians put it you're in hell
you're induced to act in certain ways
but not from Devils for your free choice
well that's essentially the roots of
modern authentic libertarian thought
talking about what's going today well
their core concept is that
form of authority is has a burden of
proof unless it can justify itself it's
illegitimate should be overcome okay
because human dignity and freedom and
creativity are the fundamental object
that we want to preserve and enhance
educational systems are the same so on
so there's a kind of commonality but you
can't draw any the deductive conclusions
from yes so I'm picking up on that
question of proof and evidence there's
questions about this from Emma from
Emmanuel College Cambridge
she asks tend the concept of ug
universal grammar they've proven any
more concretely than it has been I'm
sorry I'm can the concept of universal
grammar be proven any more concretely
than it has been really Universal
grammar a little bit misunderstood
outside of the places where people work
on it a universal grammar for the last
fifteen or sixteen years has been used
in a technical sense it borrows from the
traditional notion but modifies it
within a different framework the
universal grammar traditionally meant
principles and properties you can find
in all languages it doesn't quite mean
that what it refers to is the biological
endowment genetic endowment that enables
you and me to do what we're now doing
but is totally lacking in every other so
humans have a specific Faculty of
language it's a species character as far
as we know it's common to the species
there's no group differences that are
known a child born in Cambridge who
grows up in with a problem of Guinea
tribe
though their language and conversely you
know of no differences
it's your Neath the unit's though
there's nothing the reason there's
nothing closely analogous apparently
developed pretty much along with normal
sapiens a couple hundred thousand years
ago the universal grammar is just the
name for whatever that biological
endowment is now there's the research
over the last sixty or seventy years at
least the kind that I'm personally
interested in that's been primarily
devoted to trying to determine what they
system is the early proposals back in
the 50s were extremely complex the main
the goal then was just this a new
approach to language to see if he could
just account for the massive new
discoveries that were coming on it had
been thought for that almost everything
was known as soon as he started working
on generators brown eyed turned out
nothing was known you had to start
homeless was great so lots of new things
were being discovered yet to see can I
find mechanisms that will enable me to
capture them they were way too complex
everybody knew today the main tasks over
the years has been to reduce the
complexity to show you can get deeper
results with simpler more general
mechanisms finally reached a point in
the 1990s when I think we're coming
close to something like genuine
explanation that is principles of
universal grammar which are simple
enough so that you can give a plausible
evolutionary account of their origin and
that alone are able to account for many
of the most striking features of
language so that's Universal grammar
it's not what people usually mean thank
you so I'm returning to politics at that
wholly from
College asks do you think that the UK
Labour Party has a hope left to be a
vehicle for legitimate change well
correct me if I'm wrong you know more
about it than I do but I've been
following as much as I can as far as I
understand that the korbinite party
expanded very quickly is on the move to
becoming a membership party for the
first time long time but did very well
in 2017 surprising everyone biggest
victory in Labour's history the moving
on the party's programs seem to remain
popular and I look at you go polls about
people's preferences that seems that the
policies that the korbinite party
introduced are still popular the face
that was asked me in the last election
so the seems fear major gap between what
happened to the party and what happened
to its principles okay if we look at
what happened to the party and our
number of things for one thing it was
under enormous attack from the
parliamentary party new labour you know
the old guard they wanted to destroy
this it was pretty obvious before but
after the revelations of this latest 800
pages of documents
same across the baby the hatred of the
1400s for Gordon then came this assault
about anti-semitism almost complete
fraud you know there's some
anti-semitism and the Labour Party less
probably than almost anywhere else in
English but a huge campaign was launched
know based on outrageous fabrications
exposed over again
what there was no it was marginal it was
mainly an attack on the party for being
daring to be supportive of Palestinian
rights not alone okay
they handled it very badly Corbin is a
very decent human being he's not a
fighter he couldn't he couldn't respond
but he just let it pass then came brexit
Corbin just couldn't take a position you
couldn't say yes couldn't say no but it
all dislike it in one way or another it
didn't work for the former Labour
constituency now there's a deeper
problem there the Labour had not been
organizing effectively and it's old
constituency northern former industrial
area didn't take much for them to switch
to somebody who seemed to be offering
live imply in the sky
somehow pressure will solve all your
problems but at least they were saying
something
well all of this led according to polls
to extreme dislike of Corbin personally
and drifting the way of support now kind
of come back well if it's true that the
policies still have support then a
different approach can lead to a
comeback and lead to an authentic
participatory party that is devoted to
means and interests of the general
population can happen but take a lot of
work and reflection and self-criticism
yes so I'm one thing that the New Labour
leader pierced Armour has tried to do in
his first moments has been to brand
labour a more patriotic party so I think
that's in response to kind of some of
the media criticisms during last
election about terrorism and other
issues
um do you think that progressive
patriotism is a productive angle for
Laughs in Britain or get and what's
patriotism is it my country right or
wrong or I want to make my country
better which kind of patriotism do you
want as far as I see it
people like Corbin are the true patriots
you have to wave a sign saying I'm
patriotic here's the Union Jack that's
not patriotism any person a totalitarian
state can do that if you are serious you
seriously care about your country
you'll criticize what's wrong try to
improve what's right actually there is
an international movement just beginning
this first was opening was yesterday and
faith which is dedicated to true
internationalism and authentic
patriotism in this then that's the
progressive international that was
launched officially yesterday of course
there's no mention of it in the United
States some in England was not as
initiated by Bernie Sanders in the
United States than by Yanis varoufakis
in Europe the founder of the the m25 the
transnational European movement which is
seeking to salvage what makes sense in
the European Union and to overcome the
very serious cause front they're
bringing in the global South many
representatives from Africa and Asia
elsewhere it could be again this depends
on people's commitment but it could be
the basis for the move towards genuine
internationalism mutually
it's progressive policies overcoming the
rock of the new liberal period and
moving on not just to what was but what
can be much better can't happen it's
only one of two internationals that are
developing there's another one take a
look at the chaos and Trump's White
House it's a little hard to determine
any coherent strategy but there is one
just formally described frequently by
Steve Madden obviously what's going on
construct the reactionary international
based in the White House which will
bring together the world's most
reactionary large states so in the
Western Hemisphere leading candidate is
Brazil under Xavier Bolton Otto he's a
kind of apathetic Trump clone so Brazil
will be a major party in the Middle East
all season Egypt the most brutal
dictatorship in Egypt's history there
Trump's favorite dictator as inputs it
there are natural member of the Gulf
family dictatorships nice people like
NBS better members Israel's of quorum
then we shifted so far to the right you
need a telescope to find it because had
tacit links with the Gulf dictatorships
for a long time they're not coming go
further east Modi's India is a very
natural candidate Modi is devoted to
destroying Indian secular democracy
instituting the ultra-right to end it
both were nationalists we knew the
control the crushing Kashmir with some
population within of these member and I
moved to Europe or bonds monger
e-learning indicators
they're mighty willful if Neil Faraj
could win in England this perfect member
Boris Johnson's vacillates too much
salvini in Italy lead obvious members so
put this together under white house
direction the Progressive International
is a counter to same class Wars before
question is which will prevail that
depends on the world population at the
level of States the reactionary
international has all the power at the
level of people it's very different but
as always depends whether the people
will react and the rich and powerful are
nervous very nervous now you may have
seen about a year ago
talk about a hundred and fifty top US
executives CEOs of major banks
cooperation so they came together and
issued a manifesto as a manifesto
basically said yes we realize we've been
making mistakes
during those neoliberal years we've been
profiting enormously and farming
everybody else that was a mistake
we're not going to do that anymore that
we're going to be to devote ourselves to
stakeholders workers communities weird
really nice guys not trust us so now
we're on a better path so that was
interestingly duplicated that's the
latest Davos means you know every year
the people who are called the Masters in
the universe get together in Davos
Switzerland go skiing have parties and
tell each other how wonderful they are
and so on this last meeting was
different they did all those things but
they also have the theme of the meeting
was the same as the theme of
those executives yes we made mistakes
we realize that we're gonna become
better we're going to work for you put
your trust in us we're going to take
care of you no you peasants out there
put down your pitchforks and go back
home
we've got everything those who have a
little memory an advantage years old you
can remember the 1950s when the motto
was what's called soulful corporations
the corporate the the leading
intellectuals on the liberal left it's
immediately telling us corporations have
learned that they can't be just out for
themselves they're becoming souls for a
corporation okay we've seen at 60 years
to see just how soulful they on know now
they're becoming soul food again why
because people are beating the doors
they know there's a problem so they have
to react at least in words maybe
partially in actions and the pressure
keeps on new movements develop organize
things like the climate strike was like
they can win with to address the videos
available that will be played in every
classroom in the world in every very
forceful and revealing the first keynote
address was of course by the master of
the world
David don't like his vulgarity is petty
megalomania undermine the image that
they're trying to project so it's not
the kind of person they would welcome
into the forties but they gave another
rousing of
was stand up applause love didn't why
because they realized that he
understands the one thing that matters
policy has to be directed to pouring
money into the right pockets hours as
long as he does that we don't care that
much about his crazed antics
okay so he gets cheered after him comes
a seventeen-year-old girl
Greta Thunder quiet factual brief
comment describing what's happening
actually accurately forcefully ending up
by turning to the audience and saying
you're betraying us
you're robbing us of our childhood it's
right of course she got some mild little
padding on the head and saying nice go
back to school we'll take care of more
that should be shown everywhere that's a
symbol of the modern age a dramatic
symbol of now we should be thinking
about those things we can be on one side
or the other if we're passive were on
the side of the master especially in
free societies like ours silence equals
acquiescence and support yeah great
thanks so much um one last question I
think so you said in response to last
question that Jerry Corbin's result in
2017 with a huge victory for labor but
given that it didn't actually produce
parliamentary majority and no labor
government has gotten the parliamentary
majority since 2005 do you think that
the organizing work you say needs to be
done in formerly industrial towns in the
Midlands and North England can actually
happen the next five years or do you
think that things got too bad you need
more time the example of my childhood
again 1929
labor movement was in the United States
virtually dead 1934 there was a raging
torrent which led the way to the New
Deal measures in the revival of decent
income decent in American society five
years okay
doesn't have to be 5,000 can be less we
have many more ways of backing
organizing the world is a much been a
lot of regression but overall the world
is a much much civilize place that
wasn't a lot of battles have been won
can be put in the background they
weren't given by gifts they were won by
struggle but they're there now the
world's a much more civilized place than
it was 50 years ago young people often
forget this they think everything you
know there's no vote take a look at the
United States fifty years ago I was a
young man the United States had
anti-miscegenation laws that were so
harsh that the Nazis refused to adopt
them because they want you to wash one
drop of blood and your blood you have
any great-great grandmother was a slave
you're out did not of course any sodomy
laws no Saudi Britain Britain as you may
recall murdered one of the great
mathematicians of the century the
British war hero who broke the German
code murdered him because he was a
homosexual that was Britain in the
fifties in the United States there was
federal housing government supportive
housing but by law it couldn't include
blacks had to be pure white the liberal
senators who voted for that Navy but
that was the only way they could get any
housing through the Senate Stocking
dominated by Southern Democrats women's
rights non-existent
there's been a lot of change in 50 years
now there can be plenty of change ahead
but not if you sit there obediently in a
quiescent and again in free societies
acquiescence equals support because you
can do swings you choose with it do it
that's a very hopeful message and this
discussion on so that's very nice thank
you so much for coming everyone
