the word terror is one that rightly
arouses strong emotions and deep
concerns the primary concern naturally
should be to take measures to alleviate
the threat it has been severe in the
past and it's likely that it will be
even more so in the future to proceed
with this in some serious way we should
have established a few guidelines here
are several simple ones the first is
that facts matter even if we don't
happen to like them the second is that
elementary moral principles matter even
if they have consequences that we would
prefer not to face and third is that
relative clarity matters so it's
pointless to seek a truly precise
definition of terror or for that matter
of any other concept outside of the hard
sciences and mathematics and often not
even there but we should seek enough
clarity at least to be able to
distinguish terror from two notions that
lie uneasily at its borders aggression
one end and legitimate resistance at the
other terror finds its place somewhere
between those two well if we accept
these guidelines there are actually
quite constructive ways to deal with the
problem of terrorism which are again
quite severe it's commonly claimed that
critics of ongoing policies that do not
present solutions if you check the
record I think you'll find something
else you'll find that there's an
accurate translation of that charge
namely they do present solutions a very
constructive ones but I don't like them
so therefore they don't present
solutions suppose then that we
except these simple guidelines and now
turn to the war on terror well since
we've agreed that facts matter it
matters that the war on terror was not
declared by George W Bush on 9/11 but by
the Reagan administration 20 years
earlier they came into office declaring
that their foreign policy would confront
what the president called the evil
scourge of terrorism a plague spread by
depraved opponents of civilization
itself in a return to barbarism in the
modern age it's the Secretary of State
the campaign was directed against a
particularly virulent form of the plague
state-directed international terrorism
the main focus of the war on terror was
Central America and the Middle East but
it reached the southern Africa in
Southeast Asia and Beyond a second fact
is that the war was declared and
implemented by pretty much the same
people who are conducting the read
eclair war on terrorism the civilian
component of the Rida clared war on
terror is led by John Negroponte II who
was appointed last year to supervise all
counter-terror operations returned to
some of his tasks during the first phase
of the war the military component of the
Rida Claridon war on terror is led by
Donald Rumsfeld during the first phase
of the war on terror Rumsfeld was Reagan
President Reagan's special
representative to the Middle East and
there his main task was to establish
close relations with Saddam Hussein so
that the United States could provide him
with large-scale aid including means to
develop weapons of mass destruction all
of this continuing long after the huge
atrocities
the Kurds and after the end of the war
with Iran the official purpose of the
continuing aid was not concealed it was
as President Bush number one put it it
was Washington's responsibility to aid
American exporters and also quoting now
the strikingly unanimous view of
Washington and its allies Britain and
Saudi Arabia that whatever the sins of
the Iraqi leader he offered the West and
the region a better hope for his
country's stability than did those who
have suffered his repression now that's
the New York Times Middle East
correspondent describing Washington's
judgment as George Bush number one
authorized Saddam to crush the Shiite
rebellion in 1991 which probably would
have overthrown the tyrant in this case
leaving tens of thousands of corpses
Saddam is at last on trial for his
crimes the first trial which is now
underway is for crimes that he committed
in 1980 to 1982 happens to be an
important year in u.s. Iraq relations it
was in 1982 that Reagan removed Iraq
from the list of states supporting
terror us the reason was so that it aid
could flow to his friend in Baghdad
Rumsfeld then visited Baghdad to confirm
the arrangements
judging by media and journals of opinion
it would be impolite to mention any of
these facts so I beg your pardon
let alone to suggest that some others
might be standing alongside Saddam
before the bar of justice removing it
Iraq Saddam from the list of states
supporting terrorism Left gap that gap
was at once filled by Cuba and perhaps
in recognition of the fact that the u.s.
terrorists wars
Ljuba from 1961 had just peeked at that
time including events that would be on
the front pages right now in societies
that valued their freedom well return
briefly to some of them since the first
war on terror was waged by those who are
now carrying out the Reda clared war or
their immediate Mentors
it follows that anyone who's seriously
interested in the Reda clared war on
terror should ask at once how it was
carried out in the 1980s that topic
however is under a virtual ban and that
becomes understandable as soon as we
investigate the facts the first war on
terror very quickly became a murderous
and brutal terrorist war in every corner
of the world where it reached there
leaving traumatized societies that may
never recover
what happened is hardly obscure but it's
doctrinally unacceptable and therefore
it's protected from inspection
unearthing the record which is not very
difficult is an enlightening exercise
with enormous implications for the
future well these are a few of the
relevant facts let's turn to the second
of the guidelines elementary moral
principles the most elementary so
elementary that I'm embarrassed to
mention it is a virtual truism decent
people apply to themselves the same
standards that they apply to others in
fact more stringent ones adherence to
this principle of universality would
have many useful consequences for one
thing it would save a lot of forests the
principal would radically reduce
published reports and commentary on
social and political affairs it would
virtually eliminate the newly
fashionable discipline of Just War
Theory it would wipe the slate that
slate almost clean with regard to the
war on terror and the reason is the same
in all cases
many others to the principle of
universality is rejected for the most
part tacitly sometimes explicitly these
are very sweeping statements and I'm
purposely putting them in a stark form
to invite you to challenge them and I
hope that you do so you'll find I think
that although the statements are very
slightly overdrawn on purpose they
nevertheless are uncomfortably true too
close to accurate and in fact very fully
documented but try for yourselves and
see actually here's another one you
might try from the front pages in
England at least in England the
principle of universality would
terminate virtually all media and
publishers in England under Tony Blair's
proposed Aires proposed glorification of
Terror Act which actually was voted down
by the Lord's who proposed instead a ban
on indirect encouragement of terror well
that I repeat that law which will be
passed in one or another form will shut
down virtually every publisher and
journal in England does this statement
sound extreme well not if facts matter
if they do then the statement is in fact
quite conservative and therefore
regarded as outrageous by the educated
classes and the two proposals would have
rather similar consequences again I urge
you just to think it through and look at
the facts this most elementary of moral
truisms is sometimes upheld at least in
words one example of critical importance
today is the Nuremberg Tribunal which
sentenced Nazi criminals in sentencing
them to death the Justice Robert Robert
Jackson who is the chief of counsel for
the prospects
for the United States and the tribunal
he spoke eloquently and memorably on the
principle of universality 1945 here's
what he said if certain acts of
violation of treaties are crimes they
are crimes whether the United States
does them or whether Germany does them
and we are not prepared to lay down a
rule of criminal conduct against others
which we would not be willing to have
invoked against us we must never forget
that the record on which we judge these
defendants is the record on which
history will judge us tomorrow to pass
these defendants a poison chalice is to
put it to our own lips as well that's a
clear and honorable statement of the
principle of universality but the
judgment at Nuremberg which had just
concluded curly violated that principle
consciously and explicitly the tribunal
had the task of defining war crime and
crimes against humanity it crafted these
definitions very carefully so that
crimes are criminal only if they were
not committed by the Allies so urban
bombing of civilian concentrations was
excluded from the tribunal because the
Allies carried it out and were
barbarically than the Nazis and Nazi war
criminals like Admiral Dennett's
submarine the submarine fleet he was
able to plead successfully that the his
British and US counterparts had carried
out the same practices so therefore he
was exonerated of those charges the
reasoning was outlined by Telford Taylor
he's a distinguished international
lawyer an historian who was Jackson's
chief counsel for war crimes he
explained his words that to punish the
foe especially the vanquished foe for
conduct in which the enforcing nation
has
gaged would be so grossly inequitable as
to discredit the laws themselves that's
quite correct but the operative
definition of crime also discredits the
laws themselves and subsequent tribunals
are discredited by the same moral flaw
but the self exemption of the powerful
from international law and elementary
moral principles bars any discussion of
these unwelcome truisms
well let's turn to the third background
issue the defining terror and
distinguishing it from aggression and
legitimate resistance actually I've been
writing about terror for 25 years ever
since the Reagan administration came
into office declaring its war on terror
and I've been using definitions that
seem doubly appropriate first of all
they make sense and secondly there they
are the official definitions of those
who are waging the war so to take one of
these official definitions terrorism is
the calculated use of violence or threat
of violence to attain goals that are
political religious or ideological in
nature through intimidation coercion or
instilling fear typically targeting
civilians the British government's
definition is about the same terrorism
this is the use or threat of action
which is violent damaging or disrupting
and is intended to influence the
government or intimidate the public and
is for the purpose of advancing a
political religious or ideological cause
these definitions seem fairly clear
pretty close to ordinary usage and there
also seems to be general agreement that
they are appropriate when discussing the
terrorism of enemies but a problem
arises at once these definitions yield
an entirely unacceptable consequence it
follows that the United States is a
leading terrorist state and the same is
true of what's been called the spear
carrier for Pax Americana that's
referring to Tony Blair's Britain and
Britain's leading journal of
International Affairs this was true
dramatically during the Reagan ID war on
terror just to take the most
uncontroversial case Reagan's state
directed terrorist war against Nicaragua
was condemned by the world court backed
by two
curity council resolutions both vetoed
by the United States with Britain
politely abstaining another completely
clear case is Cuba since 1961 where the
record by now is voluminous and not
controversial and there's a long list
beyond them however we may ask a
question about these terrorist crimes we
may ask for example whether the state
directed terror against Nicaragua was
really terrorism or whether it rises to
the level of the much higher crime of
aggression the concept of aggression was
defined clearly enough by justice
Jackson at Nuremberg in terms that were
basically reiterated by in an
authoritative General Assembly
resolution with no objections an
aggressor Jackson proposed to the
tribunal is a state that is the first to
commit such actions as invasion of its
Armed Forces with or without a
declaration of war of the territory of
another state or provision of support to
armed bands formed in the territory of
another state or refusal notwithstanding
the request of the invaded state to take
in its own territory all the measures in
its power to deprive those bands of all
assistance or protection well the first
of those provisions unambiguously
applies to the u.s. British invasion of
Iraq and the second justice clearly
applies to the u.s. war against
Nicaragua which means that the Nuremberg
judgment is appropriate however we might
give the current incumbents in
Washington and their European allies the
benefit of the doubt considering them
guilty only of the lesser crime of
international terrorism huge and
unprecedented scale the World Court
interestingly did not condemn the Reagan
administration for aggression in
Nicaragua case and the reasons are
instructive and have quite considerable
contemporary relevance
Nicaragua's case at the world court was
presented by the distinguished Harvard
University law professor Abram J's
former legal adviser to the State
Department the court however rejected a
large part of his case on the grounds
that when the United States accepted the
jurisdiction of the World Court in 1946
it did so only after entering a
reservation excluding itself from
prosecution under multilateral treaties
including the UN Charter so therefore
it's barred from prosecution for
aggression the court accepted that and
therefore restricted its deliberations
to customary international law and a
bilateral u.s. Nicaragua treaty so that
the more serious charges were excluded
and even on these very narrow grounds
the court did charge Washington with
unlawful use of force that's in lay
language international terrorism and
ordered it to terminate the crimes and
pay substantial reparations the Reagan
administration reacted by escalating the
war with bipartisan support
after the shattered country fell back
under US control it declined to further
misery it's now the second poorest
country in Latin America after Haiti and
by accident also second after Haiti in
intensity of US intervention in the past
century the standard way to lament these
tragedies is to say that Haiti and
Nicaragua are battered by storms of
their own making I'm quoting the Boston
Globe
which is at the liberal extreme of
American journalism Guatemala ranked
searches at the liberal extreme of
American journalism Guatemala ranks
third in both misery and US intervention
another one of those curious aberrations
that litter history all placed on the
index for obvious reasons these
considerations have to do with the
boundary between terror and aggression
what about the boundary between terror
and resistance legitimate resistance one
question that arises is the legitimacy
of actions and now quoting the
legitimacy of actions to realize the
right to self-determination freedom and
independence as derived from the charter
of the United Nations of people forcibly
deprived of that right particularly
peoples under colonial and racist
regimes and foreign occupation do such
actions fall under terror or resistance
well the quoted words are from the most
forceful denunciation of the crime of
terrorism by the UN General Assembly
that was in December 1987 it was taken
up under Reaganite pressure
hence it's obviously an important
resolution it's even more important
because of the near unanimity of support
for it the resolution passed 153 to two
with one country Honduras abstaining the
resolution stated that nothing in the
present resolution could in any way
prejudice the right to
self-determination freedom and
independence as characterized in the
words I just quoted well the two
countries that voted against the
resolution explained their reasons at
the UN session the reasons were based on
the paragraph that I just quoted the
phrase colonial and racist regimes was
understood to refer to their ally
apartheid South Africa which was then
consummating it's horrendous massacres
in the neighboring countries and
continuing its brutal repress
within and evidently the United States
and Israel the two countries that voted
against that could not condone
resistance to the apartheid regime
particularly when the resistance was led
by Nelson Mandela's African National
Congress which is was one of the world's
more notorious terrorist groups as
Washington determined at the same time
granting legitimacy against foreign
occupation was also unacceptable the
phrase was understood to refer to
Israel's us-backed military occupation
than in its 20th year and evidently
resistance to that occupation could not
be condoned either even though at the
time of the resolution the resistance
scarcely existed despite extensive
torture degradation brutality robbery of
land and resources and other familiar
concomitant of military occupation
Palestinians still remained what they
called Sammy Dean those who quietly
endure well technically there are no
vetoes at the General Assembly but in
the real world
negative u.s. vote is a veto in fact
it's a double veto the resolution is not
implemented and it's vetoed from
reporting and from history has happened
in this case it should be added that the
voting pattern is quite common at the
General Assembly and also at the
Security Council on a very wide range of
issues
ever since the mid 1960s when the world
fell pretty much out of control after
decolonization the United States is far
in the lead in Security Council vetoes
it's spear carrier is second and no one
else comes even close it's also of some
interest to note that a majority of the
American public favors abandonment of
the veto and following the will of the
majority even if Washington disapproves
those are facts virtually unknown in the
United States
sir I suppose elsewhere that suggests
another conservative way to deal with
the problems of the world pay attention
to public opinion terrorism directed or
supported by the most powerful States
continues to the present often in
shocking ways these facts offer another
useful suggestion as to how to mitigate
the plague spread by depraved opponents
of civilization itself namely stop
participating in terror and stop
supporting it that would certainly
contribute to the proclaimed objectives
but that suggestion too is off the
agenda for the usual reasons however
even with careful sanitation of
discussion dilemmas constantly arise one
has just arisen in the past few weeks
when Luis Posada
Carolus entered the United States
illegally even by the narrowest
definition of terror he is clearly one
of the most notorious international
terrorists from the 1960s to the present
Venezuela requested that he be
extradited to face charges for the
bombing of a Cuban airliner in Venezuela
killing 73 people the charges are
admittedly credible but there's a real
difficulty after Venezuela after Posada
miraculously escaped from a Venezuelan
prison the liberal Boston Globe reports
he was hired by us covered operatives to
direct the Sabri supply operation for
the Nicaraguan Contras from El Salvador
that is he was hired to play a prominent
role in terrorist atrocities that are
incomparable worse than blowing up the
Cubana
airliner and therefore there's a dilemma
to continue quoting the same report
extraditing him for trial would send a
worrisome signal to
foreign agents that they cannot count on
unconditional protection from the US
government and it would expose the CIA
to embarrassing public disclosures from
a former operative it's clearly a
difficult problem this is just the past
few weeks the Posada dilemma was
thankfully resolved by the courts which
rejected Venezuela's appeal for his
extradition in violation of u.s.
Venezuela
extradition treaty a day later the head
of the FBI Robert Mueller urged Europe
to speed us demands for extradition he
said we are always looking to see how we
can make the extradition process go
faster we think we owe it to victims of
terrorism to see to it that justice is
done efficiently and effectively at the
eye Bureau American summit all let heads
of Latin American States and Spain
shortly after the leaders of Spain and
the Latin American countries backed
Venezuela's efforts to have Posada
extradited from the United States to
face trial for the Cuban airliner
bombing and they again condemned what
they called the blockade of Cuba by the
United States and they were endorsing
near-unanimous
United Nations resolutions the most
recent a few weeks ago with a vote of
179 for the four were United
states-israel Marshall Islands and Palau
after strong protests from the US
Embassy the summit withdrew the call for
extradition but refused to yield on the
demand for an end to economic warfare
Posada is therefore now free to join his
colleague Orlando Bosch in Miami Bosh is
implicated in dozens of terrorist crimes
including the Shabana airliner bombing
many of these crimes on US soil the FBI
and the Justice Department
wanted him deported as a threat to US
national security but Bush number one
took care of that by granting him a
presidential pardon
notice that this goes well beyond both
cases well beyond indirect encouragement
of terror which is to be criminalized in
Britain with consequences that you can
deduce one consequence would be that
every journal or publisher in England is
to be banned because of their praise for
George Bush number one and participation
with him and these and other activities
under the legislation that's proposed by
New Labour and the dissenting House of
Lords one might have thought that a
dilemma would have arisen as well when
John Negroponte II was appointed to the
position of head of counterterrorism
last year he was the ambassador to
Honduras in the 1980s where he was
running the world's largest CIA station
and not because of the grand role of
Honduras and world affairs but because
Honduras was the primary US base for the
international terrorist war which
Washington was for which Washington was
condemned by the world court and the
Security Council absent the veto
negroponte II had the task of ensuring
that the international terrorist
operations would proceed efficiently his
responsibilities also included
pressuring and bribing senior Honduran
generals to step up their support for
the terrorist war the most vicious of
the Honduran killers and torturers was
general Alvarez Martinez who's the head
chief of the Honduran armed forces at
the time they had informed the United
States that in his words he intended
armed forces at the time he had informed
the United States that in his words he
intended to use the Argentine method of
eliminating suspected subversive
no comment necessary on that Negroponte
a regularly denied it gruesome state
crimes in Honduras to ensure that
military aid would continue to flow for
international terrorism knowing all
about Alvarez the Reagan administration
awarded him the Legion of Merit medal
for formal words for encouraging the
success of democratic processes in
Honduras which tells you something about
democracy promotion when the government
of Honduras finally got around to trying
to deal with these crimes and to bring
the perpetrators to justice the Reagan
and Bush number-one administration
refused to allow Negroponte II to
testify as the Honduran courts had
requested coming back to the present
there was virtually no reaction to the
appointment of a leading international
terrorist to the top counterterrorism
position in the world nor was there any
reaction to the fact that at the very
same time the heroine of the popular
struggle that overthrew the vicious
Somoza regime in Nicaragua Dora
Maria Telus was denied a visa to teach
at the Harvard Divinity School on the
grounds that she was a terrorist her
crime was that she had helped overthrow
the us-backed tyrant and mass murderer
or will I think would not have known
whether to laugh or to weep now that's
today so far I've been keeping to the
kinds of topics that would be addressed
in a discussion of the war on terror
that was not deformed in accord with the
iron laws of doctrine and this barely
scratches the surface but let's now
adopt Western hypocrisy and cynicism and
keep to the operative definition of
terror which is the same as the official
definition but with the nuremberg
exception admissible terror it is your
terror ours is exempt
even with this constraint terror is a
major problem undoubtedly and to
mitigate or terminate the threat of
should be a high priority regrettably it
is not
the invasion of Iraq is perhaps the most
glaring example of the low priority
assigned by US and British leaders to
the threat of terror they had been
advised by their own intelligence
agencies and others that the invasion
was likely to increase the threat of
terror and indeed it did as the same
intelligence agencies confirm to take
just one of many illustrations last May
the CIA reported that Iraq has become a
magnet for Islamic militants similar to
Soviet occupied Afghanistan two days ago
two decades ago and Bosnia in the 1990s
the CIA concluded that Iraq may prove to
be an even more effective training
ground for Islamic extremists than
Afghanistan was in al-qaeda's early
years because it is serving as a
real-world laboratory for urban combat
shortly after the London bombing last
July Chatham House released a study
concluding their words there is no doubt
that the invasion of Iraq has given a
boost to the al-qaeda network in
propaganda recruitment and fundraising
while providing an ideal training ground
for terrorists and leaves the UK United
Kingdom at particularly
because it is the closest ally of the
United States and is a pillion passenger
of American policy in Iraq and
Afghanistan writing behind the driver of
the motorcycle and in fact terrorist
crimes sharply escalated in the
following year approximately tripled
well there's extensive supporting
evidence to show that as anticipated the
invasion increased the risk of terror
and nuclear proliferation
none of that shows that planners prefer
these consequences of course rather
they're not of much concern in
comparison with much higher priorities
priorities that are obscure only to
those who prefer what human rights
researchers sometimes call intentional
ignorance widely distributed plague
among the educated once again we find
very easily a way to reduce the threat
of terror
stop acting in ways that predictably
enhance the threat well the enhancement
of the threat of terror and
proliferation was anticipated in the
invasion of Iraq the invasion actually
did so even in unanticipated ways it's
common to say that no weapons of mass
destruction were found in Iraq after an
exhaustive search however that's not
quite accurate there were stores of
weapons of mass destruction in Iraq
namely those that were produced in the
1980s
thanks to aid provided by the United
States and Britain along with others
these sites had been secured by UN
inspectors who were in fact dismantling
the weapons but the inspectors were
dismissed by the invaders and the sites
were left unguarded the inspectors
nevertheless continued to carry out
their work with satellite imagery they
discovered sophisticated massive looting
of these installations in over a hundred
sites that includes weapons includes
equipment for producing solid and liquid
propellant missiles and bio toxins and
other materials usable for chemical and
biological weapons and also
high-precision equipment capable of
making parts for nuclear and chemical
weapons and missiles a Jordanian
journalist who was monitoring the
Jordanian Iraqi border found that after
the US UK forces took over radioactive
materials were detected in one out of
every eight trucks crossing to Jordan
destination on
and we'd rather not yes well the ironies
are almost inescapable inexpressible the
official justification for the US UK
invasion was to prevent the use of
weapons of mass destruction that did not
exist
the invasion provided the terrorists who
had been mobilized by the US and its
allies with the means to develop weapons
of mass destruction the namely equipment
that they had provided the Saddam
Hussein carrying nothing about the
terrible crimes that were later invoked
to whip up support for the invasion
it's as if Iran were now making nuclear
weapons using fissionable material
provided by the u.s. to Iran under the
Shah which may indeed be happening all
of these would be headlines and boldface
and every newspaper in a free country in
the world that's concerned with the
truth of the important truths you can
judge how many times you've read it
turning to another domain the US
Treasury Department has a bureau that's
assigned the task of investigating
suspicious financial transfers it's a
central component of the war on terror
in April 2004 the bureau gave its
regular report to Congress and it
informed Congress that of its hundred
and twenty employees four were assigned
to tracking the finances of Osama bin
Laden and Saddam Hussein well six times
that many were occupied with enforcing
the embargo against Cuba something else
about priorities this goes way back from
1990 to 2003 there were 93 terrorism
related investigations with nine
thousand dollars in fines and eleven
thousand Cuba related investigations
with eight million dollars in fines the
revelations
of course received the silent treatment
in the US media and elsewhere as well to
my knowledge well why should the
Treasury Department to vote vastly more
energy to strangling Cuba than to the
war on terror well the basic reasons
were explained in internal documents of
the Kennedy Johnson years State
Department planners warned that in their
words the very existence of the Castro
regime is successful defiance of US
policies going back a hundred and fifty
years to the Monroe Doctrine notice not
Russians but intolerable defiance of the
master of the hemisphere much like
Iran's crime of successful defiance in
1979 punishment of the population of
Cuba was regarded as fully legitimate so
we also learned from internal documents
the Eisenhower State Department
concluded decided that in their words
the Cuban people are responsible for the
regime so therefore the United States
has the right to cause them to suffer by
economic strangulation later escalated
to direct and very serious terror by
Kennedy Eisenhower and Kennedy agreed
that the embargo would hasten Fidel
Castro's departure as a result of what
they called rising discomfort among
hungry Cubans and notice that all of
that fits to a tea the definition of
terror quite apart from the direct
terrorist acts which were serious and so
it continued when Cuba was in dire
stacks which were serious and so it
continued when Cuba was in dire straits
after the collapse of the Soviet Union
Washington intensified the punishment of
the people of Cuba at the initiative of
Liberal Democrats the author of the 1992
resolution to tighten the blockade
proclaimed that
objective is to wreak havoc in Cuba
that's New Jersey Liberal Democrat
Robert Torricelli and all of that
continues to the present moment
putting the war on terror very deep in
the shadows because much less important
than this
if reducing the threat of terror were a
high priority for Washington or London
there would be ways to proceed even
apart from the unmentionable idea of
withdrawing participation the first step
plainly is to try to understand its
roots with regard to Islamic terror
there's a broad consensus among
intelligence agencies and researchers
they identify two categories on the one
hand are the jihadis organized by the US
and its allies in the 1980s they regard
themselves as a vanguard it's one
category the other category is their
audience which may reject terror but
nevertheless regards the cause of the
jihad ease is just so a serious counter
terror campaign would therefore begin by
considering the grievances and where
appropriate addressing them as should be
done with or without the threat of
terror it's an experience in Ireland
about this there's broad agreement among
specialists that al-qaeda style terror
I'm quoting is today less a product of
Islamic fundamentalism than a simple
strategic goal to compel the United
States and its Western allies to
withdraw combat forces from the Arabian
Peninsula and other Muslim countries
that's Robert Pape who's the academic
scholar who's done the major studies of
suicide bombers serious analysts have
pointed out that bin Laden's words and
deeds correlate closely and history
reveals the same the jihadis who were
organized by the Reagan administration
and its allies ended their Afghan based
terror inside Russia
after the Russians withdrew from
Afghanistan though they continued it
from occupied Muslim Chechnya which is
the scene of horrifying Russian crimes
back to the 19th century
Osama himself turned against the United
States in 1991 because he took it to be
occupying the holiest Arab land that was
later acknowledged by the Pentagon as a
reason for shifting US bases from Saudi
Arabia to Iraq
additionally Osama was angered by the
rejection of his offer to join the
attack against Saddam the most extensive
scholarly inquiry into the jihadi
phenomenon the American scholar fellows
Girgis concludes that after 9/11 I'm
quoting him the dominant response to
al-qaeda in the Muslim world was very
hostile specifically among the jihadis
who regarded it as an extremely
dangerous extremist fringe instead of
recognizing that opposition to al-qaeda
instead of recognizing that the
existence of the opposition and the fact
that it offered Washington the most
effective way to drive a nail into its
coffin by finding intelligent means to
nourish and support the internal forces
that were opposed to militant ideologies
like the bin Laden Network the Bush
administration did exactly what then
Laden hoped it would do resort to
violence particularly in the invasion of
Iraq investigations by Israeli and Saudi
intelligence which are supported by US
Strategic Studies Institute's conclude
that foreign fighters in Iraq which are
maybe five to ten percent of the
insurgents were mobilized by the
invasion and furthermore had no previous
record of association with terrorist
groups the achievements of the Bush
administration planners and its pillion
rider their achievements in inspiring
Islamic radicalism and tear
and in joining Osama and creating a
clash of civilizations are quite
impressive the senior CIA analyst
responsible for tracking Osama bin Laden
from 1996 that Michael Shire writes that
US forces and policies are completing
the radicalization of the Islamic world
something of some oven Laden has been
trying to do with substantial but
incomplete success since the early 1990s
as a result sharor adds it is fair to
conclude that the United States of
America remains bin Laden's only
indispensible Ally the grievances that
the jihadis appeal to as a mobilizing
technique those are very real a Pentagon
advisory board panel just a few months
ago concluded that Muslims do not hate
our freedom but rather they hate our
policies and they added that when
American public diplomacy talks about
bringing democracy to Islamic societies
this is seen as no more than
self-serving hypocrisy those conclusions
go back many years if we choose not to
know them that's because of intentional
ignorance in public for a long time
the Eisenhower President Eisenhower in
1958 puzzled about what he called the
campaign of hatred against us in the
Arab world not by the governments but by
the people who are on Nasir side
supporting independent secular
nationalism which the u.s. opposed it
was supporting fundamentalist extremism
the reason for the campaign of hatred
was explained by the National Security
Council the highest planning
organization here are their words in the
eyes of the majority of Arabs the United
States appears to be opposed to the
realization of the goals of Arab
journalism they believe that the United
States is seeking to protect its
interest in Near East oil by supporting
the status quo and opposing political or
economic progress furthermore they say
the perception is understandable our
economic and cultural interests in the
area have led not unnaturally to close
US relations with elements in the Arab
world whose primary interest lies in the
maintenance of relations with the West
and the status quo in their countries
blocking democracy and development they
didn't go on to point out that this is
the most extreme fundamentalist fanatics
in the world and also some of the most
brutal and vicious regimes
that's 1958 right after 9/11 The Wall
Street Journal
carried out a survey of the opinions of
what they called money Muslims that's
immediately after 9/11 they surveyed the
bankers professionals businessmen all
committed through official so-called
Western values and embedded in the
neoliberal globalization project they
too were dismayed by Washington's
support for harsh authoritarian States
and the barriers Washington erectus
against development and democracy by
propping up oppressive regimes that goes
on to the present moment they however
had new grievances beyond those reported
by the National Security Council in 1958
primarily Washington's sanctions regime
in Iraq u.s. British sanctions regime
and support for didn't mean much in the
West but slaughtering hundreds of
thousands of people devastating the
society strengthening Saddam probably
preventing him from being overthrown
that actually meant something
among the backward people of the Arab
world that was one and the other was
support for Israel's military
occupation and takeover of the occupied
territories there was no survey carried
out of the great mass of poor and
suffering people but it's likely that
their sentiments are more intense
coupled with bitter resentment of the
Western oriented elites and the corrupt
and brutal rulers backed by Western
power who ensure that the enormous
wealth of the region flows to the west
apart from enriching themselves and the
Iraq invasion only intensified these
feelings further much as anticipated
also contributing materially to the
increase in the threat and reality of
nuclear proliferation and international
terrorism well there are ways to deal
constructively with the threat of terror
though not preferred by bin Laden's
indispensable ally or by those who want
to avoid the real world by striking
heroic poses about Islam oh of fascism
or those who simply claim that no
proposal has been made when there are
quite straightforward proposals that
they do not like the constructive ways
begin with an honest look in the mirror
and never an easy task always a
necessary one
