so my question is right now we have an
opportunity of anti-war organisms have
an opportunity to try to take all these
people who are against this and who you
know we could organize them we could try
to stop this government from trying to
end the current work how to prevent wear
with your on etc but the rest of the
world thinks that the administration is
unstoppable and I think that that's
probably what most of these people in
our country think as well so it has anti
war ii measures what should we do in
that with that i think yeah and then
yesterday where drinks with pretty much
with the authors in the journal of the
american academy think that with the US
government bows is unstoppable by
Americans they didn't say this works
it's just implicit in their conclusion
that China should somehow stop our
aggressive militarism they think that it
probably think it's right of states do
but is it it was a really impossible
fact that is the opinion of Americans
sometimes it's dramatic Mike mentioned
today during one of the discussions that
will he actually knows the number but
some somewhere between maybe a third and
a half of Americans I think that George
Bush was probably involved in blowing up
the World Trade Center okay because it
has the exact number depends on how the
questions asked in polls but somewhere
in that range with it the lower number
of third means favor the population
thinks the country is want to run by
mass murderers who want to slaughter
Americans ok does that favor the
population try to do anything about it I
like if their political candidate who
says we're gonna stop the country from
being run by mass murders of want a
Florida Americans no I mean do the
people do anything in like do they hold
up a placard and say let's stop ever
as a meeting about it now they
communicate on the Internet if you were
you know but the time I had debates on
the internet but the the third of the
population for maybe half and thinks
that think I can't do anything about it
okay so one by one Flores but can I do
that that's the real success of the
propaganda system it has succeeded in
making people feel helpless people feel
alone isolated helpless can't do
anything that's the job for organizers
get him to understand you not at all
helpless and there plenty ways to do
that I mean just take a look at very
recent history you go back not many
years it was a very different country
though the activism of the 1960s let's
just go back that far it changed the
country radically and all kinds of
respect I mean opposition the water for
example like i mentioned that when
kennedy launched the Vietnam War 1962
there was no protest at all and I
remember trying to get talks at the time
you know it's like somebody's living
room or literally a church with four
people literally the creature you know
the organizer drunkle Watkins from the
slate street and someone to kill without
with an added weight off and the earth
was carrying on a major war against
another country which and they're
effectively destroying it within a
couple of years okay at this by the time
that right now this take 3500 American
troops killed and maybe a hundred fifty
thousand troops there we reach that
level in Vietnam there still was no
practice virtually and by then a little
bit but not much and most of it was
directed against the bottom of the north
side it should bed not for the side
issue a little bit different this time I
mean the Iraq war is quite striking and
this is the first war in
hundreds of years of western imperialism
first time that there was massive
protest against the war before it was
officially launched I don't think
there's this ever happened before okay
that's a sign of ice tres officially
launched because we now know from weeks
and Britain the Downing Street memos
that bush and Blair knew that the world
was already going on they were bombing
at the time when they were pretending to
you know Blair was giving these eloquent
speeches about diplomacy you know
perfectly well that the US and Britain
to race are demonic but it was
officially launched there were massive
practice huge okay that's big difference
in fact protest against the Iraq word
day is far beyond what it was that the
against the Vietnam at a carnival stage
that's one thing you go back forty years
ago there was no anti-nuclear move now
the huge ending a clear movement i just
mentioned eighty-two percent of the
population think we should eliminate all
nuclear weapons the it seems to another
domains it takes a the women's movement
major effect on society it didn't win
there in the 60s barely very beginning
nicely moving from the 70s and on but
instigated by the activism the 6x will
change society tremendously there was no
environmental movement in the 60s
pigment now it's a movement of the 70s
and are the Solidarity movement didn't
exist today mostly from the eighties not
so visible because they worked on the
elite campuses they were in churches and
Kansas and Arizona and places like that
but they're very significant again the
first time in European you know Western
history that that people from the
invading country that's us in Central
America went to live with the victims
like that anybody go live in a
Vietnamese village
an Algerian village or anywhere to try
to protect to help the people and
protect them with a white face what's
there I was um you know on her father's
Americans did that when we will that's
where you get Christian peacekeepers and
Headroom you know or in Iraq and so on a
lot of different churches that's why
they're Christian peacekeepers well
there's a big popular movements right
out of the mainstream I think the most
important perhaps of the global justice
movement huge movement mostly started in
the south but the North has come in big
popular movements anti sweatshop
movements lots of things where they come
from and you get at the 1950s people
felt totally helpless and isolated you
read the literature the 1950s was a very
self congratulatory ahrens / end of
ideology Daniel bill nothing more to
discuss you know all the problems that
were over taken care of just a little
bit of tinkering and Paul Samuelson
explained that we know perfectly well
how to run the economy no problems can
ever come up maybe a little bit of
tinkering and we can make it three and a
half percent growth instead of
three-point-two percent growth are any
problems anymore you know cover years
later the country's maja
re-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-nce' Mike's memoir
in a very graphic account of one of the
most exciting examples of this right at
MIT but it was happening in some to some
extent it everywhere I changed the
country enormously yet people felt
helpless hopeless co-players later turns
out it wasn't true and that goes right
through history abolitionist movement to
you know everything like what is right I
think you know walking lightly about the
healthcare crisis you can talk much
about it in the 1960s because there
wasn't any national health system now
there's a kind of tottering one Medicare
Medicaid it came in through popular
pressure
you can think of it so yeah that's the
task of organizers make it clear of
people that this party that you can do
in fact it's easier now to organize and
it's a we've been in the past because
we're we can drop it from benefit from
the legacy of people who came before who
created the degree freedom we don't have
okay easier for us i'll show you use the
up to my question about something said
in nineteen seventy government future
and you said wow if a president a
refreshing tea date back with the
leftover come in for suicidal tendencies
and build upon the achievements of the
past decade then the problem of how to
organize industrial society on truly
democratic lines with democratic control
workplace as well as in the community
should become the dominant intellectual
issue for those who are live in the
province of contemporary society so i
was just wondering what you meant
anyone could in fact that's what the
Institute's about actually the way the
profession was beaten back it was
persevere we're more severe than
anything is happening now I mean you
know people complain now about
repression and correctly should complain
about repression but there's nothing
like COINTELPRO going
