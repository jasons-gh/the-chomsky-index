people are interested in linguistics for
all sorts of reasons but my own interest
for since the beginning for 50 years has
been as a way of exploring some aspects
of human higher mental faculties and
ultimately of human nature which should
show up in every domain not just in
language happens to be one of the few
areas where you can study very core
human capacities unique in core human
capacities in a very intense way and
achieve some results that go beyond
superficial understanding in most areas
is very hard to do it but this is one
area in which you can and at the core of
this capacity for language it's been
recognized for centuries is a kind of
was sometimes called a creative aspect
the free ability to do it you and I are
doing to express our thoughts without
limit within constraints but without
limit in novel ways and so on that
somehow a fundamental part of human
nature is the core of Cartesian
philosophy was disability for example
well similar questions arise in every
aspect of human capacity and again it's
traditional so David Hume 250 years ago
pointed out that the foundation of
morals must be what we nowadays call
generative grammar you didn't call it
that but it must be some set of
principles that we're capable of
applying in novel situations again
without limit and he pointed out these
principles have to be part of our nature
because there's no way to acquire them
from experience in theory you can learn
something about these aspects of human
nature and that moving over to the
domain of human affairs including
politics but personal life or anything
else
anyone who makes any stand on anything I
say if you're in favor of keeping things
the way they are or some minor reform or
revolution or whatever it may be I mean
if you're serious about it if you're
acting as a kind of a moral agent you
think what you do should meet certain
minimal moral standards you're taking
that position because you think it's
it's good for people it's gonna somehow
conform it's going to bring out and
amplify and offer possibilities for
their fundamental nature to express
itself well at that point there's a
theoretical connection but it's pretty
abstract because when you deal with
anything as complex as human beings
you're always on the surface the fact we
can't answer questions like this about
insects we a long time if ever before
one can have a anything like scientific
understanding of any questions like
these
