objectivity of you know I mean even in
the Natural Sciences you approach a
problem from a point of view if you're
honest you tell people what the point of
view is I mean no scientist says look
I'm I'm completely objective what you do
is you say look here's my assumption you
make enough about us saying it's
implicit and everything you say and it
won't understands it here's look here's
my hypothesis here's my background you
know here's the framework of things I'm
investigating here's the way I look at
things others can compensate for it
maybe they look at things differently
okay so they know how to compensate for
what you write and then when you're
talking about public affairs these
effects are just overwhelming you know
not to pretend not to have that point of
view is simply to be an extreme
propagandist anyone who's even minimally
honest will say look yeah I have a very
special point of view and here it is so
when I up here nobody doubts for one
minute where I'm coming from because
they make it very obvious and therefore
people can listen and figure this ID
whether they want to compensate or
modify or look at things otherwise so
the and it's not that you can't tell the
truth you can perfectly well tell the
truth but you're looking at certain
things you're omitting other things your
you know you're selecting what you think
is important or what you'd like to be
heard and so on there's no way not to do
that so in this sense of course
objectivity is a myth in the sense of
you know giving a neutral position that
doesn't exist and if you're honest
you'll say what the position is so the
media ought to open by saying you're now
listening to the corporate media which
are presenting the point of view of the
view of the world as seen by
transnational corporations and your
sponsors and so on and so forth and
here's what it looks like to us from
that point of view and then listeners
could figure it out I think that sort of
what happens in a totalitarian state so
in Russia for example under Brezhnev
they didn't have to open the television
by saying you know isn't into the
Communist Party bureaucracy told what
they think oh I knew that you know and
then you could compensate
that's the objectivity
there's a certain form of doublespeak
and language manipulation and shaping of
the images and so on which is pretty
transparent and ensure that these are
modes of propaganda in fact they're
there by now you know rather
sophisticated so the public relations
industry which is the main business
input into this and as an American
invention actually goes back to the
early part of the century it's been huge
amounts of money last time Congress
investigated about twenty years ago it
looked like it well over a billion
dollars a year by now probably much
higher to try to shape to well as they
put it to control the public mind
and they're they're interested in all
kinds of things not just making you have
the right ideas on health care but also
just shaping your personality so there's
a huge I mean we were talking about
ideology in the media but in fact the
overwhelming force of the media is in
some other area it's to try to turn
people into passive consumers whose only
interest in life is to pursue once that
they don't have a tremendous amount of a
media is just committed to creating
artificial ones and trying to get people
trapped
and but just take a look at advertising
I mean if you can convince a poor black
kid in the ghetto that he needs to have
$200 sneakers signed by a basketball
player if that's the most important
thing in life he's going to go out and
get it and to go ahead and get it he'll
have to do what is available which
becomes work for the drug rackets or you
know kill the guy and go rob the store
next to her and so on and you have then
built up a system of internal terror and
control which is fairly effective and
destroys the societies

United States a much freer country than
any in Europe so say the power of the
state to coerce is considerably less
here than in any other country I know
there's no way for the government here
to say March into the offices of CBS and
take their files as they can do in
England so they're compensating factors
and uh but one reason I'm a little
hesitant about talking about it is that
the United States is the only country I
know of where there has been extensive
and systematic inquiry into the media
that's not true in Europe there's a
little but not much and that reflects
the fact that this that there are many
more independent thinker people here
Europeans like to think they're
independent but in fact they are so
coerced but then I mean think of
inquiring through their own media they
just take it for granted they must be
completely free and open you don't get
to become Ted Koppel or Sam Donaldson
and so on unless you've already
demonstrated that you have internalized
the values of the powerful and once
you've demonstrated that then you can
move up and if you do your job properly
you'll move into the social circles and
then it begins to have an effect so the
kind of people you play golf with and
you have a dinner with and whose
meetings you attend and so on you have
naturally that's part of the process of
socialization that begins at a much
lower level you know it's begins in
school you get into the right circles if
you behave the right way the right
circles in college maybe the Faculty
Club and the local elite and so on you
move along it gets to be the corporate
world the literary intellectuals the
Washington inside the beltway Club and
these are very closely linked groups
they're all very privileged and wealthy
and share lots of interests and concerns
and if you but if you're properly
behaved you can enter into those circles
but then of course you've got to see the
world they do or shape your picture of
the world the way the
they do if you don't you're out of the
circle
