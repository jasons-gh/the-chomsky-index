right at this moment the government and
the corporation's are dismantling a
productive industry in say Michigan and
Indiana like closing GM plants and so on
and sending the production abroad or
they're doing that that's one thing to
doing the other thing that's happening
is that Obama's Transportation Secretary
is in Europe in Spain using federal
stimulus money namely taxpayer money to
try to get contracts for Spanish firms
to provide high-speed rail that the
United States needs not can you think of
a better thing I mean it's hard to think
of a more dramatic criticism of the
state corporate socioeconomic system
here are communities and work forces
being destroyed while we while their tax
money goes to purchase in Spain what
they could be producing themselves
should the I'm gonna take city of the
workers and Gary Indiana or Flint
Michigan and so on do they have to just
sit and watch this happen no they can
take over the work the workplaces the
factories they can run on themselves
they can convert them it's been done
before there's much greater conversion
during the second world war to work on
production
they'll need state support for that
because that's the only institution that
exists and the only one that people can
influence can't influence a private
tyranny it can influence the government
it's often been done it would take some
support but nowhere near as much as
bailing out goldman sachs and so on it
would take some it would take a lot of
popular support but it can be done it
can even be done within the framework of
conservative economic theory which is
pretty straight about this
we read textbooks on corporations that
say well you know it's not graven in
stone that they should work only to the
benefit of shareholders which means a
tiny percentage of wealthy shareholders
they can work in the interests of
stakeholders meaning workforce and
community and then I decide to do that
but the workforce in the community can
decide it for there was a perfectly
feasible efforts in fact it's been done
you know there are cases where it's been
done this case this was even been tried
on a very large scale like US Steel and
came close to succeeding these are real
organizing strategies which combine
short-term efforts which confront real
problems that people face in their
everyday lives with long-term objectives
like creating part of the basis for a
society based on free association solid
I already popular control and so on it's
sitting right there in front of our eyes
those are my view are the things we
should be looking at not abstract
questions like should we try to destroy
the state for which we have no strategy
my feeling is that's the direction in
which kind of direction which thinking
or a move it doesn't mean giving up your
long term goals in fact that's the way
to realize them and if there's another
way to realize them I have never heard
it there's a very large number of people
who are committed sincerely and rightly
to the kind of long-term objectives that
anarchists have always tried to uphold
and the question is why can't we get
together and decide on and instead of
you know
condemning one another for not viewing
things exactly the way we do why can't
we try to formulate concrete proposals
which combine two properties one dealing
with the real problems that people face
in their immediate daily lives he's
going to get anywhere you're going to
have to deal with those that's not just
for tactical reasons it's also out of
simple humanity so on the one hand those
while maintaining as your guidelines the
conception of the kind of just and free
society that you would like to bring
into being through these steps and
sometimes the two are very close
together as in the case that I mentioned
like takeover of a productive enterprise
by work force in communities which is
not it's not it's a feasible objective
and one that has a great deal of Appeal
would have if it were put forward as to
others and combined so both the long
term vision and the short term dealing
with real existing grievances and
problems and there are quite a few
things like that so the question is why
focus on that rather than on abstract
questions such as what's the best
strategy for destroying the state
answered well no best strategy because
nobody's proposed any
