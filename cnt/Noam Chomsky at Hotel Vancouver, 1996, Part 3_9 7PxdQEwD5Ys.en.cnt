so it's not you know it's not no major
just like some catastrophe or something
it's well within the historical range
and not even noticeable particularly
furthermore there's also evidence about
the effect of running deficits there
have been a couple of times I think
about half a dozen times in American
history when there has been an attempt
to balance the budget and in fact every
single one of them has led pretty
quickly to either recession or a deep
depression on the other hand there here
it gets tricky but there are some
studies the only studies that have been
done as far as I know most of them done
by an economist named Robert Eisner at
the Northwestern where which have been
attempt to estimate to try to work out
the effect of a deficit on things like
investment growth you know anything in
measure it turns out there's a not huge
but somewhat positive effect to running
deficits and the reason is not very
surprising after all every business runs
deficits all the time every business is
in debt every household is in debt
everything that functions is in debt all
the time you're in debt because you're
trying to you know do something now of
course if you use the debt as neither
good nor bad I mean if you use the debt
to you know gamble at Las Vegas it was a
bad day if you used the debt to you know
to send your kids to college or you know
buy a car or start a business or
something then a good ok from the point
of view of economic gain and other
things depends we could do with it and
if the if the borrowing is used
intelligence for example if government
borrowing goes into building
infrastructure and improving education
and health and so on so there's a more
viable society down the road there'll
also be more growth more income you pay
off the debt that's what matters what
matters is why is investment
in people's lives and the way they live
and what's produced and so on and so
forth and of course wise investment is
going to because no Naknek off debt
public spending is in fact a major way
in which the any economy grows you know
sometimes the healthy way sunglass a
destructive way depends what you do with
it
so as far as we know at least there's
nothing there's no big imperative about
cutting the debt I mean obviously it
depends he despite the Reagan years
which didn't you know I mean they did
turn the United States very quickly from
the world's biggest creditor into the
world's biggest debtor very fast but
that was because of a combination of
massive spending the massive state
spending and tremendous bar there was
kind of like a borrow-and-spend abandon
in the reagan years and mainly as David
Stockman said right at the beginning
though there's no secret the head of the
budget because if they figured if they
get deep enough into debt they'll be a
straightjacket and I'll be able to kill
social spending well ok if that's your
goal and that's a good thing and if you
can use cutting the debt to achieve that
goal then that's fine but for the
general population that doesn't make any
sense at all and even on narrow economic
grounds it's very dubious that it makes
any sense probably harmful and narrow
akin on the narrowest economic ground
now different you know in Canada the
answer to that may be different remember
the take take the talk about how the
debt is a burden on future generations
well in the United States that's simply
not true the debt is mostly owned by
Americans which means that the payments
on the debt stay right in the country
and now it may have a redistributed
effect like it's probably the case
although even this is pretty hard to
show because of pension funds and
everything else but it's you know you
guess that it's the case that
richer people hold more the debt than
poorer people
but if that's true then the debt will
indeed have a redistributive effect in
fact regressive free distributive effect
although even that's challenged but if
but but that you take care of a nut by
other means likes a more progressive
taxation so those are not big social
problem I mean there's nothing
unworkable about the social problems the
debt it does the the payment on the debt
just stays almost all stays inside the
country just gets reshuffled around and
should be shuffled around in complicated
ways so there's no burden on future
generations I mean the burden on future
generations is if you don't leave them
with a viable society like if your
children and your grandchildren are
going to go into society with which
doesn't have roads and bridges and
people aren't educated and people are
dying of diseases and so on and so forth
yeah then everything going to news and
it's not gonna be a nice life for them
and in fact they won't be able to
maintain anything like the lifestyle
they haven't people I'd know but in
order to achieve those goals to create a
viable society public spending is
absolutely fun acessory furthermore the
business meeting that was that's why
they insisted on the Pentagon staying
high because that's the form of public
spending they like and they don't call
it public spending but that's a method
whereby the general public pays the
costs of research and development and so
on and basically you know creates the
creates the high-tech system which is
then handed over then not just the
engineering and so on same improved
biotechnology and everything else
hard to find the dynamic sector of the
economy where that hasn't been a major
factor so yeah there is that kind of
public spending but what about the other
kind I mean what about you know creating
and helping helping develop a society
and with the human being we want to live
would want to live and would want to
work and would want to work productively
and so on and so forth well that's
public responsibility now how that in
you know I don't
I think it's not a great idea to have
that public responsibility fulfilled
through a powerful central government in
fact I think is a rotten idea but under
current circumstances it happens to be
the only alternative to having private
tyrannies around everything which is far
worse so given the options that's the
best one I think but that means but and
I think most people kind of sense this
and that's or at least at some level
sense it which is why you don't have
support for balancing the budget and
think about your original question it's
why as soon as candidates have to face
the public they drop it like a hot
potato
so it's only the business world and its
various flex who say that we have to
balance the budget not many other people
do I work for a union that represents a
lot of people in Canadian newspapers and
radio and television one of the things
we see occurring is a fragmentation
particularly of the advertising market
but also of the circulation and the
viewers of uh of this media and I wonder
if you agree with that and what
implications it has for that idea of
having agenda-setting media you know the
necessary to have a mass media that
important media that are agenda-setting
and the other does fragmentation offer
us opportunities in terms of alternative
media and being able to to get a message
out how do you have you well I don't
know the details about Canada though I
can
it's very different from the United
States and other countries and the main
tendencies towards mega-mergers so the
the number of separate I hate stay
independent because they're all more or
less the same anyway but the number of
separate news sources is decline has
been declining for a long time and it's
declining even more now like when you
start kidding
you know Disney ABC or whatever it is
all of these things are turning into
real mega-mergers and this is just part
of what's going on in the business world
altogether there's a big move towards
kind of mega corporations it's a
thinking merger frenzy now it's partly
because it's not much financial capital
floating around it's probably it's
pretty destructive for the economy but
that's the way things are going and it's
pretty strikingly true in the media as
well even internationally that's like I
just came back from the indeed a couple
of weeks ago and the big talk question
there is whether the media which are
pretty right-wing by and large should
they resist takeovers by Murdoch name
guys like that we thought what will
happen if they do what's called
liberalizing the economy liberalizing
the economy means letting the guys with
really big money do everything and kick
everybody else out because that's the
way the markets work so when should they
sort of give away the ending media to
Murdoch and black and these other
characters and the big empires that they
run like awfully major corporations like
you know Disney and Warner and so on but
now one another part of that is cutting
back on news so it's perfectly true that
news is beat that news coverage is being
cut back news offices are being cut
back there is less coverage but that's
kind of like you know it's like the
reason I'm late today as the nominee do
whether it had to do an elephant we had
to do it deregulation of the airlines to
do back for another one effect with the
regulation of the airlines has been to
transfer costs to the public in fact a
lot of automation has the characters
automation you know they carry it saving
money it's certainly saving money for
businesses but if you think about it
it's transferring the cost and you know
it very well
