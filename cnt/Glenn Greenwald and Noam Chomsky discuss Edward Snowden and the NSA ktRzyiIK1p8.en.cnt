on behalf of Harvard bookstore it's my
great pleasure to welcome you to this
evening's event with Glenn Greenwald and
Noam Chomsky discussing discussing
Greenwald's new book no place to hide
Edward Snowden the NSA and the US
surveillance state Greenwald is the
best-selling author of how the Patriot
Act and with liberty and justice for
some his reporting on the NSA has won
him numerous awards and he has been
acclaimed as one of the most influential
political commentators today he is
joined tonight by Noam Chomsky one of
the world's leading public intellectuals
Chomsky has taught at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology since 1955 and
his political and philosophical writings
are known and acclaimed worldwide in no
place to hide Greenwald recounts his
trip to Hong Kong to meet with an
anonymous source who had information on
pervasive government spying that source
turned out to be Edward Snowden
examining the broader implications of
the surveillance and revealing fresh
information on the NSA's abuse of power
Greenwald also takes on the
establishment media for their avoidance
of adversarial reporting on the
government he asks what it means for
both individuals and the nation when a
government prize so invasively
into the private lives of its citizens
we are so very pleased to be hosting
them tonight please join me in welcoming
Glenn Greenwald and Noam Chomsky good
evening everyone and thank you so much
on behalf of professor Chomsky myself
for that really warm and generous
welcome and thank you so much as well to
Professor Chomsky for agreeing to
participate in this evening's event I
was here actually two years ago or so
from my prior book with Professor
Chomsky and what I said at the time was
that writing a book is a really solitary
process you sit there and write it and
you struggle with it and the only people
who are reading it are your editors who
are constantly telling you how awful it
is to justify the changes that they want
to do that you're fighting against and
you really have no idea how people are
gonna react and and you can't wait to
get it out into the world and what I
said two years ago is that there really
is no greater honor than writing a book
and then having the opportunity to
discuss it with one of your premier
intellectual heroes really one of the
most fearless and accomplished public
intellectuals on the planet and I
certainly continue to think that and
it's a huge honor to
you know it's funny it's particularly
generous of him to be here because as he
knows before or as Edward Snowden sort
of wormed his way into my existence I
happened to be working on a book about
the way in which the establishment media
constricts the range of acceptable
political discourse and was writing a
book about how he had been treated and
by by the US media as a window into
understanding those those dynamics so he
sort of got bumped by Edward Snowden
when when somebody comes to you and says
hey I'd like to give you tens of
thousands of top-secret documents from
the most secretive agency of the world's
most powerful government you tend to put
your current projects on hold so I did
but I hope to return to that I want to
just talk a little bit about the reason
I wrote the book because there's a lot
of obvious component parts that that are
worth discussing I think but I think
it's a good idea to step back and talk
about the impetus behind the book
because as I said writing a book is a
really grueling process especially when
you're trying to report on stories and
do a variety of other things and you
need good reasons to do it and I spend a
good amount of time thinking about
whether I wanted to do it and whether
there was a sufficient reason to do it
and there are some general reasons why
it made sense for one ever since I got
these documents I felt a very cumbersome
obligation to my source who unraveled
his existence to bring this information
to the public and to galvanize a debate
around the world and also to the
material and to the public which had a
right to not only see it but to
understand it and interact with it and
writing a book is a unique opportunity
to reach people who don't spend their
time reading newspapers or following
debates you can go around the world and
talk about the importance of privacy in
the Menace of a secret surveillance
state and really help catalyze the
debate even further and I thought I had
the obligation to do that and the other
part about writing a book is that when
you're reporting on and writing on
something every single day you're
focused on the immediate story before
you and it's hard to understand some of
the underlying application
and when you write a book you're sort of
forced to take steps back in and look at
how these issues connect with one
another and what some of the underlying
themes are the sort of contacts for the
reporting that you've been doing and I
think I had an opportunity to do that
with this book and it was really
fulfilling and helpful to me and I hope
will inform the debate on in a lot of
ways but a really significant reason why
I decided to write the book is because
so much has been said over the last year
about Edward Snowden about the reporting
that we did about the documents that we
have about the way in which we disclosed
them so much of which has been
completely untrue and I really wanted to
take the opportunity to present the
definitive set of events as I saw them
to sort of as a corrective and you know
one of the things is if you're somebody
who enjoys bashing the American media
and I am somebody who enjoys that
immensely you know it comes as no
surprise that in in the abstract you
recognize that the American media all
the time disseminates wildly false
claims I mean that doesn't surprise I'm
sure anybody in this room you sort of
see it from a distance you know that
they're they're making falsehoods and
and deceiving people and and that's
something that we abstractly understand
but when you're actually at the center
of one of the stories and you know
firsthand what actually happened your
appreciation for their eagerness and
capacity to mislead substantially
increases it has really been I don't
know maybe I was a little bit naive I
don't think so but it has been a
remarkable experience to watch the
extent to which people in public life
you have significant platforms just
routinely and without the slightest
thought spout all kinds of blatant
falsehoods you know I was I remember
when when I was in Hong Kong after we
unveiled Snowden's identity for the
first time there was this consensus that
arose among certain members of the media
in the political class that this was
clearly a spying operation run out of
Beijing that Snowden was almost
certainly a Chinese spy there were weeks
of people
you were saying this and then once the
Chinese government told him you know
what you have to leave and he flew to
Russia on his way to Ecuador and got
trapped in Moscow by the US government
revoking his passport and bullying the
Cubans into rescinding their guarantee
of safe passage on his way to Ecuador
those very same people who had been
saying just two weeks earlier that he
were was clearly a Chinese by suddenly
switched on a dime and started saying
obviously he this is an operation run by
Vladimir Putin and I guarantee you
tomorrow if he like flew to I don't know
like Lima these same people would say oh
he's obviously a Peruvian agent engaged
in an espionage operation they'll just
say whatever they need to say to
demonize him and there was even a Wall
Street Journal op-ed several days ago
saying we know for certain that this was
either a Chinese espionage operation a
Russian espionage operation or possibly
a joint sino-russian plot and and it's
really been just remarkable how
seriously all of that has been taken
despite the fact that there's zero
evidence to support any of it and
enormous mountains of evidence that
negate it
similarly there was this two-week period
after we really after we revealed
Snowden that was incredible when I was
in Hong Kong I really wasn't paying
attention to the extremely important
musings of people like David Brooks and
David Ignatius and Bob Shafer and
Jeffrey Toobin because I was a little
bit busy but I did go back and the
course I'm writing this book to look at
what the discourse was and the immediate
aftermath of Snowden's unveiling and I
was really amazed because I've been
pretty scornful of the notion that
there's this active plotting among
journalists and media outlets to
coordinate their their storyline I I
generally think that they don't need to
plot they're just sort of appendages of
a certain culture and it just kind of
comes naturally the way they all embrace
each other's conventional wisdom but
within 24 to 48 hours literally after we
first introduced Edward Snowden to the
world
there was this immediate consensus among
all of these media elites that they were
completely capable of
taking this person that they had never
heard of before and didn't know the
first thing about and like diagnosing
her my clinically diagnosing him like
psychologically assessing his
pathologies and they all somehow settled
on this incredibly coordinated script
that he was a Fame seeking narcissist
this is I mean if you google it you'll
find this phrase over and over and over
again that this was the the mental
imbalance that led him to do what he did
it was obviously not any genuine
dissatisfaction with the US government
or what it was doing because how could
any sane person possibly be dissatisfied
with the US government there must be a
mental condition that led him to do what
he did and that was the one they settled
on and it didn't just amaze me how
coordinated it was like where did they
all get that how did they where did that
come from that that fame-seeking
narcissist theme I really want to know
but what really struck me about it was
the very first conversation that I ever
had with Edward Snowden ever online
before I knew who he was what he said to
me was I want to do this and I'm gonna
give you these documents and when I give
them to you
I am adamant about the fact that I want
to identify myself as the source for
these disclosures and I want to come
forward and explain to the world why I
did what I did and he said the reason is
that I feel I owed the world an a duty
to explain the motives and rationale
behind what I did and not to allow other
people to be falsely accused and I'm
proud of the choice that I made so I
want to stand up and take responsibility
for it and
and then he said once I do that once I
make that public statement I'm going to
just disappear from Mediasite because he
knew that the objective of the national
security state and its apologists and
defenders would be to try and shift the
focus away from the substance of the
revelations away from the fact that they
were engaged in the largest and most
pervasive system of suspicionless
surveillance ever created in human
history and talk about his mental
afflictions and why he was where he was
and how he missed his girlfriend and
what he did to her and all of that and
and so he wanted to just disappear from
sight and prevent them from doing that
you know there's this fascinating
history of how things are done to
whistleblowers you know might one of my
childhood heroes politically was Daniel
Ellsberg and I've gotten to become
friends with him he's a colleague of
mine and I've talked to him about this
before because I never used to be able
to understand why in response to the
leaking of the Pentagon Papers the
response of the Nixon administration was
to break into the office of his
psychiatrist in the hope of obtaining
his psycho sexual secrets it never made
any sense to me like it seemed like the
ultimate non sequitur like oh look we
have documents showing that the US
government has been systematically lying
to the American people for years about
the Vietnam War and the response would
be well Daniel Ellsberg is a swinger
like I never quite understood why they
thought that would be effective and I
asked him about that and what he said is
you're thinking about this way too
rationally that once you sufficiently
demonize a person on a level that makes
people uncomfortable though everybody
will want to avoid not just that person
but all of the fruits of their work and
the message that they're delivering it's
an incredibly effective means of
excluding somebody from decent company
and making everything that they say
instantly dismiss for that reason you
saw the same thing done to Julian
Assange and Chelsea Manning and anybody
who has delivered in the comfortable
message and so Snowden was determined
not to let that happen
and so literally four months after we
revealed his identity I got telephone
calls on a daily basis literally on a
daily basis from all of the very shining
American TV personalities the actors who
play the role of journalists on TV
pleading with me to arrange for them to
get an interview with him that they
could put on prime-time television he
could have spent months and months and
months on every single major world
television networks
spouting and talking and pontificating
and become the most famous person in the
world and yet he has steadfastly refused
in fact to date he has never given an
interview to an American television
network precisely because he was
completely uninterested in Fame in fact
he wanted to avoid it so that the focus
could remain on the substance and that
is the person that all of our brilliant
media pundits accused of being motivated
by Fame and being a narcissist you can't
find a person to whom that description
applies less I want to talk to you about
the the the idea that the disclosures
have helped the terrorists and been
treasonous and all of those cliches that
I'm sure you're already very familiar
with and the thing that makes me amazed
about the extent to which this is voiced
and you know I'm on a book tour so I've
done I don't know countless interviews
with all kinds of establishment media
outlets and I don't think there has been
a single interview I've done that didn't
include some kind of question along the
lines of like they put their very
serious somber faces on to signal that
this is important and they say mr.
Greenwald general Keith Alexander the
longtime chief of the NSA said in an
interview last week that he is certain
that people will lose their lives as a
result of these disclosures innocent
people will be killed as a result of
what you have revealed does that keep
you up at night the the prospect that
your reporting will result in other
people's deaths and what makes that so
amazing to me isn't just that the these
officials are allowed to make these
claims and have the media go forth and
amplify them without the slightest
expectation that there will be any
evidence presented at all that any of
that is true right I mean that's not
really remarkable anymore the idea that
media officials mindlessly amplify
whatever government officials tell them
without expecting any evidence to
support it that's the reason why we have
the media debacle leading up to the Iraq
war that's not what surprises me what
surprises me is the fact that there is
no awareness that in virtually ever
every single case over the last 50 years
where there have been whistleblowers who
come for unauthorized disclosures up top
media figures call it unauthorized
disclosures meaning reporting things
that the government didn't give you
permission to report in every single one
of those cases the same exact script is
immediately and reflexively read from
and it continuously is proven to be
false over and over and over again and
there's never any hesitation or thought
of well maybe because they've said this
every single time there's a story and it
always turns out to be true that we
oughta treat it with a tad of skepticism
there's just a kind of immediate
reflexive reaction that it ought to be
taken seriously because they wear medals
on their chest and so a big part of
writing this book is to detail just how
capable of and devoted to deceit and
public lying these same officials are in
the hope that their pronouncements will
be treated much more skeptically in the
future so I just want to talk about a
couple of other brief points in terms of
the the falsity of the public discourse
that I was hoping to correct and one of
them is about the way in which we've
reported these documents and the
intentions that Edward Snowden had when
he gave them to us we have been
criticized very predictably and very
inconsequential II from what I will call
just for lack of a better term the right
which is you know primarily Democrats
who voiced this this was critique that
our disclosures are gonna help the
terrorists and result in the deaths of
innocent people and all of that I was on
c-span two days ago and every time the
host said and now we're gonna go to the
Democrat line I knew I was about to be
called a traitor it was like completely
reliable so you know that's the critique
from the right and there's a much more
interesting and I think reasonable and
even more valid critique that for again
want of a better term alcohol from the
left that has also been critical of how
we've done the reporting that has said
actually you haven't released too much
you've actually released too little and
we think you should just take these
documents and put them all online or you
should release them a lot more
aggressively or a lot more quickly you
have all these documents and you've
released only a small four
and so I wanted to make clear exactly
what happened so that there's no
confusion about how the story have
evolved and the reasons why and when
that is that when Edward Snowden came to
us he had a very very clear and
determined understanding of how he
wanted these documents to be reported he
didn't want all of the documents
uploaded to the Internet if he wanted
that obviously he didn't need me to do
it he's extremely capable much more so
than I am of doing that had he wanted
that to happen he could have just done
it himself or he could have given it to
other groups and asked that they do it
or he could have given it to me and
asked that I do it that isn't what
happened he was inspired by prior
whistleblowers like Chelsea Manning and
WikiLeaks and Thomas Drake and others
and wanted to learn from the ways in
which they had been effectively attacked
and the importance of their revelations
diluted and undermined and he was
determined not to let the debate be all
about why is there this reckless
indiscriminate disclosures even though
that wasn't the case for any of those
prior instances that was the attack that
was made and so he said I want you to go
very carefully through each of these
documents and to report them
journalistically one by one meaning
explain to the public exactly what these
documents are do reporting to make them
even clearer and let each story breathe
so that people can react and debate and
let the story unfold and that we can say
credibly that we're releasing these
documents in a manner that's systemic so
that they couldn't demonize the
disclosures and that was a framework to
which I agreed when I took the documents
which for me ends the debate even if I
didn't think that was the right approach
I would never violate my agreement to
him no matter who doesn't like it but I
also think it was the right thing to do
in the evidence I think that vindicates
that strategy is the fact that I've been
writing about surveillance for eight
years and it's a very hard thing to get
people to pay attention to or care about
they think it's remote they think it's
abstract it can be complicated and yet
here we are a year later and interest in
this topic is more sustained and more
intense than it was back in June when we
first started revealing the stories
there are incredible reform movements
around the world people's changing to
how they think not just about
surveillance and privacy
but about the role of the United States
and the dangers of investing their own
government with power to be exercised in
secret and the proper role of journalism
visa via the state I think these issues
have been debated in a more serious way
and in a more intense way around the
world for a longer period of time than
almost any other story that I've seen
and I think that really vindicates the
strategy that he insisted upon and that
we agreed to undertake and whatever else
is true that strategy is not what has
been depicted it is the opposite of a
reckless and indiscriminate strategy it
is a very strategically precise strategy
of trying to make sure that the debate
proceeds constructively by choosing the
documents to release in a way that the
public can best understand which I think
is the duty of an activist and the duty
of a journalist as well the last point I
want to make and then I will turn it
over to Professor Chomsky is there is a
much more important point to me to the
Edward Snowden story into telling you
than just correcting the record and
clearing up all those misconceptions and
that is that for me there is an
extraordinarily valuable lesson to learn
from everything that has happened here I
have been going around talking about all
sorts of issues relating to war on
terror abuses and fundamental defects in
the American criminal justice system and
all of these other kinds of issues and
invariably the question that everybody
asks is well what can I do about it and
embedded in that question oftentimes is
a sense of the feed ISM the idea that
these forces are so formidable that I
don't really feel as though as outraged
as I may get that I have within me the
capacity to do anything about them and I
know professor Chomsky has talked about
that question and that mindset a lot
before and said he really only hears it
in the United States or in the West and
and not typically in other countries
where they feel like they have an outlet
and know what to do which is take it
upon themselves to change it but the
reason I think there's such a valuable
lesson here is that whatever else do you
think about headward Snowden when I met
him he was 29 years old he was raised in
a lower middle class to middle-class
environment by a father who was in the
Coast Guard for 30 years he has no
family connections he had no power no
prestige he was as
ordinary as it gets completely obscured
no support institutionally in any way he
was just an ordinary individual who
through nothing more than an act of
conscience acting more or less alone
literally change the world and the
lesson for me that profoundly influenced
how I think and how I did everything
from that point forward and what I think
probably for the rest of my life is
really clear to me which is that no
matter who you are and no matter how
inadequate you think you are when
arrayed against these very powerful
forces we all have within us the ability
when we summon the proper will and
really make the choice to do so in
defense of the things that we say we
believe to a fact not minor but radical
and fundamental change in the world and
I think the decision and choice that he
made should be the permanent antidote to
that kind of defeatism and I wanted to
convey that lesson in writing the book
and going around and talking about it
and and I hope I did so thanks very much
and
I think I quite agree with you what he
achieved does drive home that lesson
which is one that we should really be
familiar with almost every significant
change that's ever happened was sparked
by often isolated individuals who were
willing to take a stand on something so
it takes a the modern civil rights
movement civil rights movement goes back
centuries but it really took off in the
modern period around 1960 and if you
just look at the incidents that were
involved it very much underscores what
Glenn is saying so in 1960 in Greensboro
North Carolina a couple of black
students decided to sit-in at a
Woolworth's lunch counter and asked to
be served of course they were
immediately arrested and brutalized set
off could have been the end of it except
the next day more students came pretty
soon you had the formation of the
Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee he had Freedom Riders going
through the South really risking their
lives it was not it was not easy
beaten attacked killed some northerners
came down number of them were murdered
finally you had legislative changes
which were partial victories but
nevertheless significant victories and I
think this is true in every case I know
then they take one of a very different
kind in in 1975 the Indonesian
government invaded the former Portuguese
colony of East Timor nearby mainly
because they wanted to gain control of
the oil of the region the invasion was
murderous that led virtual jenis
I probably killed quarter third of the
population the u.s. strongly supported
it from the very beginning so it Britain
so other allies that mainly because
Indonesia is a rich prize a lot of
resources a lot of investments make a
lot of profit from a very significant
and strategically there were about three
or four people I could name who some of
them students who dropped out of school
devoted their lives to trying to
organize on this topic
their names are said like Snowden you
don't nobody knows their names
practically nobody except those who were
involved they don't want to be known but
they succeeded over in bringing other
people to become involved a lot of the
speaking that I did was organized by
them testimony at the General Assembly
was organized by them the spread of the
countries there finally in 1979 1999
September 1999 twenty four five years
after this genocide Allah salt a Bill
Clinton president said a couple of words
he informed the Indonesian generals that
the game's over
after mr. OH prior to the October saying
they'd never withdraw this was their
territory they did next it they got a
word from the White House and they
instantly withdraw a few people were
responsible for this let's go to the
media covered the media knew all about
this for 25 years there was extensive
reporting in Australia there were all
kind of leaks take a look at the record
virtually nothing and then look what
happened when a Clinton declared it over
the reporting wasn't look this shows
that you guys are incredible criminals
you were responsible for what happened
all these years
the response was magnificent act of
humanitarian intervention because
Clinton intervened stopped the crimes
the Indonesian army withdrew that
allowed a UN peacekeeping force to enter
a wonderful tribute of humanitarian
intervention mark we'd magnificent this
happens over and over again when you
were talking about the sino-soviet
conspiracy what came to my mind is an
interesting case that there's a
wonderful book that I'd urge you to read
if you haven't by old friend of mine Jim
Peck
is very good the China scholar the book
is called Washington's China that what
he did was go through the records of the
Declassified records of the National
Security Council you know for the entire
period up to what had been released when
he wrote the book and presented their
account of what the Chinese but what
their analysis of China's role in the
world
there was a conclusion that was
consistent through all the accounts
China's a terrible threat but what
changed over the years is the reasons
when China was more or less friendly to
Russia or looked that way
China's a terrible threat because it's
puppet of Moscow when China was
proclaimed war with Russia a couple of
years later China's a terrible threat
because the Russians are kind of more or
less moderate and the Chinese are
extreme and no matter what the facts
were you always got the same conclusion
the most interesting case and one that
you really people really ought to be
taught in elementary school is what
happened with regard to Indochina in the
late 19th that come the late 1940s of
the US was kind of ambivalent about
which third-world movements to destroy
and which ones to support that were
conflicting goals the u.s. was not had
objections to traditional European
imperialism because it kept out US
interest so they wanted it dismantled on
the other hand third-world nationalist
movements are even more of a threat so
various choices were made in the case of
Indochina in the late 1940s the US was
more or less supported to the Viet Minh
towards the Vietnamese independence
movement it had fought with the u.s.
during the war fought against the
Japanese and so on around 1950 the
government US government decided to
support the French in their effort to
reconquer Indochina at that point orders
went out to the intelligence agencies to
prove that Ho Chi Minh was a puppet of
China or Russia or the sino-soviet
conspiracy anything would do you know
it's very much like what you described
and for a couple of years they worked on
it and there's also pretty interesting
they finally felt like the final reports
couple years later where that very
strange but Hanoi seems to be the only
place in the region where there's no
contacts with China or Russia well the
conclusion that was drawn by the wise
men in the State Department Dean Acheson
so on is that proves their point they're
such a loyal puppet of take your choice
okay taking pay paying as it was called
the Moscow of the conspiracy that they
don't even have to give him orders you
take a look at the reporting over the
years
it follows whatever the conclusion is
religiously and it's the same way on
just about every issue you can think of
I'm there's kind of an interesting case
within the case of the Iraq war
and the when when George Bush and his
gang decided they were going to invade
Iraq they spread all kind of stories
about you know mushroom cloud over New
York and so on and so forth
immediate have totally reported those no
occasional questions not much just solid
from bead of approval the reason for the
war if you look back was a single
question
that's what Bush Blair repeated over and
over there's a single question will
Saddam Hussein put it into his programs
of development of nuclear weapons that
was the single question well as you
remember after a couple of years of
investigation the single question got
the wrong answer there never happened in
any there hadn't been any such programs
with an interesting exception apart from
the ones that the u.s. supported what
you won't see reported is that George
Bush number one was such an unwritten
were such enthusiastic supporters of
Saddam Hussein that it when the war with
the ground was over they Bush was then
president he actually invited Iraqi
nuclear engineers to come to the United
States for advanced training in nuclear
weapons production well that's not the
final thing to report anyhow after you
know as tenure has been no programs what
happened the story changed it wasn't
nuclear weapons that was not the reason
why we had we entered because of our
love of democracy this was part of our
democracy promotion project and in fact
if you look back in November 2003 which
gave a well advertised speech National
Endowment for democracy in Washington of
rating about our love of democracy and
that's why we had to invade Iraq to
bring democracy to the directive people
and so
take a look at the journalism like you
said turned on a dime of course there
were some things they didn't public
opinion kind of more or less follows not
entirely though there were international
polls asking people that what they
thought about the US democracy promotion
program and one place they asked them
was in Iraq I think about 1% of the
population took it seriously they have a
little experience with it that goes on
the right to the present we have a
democracy promotion program in the
Middle East that's why we supported the
Arab Spring and we're posted dictators
and so on there are international polls
asking people what they think about this
in the Arab world that was maybe 5%
think maybe it's serious
almost everybody regards it as total
nonsense can you get that recorded here
no in fact the things that can't be
reported are pretty spectacular last
December for example there was a poll
International fold top folding agencies
Gallup in the United States their
counterpart in England and asking
various questions one of the questions
that was asked was which country in the
world is the greatest threat to world
peace guess what the United States was
so far on the lead nobody was even close
way below was Pakistan and that was
inflated because of the Indians vote
I had a friend to a database check there
was one report on it in the United
States in a Murdoch Journal right-wing
Murdoch Journal New York Post they
reported it and said this this is very
interesting it shows how crazy the world
what I think I I think it's redundant to
say that I urge you to read the book but
I really do it does bring this home in a
very remarkable way also it brings home
some other lessons which lended
mentioned but I think are worth
stressing it's it's common discourse if
you you know you studied in political
science or international relations read
the press governments are committed to
security that's their major goal they're
committed to security against their
enemies there's a couple of things that
are not asked security for whom and who
are the enemies well it turns out that
one of the major enemies is you one of
the major enemies of every government is
its own population there are dangerous
we got to know everything about them
that we can we have to control them we
have to make sure they don't get out of
hand every power system believes this
certainly governments do and this is
demonstrated with spectacular clarity
than the especially in the especially in
the book which brings it together you
know I mean I'd read the reports when
they came out reading it together and
the book was different you should see it
much more dramatically second point is
whose security are they concerned with
is it security the population well
certainly not in fact after the plan of
the book reports the spectacular - Obama
I you know he thought examiner's high
officials about how this this operation
is protecting us from I think the first
claim was 54 terrorist attacks before
and then it went down to about a dozen
terrorist attacks with foil and finally
there was a government Commission which
was appointed to investigate how many
terrorist attacks were foiled they had
access to high-level security internal
documents all the best sources they did
find something one one person had sent
eight thousand dollars to Somalia that's
what this massive operation of control
of everything you do is about well that
tells you whose security is being let's
put an example of who security is being
protected it's the security of state
power from its enemy and one of the main
enemies is the population occasionally
array of light comes through on this
tribute to Harvard I'll quote the
professor of the science of Government
at Harvard I always liked that table all
those professor the science of
Government at Harvard Samuel Huntington
back in 1981 he pointed out that I
forget his exact words something like
this that power has to operate in the
dark when it's exposed to sunlight it
wilts and evaporates and then he went on
the same time to say that ever since the
Truman Doctrine 1947 it's been necessary
to try to convince the American people
that we're defending them from the
Russians of course we're not other goals
but that's we have to convince them and
that requires the power operate in the
dark that's the reason for secrecy this
all of this demonstrates it clearly you
can find it just by searching through
declassified documents if you go through
that bore and occasionally illuminating
activity you find
that's genuine security is almost never
an issue what is the main issue is
making sure that power can operate in
the dark for its own reasons support for
state power and support for private
power one of the striking things that
emerge from the Snowden revelations then
emphasized in his book is the extent to
which economic espionage is at the core
of these massive operations and not just
the United States
like for example Canada big mining
country uses these techniques to try to
find out what's happening in the British
in the Brazilian the mining and energy
industries u.s. does the same trading
partners and so on you have to expose
everything for the benefit of the forces
that really matter which are not the
population the population has to be
controlled subdued a frightened misled
and these are among the lessons that I
think come out with a dramatic clarity
from the revelations and particularly
for the book which put together
so what we want to do is have a a Q&A
session and I'm not sure I think they
told you what the format was what the
instructions are I wasn't part of that
so I don't know I guess people just line
up in this middle aisle here and then
we'll just take them one by one for as
long as we can I was very acrobatic
professor Chomsky given that American
power only seems constrained by two
things the first being that which is
required to avoid a revolution and
second is technological capability for
abuses and excesses and I'm not even
sure of the first frankly I'd like to
know what your thoughts are on where the
surveillance state is proceeding because
it as I said it seems to be simply
limited by the technological capability
to exploit the population and to spy on
it and so there may be a time when we
look back on today and I admire the
amount of freedoms that we had given
that constraint particularly the
development with the Obama
administration having essentially
normalized the procedures of the Bush
administration critically before the
first primaries but he has surprised me
on one thing his attack on civil
liberties I just I really don't see the
point of this and it's the attack on the
Fourth Amendment which of course is a
devastating attack on the Fourth
Amendment any reasonable reading of it
because we'll be on also taking
mentioned two other cases which are not
that well-known one of them is a case if
you want to look it up its holder
Attorney General V humanitarian law
project it's a case for our party Obama
administration against humanitarian law
project but Supreme Court Court justify
has validated the Obama position the
Obama position humanitarian law project
was a legal aid group it was giving
legal advice to a group that's
on the government's terrorist list the
government's terrorist list incidentally
is an abomination it should not be
tolerated in a free society you can be
on the terrorist list if the government
if the president says I don't like you
then you're on a terrorist list and if
you take a look at who was on the
terrorist list it's pretty remarkable so
for example Nelson Mandela was on the
terrorist list until a couple of years
ago because the Reagan administration
had determined that he's one of the more
notorious terrorists in the world on the
other hand Saddam Hussein was taken off
the terrorist list in 1982 because the
Reagan administration wanted to provide
him with aid for his attack on Iraq so
he was off the terrorists list the whole
idea that his grotesque it is never
questioned but putting that aside
they gave legal advice to a group on the
terrorist list that was described by the
Obama administration we can lead legal
proceedings as material assistance to
terrorism okay
material assistance used to mean you
give it terrorists a gun or something
now it means you give them legal advice
and if you read these colloquy you know
the discussion and the court it could
extend as far as having an interview
with Hasan Nasrallah a head of Hezbollah
which I've had anything that gives any
credibility to people they call
terrorists is material assistance
there's another one the NDAA
which is sort of similar that's the
National Defense budget for the military
it has a provision in it which allows
the military to hold people permanently
without charge to detain them
permanently without charge primarily
their talk about foreign citizens but it
has a provision that in principle makes
it open to American citizens there is a
court case
initiated by Chris Hedges against this
provision on one of the plaintiffs but
wasn't very happy about it frankly
because the case is concentrated on
American citizens and the kind of tacit
assumption is if you want to pick up
somebody who isn't an American citizen
and hold him indefinitely without charge
apparently that's that's okay
we shouldn't be conceding that but
anyway the case went through it at the
district level the it won the plaintiffs
won but but then the government
immediately appealed it higher levels
it's been sustained and it extends the
notion of material assistance to
terrorism to substantial aid to
terrorism whatever that means
like talking to them for example this is
no good Supreme Court will be ratified
now what does Obama kept out of pressing
home an attack on civil liberties that
goes well beyond anything you could even
get a political gain out of that's the
one thing about the administration
that's really surprised me and you're
quite right every one of these things
sets a standard which the next president
can go beyond doesn't have to but it
tends to work that way and if we accept
it if we don't do what Snowden Glenn
Greenwald and other people are doing and
really struggle against it that we're
complicit and the further erosion of the
liberties that we have and a-440 people
have fought for for years I can rest
safely now knowing that we're all we've
all provided material support to
terrorists hi thank you both for your
work so mr. Greenwald one of the things
that has stood out about this Snowden
saga is its international scope you know
traveling to Hong Kong to Russia correct
me if I'm wrong but it seems that you're
no longer you are not based in the
United
and people have become exiled over this
over the affairs with WikiLeaks they are
no longer welcome in their own countries
with in endeavors like first look media
how are you stepping outside of national
boundaries in order to more effectively
report on these kinds of issues that can
eliminate you so intensely if you are
embedded in a national culture that's a
great question
I think one of the most overlooked
aspects of the story has been exactly
what you just raised which is that the
story really is global in nature the
first story that I really concentrated
on after I started writing about
politics in 2005 was the revelation
about NSA eavesdropping on Americans
without the warrants required by the
criminal law and that story involved
companies like Verizon and Sprint and
AT&T which are overwhelmingly domestic
and it involved only the communication
of American citizens and was exclusively
a domestic controversy and what made
this story so explosive not in the
United States only but globally was the
fact that the Internet is a global means
of communication you can't invade it and
segregate the impact only to certain
countries you invade the Internet it
means that you're invading
communications internationally and
beyond that the companies that are
implicated who have eagerly participated
with the NSA for all sorts of reasons
such as Facebook and Google and Skype
and Microsoft and and Yahoo are the
means that hundreds of millions of
people not in the United States but
around the world use as their primary
means of communication and then beyond
that there was this incredible
international scope to the story it
wasn't just me working outside of the
country but my close collaborator and
partner Laura Poitras who worked from
Berlin because as a filmmaker she had
been long afraid to be in the United
States because she thought that her film
would be subpoenaed on the stories that
we did we purposely partnered with media
outlets in every country around the
world so that the people most affected
by the revelations would have their own
media outlets reporting on it with
journalists in those countries who knew
them best to maximum
the impact internationally and you know
when I go around the United States
sometimes people say well what really
has changed what are the big significant
reforms and outcomes and usually that
question is confined domestically and
there are lots of changes in in the
United States and I think there are a
lot more to come as more reporting
unfolds in the like but the real changes
invent I think in terms of the dynamic
internationally you know this is there's
so many things that have happened in the
story that some really significant ones
get overlooked but one of my favorite
events that has happened happened way
back in June of 2013 when the United
States for two weeks after we unveiled
Snowden in Hong Kong was demanding with
increasing levels of aggression that the
government in Hong Kong turned Snowden
over to them in order for them to arrest
him and bring him back to the United
States and rather than comply which is
what everyone in the American media
thought they would do to the point they
were mocking Snowden for his choice of
Hong Kong which was a stupid choice they
said because of course Hong Kong is
gonna obey the dictate of the United
States instead the government of Hong
Kong said we'd like to put you on this
plane and have you go wherever you want
and then the day they did that and if
you haven't seen it please go look at it
when you get home because it's the
funniest thing ever they issued this
statement saying the United States
government has submitted a request to
the government of Hong Kong to detain
Edward Snowden and turn him over
unfortunately the documents of the
United States government submitted were
filled out improperly and we therefore
have no choice but to let him go and
then the last paragraph said it began
with the word meanwhile we have recently
learned that the United States
government is invading the
communications of our civilian
infrastructure Zoar research facilities
are no universities and we think an
investigation is warranted and the
reason that was so significant aside
from how hilarious it is is that it's
signaled that there was going to be this
change of tenor in how the United States
was perceived and after that happened
country after country government after
government publicly defied the US and a
really brazen an unapologetic way unlike
what almost never happened and you saw
Russia do it when they granted him
asylum and refused to turn him over when
he was in the airport and he saw
latin-american countries like Venezuela
and Nicaragua
in Bolivia all formally offer him asylum
and you saw Ecuador publicly argue for
his asylum and then you saw Brazil which
has always had this sort of complex of
being subservient to the United States
because it been dominated through all
kinds of colonial and imperialist
policies not only canceled the state
visit the first that they honored the
Brazilian president within forty years
but then the president of Brazil Dilma
Rousseff whose conversations were
themselves targeted and invaded as we
reported in Brazil went to the UN and
vehemently denounced the United States
and very harsh terms of human rights and
privacy while President Obama lurked
angrily out in the hallway and Germany
has done the same thing at his damaged
international relations it has changed
the way that people think about the
United States all over the world and
when you start changing consciousness
and not just consciousness about how
people think about surveillance or
privacy but about how they think about
their own governments power and the role
of the United States and a whole variety
of other issues fundamental change will
emerge and it will emerge quickly and
probably in ways that we can't even
anticipate and I think the most exciting
part of the story is exactly what you
asked about which is the international
scope really the global scope of how the
story has played out
I was a Chomsky if there is a theme to
your book I finished I just I'm sorry oh
if there is a theme to your book which I
just finished reading is that for me was
quotes not only from your laptop getting
stolen from your house and that can you
resolution to how hard you were going to
tackle the issues even harder to learn
how to install a program a computer
program for hacking purposes or for you
know communicating on so for me the team
notebook was really gross your personal
growth and I think that's what I see for
the last year and I guess my question is
sir what has this last year taught you
personally and for professor Chomsky
you're real quick it was really hard to
find a book of you in Spanish and it
took me like I want I would be honored
if you could please sign for me that you
could sign the book for me that I think
we're gonna both be around a little bit
after all to sign so you know just as
far as the question you asked I mean I
talked a lot about the primary lesson
that I feel like I learned from from
being able to observe Edward Snowden but
you know I also and then I've obviously
learned you know specific kinds of
information such as how to encrypt my
communications which is proven to be
very important and you know that's one
of the things the importance of which
shouldn't be underestimated is if we all
start encrypting our communications it
makes it impossible for the NSA or close
to impossible for them to invade our
communications that's something we can
do to empower ourselves now that we know
how much our privacy is being
compromised but there is another really
crucial lesson that you know I think I
learned which is you know Laura and I
have talked about this a lot which is
once we realize the fearlessness that
drove Edward Snowden's choice we felt an
obligation to have our work be driven by
the same spirit of fearlessness and once
we started doing that other people with
whom we were working including a very
large media institution that has all the
same impediments and concerns which is
the Guardian actually began being
infected by that same sort of spirit and
did actually give me an enormous support
to report the story
as aggressively as I thought it should
be reported and then huge numbers of
people around the world that I hear from
all the time journalism students and
other kinds of people who thought they
were gonna go work for tech companies
and have decided not to or journalist
students who say I now understand that
the purpose of journalism is to keep
people in power in check there's this
massive ripple effect and I do think
that this phrase courage is contagious
it's probably something that if somebody
said to me five years ago or two years
ago I would have sort of abstractly
agreed with it's now something that is a
statement of principle that I know is
true on a really visceral level and it
can happen really quickly and the ways
in which you can impact other people's
thought process and choices is virtually
limitless if if you act with passion and
fearlessness mr. Greenwald professor
Chomsky if you would both comment on the
various roles of the other various
professions of a journalist and an
academic in the world today in light of
their the freedom the effectiveness and
the limitations of both roles for
example I would imagine being a
journalist it would be limited by what
the public finds interesting you know
some of the less than savory
characteristics of media and then as an
academic I would imagine you would be
limited by feeling obligated to help
students navigate through a system that
is not like entirely beneficial and that
the government itself considers its
primary threat to be the people of the
country itself I'll start with that you
know I have always resisted pretty
vigorously any kind of label that feels
self-limiting it's one of the reasons
why I resist ideological labels because
it sort of announces in advance that
you're supposed to have a certain belief
system regardless of how you engage on
an issue and where your rationality
takes you and the same is true of this
these roles like okay there was a debate
early on about whether or not I was an
activist or a
journalist as though they were mutually
exclusive and I actually found the
debate really confusing because I
absolutely consider myself to be both
and I don't think they distract from one
another in any way I think they fuel
themselves I think journalists who don't
have a sense of activism meaning a
desire to have what they're doing have
positive effects in the world are
practicing this really impotent neutered
Solich dead-end boring form of the
practice that has actually killed it and
then ate it not only corrupted but
really just boring and uninteresting and
so I think that if you whatever you do
in in your job or in your life if you
think that there are limits on what that
role entails intrinsically just ignore
them violate those rules and and do the
things that you want that you think can
help you transcend those limits I mean
he is a professor but he's way more than
that right and so I think that that's
kind of what I was saying before was
that you know I think we all have it
within ourselves to have this profound
effect on the world and the question is
finding how what what is in yourself and
and creating your own rules to maximize
that not let it be limited it's a sound
question it questions like this brings
up my mind interesting comment by George
Orwell
which isn't as well-known as it should
be his book Animal Farm everybody's read
probably in elementary school he had an
introduction to Animal Farm which very
few people read that's one reason it
wasn't published was found 30 years
later after his death in the
introduction the book of course is a
bitter satiric critique of the
totalitarian enemy and in the
introduction he addresses himself to the
people of England free England and he
says you shouldn't feel too
self-righteous when you read this
because in England under freedom
unpopular ideas can
suppressed without the use of force and
he doesn't go into the reasons very much
but one line is relevant to your
question he says one of the reasons is
because a good education if you have a
good education it's going to the best
schools you know Oxford Cambridge you
have internalized the understanding that
there are certain things that just
wouldn't do to say and I think students
should be liberated from that internal
internalized indoctrination what how
they decided to navigate through the
perils of their lives yes
that's difficult and you know I I
wouldn't feel that I'd have any reason
to give them advice about it but they
should at least gain the understanding
of it not only of the nature of the
system of indoctrination and control the
kind of things going stalking about but
also the internal fact that you have
been trained since childhood to have it
instilled into you so you don't ask the
questions you don't think about it
that's a form of entrapment and attack
on personal integrity that is very
extreme in some ways you could say worse
than torture and people ought to be
liberated from that
so just as a note we have time for just
one more question and then we will begin
the book signing thank you for a
remarkable fearless work mr. Greenwald
I have actually two quick questions for
you one is how do you choose the order
in which to release the documents and
also the second one is can you elaborate
a little bit on whether and how the
American government has targeted you as
a person and especially in the last year
I guess so we better understand you know
what what have what happens Thanks yeah
you know the way that we choose to
release the document is a pretty simple
formula which is that we go through them
continuously and have been going through
them continuously for the past 11 months
as soon as we find something that we
think is significant and interesting and
newsworthy we work as hard as we can as
fast as we can to get it ready to be
published it is a frustrating process
because if you're going to publish
top-secret documents the position of the
US government is is that you're
committing a felony even if you are
working within a media organization and
nobody's going to do that without going
through a vetting process of editors and
lawyers and it has been a little bit
irritating to try and get this done more
quickly because there are always lots of
impediments but you know war and I and
lots of other journalists have both been
working literally 15 hours a day seven
days a week for 11 months on nothing but
this archive and there still are a lot
of other stories that are left to be
done including some huge ones not
because I'm purposely saving them but
because the reporting is really
difficult if you're gonna report for
example on who exactly the US government
has targeted in terms of surveillance
and you want to name those people so you
can illustrate the kinds of abuses that
are taking place you want to make sure
that you're not injuring people's
reputations or harming them against
their will and you want to make sure
that you're extremely careful and
certain about the things that you're
saying and these things take time which
isn't you know I know frustrating for
people out there waiting for stories and
also for me but it's a necessary part of
the process as far as being targeted you
know I mean it really is true and it's
not just false humility I mean
journalists all over the world
old hoodoo good journalism almost by
definition get targeted in all sorts of
ways and and usually they work in
obscurity as opposed to great visibility
and and the ways in which they're
targeted are much worse than anything
I've endure endure no let's go to war
and get killed I was on a panel once
with this Brazilian journalist who
uncovered massive corruption in the
local police force where he lived and a
totally obscure and anonymous way he
investigated this police force for two
years he got death threats he got rocks
burned through his window he got beaten
up his wife left him because she felt
like he was subjecting their children to
danger and he just continued I would
never have known his name had I not been
on this panel with him it got the entire
police force fired and new police
officers put in and that happens all
over the world all the time to
journalists I really have had a newfound
respect for the ability of journalism to
achieve positive change when it's done
correctly but of course I mean the the
the intention of the US government from
its continuous public statements at the
highest levels of the Obama
administration that what I specifically
was doing and the work I was doing was
criminal was a felony constituted
selling documents was something I ought
to be arrested for was a very deliberate
strategy to create this climate of fear
around the journalism that was taking
place so that every time we went to
publish a document we were supposed to
think is this the thing that's gonna
push me over the line and make them
arrest me
I had lawyers who usually can get Eric
Holder on the phone in two seconds who
got no information every time they tried
to find out whether lore and I would be
arrested when we returned to the US
because they deliberately wanted us to
remain in this state of uncertainty
obviously detaining my partner halfway
across the world while I was back in
Brazil and locking him in a room for 11
hours under a terrorism law and then
announcing that there was a criminal
investigation against him under this
terrorism statute or marching into the
Guardians newsroom and demanding while
agents of the government oversaw that
they destroyed their computers was all
very thuggish attempts to do the same
thing and so there was genuine concern
you take those things seriously if
you're at all rational that the
journalism could subject you to serious
danger but the thing that we vowed from
the very beginning is that under no
circumstances
would it ever deter us from publishing a
single document and honestly if anything
it just absolutely embolden me to work
harder because when they show their
thuggish face it makes you realize how
much more important than you thought
before transparency is and you know we
finally came back just on principle
because we weren't going to be kept out
of our own country four completely
invalid reasons of intimidation but they
often as professor Chomsky was just
saying there are lots of ways to
intimidate people and caused people to
censor their own rights without overt
shows of force and this climate of fear
even talking openly about imprisoning
journalists having graphics on the CNN
screen like I saw multiple times should
go and Greenwell be prosecuted where a
little panel of pundants debates that
it's all intended to make journalists
think really carefully before they do
this kind of reporting okay great thank
you everyone very much
