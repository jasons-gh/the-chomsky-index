there is in the recent period
particularly that increasing shaping of
Education from the early ages towards on
that towards passing an examination that
can be taking tests can be of some use
both for the person who's taking the
test see what I know
where where I am what I've achieved what
I haven't for our instructors which
would be changed and improved in
developing the course of instruction but
beyond that didn't really tell you very
much I mean I know for for many many
years I was on I've been on admissions
committees for entry into a advanced
graduate program maybe one of the most
the best anywhere and we of course pay
some attention to test results but
really not too much I mean you can a
person can do magnificently on every
test and understand very little I mean
all of us have been through schools and
colleges and universities are very
familiar with this you can be assigned
you can be in sums a course that you
have no interest in and there's demand
that you pass a test and you can study
hard for the test and you can ace it to
use the idiot do fine and three week and
a couple of weeks later you forgot with
topic was I'm sure we've all had that
experience I know I had it's it can be a
useful device if it contributes to the
constructive purposes of Education if
it's just the set of hurdles you have to
cross it can turn out to be knowing
meaning Elizabeth can divert you away
from things you want to be doing I see
this regularly when I talk to teachers
just give you one experience from a
couple of weeks ago but there's plenty
like it I have to be talking to a group
which included many school teachers that
one of them was a sixth grade teacher
teachers kids it's in our leavener under
12 something like that she came up to me
afterwards and I'd been talking about
these things and she told me that I'm an
experience that she had just had in her
class after one of the classes a little
girl came up to her and said she was
really interested in something that came
up and she asked how she couldn't do
could the teacher give her some ideas
about how to look into it further and
the teacher was compelled to tell her
I'm sorry but you can't do that you have
to study the past this national exam
that's coming that's going to determine
your future the teacher didn't say it
but it's going to determine my future
like whether I heard and so on
the system is geared to getting the
children to pass hurdles but not to
learn and understand and explore that
child would have been better off if she
had been allowed to explore what she was
interested in and maybe not do so well
on the test about things she wasn't
interested in and they'll come along
when they fit into her interests and
concerns and so a test I don't say that
test should be eliminated they can be a
useful educational tool but ancillary
something that's just helping improve
for ourselves for instructors and others
what we're doing tell us where we are
moving but they don't even passing tests
doesn't begin to compare with with
searching and inquiring and into
pursuing topics that engages and excite
us that's far more significant than
passing tests and in fact if you pursue
if you if that's the kind of educational
career that you're given the opportunity
for soon you will remember what you
discovered she was a famous physicist
world famous physicist right here at MIT
like a lot of the senior faculty was
teaching freshman courses he once said
that in his freshman course didn't
Alaska what are we going to cover this
semester and his standard answer was it
doesn't matter what we cover it matters
what you discovered and that's right
teaching ought to be inspiring students
to discover on their own that to
challenge if they don't agree to look
for alternatives if they think they're
better went to work through the great
achievements of the past and try to
master them on the run because they're
interested in it
if that's the way teaching and is done
students will really gain from it and
will not only remember what they studied
but will be able to use it as a basis
for going on in the room and again
education is really aimed at just
helping students get to the point where
they can learn on their own because
that's what you're going to do for their
life not just absorb materials that give
it to you from the outside and repeated
you
