from Public Radio International I'm
Christopher Lydon this is open source
Noam Chomsky and Tom Rix could be said
to invited two different ways of knowing
knowing the war in Iraq for example
Chomsky is the Einstein of language
theory not a military strategist he get
to know about Iraq by reading up and
thinking hard before the US invasion for
example about a major problem in the
Shiite majority which in any kind of
Iraqi democracy would want to align with
the Shiite state of Iran that was the
last thing the US wants Chomsky saw in
advance because Iran is the u.s. is next
target as now it seems to be tamrac's is
a pentagon reporter who covered the war
room and the fighting day-to-day for
four years compiling his top of the list
bestseller fiasco about a bad war plan
badly executed with two ways of knowing
two angles of view one from the briefing
room in the battlefield the other from
hyper-rational analysis and satellite
height turmeric Sonoma County our next
an open source open source is produced
in association with the University of
Massachusetts Lowell with masters
programs exploring new interdisciplinary
approaches to environmental social and
economic problems for more information
email our ESD at uml edu I'm Christopher
Lydon this is open source a radio
conversation living on the fat of the
linked Internet land at radio open
source org talking to perspectives on
the US in Iraq this hour with the
toughest questionnaire of the US at war
for forty years now the MIT linguist
noam chomsky who saw an imperialist
disaster coming in Iraq before it began
and with Thomas Rix the Washington Post
Pentagon reporter who has written the
definitive hindsight so far on what he
calls in his title Fiasco had they
converged on one disaster with two
lenses do their stories confirm each
other do you want to argue with them or
hear them argue or hear them agree the
way into this conversation is with a
comment on our website wwlp.com ski is
of course
professor of linguistics at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
his new book is called failed States the
abuse of power and the assault on
democracy Noam Chomsky let's work back
from the news of the Israeli Hezbollah
ceasefire in Lebanon you had your own
remarkable first tour of Lebanon just
two or three months ago and you got to
know a son nasrallah a man I just asked
it didn't everybody lose that war if
you're talking about people everybody
loses the most worse if you're talking
about leadership well the ones who start
wars and organize them maybe maybe not
Lebanon lost Hezbollah got badly beat up
Israel got scared the United States got
embarrassed
well Hezbollah won a huge victory as far
as the leadership is concerned they're
now probably the most popular group in
the Arab world they're even in Lebanon
you know with it not terribly popular
they their support for them is
overwhelming the latest polls in Beirut
showed about 87 percent support for
Hezbollah resistance to Israel that
included eighty percent Christians
eighty percent Druze in fact even the
Maronite patriarch came out and
supported them of course the government
of Iraq did and over the in the Arab
world the ruling tyrants are opposed to
them but at the risk of alienating their
own populations were strongly in support
I mean it's the first Arab force that
has fought his real door stand still
that means a lot I mean actually there's
a very interesting discussion of this
before the invasion by Rami Khouri the
most respected journalist in the Arab
world in a very sensible one the Atlanta
editors of the Lebanese Daily Star yes
he pointed out that the governments of
the Arab states have been unable to
deter Israeli aggression takeover of
lands and resources crushing of the
Palestinians and so on and that
naturally leads to the development of
non-governmental forces which sort of
take up the task of protecting the
population and some
military paramilitary forces it's a very
dangerous situation but it is an
automatic reaction to a predictable one
Cosmo is one of them introduces two
necessarily if you will my version the
version I heard was that you were
speaking at American University in
Beirut and he wanted to meet Noam
Chomsky and then while they jump lot
they Druze Christian later to Druze yeah
yes
what did tell us about the man nasrallah
or well it's focus on the Sorolla okay
yeah I wanted to meet his like I do
everywhere or when I have some time has
brought a spectrum of opinion and people
as I could including leadership but also
popular activist groups and so on and
among the most very pleased to receive a
invitation from nasrallah I went with
two friends both in Boston
both specialists on Lebanon incidentally
that one of them grew up there so you
couldn't help translate my impression
was about the same as everything else
therefore it for example Edward Peck who
was one of the leading counter-terrorist
specialists of the Reagan administration
recently described his meeting with
nasrallah I was about the same as mine
he said he's gives the impression of
being very measured
reasonable pragmatic thought things
through he answers your questions
explicitly you can like them his
opinions or hate him but you can
understand nobody's saying he does
social work are they intent on erasing
Israel from the map or not well their
official position which he repeated to
us and I presume it's correct is that
they don't think Israel's a legitimate
state but that's the opinion throughout
the Arab world however they said he says
and they say that they will go along
with whatever the Palestinians agreed to
well you know for 20 years officially
and for many more years tacitly the
Palestinians have been calling for
support for the international consensus
on a two-state settlement on the
international border and husband the
Arab League supports that Iran supports
it and Hezbollah necessarily says yeah
they'll support it too they don't like
it
but if that's what the Palestinians want
that's fine they won't disrupt look
ahead from Lebanon which seems now in
retrospect to have been a kind of proxy
tryout of a United States confrontation
with Iran
sorry Hersh writes in the new New Yorker
that the outcome in Lebanon was a
massive setback for those in the White
House who want to use force in Iran what
is the prospect now do you think and
then I want to enlist tamrac's in the
same question well I don't really think
that that's correct I mean I don't have
Sai hirtius sources or in fact any
sources but just looking at we're gonna
find out how you do do it but that's
another Medicaid but there's plenty of
information available that gives
essentially the same picture as his
sources do and I don't think there was
around related one goal was from the US
point of view is to eliminate a possible
Lebanese deterrent to an eventual if it
happens I doubt it an eventual invasion
of Iraq Iran there is a Lebanese
determine anyway they could attack
Israel okay that's presumably eliminated
so that's a kind of a side benefit but I
think the rate the major story there is
Palestine it's not talked about much but
the crucial issue in all of this is the
fact that the United States and Israel
and these are always joint operations
the US and Israel are implementing
long-standing programs basically to
drive the last nail into the coffin of
Palestinian nationalism that Gaza has
been turned into a prison they are now
implementing proposals that are here
called withdrawal but in fact our
annexation and canonization and
imprisonment of the West Bank
imprisonment because they take over the
Jordan Valley Canton ization because the
struck the infrastructure projects break
it up into virtually separated Canton's
a little piece of Jerusalem
an annexation simply taking over
valuable land and the major resources
well you know in the Arab League as on
the West Bank our unit everyone agrees
and in Gaza it's a kind of a catastrophe
the only support meaningful support that
the Palestinians are getting and the
our world or in fact anywhere is
Hezbollah and it therefore follows that
Hezbollah has to be destroyed well as
well as deeply integrated into Lebanese
society you that's why they bomb South
Beirut I visit ate himself be rude it's
just a poor slum you know but it's
people or nabatea where I also was yeah
it's yeah I was struck that you you keep
talking about the Palestinian issue and
the importance but I wanted to get to
that and I in your letter with John
Berger and and Harold Pinter and jose
Saramago and all the the nobel class of
commentators fixes on that issue we must
come back to it but i also want to ask
tom Rick's picking up on this threat of
after Lebanon
what's the Iran you know what's the Iran
next move with Iran what's your version
of that one Tom I agree that it's
unlikely that you'll see a US invasion
of Iran
what I find perplexing about this whole
situation is that the United States and
Iraq has essentially engaged in a
massive transfer of power from the Sunni
population which held power under Saddam
Hussein and previously under the British
and the Ottomans to the Shiite
population one of the major
beneficiaries of this transfer has been
muqtada solder a radical Shiite cleric
who recently mounted a huge
demonstration in support of Hezbollah so
here we are empowering an ally of
Hezbollah in Iraq I don't get it this is
a guy who two years ago militarily
confronted US forces killed many US
troops with his militias and is now a
major figure in the new government I
mean I'd like to hear professor
Chomsky's interpretation of that it's
not a loaded question I just don't
understand it well frankly I'm surprised
a country what said before I thought
that the invasion of Iraq would be a
quick success if they thought of you one
of the easiest military victories in
history Iraq was totally defenseless it
barely existed the invasion eliminated
two Turan from destructive regimes not
one they eliminated Saddam Hussein they
also terminated the sanctions which had
state of the society killed hundreds
thousands of people the US could come in
get a class from the MIT electrical
engineering department probably get the
electricity started again instead of
being one of the easiest military
victories in history became one of the
worst military catastrophes in history
did you think that an insurgency was
inevitable they're not if they had done
it with any sense I wouldn't have liked
the US I'm not in favor of a US military
victory I was against the invasion but
my guess was it would easily be
successful but the incompetence and
arrogance of the Rumsfeld Cheney
Wolfowitz crowd is just kind of
indescribable
they created a catastrophe even for
themselves Humber expands about 600
pages describing it okay and well you've
you know you know more about than I do
but it's obvious even from my point of
view and what they have done as you say
is empower a Shiite majority which I'm
sure was the last thing they wanted
after all they tried in every way they
could to prevent an actual election they
were finally forced to allow it by
mainly by Ayatollah Sistani and what the
former Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul
Wolfowitz wanted well I think he really
did believe that we can go in and set up
a democracy and to the in Iraq that's
always meant Shiite power okay but see
he's just an ideological fanatic I don't
think anyone who knew anything about
Iraq and wanted and anticipated that I
mean just think how that's a nightmare
for the United States if there's a
Shiite majority and it's got some
sovereignty and it's moderately
democratic of course it's gonna link up
with Iran it's not just muqtada al-sadr
I mean the prime minister also denounced
the invasion of Lebanon thee the
Parliament voted I think unanimously are
close to that - what do you what do you
make of the u.s. effectively
transferring power to an ally of
Hezbollah in Iraq I mean I think it's
just sheer stupidity just a series of
mistakes they didn't do from you know
again I'm not I don't want them to
succeed like you know I think the
Russians could have done better in
Afghanistan but doesn't mean I favor the
invasion they carried out they hoped to
be able to install a traditional client
state that does what the US wants them
to do
they couldn't do it hold the thought
because we've gotta take a short break
but all of this strangely enough you
wrote Noam Chomsky in the in 2003 before
the invasion we're talking about Iraq in
hindsight hi this is Brendan I'm the
open source blogger and chief we have
two empty chairs in our office they make
us sad and we want to fill them we are
looking for fall
interns interns who will not be making
coffee but who will actually be
researching writing for the website and
producing for the show we treat our
interns well we train the hell out of
them and we trust them with very
important things if you see yourself in
our office click on the link that reads
fall internships at Radio open-source
org open source is produced in
association with the University of
Massachusetts at law and WGBH Radio
Boston this is open source from pri I'm
Christopher Lydon this is open source
we're talking about Iraq with two men
with two very different angles Noam
Chomsky most famous originally as a
linguist a war critic I think of him as
the American Socrates asking every
manner of awkward question especially
about our role in the world and Tom
Rick's Washington Post Pentagon reporter
who has compiled day-to-day history was
an amazing narrative energy and an
unquestionable conclusion in the title
fiasco we were just speaking about this
matter of us invading Iraq who wins the
war Iran to plump a little bit for Noam
Chomsky's anticipation Tom he wrote in
The Guardian as I was reading it today
in The Guardian in the spring early
spring before the war Noam Chomsky said
of course the 60% Shiite majority if
there's anything like a democracy in
Iraq is going to want to sidle up to
Iran reduce the tensions reintegrate
Iran in there in the whole region which
he said is the last thing the US wants
Iran is the us's next target for that
kind of fourth
thinking ahead we expect that's what
military intelligence or something is
somebody in the conning tower there is
thinking about were they one would hope
but as a senior military intelligence
officer said to me one day when I was
researching my book he said Tom you know
what the difference is between general
Tommy Franks and tyronn and I said no
what he said Tehran had a phase four
plan he said in fact as US forces moved
across southern Iraq in the spring of
2003 he said we had Iranian agents upon
our heels sweeping in right behind us
making connections locally activating
networks I've always suspected that they
also were active on behalf of McCotter
solder which surprised me a bit cos
solder is seen as more of a nationalist
Iraqi not necessarily a pro Iranian
Shiite but sort of a nationalist Shiite
yet in the spring of 2003 I think solder
is militia we really were a bunch of you
know Street guys just with RPGs and
ak-47s
we're very militarily effective in doing
things like dropping large highway
bridges in front of a convoy I was in
I've always suspected that the Iranians
were helping them out maybe with Iranian
Special Forces and intelligence officers
well that's Noam Chomsky yeah I mean
it's basically the United States that
created solder as a major figure but the
major Shiite groups like scary and they
bought a brigade I mean they're right
their background is Iranian yeah those
BOTS every guys was trained in Iran they
forget actually the Sistani is I think
still in Iranians it's not yeah he's
born in Iran in fact a lot of the
clerics have close connections with you
around I mean anybody who had minimal
knowledge of the region knew that if
Iraq is granted any degree of
sovereignty and minimal democracy does
Shiite adjust what you read the Shiite
majority will try to strengthen its
relations with Iran and it's worse than
that surely people in military
intelligence must know this I'm by an
accident of geography the major energy
resources of the world happened to be in
Shiite areas southern Iraq Iran and
Saudi Arabia's well you're free
aspect of the war planning here which
was that people who had knowledge were
not invited back to meetings because
they expressed skepticism and doubt
about the assurance that this would be
easy yeah I my suspicion is when if we
ever get declassified documents on this
thirty years from now we'll find that
the military was opposed that
intelligence was opposed and they were
overruled by a clique of extremist
fanatics aren't you one thing I report
in my book that hadn't been disclosed
before was the fall of 2002 an order
went out from the Joint Staff saying
that if we invade Iraq you will consider
it part of the war on terror the reason
I had to do that is because so many
officers had expressed concerns and what
the hell does Iraq if I do with the war
on terror why are you talking about Iraq
why are we keeping an eye on bin Laden
right and in fact you know enough
information has leaked from CIA and
other intelligence agencies to indicate
that that was probably their
interpretation too and it takes no great
genius I mean it's obvious and let me
continue on the Saudi Arabian thing
which is probably their major nightmare
right across the border it happens to be
the region of Saudi Arabia where most of
the oil is as a Shiite majority they've
been bitterly repressed by the us-backed
tyranny they're now pressing you can
read the suppressed pressing for more
rights more autonomy I mean you can
imagine loosely linked Shiite alliance
Iran southern Iraq Saudi Arabia
controlling most of the world's oil an
independent of Washington I was like the
ultimate nightmare for planners almost
yeah I could easily see a Iranian code
in Iraqi government dominated by Shiites
saying we want to extend the handle
sympathy to our press brothers in Arabia
and Saudi Arabia which is where the oil
is and so around and in fact it could
get worse they're already making moves
towards the east you know the United
States can intimidate Europe and they
shake their fist and say disinvest for
me in Iran and the big corporations pull
out they can't intimidate China that's
why they're so afraid of China and
Shauna wanted energy yeah try to moves
in you know in fact very sad very
dramatically when President who visited
Washington a couple of months ago the
administration felt they could insult
him so they didn't grant him a state
dinner only a state lunch he was
perfectly happy with that he went back
and insulted them in spades he flew off
to Saudi Arabia immediately made new
deals for trade and investment with the
King Abdullah's returning his visit
there sending them weapons they're happy
to do it and the Saudi and Saudi
Arabians and the Iranians are perfectly
happy with that well you know the Bush
administration planners have succeeded
in threatening what was the one of the
core principles of US foreign policy
since World War two namely controlling
the world's energy reserves but also
they decided after 9/11 that stability
was no longer our goal in the Middle
East that had been the goal literally
for half a century we wanted to believe
we laid all costs in the Middle East
this is what's dr. Wolper Webb saying
yes especially Wolfowitz brothers others
around them would say I remember being
told in interviews they'd say
containment with the part of the problem
containing Iraq was part of the problem
and if you like 9/11 keep up a policy of
containment and so stability became not
the goal but the target of US policy in
the Middle East and they were going to
quote-unquote drain the swamp so in some
ways you still see them arguing that
line the way you're seeing now is the
birth pangs of a new Middle East what do
you make of that professor Chomsky this
- this idea that the u.s. goal in the
Middle East is now instability relative
stability I don't really believe it I
think they want Wolfowitz all put to the
side there's a reason why he was kicked
out of Washington he was just an
embarrassment but Rumsfeld and Cheney
are there Rice's there and they're
rational people I think they wanted the
kind of stability that the US has say
and tries to have in Latin America and
elsewhere namely subordinate regimes
they're not trying to overthrow the
government of Saudi Arabia that's the
oldest and most valued ally of the
United States it's part of us support
for radical Islamic fundamentalism well
I pursued that with you why then the
trashing of sort of the old-line
Republican mandarins like Ben Scowcroft
and James Baker because they were saying
they were thinking through what's going
to happen and these guys are and we you
know been better than I do they're an
extremist group with who wants to hold
tight Authority run everything in a very
authoritarian fashion and they think
they can do what they want I mean look
at the way they planned the war in Iraq
I mean anyone with brains could have
told them that's gonna be a busy time
Rex you know I I remember years ago Tom
winch it then the editor of the Boston
Globe the late time when she used to say
we got to get Chomsky on staff here just
haven't walked him through the newsroom
every once in a while and say what the
hell is going on question why doesn't
the Pentagon call Noam Chomsky once in a
while and say does this make any sense
you may not know this but Tom offered me
a job at the globe just that I leave MIT
and go to the globe to pick out stories
it's not covering I figured that would
last for about a week so no it's but
come on that the Pentagon needs to help
this is a question of judgment and
values but also of you know have we
crossed any T's dotted any i's do we
know what in the world were doing well I
the military now I think is more open to
information than it was partly because
going into this war they've been told we
don't want all these experts bothering
us either military professional experts
or area experts who understood Arabic
language and history and culture so when
general Shinseki got up and gave his
best professional military advice he was
slapped down hard and publicly
likewise when area experts said you know
you really need to think about you know
these sectarian differences these
demographic issues locations of energy
they were not invited back I know a
military intelligence expert who
reviewed part of the annex Bravo which
is the intelligence appendix to a war
plan sending a list of issues that he
had with it and literally was not
invited back to the next meeting because
people who raised issues made the
occupation seem difficult and they
wanted to tell you that the occupation
was going to be easy well I'm interested
your opinion about this but my
impression from outside is that the
military themselves did not want the war
but that the Pentagon civilians did
Rumsfeld Cheney that bunch yeah during
2002 there was an enormous amount of
skepticism about invading Iraq why
exactly what's what new information do
you have and it really took him that in
the fall of 2002 a couple of events when
Vice President Cheney got up and said in
August 2006 2002 that quote there is no
doubt about Iraq Yepez mass destruction
the military got the message the debates
over and in our society and I think
properly when the civilians give the
orders the military shots up salute
smartly and moves out a month later
defense secretary Rumsfeld said the
debate is over they got the message and
finally you've had the formal issuance
of an order from the Joint Staff saying
you will consider this part of the war
on terror so the military had expressed
their doubts and scepticism they were
unhappy about it but then they were told
you need to go do this generals any
bailout generals immediate are retired
and in fact endorsed Bush and Cheney in
the 2000 campaign 2000 but what did but
my recollection is that he criticized
this operation even before it started oh
yes
September 2002 yeah in October 2002 he
became quite publicly critical party
because when he asked a senior officer
at Central Command what about my desert
crossing war plan which is a plan for
what are we what we do if the government
in Iraq collapses David they said what
we'd never heard of that this is
something he'd worked on for years and
the State Department of course had
extensive plans which they apparently
just junks yeah the future of Iraq study
there were there was also work by the
Army War College looking at what the
issues would be and instead I get the
person that Rumsfeld kind of cooked up
what he thought might be the problems
wrote a list of like 13 issues that
really were in disregard of professional
knowledge of counterinsurgency there are
certain things that again and again have
worked in counterinsurgency campaigns
close the borders treat your prisoner as
well and the war plan was written and
disregarded that as was the occupation
plan hmm
Tomer exit let's let's also just get to
the
the real horror that's still unfolding
in Iraq 3400 Iraqis died in July
overwhelmingly civilians that's and one
has just to put it in proportion it's
more than the Americans who died at the
World Trade Center it's more many more
than died in Lebanon in in the last
month and not just the body to show up
in the morgue every time I've been down
around the baghdad sewer system there's
bodies that come up against the grates
that flow into the city there are bodies
that are thrown directly into the Tigris
and Euphrates so I think it probably is
only a fraction of those who are
actually killed how do we get here who's
gonna who's gonna make an accounting of
it who is going to be held accountable
here and I'm really talking about this
the general American conversation about
so-called war on terror who's scared
what's dangerous where are we I think
two things first every time I've been to
Iraq I've been surprised it's worse than
one of my previous trip I've been five
times the last one was January and
February this year January and February
that this year Baghdad was an absolute
Hobbesian state in which there was a war
of all against all any security you had
was self provided the US military didn't
recognize that when I asked US military
guys they say no the area you're living
in and by the way reporters do not live
in the Green Zone was one of the great
myths we have a house that in the so
called red zone which is the rest of
Iraq when I talk to US military guys
they say oh you're area secure and it
finally dawned on me too what they meant
was secure meant you could drive a
Humvee through with the 50 caliber
machine gun on top and most of the time
you would not be attacked that has
nothing to do with security of average
Iraqis and what u.s. military
intelligence doesn't capture so it
doesn't pass up the chain of command
ultimately to the president is most of
what happens to Iraqis most of the time
they get any threat to American troops
in their security reports can they get
any killing or most killings of Iraqis
what they don't get is rape kidnapping
robbery and most of all
all violent political intimidation so
they don't get the atmosphere of nobody
knowing whether the cop on the corner as
part of a despot is gonna kill you today
they can't get it if they want for
example there are you know Iraqi
reporters who are writing regularly like
near Menaul Muftis Turkmen writes
regularly and Nala from weekly read in
English describing exactly what's going
what the life of the Rockies is like but
they don't they don't get that and they
don't they don't hear it but these
second party question is what is it open
I mean for us and I think open means for
us we need to consider whether the
American system is working my opinion
I'd grown out of writing the book was
that I don't think it is and more even
than the Bush administration I blame the
Congress the Bush administration did
what it did it made use mistakes but you
don't get a mess is a big because Iraq
if the American system is working and
what hasn't been working particularly is
the oversight and accountability role of
Congress and this is not just what
informing the American people this is to
make a the war effort more effective
you've got a Republican Republicans in
Congress that don't ask embarrassing
questions and Democrats in Congress who
either don't want to ask questions
because they don't want to look weak
under on defense the media doesn't
didn't ask many questions either and
it's given the last month a pretty
pretty blind eye that's the great myths
of our modern times but the media didn't
ask questions we asked questions we
didn't get answers we wrote stories I
heard a story a month before the
invasion I asked the channel the Joint
Chiefs you don't know where the WMD is
do you and he said no but I'm confident
that once we cross the board of the
Iraqis will show us I wrote these
stories Walter Pincus wrote these
stories now yeah the New York Times
screwed things up to a fare-thee-well
but you're painting with a pretty broad
brush if you say the media
fair enough Tom I stand corrected but I
do I am the New York Times refugee and
and reader but I want you to expand your
reading base I stand corrected and it's
a good point but I just want to come
back to the venerable Pottery Barn rule
there's nobody coats anymore but it
makes a certain moral sense you break it
you own it which doesn't mean to say you
stay there forever but that you have a
moral responsibility for thirty four
hundred dead in Iraq last month where do
we begin
making that real in our own in our own
hearts and our minds are in public
discussion our own politics I would
begin with congressional hearings on the
conduct of the war one thing that the US
military actually has done better this
year is look at the issue of American
violence against Iraqi civilians and how
it's contained how it's used
how how it's reviewed one of the things
that shocked senior commanders was that
there was no marine investigation of the
Haditha killings it seemed to really not
raise an eyebrow when 24 civilians were
killed in the course of a marine
operation they and senior leaders
general Corelli when he heard about this
said no I want that investigated but I
think the point in Congress is you just
holding hearings asking commanders
asking senior officers what have you
done out there how have you done it how
what do you attribute these failures to
when an Abu Ghraib happens the military
is just tended to blame it on low
ranking soldiers it's what the military
calls different Spanx for different
ranks what about leadership failures in
Iraq why have we not had a single
general relieved in Iraq we've been
fighting this war almost as long as the
US military fought World War two get
four years into it every single general
seems to have done just fine that's such
a contrast to say Lincoln in World War
two buzzing mr. Lincoln in the Civil War
buzzing through generals until he found
grant or Marshall at the outset of World
War two relieving dozens of senior
officers in the military has masters
help with tough questions so I hope that
Congress would begin doing it and I
think that actually would begin the
process of informing American people
about what we're doing there and how
we're doing
oh you wonder and maybe the the Joe
Lieberman setback in the Democratic
primary could be taken as a cue we're
talking about Iraq with two men very
different perspectives Noam Chomsky from
MIT Thomas Rick's from the Pentagon desk
at the Washington Post this is open
source from Public Radio International
we'll be back
I'm Christopher Lydon this is open
source with Noam Chomsky and Tom Rix
two very different kinds of critics of
the war in Iraq and the American policy
in the Middle East the last five years
and yet there's a lot of conversions
here Noam Chomsky you remember the
Pottery Barn rule you break it you own
it and that means maybe in terms of
sadness or moral responsibility or
financial responsibility or to stay or
to go
what's your application of the Pottery
Barn rule here first of all first point
is that nobody believes in it so for
example when the Russians invaded
Afghanistan we did not say okay you
ruined it now you stay there and you fix
it we said you ruined it now you have
you attacked it and you have all the
rights of any aggressor no rights at all
only responsibilities your
responsibility is to pay massive
reparations and to adhere to the will of
the population period that's the end of
your those are your responsibilities you
have no rights no invading army ever has
Rights applied to us in Iraq if we apply
the same standards to ourselves that we
do to others that's minimal morale you
know that's the minimal moral principle
how would you apply it exactly the way I
did in Afghanistan hey we can like the
Russians in Afghanistan we committed
what they called at Nuremberg the
supreme international crime aggression
which encompasses within it all of the
evil that follows words of the nuremberg
judgment justice jackson the US justice
very eloquently proclaimed that if this
is not a farce we have to apply to
ourselves the same rules fine let's do
it we committed the supreme
international crime I agree with Tom
Rick's that the media in an in a
professional sense did their job I
suspect the Russian media did too they
described the catastrophes they asked
who was responsible etcetera but we
didn't ask this question about
Afghanistan we didn't ask how can you do
it better what went wrong with the
question we asked rightly was you have
no right to do it
all know well professor Chomsky if
that's the case then do you think we
should pull out of Iraq if if the it's
up to them it's not up to you it's not
up to me it's up to the people of Iraq
we know from US polls that I think the
latest poll was on like 85% or so want a
firm timetable for withdrawal in
response to that during them that we
would have a civil war in Iraq that it
would unleash a tidal wave of blood that
probably was sloshed across the region
that's first of all I suspect that the
US presence in Iraq does more of that
and leaving but that's not the point
the point is it's not my judgment the
Russians could have said the same about
Afghanistan in fact they would've been
right when they left it did leave to a
lead to a bloodbath when the u.s.
trained jihadis went berserk but that
was not a reason for them to stay in
their responsibility was to do what the
Afghans want our responsibilities to do
what the Iraqis want their opinion as we
know from US polls is to set a firm
timetable for withdrawal in response to
that Blair and Bush said we will never
set a timetable for withdrawal okay that
tells you we the government's behaving
like the Russians those are the
questions the media should have been
asking while I agree with you about the
reporting you know they're brave serious
honorable reporters there and people ask
questions like where the WMD but they
didn't ask the question do we have a
right to commit the supreme
international crime they did any more
than we treated the war if anyone were
to compare the treatment of the Afghan
war in Pravda with the treatment of this
war in the United States I think would
be very similar and I don't like that I
don't think the happy dumping it was
because I used to live in Afghanistan I
followed that closely and I think what
you saw in the Russian media was
actually surprisingly little coverage of
casualties until well into the war
actually I read translations from Pravda
in those years and in fact there's
somebody now reviewing it they did have
articles talking about the and they were
condemned by the government about the
terrible travail of the soldiers I mean
they're facing these terrorists they're
getting killed and
you know it was worth going in and so on
I mean I read articles like that maybe
not to the extent that you read them
here but they were certainly there but
the point is that the the framework was
the same framework is the framework is
presupposing job that we have a just a
case where we are right and doing what
we do question is are we doing it badly
or will turmeric so I want to ask you to
answer what's that what's the best
answer you've heard to your question
about should we stay should we go
how long in what form well this is
actually a point I think of disagreement
between myself mr. Chomsky what I found
purse ways that were senior strategist I
talked in Iraq earlier this year who
said probably the smartest thing at this
point is to cut the US troop presence by
2/3 have only a force that's steeped in
the principles of counterinsurgency able
to live among the population that values
Iraqi lives more than they value
American lives then you take all the
money we're spending right now in the US
troop presence which is 1.5 billion
dollars a week can you spend it instead
on Iraqi police and army you make them
look like winners rather than chumps you
give them everything they need and more
you protect their families as well and
if that means moving the families
temporarily to Jordan or another country
you do that as well if you take you try
one last chance to get this right
because I think their consequences of
getting it wrong would be huge which
leads to the question I wanted to ask
professor Chomsky which is can we sit
back and say sure we might have set the
conditions that will lead to a civil war
in a regional war but it's not our call
anymore so we should just leave it was
never a call in the first place our call
was as n was and is to follow the will
of the country that we're invade the
population of the country were invading
but by invading we have haven't we taken
our moral responsibility that we didn't
have before we invaded did the Russians
take on more responsibility when invaded
Afghanistan in a sense yes when they
invaded Afghanistan they gave the United
States an opportunity to organize
radical Islamic fanatics from around the
world and to carry out terrorist acts
even in Russia and
you know Hekmatyar and the rest of them
when they left the these people turned
well you know what happened they
destroyed Kabul they went crazy they
were so awful that the population
actually welcomed the Taliban when they
came in did that mean the Russians had
ever had a responsibility to stay no
they're staying would have made it worse
what they should have done is what we
should have done within Afghanistan -
and that is pay massive reparations to
the people we have destroyed let them
try to give them every help we can to
work their problems out for themselves
they can do it way better than we can
and what we will do will be a bull in a
china shop that's what invaders are and
then I have a question for you
inevitably though the Iraqis would work
this out violently I think which is kind
of where they're at now I think they're
almost having the argument you're
discussing which is what do we do after
the Americans leave I think that's kind
of what's going on this year in Iraq oh
yeah I don't it's basically a low-level
civil war I worry that if we left
tomorrow morning it would become a
full-blown Civil War well see I think
all of this discussion about withdrawal
is missing a critical point this war is
not like Vietnam indicate or any of the
other analogy or Afghanistan for the
Russians in the case of Vietnam the
United States could destroy South
Vietnam as it did devastate most of the
rest of Indochina then pull out and gain
most of its War Rooms as it did not hear
you what we were talking about before is
critical for Washington planners leaving
Iraq with any degree of sovereignty and
democracy would be an absolute nightmare
we have to face that we have to face
that they're not going to withdraw
unless they are compelled to by the
American people because withdrawing
would mean facing the likely prospect of
losing control of the world's major
energy resources and perhaps having even
trying to move in how long do you think
US forces u.s. soldiers will be on the
ground I think they'll be there until
the American population forces them out
because
planners whether Democrats or
Republicans are not going to be willing
to give up one of the core principles of
US foreign policy since the Second World
War and British foreign policy before
that namely controlling the world's
energy reserves will have forces there
for 10 to 15 more years I think so too
until client regime instead of I want to
come back to the the question posed by
Sonia Hersh's piece in the new New
Yorker which is what did the the
Pentagon effective managers there what
do they learn from normally the fiasco
in Iraq but now this very sorry
adventure in lebanon richard armitage
you know of the Colin Powell State
Department says the answer is you can't
win this way you couldn't you can't
couldn't imagine building a war on Iran
on that model but the question is does
anybody in the Pentagon you know read
results and make corrections or are we
plunging blindly ahead toward a war with
Iran I don't think we're plunging
blindly ad towards a war with Iran but I
also my pressure with the US military
doesn't see the Israeli experience in
Lebanon is particularly relevant to what
it's up to rightly or wrongly I think
one of the little secrets of the
Pentagon is they don't like the Israelis
very much they kind of have had issues
with them for years and years and so
they do they tend to hold them at arm's
length the US military because of partly
because the US military structure
Central Command is all in the Arab world
but if Israel comes on to the European
Command so the US military tends not to
know Israel very well in to really look
upon it with some disdain but I'm still
wondering about the lesson armitage tell
sy Hersh if the most dominant military
force in the region the Israeli Defense
Forces cannot pacify a country like
Lebanon with a population of 4 million
you should think carefully about taking
that template to Iran with strategic
depth and a population of 70 million
well there's my people I don't know what
fire is up to I don't
here I've not heard a single person say
the US military is contemplating
anything like a ground invasion of Iran
especially with involving a conventional
military force going after a guerrilla
force that's good news
well I'm knowing having no sources at
all
that's exactly my impression I think
they'd have to be insane to invade Iran
with the ground invasion what I would
get if I were a Pentagon strategist what
I would and I wanted to win wars that I
don't think we ought to be in in the
first place let me make that clear if we
were only limiting ourselves to how to
win a war and overthrow the government
of Iran what I would be planning is
something quite different and I suspect
they're doing try to instigate first of
all try to get the regime in Iran to be
as harsh as possible that's the
consequence immediate consequence of
threats against Iran actually I was just
talking to bargain G one of the leading
dissidents is afternoon that's exactly
what he pointed out and all around and
dissidents do the more you threaten Iran
with attack the more power you give to
the authoritarian regime and the most
harshest elements among them and the
more you harm the democratic elements so
that would be a rational goal for a
pentagon planner make the regime as
harsh as possible hoping that it'll stir
up internal resistance meanwhile support
secessionist movements and groups there
are plenty of them Iran's a complex
society so support an asura resistance
movement support and quasi resistance
movement and who sit on the area right
next to the Gulf which happens to be
where the oil is Ameri not not Persian
and if you can get them if you can get
any pretense of a secessionist movement
even if the CIA created it then move in
and in quotes defend it against the
government and that just bomb the rest
of the country then you've got the oil
you bomb anybody at will and you don't
have to invade could I come back to the
Palestinian question because you say
it's the core issue and also because
Brent Scowcroft says this this gathering
disaster all over the Middle East is a
cue to go back to basics they've got the
plan the Saudis are in the Israelis know
what it's about the Americans know what
it's about
no it's it's very very close and yet
Brent Scowcroft piece in your paper Tom
couple Sundays ago has kind of gone the
way of sunday supplements
what is the chance professor Chomsky
what is the urgency who would have to
who would have to be enticed
strong-armed into a redefinition of a
Palestinian solution to countries the
United States and Israel which have
unilaterally blocked the an
international consensus on a two-state
settlement for thirty years with very
few deviations and are now implementing
programs which make it impossible that's
the core of the problem which is lucky
for us because the core of the problems
right here we can change it if we want
to the Arab world years ago except that
a two-state settlement the US had to
veto a resolution at the Security
Council in 1976 to prevent that the Arab
League proposal of 2002 called for
normalization of relations with Israel
if it withdrew to the international
borders Iran has accepted it the
Palestinians have accepted it for
decades Hamas has said that they would
negotiate for it the only barrier is the
United States and Israel which are not
and that's not a rhetorical barrier they
are implementing programs which make the
realization of it impossible I want to
ask you a question I've asked at least
100 people since 9/11 if you picked up
the paper tomorrow the Washington Post
and you saw the Israeli and Palestinian
leadership sealing the deal Jerusalem
right overturn walls everything and and
and you were promised convincingly that
that problem has been resolved for the
rest of your lifetime in your
grandchildren's lifetime what percentage
of the larger conflagration around Islam
and the world do you think would be
pacified first of all let me say that
they came very close to it there was one
moment in the last thirty years when the
US and Israel did
agree to this that was in Taba in
January 2001 a couple of more days they
probably could have made it the
high-level negotiator said Israel called
off the negotiations then went on with
and of course people this theory about
who blew it but there's no disagreement
Barack called off the negotiations four
days early
the prayer there was a press conference
of both groups Israeli man
yeah Israel the previous prime minister
the Bark's yeah and so that's not
controversial then there's still
programs of the Geneva Accord which is
informal but high-level it's pretty
similar could be implemented if the US
and Israel would agree how much would
that deal with well you know you can't
give a percentage but undoubtedly anyone
in those the Arab world knows this this
is one of the main elements that
stirring up popular opinion in the Arab
world radicalizing it
what Rami Khouri wrote is correct I mean
the inability or unwillingness of the
Arab states to do anything about this
which is a major issue there is one of
the reasons for the growth and
popularity of the paramilitary and other
forces so that would it would undercut
it's a little like the British in
Northern Ireland as long as the British
IRA terror was pretty awful when the
British responded with violence it got
worse was a gift to the IRA hardliners
as soon as the British started paying
some attention to the grievances and
they were real didn't justify the
terrorism but they were real as soon as
they paid some attention to them it
started to improve I mean I was in West
Belfast about 10 years it goes like a
war zone
you go there now it's like Boston but
you could make a pretty compelling case
to get busy on that agenda seems to me
yeah in fact a large majority of the
population in the United States favors
it these are a late decisions it's
bipartisan that's a leap decisions they
have all kind of reasons we could go
into it but that's the barrier no would
that solve all the problems by any means
no the problem with Iran for example is
a different one that could be settled or
at least approach a settlement by
accepting the Iranian offers to
negotiate all the issues which have been
on a table for years was just repeated
by Ayatollah Khamenei a couple
couple weeks ago yeah you could explore
maybe they don't mean what their son I
hate to be the bad guy but it's such a
wonderfully interesting conversation
