welcome to the first episode of Loki
interviews and today we are joined by
somebody who is really good enlighten us
he rose to prominence in the 70s as a
very well-known campaigner against the
Vietnam War and was so troublesome
that he was placed upon Richard Nixon's
enemies list he has published over a
hundred books and I am talking about
none other than the man the myth the
legend
Noam Chomsky thanks for joining us now
you have said before that if you could
you would vote for Jeremy Corbyn but if
you were to believe the mainstream media
in this country he has a problem with
anti-semitism how do you read that well
I've looked at those charges I don't
think they have any credibility
undoubtedly there's a degree of
anti-semitism of the Labour Party pretty
much like the rest of the population
nothing beyond that the charges if you
look at them closely or mostly related
to criticisms of Israeli policy at the
Labor Party on under the previous
leadership has been strongly supportive
of Israel overwhelmingly and Corbin is
not it takes a position which is
critical of Israeli crimes of Israeli
human rights violations other members of
the Labour Party do as well and this
this is being used as a basis for the
fam'ly Tory charges in my view you can
find things undoubtedly you look
anywhere yeah you're gonna find bits and
pieces of anti-semitism racism misogyny
of whatever may be but I don't think
there's any serious basis for this
well with the statement which was
recently secretly recorded of Mike
Pompeo saying that the United States
would take steps to prevent a Jeremy
Corbyn government knowing that the u.s.
interfered in Australian democracy to
remove Gough Whitlam from power in the
70s is it not likely that the United
States would interfere in British
democracy to prevent the Jeremy Corbyn
government the United States is powerful
but not all-powerful Europe chose
policies of extreme policies of
neoliberal austerity it also the
European Union was designed in ways
which undermine popular democracy they
major decisions in Europe are not taken
by Italians for Italy by French for
France they're taken by the bureaucracy
in Brussels unelected bureaucracy the
troika European Commission unelected IMF
obviously unelected European Central
Bank they make the basic decisions of
the policies they followed the austerity
policies that were very destructive for
much of the population the United States
didn't carry out great policies but
better than that and the result of that
is an enormous amount of anger
bitterness resentment often takes
pathological forms it's these people
open to demagogues will try to exploit
scapegoats you know immigrants whatever
it may be so yes it's a very bad trade
very bad situation situation the it's
but these were decisions made in Europe
United States is in the background but
can't blame the United States for that
same thing in Australia a lot to say
these are they
powerful regions they'd make the wrong
decision not out of the context of world
affairs but with plenty of freedom and
this neoliberal wave that spread over
the world basically since Reagan
Thatcher had had very harsh consequences
for a considerable majority population
in the United States for example the
real wages today are about what they
were in the 1960s 1979 before the
neoliberal programs began the programs
have sharply concentrated wealth led to
undermining of benefits stagnation for
much of the population a economy that's
increasingly precarious for individuals
of course the concentration the high
concentration of wealth itself almost
automatically leads to erosion of
functioning democracy but means that we
described them are pretty obvious so yes
you have a pretty ugly difficult
situation much of the world in your book
optimism over despair you say there is
unlikely civilization can survive really
existing capitalism can you explain that
statement to us please really existing
capitalism is what we concede described
in the press
day after day so for example euphoric
articles in the New York Times Financial
Times and elsewhere about how the United
States has leaked past Saudi Arabia in
oil production is now first in the world
it's opening new new oil fields for
exploitation
offshore oil that now can go back to the
time when it was dominating world oil
production we read that the major banks
like JPMorgan Chase are increasing their
investment in fossil fuels including the
most dangerous like Canadian tar sands
and all of this is a quite
understandable on the assumption that
are that the structure of our
institutions is geared to maximizing a
short-term profit and power without
regard to wood what might happen the
world in another 20 or 30 years that's
both capitalist but we can't survive
that there are ways in which existing
institutions could be modified so that
they will deal with the literally
existential crises that are coming
before us and it's conceivable that they
might that even they're self-destructive
business model might offer way out but
simply because the costs of renewable
solar and basically are declining fast
enough so that it might become more
profitable to try to save the world and
to try to destroy it but that's a pretty
weak read to rely on now know before you
have said that we as a species are in
the midst of a sixth extinction or an
answer machine can you explain to us
what those times mean you're the six of
snakes that's not particularly debatable
the sixth extinction refers to the rate
of species destruction
under way over geological time there
have been a number of periods when there
was massive extinction of species the
last one was the fifth extinction about
65 million years ago assumed not certain
but likely that it was caused by a huge
asteroid hitting the earth which led to
of the destruction of most of the
species at most an existing stages
particular it ended the age of the
dinosaurs they were wiped out and it
left an opening for small certain small
mammals which did survive and ultimately
proliferate that ultimately became
common both the homo sapiens who are now
engaging initiating in fact carrying out
the takes attention that's what we're
doing for the asteroid and in fact the
rate of species Direction is shocking
across the board in many ways the most
dangerous the radical destruction of the
insect population it's been declining
grimly sharp places were monitored first
Germany a few others that's probably
worldwide if they substantially
disappear along with them goads
fertilization of crops but the basis for
much of the rest of life and this is not
a just exotic species were which are
disappearing of course that's happening
but there's a very serious threat of
natural something of the character of
the dislocation and it's happening quite
fast faster than the earlier period
so that's underway that's one of the
consequences of not only global warming
but also habitat destruction other
impacts on the end but human impacts on
the environment no you are quoted as
saying that the CEOs responsible for
dragging us to the sixth extinction love
profits more than they love their
grandchildren what do you mean by that
they not to be concerned about the
future of their grandchildren well you
have to we'll put yourself in the
position of say Jamie Dimon the CEO of
the biggest bank JP Morgan Chase as CEO
he has actually two choices one choice
is to do exactly what he's doing
invest direct investments to the most
profitable outcome if it happens to be
the most dangerous fossil fuels do that
of the other alternative he has is to
resign and be replaced by somebody else
will do the same thing but this is an
institutional problem not an individual
one you can ask yourself what might go
on in the mind of someone who knows
exactly what he's doing as of course all
the people in high places do including
President Trump the leader Direction
who's a firm believer in global warming
so you can and we know that so you can
ask what goes on in their minds but at
least in the business world the choices
are very restricted and that is a
problem about the nature of institutions
but different faces in there they'll
face the same problems no when we
consider that annual global subsidies to
fossil fuel companies are five trillion
dollars per year and that the US
government according to IMF papers
subsidizes the fossil fuel industry to
the tune of 700 billion dollars per year
how is it that the mainstream media have
expended far more resource to
investigating seemingly tenuous links
between Donald Trump and Russia rather
than interrogating this relationship
between the levers of political power
and the forces of the SiC extinction
well that was pretty much nonsense and
at the outset I'm in the most that
anyone was ever gonna discover might be
here that he had a plan to build a Trump
Hotel in Red Square or something like
that maybe marginal corruption but
nothing very serious I don't say that in
retrospect I've been staying at for
years it's clear that there was nothing
that was going to come out of the Russia
gate so-called Russia Gate inquiry the
Millar inquiry any idea that the
Russians tried to influence the u.s.
elections is laughable maybe they tried
who knows but any possible impact was
completely undetectable and in fact take
a look at the 2016 election it wasn't
just Donald Trump it was elected
Republicans swept the Senate and the
house was that Russian collusion baikal
in fact we know very well I'm work by
serious political scientists primarily
Thomas Ferguson but it was a huge influx
of money mostly dark money for Trump
right at the last couple of weeks of the
election when the Republican
establishment earned that even though
they didn't like Trump basically their
party might my
then why are we doing why is this
massive campaign going out about
marginalia ignoring the major issues
well it's a sign of the ineptitude and a
wait almost irrelevant of the political
opposition that they don't disagree all
that much with Trump on the main
policies so they're desperately seeking
some way to get rid of them so they can
take power again and do things that are
not very different maybe little less
outrageous them there was a much better
style but not fundamentally different
and in the case of the Democrats is also
a hard a measure but undoubtedly a
measure of simply an effort for revenge
they've run it they ran a really run
campaign and managed to lose an election
that should have been in their pocket to
conman which I'm sure grates very
seriously so they're trying to bring it
down but what they did was what they're
doing is just giving him a huge gift and
may have even helped him become a I'll
be elected in the next election but they
should have been doing all along is
exactly what you just said focusing on
the policy but not just the case of
extreme significance like local warming
but also other policies I mean after
there's one legislative achievement of
the Trump administration tax scam which
poured gifts into the pockets of the
super-rich and the corporate strip and
had the at the expense of everyone else
also had the side benefit point of view
of the Republican establishment of
creating a huge deficit which can now be
used as a pretext to cut away at social
benefits welfare or at health
education anything that might be a
benefit to the unworthy majority those
are the kinds of issues that there are
many others I could list that are
serious opposition would have been
focusing on but not the remote
possibility that somehow Trump is on
Putin's payroll so we've established
it's unlikely that Russia interfered in
u.s. elections in any meaningful way but
does any other state have the power to
interfere in u.s. democracy well there
is one state that openly and proudly
tries to interfere in u.s. elections
even sending the Prime Minister to speak
to a joint session of Congress without
informing the White House to try to
undermine a major program of the White
House I'm speaking of Benjamin
Netanyahu's appearance too from Israel
in order to try to block Obama's a deal
with Iran that's radical interference
but all of that is really pretty
marginal there is massive interference
in u.s. elections massive comes from the
corporate sector it's been demonstrated
very effectively again Ferguson's work
that elections in the United States are
pretty much bought in the sense that you
can predict the outcome of an election
with a very high precision simply by
looking at the single variable of
campaign spending and that's of course
only one what that means is only did
those candidates get into office but
that as soon as they get into office a
representative has to spend many hours a
day trying to get the donors to fund the
donor class to fund his next election
that means well well the representative
he or she is doing that lobbyists hordes
of lobbyists are pouring into
congressional offices to meet with the
staffs and craft the legislation at
which the register the legislature will
sooner or later sign and we see the
consequences of this the again there's
excellent careful of political science
research Martin gilens Bartel and benjin
page and others which shows very
convincingly that consider majority the
population of voters are literally
unrepresented and that there is no
correlation between their own
preferences and the voting record of
their own representatives who are
listening to other voices and they
believe the voices of the donor class is
that interference and elections I mean
in comparison with that that anything
else you convention is like a piece of
straw and not a mountain you know so yes
there's massive interference of
elections some from other states like
Israel and nothing else of any
significance on top of that the United
States has no reluctance at all in
substantially enter it not only
interfering in elections of other
countries but simply overthrowing the
government so we don't like them that's
a sixth irias interference and that
happens all the time and often through
the record so we could say one of the
bipartisan
orthodoxies in the US political system
is regime change what's happening today
in Venezuela no well the most important
case actually I'll get the Venezuelan a
moment is Brazil now that's the most
important country of Latin America in
fact in many ways of the global South
and just think back to what happened
Lula da Silva was elected
2003 2016 the World Bank published a
detailed study of his time and office at
which they called the golden decade in
which there was enormous progress in
Brazil in reduction of poverty in
enhancing inclusiveness including
educational opportunities for
marginalized people the World Bank was
full of praise for that and felt that it
could have continued with the right
policies but there was a counter
reaction after Lula left office soft
coup began the successor of Dilma
Rousseff was impeached on utterly
derisory grounds by a gang of thieves in
the parliament shocking then came last
fall there was going to be an elected as
an election last fall last October Oh
Lula was poised to win the election and
the public opinion polls he was will in
the lead they put him in jail he's in
prison 25-year sentence solitary
confinement not allowed to read those
papers and limited visiting hours I did
manage to visit him with my wife but
very limited and crucially not permit
make a public statement
unlike murderers on death row okay you
have to silence that voice and it was
silenced
then came something which is probably a
precursor of what we're going to see in
2020 and elsewhere a huge campaign of
vilification lies demonization and
mainly over the social media which are
the source of information for most of
the population of shocking display and
they managed to put in an in power the
worst of the far-right gangsters
were plaguing the the world right now
Lula's in my opinion the most important
political prisoner in the world he sandy
discussion our mention of it no this was
a success of a right-wing coup to beat
back the progress that was made he also
became the most probably the most
respected statesmen in the world I'm a
strong voice for the global south
now can't be tolerated I know of Olson
ro was turning and his cohorts obligate
is the economics Minister ultra-right
Chicago product whose slogan as he says
it's privatize everything so off the
concrete as foreign investors destroy
the educational system cut back research
impose religious extremist and turn
Brazil into a well-behaved continent the
United States so that's a big success
now go to Venezuelan well a lot to say
about it but during the Chavez years it
was somewhat similar it doesn't matter
much what my opinion was or your opinion
but the opinion of Venezuelans doesn't
matter
and that was monitored regularly by
Latino barometer oh the main polling
agency in Latin America based in Chile
in perspective it hurts integrity it
found that Venezuela was ranked right
next to Uruguay and the lead in Latin
America for the port for the government
support for a democracy
well Chavez died there were a lot of I
should say both in the case of Brazil
and Venezuela this plenty to criticize
and the behavior of the parties but
that's not the reason for the akuze that
are taking place people who were
carrying the boundaries worse than they
are
anyways the United States has no
reluctance at all in substantially enter
not only interfering in elections
another country
but simply overthrowing the government
so we don't like them that's a serious
interference and it happens all the time
I don't run through the record Noam
Chomsky thank you for joining us
