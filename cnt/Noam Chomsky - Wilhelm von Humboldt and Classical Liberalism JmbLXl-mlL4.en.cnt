classical liberalism asserts as its
major idea an opposition to all that the
most restrictive minimal forms of state
dimension and personal or social life
well this conclusion is quite familiar
however the reasoning that leads to it
is less familiar and I think a good deal
more important than the conclusion
itself one of the earliest and most
brilliant expositions of this position
is in ville Homefront humboldt limits of
state action which was written in 1792
though not published for 6070 years
after that in his view the state tends
to quote tends to make an instrument to
make man an instrument to serve its
arbitrary ends overlooking his
individual purposes and since man is in
his essence of free searching self
perfecting being it follows that the
state as a profoundly at a human
institution that is its actions its
existence are altima CLE incompatible
with the full harmonious development of
human potential in its richest diversity
hence incompatible with what Humboldt
and in the following century Marx
bakunin Mill and many others what they
see as the true end of man and for the
record I think that this is an accurate
description the modern conservative
tends to regard himself as the lineal
descendant of the classical liberal in
this sense but I think that that can be
maintained like an extremely superficial
point of view as one can see by studying
more carefully the fundamental ideas of
classical libertarian thought as
expressed in my opinion and its most
profound form
bye-bye-bye Humboldt I think the issues
are of really quite considerable
contemporary significance and if you
don't mind they what may appear to be a
somewhat antiquarian excursion I'd like
to expand on them for Humboldt as for
Rousseau and before him the Cartesians
man's essential attribute as is freedom
quote to inquire and to create these are
the centers around which all human
pursuits more or less directly revolve
but he goes on to say all moral culture
Springs solely and immediately from the
inner life of the soul and can never be
produced by
external and artificial control houses
the cultivation of the understanding as
of any of man's other faculties is
nearly achieved by his own activity his
own ingenuity or his own methods of
using the discoveries of others well
from these assumptions quite obviously
an educational theory follows and he
develops it but I won't pursue it but
also far more fellows humboldt goes on
to develop at least the rudiments of a
theory of exploitation and of alienated
labor that suggests in significant ways
i think the early marks so I mean combo
compact continues these comments that I
made Leah that I quoted about the
cultivation of understanding through
spontaneous action in the following way
he says man never regards what he
possesses as so much his own as what he
does and the labourer who pens a garden
is perhaps in a truer sense its owner
than the lit than the listless
voluptuary who enjoys its fruits and
since truly human action is that which
flows from inner impulse it seems as if
all peasants and craftsmen might be
elevated into artists that is men who
love their labor for its own sake
improve it by their own plastic genius
and inventive skill and thereby
cultivate their intellect and ovale
their character and exhaustion refine
their pleasures and so humanity would be
a noble by the very things which now
though beautiful in themselves so often
tend to degrade it freedom is
undoubtedly the indispensable condition
without which even the pursuits most
congenial to individual human nature can
never succeed in producing such salutary
influences whatever does not spring from
a man's free choice or is only the
result of instruction and guidance does
not enter into his very being but
remains alien to his true nature he does
not perform it with truly human energies
but merely with mechanical exactness and
if a man acts in a mechanical way
reacting to external demands or
instruction rather than in ways
determined by his own interests and
energies and power he says we may admire
what he does but we despise what he is
for Humboldt and man is born to inquire
and create and when a man or a child
chooses to inquire or create out of his
own free choice then he becomes in his
own terms an artist rather than a tool
of
duction or a well-trained parrot this is
the essence of his concept of human
nature and I think it's very revealing
and interesting to compare it with Marx
with his early with the early Marx
manuscripts in particular his account of
quote the alienation of Labor when work
is external for the worker not part of
his nature so that he does not fulfill
himself in his work but denies himself
and is physically exhausted and mentally
the based this alienated labor that
tasks some of the workers back into a
barbarous kind of work and turns others
into machines thus depriving man of his
species character of free conscious
activity and productive life recall also
Marx's well-known and often quoted
reference to a higher form of society in
which labour has become not only a means
of life but also the highest wanted life
and recall also his repeated criticism
of the specialized labor which a quote
again mutilates the worker into a
fragment of a human being
degrades him to become a mirror of
pertinence of the machine makes his work
such a torment that it's essential
meaning is destroyed estranges from him
the intellectual potentialities of the
labour process in very proportion to the
extent to which science is incorporated
into it as an independent power robert
tucker for one has rightly emphasized
that Marx sees the revolutionary more as
a frustrated producer than as a
dissatisfied consumer and this far more
radical critique of capitalist relations
of production flows directly often in
the same words from the libertarian
thought of the Enlightenment for this
reason I think one must say that
classical liberal ideas in their essence
though not in the way they developed are
profoundly anti-capitalist
the essence of these ideas must be
destroyed for them to serve as an
ideology of modern industrial capitalism
writing in the 1780s and early 1790s
Humboldt had no conception of the forms
that industrial capitalism would take
consequently in this classic of
classical liberalism he stresses the
problem of limiting state power and he's
not overly concerned with the dangers of
private power
the reason is that he believes in and
speaks of essentially quality of
condition of private citizens and of
course he has no idea
writing in 1790 of the ideas of the ways
in which the notion private person would
come to be reinterpreted in the era of
corporate capitalism he did not proceed
and I'll quote the anarchist historian
Rudolf rocker he did not foresee that
democracy with its model quality of all
citizens before the law and liberalism
with its right of man over his own
person both would be wrecked on the
realities of capitalist economy
whom both did not foresee that in a
predatory capitalist economy state
intervention would be an absolute
necessity to preserve human existence to
prevent the destruction of the physical
environment
I speak optimistically of course as Karl
Polanyi for one has pointed out the
self-adjusting market could not exist
for any length of time without
annihilating the human and natural
substance of society it would have
physically destroyed man and transformed
his surroundings into a wilderness I
think that's correct
humble also did not foresee the
consequences of the commodity character
of labour the doctrine again in Kalani's
words that it is not for the commodity
to decide where it should be offered for
sale to what purpose it should be used
at what price it should be allowed to
change hands in what manner it should be
consumed or destroyed but the commodity
in this case of course a human life and
social protection was there for a
minimal necessity to constrain the
irrational and destructive workings of
the classical free-market nor did
Humboldt understand the 19-7 in 1790
that capitalist economic relations
perpetuate the form of bondage which
long before that in fact as early as
1767
see Marvin Gaye had the Clinton to be
even worse than slavery writing it is
the impossibility of living by any other
means that compels our farm laborers to
till the soil fruits they will not eat
and our maid seems to construct
buildings in which they will not live it
is one that drags them to those markets
where they await masters who will do
them the kindness of buying it is once
that compels them to go down on their
knees to the rich man
in order to get from him permission to
enrich him what effective gain has the
suppression of slavery brought him he's
free you say that is his misfortune
these men that have said have no master
they have one and the most terrible the
most imperious of masters that is need
is this that reduces to the most cruel
dependence and if there is something
degrading to human nature in the idea of
bondage as every spokesman for the
Enlightenment would insist then it would
follow that a new emancipation must be
awaited what Fourier referred to as the
third and last emancipatory phase of
history the first having made serfs out
of slaves the second wage earners out of
serfs and the third which will transform
the proletariat to free men by
eliminating the commodity character of
labor ending wage slavery and bringing
the commercial industrial and financial
institutions under Democratic control
these are all things that Humboldt in
his classical liberal doctrine did not
express and didn't see but I think he
might have accepted these conclusions he
does for example inter degree that state
intervention in social life is
legitimate if freedom would destroy the
very conditions without which not only
freedom but even existence itself would
be inconceivable which are precisely the
circumstances that arise in an
unconstrained capitalist economy and he
does as in the remarks that I quoted
vigorously condemned the alienation of
Labor event his criticism of bureaucracy
and the autocratic state stands as a
very eloquent for a warning of some of
the most dismal aspects of modern
history and the important point is that
the basis of his critique is applicable
to a far broader range of coercive
institutions than he imagined in
particular to the institutions of
industrial capitalism though he
expresses a classical liberal doctrine
Humboldt is primitive individualist in
the style of for example Russo Joe Russo
of tolls the savage who lives within
himself but Humboldt vision is entirely
different he sums up his remarks as
follows he says the whole tenor of the
ideas and arguments unfolded in this
essay might terribly reduce to this that
while they would break all fetters in
human society they would attempt to find
as many new social bonds as possible the
isolated man is no more able to develop
than the one who is fettered and he in
fact looked forward to a community of
free association without coercion by the
state or other authoritarian
institutions in which freemen and create
and inquire achieved the highest
development of their powers back far
ahead of his time he presents an
anarchist vision that is appropriate
perhaps to the next stage of industrial
society we can perhaps look forward to a
day when these various strands will be
brought together within the framework of
libertarian socialism a social form that
barely exists today though its elements
can perhaps be perceived for example in
the guaranty of individual rights that
has achieved so far its fullest
realization though still tragically
flawed in the Western democracies or in
the Israeli Cuba scene or in the
experiments with workers councils in
Yugoslavia or an effort to awaken
popular consciousness and to create a
new involvement in the social process
which is a fundamental element in the
third world revolutions coexisting
uneasily with indefensible authoritarian
practice the first concept of the state
that I want to set up as a point of
reference classical liberal its doctrine
is that the state functions should be
drastically limited but this familiar
characterization is a very superficial
one more deeply the classical liberal
view develops from a certain concept of
human nature one that presses the
importance of diversity and free
creation and therefore this view is in
fundamental opposition to industrial
capitalism its wage slavery its educated
labor and its hierarchical authoritarian
principles of social and economic
organization at least in its multi
inform classical liberal thought is
opposed as well to the concepts of
possessive individualism which are
intrinsic to capitalist theology so it
seeks to eliminate social fetters but to
replace them by social bonds not by
competitive greed not by predatory
individualism not of course by corporate
Empire state or private classical
libertarian thought seems to me
therefore to lead directly to the
Terry and socialism or anarchism if you
like when combined with an understanding
of industrial capitalism
