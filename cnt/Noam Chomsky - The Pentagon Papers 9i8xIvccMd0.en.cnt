noam chomsky joins us now from Boston
it's good to have you back again Noam
why don't we start there before we talk
about WikiLeaks what was your
involvement with the Pentagon Papers I
don't think most people know about this
dan and I were friends at Coney versa
also who also prepared them and helped
leak them and I got advanced copies from
Dan and honey and there were several
people who were releasing them to the
press I was one of them and then I along
with Howard goes in as you mentioned
edited a volume of essays and an index
of the papers so explain though how it
worked and I always think this is
important to tell the story especially
for young people Dan Ellsberg Pentagon
official top secret clearance gets this
u.s. involvement in Vietnam history out
of his safe he Xeroxes it and then how
did you get your hands on it he just
directly gave it to you from Dan and Dan
Ellsberg Antonio Rizzo who had done the
xeroxing and the preparation of material
yes we did you edit
well we didn't modify anything we the
papers were not edited they're just in
their original form what Howard Zinn and
I did was they came out in four volumes
we prepared a fifth volume which is
critical essays by they're by many
scholars on the on the papers what they
mean their significance and so on and an
index which is almost indispensable for
using them seriously so he hits volume
in the decompressed series you were then
one of the first people to see the
Pentagon Papers
outside of Den Ellsberg Tony Russo yes I
mean there were some journalists who may
have seen them I'm not sure so what are
your thoughts today as for example we
just play this clip of New York
Republican Congress member Peter King
who says WikiLeaks should be declared a
foreign terrorist organization
I think that's outlandish the materials
we should understand and the Pentagon
Papers is another case in point that one
of the major reasons for government
secrecy is to protect the government
from its own population in the Pentagon
Papers for example there was there was
one volume the negotiations volume which
might have had bearing on ongoing
activities and Ellsberg withheld that
that came out a little bit later but if
you look at the papers themselves
they're things that Americans should
should have known that the government
didn't want them to know and as far as I
can tell from what I've seen here pretty
much the same is true in fact the paper
the kind leaks are will by seeing at
least primarily interesting because of
what they tell us about how the
diplomatic service works
