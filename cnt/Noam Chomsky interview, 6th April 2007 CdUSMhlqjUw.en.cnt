do you feel the events of septum of the
11th changed the way news was covered in
America if not it had a complicated
effect in the United States which of
course reflects itself someone in the
media but among the general population
just think the most interesting it first
of all inspired fear which was quite
appropriate I mean my own feeling is
slightly to be the first of a series of
terrorist attacks that was enhanced by
the anthrax gear right afterwards the
was on entirely new I mean it was known
long before that there could be such an
attack in fact there was an attempt to
blow up the world trade center in 1993
which came pretty close to success and
there were technical studies on it and
so on but just wasn't part of the
popular consciousness so this clearly
did that fear jingoism you know what
flags and so on on the other hand it had
another effect it open people's minds
the United States is an extremely
insular society people don't pay much
attention to the outside world a lot of
people couldn't tell you where Francis
it's not big country rich country people
are inwardly or added this made a lot of
people think we better learn something
about the world there's some reason for
what are we doing you know what's going
on in the world and that had a very
positive impact it was very visible to
people like me who you know those of us
who spent a lot of time traveling and
speaking and so on I mean invitations
just shot up audiences are much larger
much more engaged much more interested
the small book publishers publish left
publishers which have a pretty small
outreach all of a sudden they had to
start re publishing their books from the
70s and the 80s because there was so
much demand
them and it just opened it opened the
country up a lot to debate and
discussion to some extent that reflected
itself in the media not much but they're
more conformist but they reflect to some
extent changes happening in the country
the anti-war movement always has been my
place or associate in the 60s and the
70s particularly do you feel and has
changed strengthened in since since nine
of them well first of all it had
continued to strengthen since the 1960s
and country to it many people believe
it's much higher now than it was in 60s
in order to have a reasonable comparison
you have to compare the Iraq war to the
Vietnam War now an anti-war movement in
the United States did not develop a
large scale in the United States until
there were close to half a million
troops in South Vietnam South Vietnam
was practically destroyed the word had
extended to the north which was costly
to the United States so therefore was
nothing very carefully meanwhile South
Vietnam is is being devastated without
cost for years there was no any war
movement the Iraq work has never reached
the level of the at which a navy war
movement developed in the 60s at the
time when say there were 150 thousand
American troops in South Vietnam was a
very small anti-war movement in fact
even to give you an illustration of the
worry it was so small that people are
not even aware of when the war began on
the were actually began in 1962 there
was plenty of terror and violence before
but the actual US invasion was in 1962
that's when Kennedy sent the US Air
Force to start bombing South Vietnam
authorized chemical warfare to destroy
props and ground cover has started the
authorized napalm and started driving
people into what were called strategic
Hamlet's basically concentration camps
urban slums ultimately millions of
people and that's an aggression that's
aggression but there was no no reaction
at all and for several years you want to
talk about Vietnam yeah talk to people
in their living rooms no church with
four people I met right right here at em
in the universities Cambridge you if we
wanted to have a few of us who are
interested if we wanted to have a
meeting on Vietnam we'd have to bring it
in half a dozen other topics and as well
at least a bunch of other things with
Vietnam that maybe some people of jilla
the first attempt in Boston which is a
pretty liberal City to have a public
anti-war demonstration like meeting at
the Boston Common essentially hyde park
where the meetings were the public
demonstrations or it was actually in
october 1965 at that point there were I
think about 250 300 thousand US troops
in South Vietnam the bombing of the
north had started we did have a
demonstration or tried to but it was
broken up I supposed to be one of the
speakers from couldn't talk we've broken
up by would have it serious violence if
there hadn't been a lot of State Police
around a lot of of them students the
Boston Globe liberal newspaper the next
day had a front-page stories about it
denouncing the demonstrators and
praising the disruption you know that's
a stage which the Iraq war has not come
close to it and it was year two after
that now finally anti-war movement
started but even when the anti-war
movement developed if you look it was
mostly focused on the bombing of the
north which was which was bad enough but
it was a kind of sideshow I mean the
main attack like about triple the
bombing does it get South Vietnam and
that was
much of a topic of protest because the
protest was focused on cost us in elite
circles the phone was no protest against
the war and at any time the actually an
interesting comparison is somebody like
say Arthur Schlesinger died recently
leading American liberal historian in
the early 1960s even adviser Kennedy is
portable factually look at his book
thousand days of Kennedy administration
is virtually nothing about the Adnan
it's just routine by the late six min
late 60s maybe 1966 he was becoming
disillusioned with the war thought his
position I could quote it was that we
all pray that the Hawks will be right in
thinking that more troops will bring
victory and if they are will be praising
the wisdom and statesmanship of the
American government in turning Vietnam
into a land of reckon ruins are his
words but we'll live one that's very
much like a leak criticism of the Iraq
war today almost the same words but by
nineteen when the invasion of Iraq took
place he was may be unique in taking a
radically different position the day of
the bombing he had an article in major
newspaper in the United States in which
he condemned it as an Alex the Pearl
Harbor said it's a date which will live
in infamy as the United States follows
the policies of Imperial Japan well he
was I was unusual very few people took
that position but the transition in his
stand and the sixties and then this war
i think is illustrative of a much
greater opposition to aggression in the
general population so I don't think
opposition the war is anything like it
ought to be but if you compare it to the
60s its greater actually the Iraq war is
the first war I think in
Western history hundreds of years where
there's been massive protest against an
invasion before it was officially
launched the road of the Internet in
that but I hope just curious you're here
presumably in 1962 you are aware of
what's going on in Vietnam maybe not as
faux pas you would be today with access
to the kind of immediate response what
was your day to day life like being
aware of that we were you angry about it
we were aware of the volume of the acts
and what was going on it's pretty well
aware of it even without an internet and
was spending an awful lot of time on it
but it was it literally was what i
described talk and some neighbors living
room talking at church to a couple of
people you know temps by 1965 you were
able to have teachings to fair number of
people but by 1965 i was organizing
resistance working with a few friends
organizing national tax resistance few
years later involved in organizing draft
resistance in and out of jail constant
demonstrations was taking up a big piece
of life very involved yeah i was i knew
i didn't realize in detail what was
happening but you could find out and it
wasn't impossible to find out in fact
you can even find out from the most
respected sources so Bernard fall for
example who was military story and
become specialists the civilian who was
most respected by the Pentagon for
example in McNamara's memoirs is the one
person mentioned he was telling the
truth about it nobody's paying much
attention but he was describing
accurately what was happening with real
bitterness and anger he was kind of a
hawk like he thought but Saigon
government should really control all of
Vietnam but he he cared about the
country and he saw there was being wiped
out in fact by 1967 when he was killed
in combat he was writing that he said
Vietnam as a cultural and historical
energy that entity may not survive
the most vicious assault that any
country's ever this size has ever
endured from major military power I was
67 whether it's very little elite
protest against the war in fact it never
really was the standard view was pretty
much what I quoted from Schlesinger and
what the view is today among elites we
have to win but cost us too much maybe
we should move through 45 years on now
there is a perception in the UK about
the reporting of the wall in the u.s.
that the Americans are slow to move
towards anti-war perception because of
the way the war is reported and I may
seem at night to you but that's would
you say that's at least and that's what
it is well there are few reporters in
England who are unusual Robert Fisk
Patrick Coburn a couple others they
really report the war there's nobody
comparable to that here on the other
hand reporting is courageous honorable
and I think generally accurate but we
have to remember that the Iraq war is
may be unique in history and that it
can't be covered directly the
catastrophe that the United States had
written have created is so extraordinary
that reporters simply can't hurt not
under if you do let say Patrick over but
not many it's just too dangerous the
reporters are pretty much confined to
either the Green Zone which is like a
fortified fortress in the middle over
the middle of Baghdad a couple of places
where they're under protection or
embedded with troops and it's not lack
of courage it's just just can't do it
it's too dangerous that was not true
Vietnam was it's not true in the Russian
invasion of Afghanistan in fact I can't
think of the case it was true so the
limitation and they rely very much on
Iraqi stringers for whom it's extremely
dangerous and they're they're just
abandoned
murder nobody protects them nothing for
them was so that of course there are
limits in that respect would it be
sample to say that suits the aggressors
I mean they tried to embed make sure
that reporters were embedded in combat
units and there were some refused and
usually the network's media just
wouldn't carry their material but
sometimes the word and my view of the
worst part of the coverage is where it's
accurate so for example the was in
november two thousand four i guess the
attack on Fallujah which was a major war
crime was accurately reported a bit
reported as it was just fine so the
first day of the invasion of Fallujah
the US forces if you look at the front
page of the New York Times now you see a
seat my mind's eye there was a picture
of the hospital in Fallujah with
patients lie on the floor their hands
tied behind the backs of doctors lying
on the floor and an American soldier
guarding them and there was a story
accompanying in the first act of the
American forces when they went into
Fallujah was to take over the General
Hospital and cross the patient's out of
bed on the floor of medical and so on
and they had a reason they said it's a
propaganda center its reporting it's
inflating were casualties you know this
is a grave breach of the Geneva
Conventions I mean even under American
law of President Bush should be executed
for that war crimes act of 1996 makes it
a crime for Qing be sent to death for
grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions
what's that jeevika mints are quite
explicit on protecting hospitals and
medical facilities when I sitting right
in the front page New York Times story
praising it and it went on like that I
mean you know they were talking about
how
the soldiers were disappointed because
they couldn't find the the ants and
their ant hills or whatever the phrase
with you know the rodents and their
Warren's or something a dead girl lying
on the ground but they weren't sure
whether she was an insurgent or not you
know that it was just test it was
accurate reporting and completely great
test that's what that's the worst part
so finally not been writing itself the
actual coverage the meteor it seems to
have a moral responsibility cauterized
to me that's not just so I think so
unfair it occurs as the media that is
the intellectual climate in Britain as
well and Europe as well I mean just take
a current example when a george bush
announced the surge you know the
increase in troops first of all i was in
direct violation of the will of the
American people of course the
overwhelming opposition of Iraqis but
they're irrelevant but it was
predictable that the surge would be
accompanied by propaganda about Iranian
intervention in Iraq sort of to justify
you have to defend ourselves and that
happened so immediately started getting
reports about you know roadside bombs ie
deeds with serial markings from Iran and
so on and then comes a debate debate is
over whether the serial markings are
really from Iran I mean it is
intelligence really telling the truth
that does it go to there is it just the
Revolutionary Guards or is it the higher
echelon so that's the debate in England
too I mean you don't know where the
laugh or cry how can I ran be
intervening in Iraq I was like asking
whether the Allies were intervening in
sovereign France in 1943 even only have
this discussion on the assumption that
the United States owns the world so if
we invade and occupy another country and
somebody say is involved in resistance
of the occupation there are the
aggressors now that's the way a
sophisticated propaganda
system works I mean in a totalitarian
state you declare the party line
officially and everyone has to a bed or
else you know in a free country you
don't do that what you do is presuppose
the party line you never articulated you
just presuppose it then you encourage
vigorous debate as long as it stays
within the bounds of the party line
here's a prototypical example the party
line is we own the world therefore if
anybody interferes with what we're doing
they're the criminals you don't nobody
says that it's just presupposed that's
the assumption on which discussion
proceeds then you have a vigorous debate
you know are the Iranians really doing
it aren't they doing it and so on well
you know that it's not just the media
you can't blame the media for that
that's the intellectual atmosphere it's
the intellectual culture is it just
deeply rooted Imperial culture which
takes things like this for granted yes
of course the media reflected too but
it's a much deeper pathology which of
the two questions is how how did we get
here or how do we get out of it well
first of all we've always been there so
there's nothing about how we got here so
say let's go back to Vietnam again in
the case of Vietnam same questions were
raised are the Russians and the Chinese
intervening so like if the Russians were
providing anti-aircraft batteries to
protect North Vietnam not South Vietnam
that's free game whoever you like to
protect say hanoi from US bombing their
intervening if the Chinese were sending
in construction crews to rebuild the
Chinese railroad that the United States
was bowing in North Vietnam then 50,000
Chinese they're invading North Vietnam
it's the same discussion it's the same
in Central America I mean if
if they take the US terrorist war
against Nicaragua in the 1980s the
question is whether the Russians are
carrying out aggression in this
hemisphere the US as usual tried to get
Nicaragua to rely on Russian arms just
as they did with Guatemala and Cuba
which do is threaten a country with
attack or actually attack it cut off
arms supplies from your allies you tell
them you're not allowed to send arms and
then you hope maybe they'll turn to the
Russians so they have justification for
the attack they tried that with
Nicaragua Nicaragua was smart enough not
to accept arms from same eggs and so on
so there were meek scares constantly
raised like the u.s. desperately wanted
to prevent the 1984 election and it was
kind of wiped out of history because
they knew the wrong people are going to
win free election carefully monitored
the wrong outcomes that didn't happen
one of the ways of eliminating the
election and of course the media went
along was to run a mix gear at the times
we say well you know the US intelligence
found crates and harbor which contain
names and so on then comes a debate as
usual vigorous debate the hawk say we
got a bomb the russians are attacking us
the dove said it could not maybe it's
not true maybe it's the intelligence
isn't good enough but if they are
sending bigs yeah then we have to bomb
them that was the doves but why would
they be getting MiG's well because the
US was controlling Nicaraguan airspace
and was using that to be so the CIA
could send instructions to terrorist
forces to avoid the Nicaraguan army and
attack what were called soft targets
undefended civilian targets that's
legitimate and if Nicaragua tries to
protect its air fate airspace that's
criminal and if the Russians are
involved its aggression and the doves
say well if that's what's really
happening
to bomb the drug it's and you want to go
back further we can go back to the
Declaration of Independence Declaration
of Independence one of the charges
against King George is that he was the
merciless Indian savages to attack us
with their known ways of warfare you
know their barbarism and so on and so
forth you know like all propaganda
there's an element of truth but Thomas
Jefferson knew perfectly well it was the
merciless european english colonists who
were with their known way of warfare
were carrying out of our barrack attacks
but we have to protect ourselves from
the merciless Indian savages and George
and so on through history and the
British history is the same and so is
everyone else's so I don't think there's
any question how we got into it as to
how you get out of it actually we have
to some extent gotten out of it as the
population becomes more civilized as it
sort of does over time that's why
there's more opposition who were now
than in the 60s the media the
intellectual culture shift to some
extent it rarely as far as the
population in fact Vietnam is a striking
case of that in nineteen-sixty-nine when
the business world had turned against
the war and the intellectual world was
turning against the war and the
population was there was a difference in
the intellectual world and the media
about the most critical voice you could
find was someone like say Anthony Lewis
in New York Times who said the war began
with benign intentions benevolent
efforts to good and so on but by 1969 it
had become a disaster or too costly for
us that was criticism at the left of the
intellectual spectrum same year 1969
seventy percent of the american
population I said the war was
fundamentally wrong at mr
not a mistake and those figures stayed
pretty steady or into the into the new
millennium you heard barely find a
sentence like that in journals or media
academic scholarship and so on now
exactly what people meant by that is not
absolutely certain because the people
who take the polls never ask the next
question what do you mean by then they
don't want to hear the answer but it's
possible it meant just what it sounds
like and I think that's not unusual what
was the impact in America as you saw it
at the Vietnamese self Vietnamese monk
self immolating themselves in the 60s it
was visually seen by people it did bring
to people a sense of the intensity of
the struggle it never overcame the basic
propaganda image I mean the basic
propaganda images the United States is
defending the South Vietnamese against
communist terrorists run the north
ultimately by the Russians or the
Chinese or someone that was the
propaganda image that was instilled you
at the most you could maybe say it's a
civil war in south vietnam nobody
practically except wait the extreme
could say what the truth was it was US
invasion of south vietnam an invasion
against which was we now know from
internal documents and province advisory
reports and so on the government knew
perfectly well but they were fighting
indigenous forces with overwhelming
popular support actually that became
dramatically obvious and there was a
huge effort to conceal it at the time of
the Tet Offensive I don't think there's
been anything like that in history the
Tet Offensive the country had over half
a million US troops I think maybe at the
time 50 thousand or more mercenaries
maybe 100,000 mercenaries from other
countries client army huge army
the country was totally saturated with
informers with troops and so on and then
on unexpectedly the whole country arose
in rebellion everywhere it certainly run
knew about it they kept it secret I us
completely taken aback you know the
massive firepower was brought in to try
to suppress it ton of destruction that's
when you get you have to destroy the
village to save it and so on let's took
over the embassy I don't think there's
been any of it I don't know of an event
like that a lil astray shun of the depth
of opposition to foreign invasion it
certainly wasn't true occupied Europe
under the Nazis nothing like that could
have it it's too much support for the
occupation but they sort of knew it from
the beginning the extent was overwhelmed
that it never really reached the public
the fact that Tet Offensive was
described as a defeat for the Communists
for the North Vietnamese after there
were North Vietnamese they were on the
border they're trying to draw US troops
away from the center of the country
toward the border they were fewer
according to pentagon there were fewer
North Vietnamese in south vietnam at the
time and there were South Korean
mercenaries low on US troops but it was
not the picture picture is we're
defending her so we're defending the
South Vietnamese from our theater music
aggression and even the acts like what
you described where regard as described
as kind of aberrations and it shows
their primitive mentality or something
like that I think we see something quite
similar today your people in Congress
talking about the primitive brutality of
the Iraqis who murder each other what
can we do with people like these are
just barbarians you know they have those
same people on set acts like Norman
Morrison's act to the Pentagon in 65
that's difficult that they can't use the
same arguments there
sighs oh jeez they were say strange
pacifist separation you know it's always
strange people around the periphery in
fact they treated the resistors the same
way I'm actually I was closely involved
with the resistance so there the young
people it's presented now as if they
were trying to evade the draft was
related the same way then that's what's
called the Vietnam syndrome the u.s.
didn't want people to be drafted them
but it's totally false and the
resistance was led by theology students
they never be drafted most privileged
young men they wanted to get out of the
draft wasn't very hard your Harvard
student you go to the clinic
psychologist and get him to say you're a
homosexual anything we all kind of ways
of getting it laughs you wanted to but
these were young kids who purposely put
themselves on the line in danger you're
an 18 year old kid it's not fun to face
the idea of five years in prison or
permanent exile that's serious and they
were courageous and honorable well that
can't be accepted that's unacceptable
they had to be cowards trying to evade
the draft there were people who just
tried to vid draft like George Bush and
others but the resistance was not that
way these were courageous young people
who incidentally had a big effect on
their families of parents sometimes
interesting ways but that's not the way
it was presented a coward this is a
draft dodgers you know trying to save
themselves privileged kids trying to
make sure that the poor on the front
lines and so on and same with northern
Mars or else they're anti-american you
know that was like that it's not just
the war it's anything else I mean the
60s were the beginnings the bear
beginnings of the feminist movement
which has probably changed the society
and civilized it more than
any other of the past 40 years had
enormous effects everywhere they were
bra burners crazed women met men haters
and yeah that's the way privileged
powerful groups respond to any challenge
to their authority I think against that
backdrop the guy with talk about we're
doing the program about Malachi Richter
on the third in November he wrapped
himself in an American flag and self
immolated himself on the expressway
Chicago on that particular morning and
it was an act of self-immolation as he
said on his own website in protest of
the Iraq invasion the continued
occupation do you support that act in
anyone my support is courage
incidentally if you did a poll at the
United States maybe one in a million
people ever heard of it you might try it
or even look it up on the internet and
see what the coverage is almost nobody
knows about it and to the extent that
it's known at all it's the act of some
crazy person who I supported I don't
like to see people kill themselves I
think theory work for all Canaries and
moral reasons and even tactical reasons
I think they're better means of
birthdays this is the moment who who had
got to that point where he felt this was
the only statement he could make it's
understandable I also understood in the
nineteen late 1960s way MIT students a
other teenage kids who I knew were
joining the Weathermen I thought they're
making a bad mistake but she could
certainly understand you can understand
the passion and the mo
the integrity that was behind it bad
mistake i think tried to talk him out of
it but understandable it was quite
interesting on that morning and i
completely agree with you about the one
in a million i probably less than that
we've already found talking to people
they say monica home yeah and and for
someone to get their life I mean
obviously that that must be the the
greatest thing you can give in terms of
what you've got to offer personally
initially the helicopters were flying
over doing you know talking about that
you know the traffic coming in and we've
got a problem on for it whatever it is I
mean that was the first reaction and as
they show pictures it became a story and
then you had this sense that they then
realized who this guy walks and this is
a guy who was arrested in 2003 and 2005
for demonstrations in chicago against
the war the story disappeared completely
disappeared is that surprising first of
all if you check the north of the
harrison story of what is name I mean it
is completely standard and I do not
particularly criticize the media
specifically there reflecting the
intellectual culture in fact in the 60s
it was much worse tell you story it's
worse one of the worst I have ever seen
in maybe nineteen sixty seven or so in
chicago the chicago museum of science
which is famous important institution
had a diorama of a vietnamese village
which was set up so that children could
stand around it with guns pointing at it
and could shoot into the village shoot
the villagers and you know destroy the
huts and so on the group mothers
protested was silent protest at a group
of mothers and want their children to be
shooting it
villagers there was a story about the
New York Times condemning the mothers
because they were depriving the kiddies
of a chance to have fun I mean I
remember what I wrote at the time it's
one of the statements I've written which
caused more fury than maybe anything
I've ever said I said you know when you
look at that new york times story you
have to ask whether what the country
needs is descent or denazification I'd
repeat that now I'm very happy to see
the infuriated reaction but what is the
answer to the question when you see
things like that okay I've heard the
nunciature I've never heard the answer
and it's no different elsewhere the I'm
in this and this had to be an extreme
case but I've evaded hospital and
Fallujah what's the reaction actually
just to add something to that the Bush
administration was aware of the danger
before that I'll bet if it can tell us
attorney general was the president's
legal advisor and a memorandum was
leaked from 2002 in which he advised the
president to effectively rescind the
Geneva Conventions because I would
reduce the likelihood of eventual
prosecution and if you look at the
military commissions act one of the most
disgraceful pieces of legislation ever
passed in the United States bipartisan
about a year ago supposed to be a to
reduce torture or something actually if
you look at it one of the things it does
is effectively rescind the War Crimes
Act it says that high officials can't be
charged under the were Crimes Act which
to repeat passed by Republican Congress
which does provide for sentences up to
the death sentence for grave breaches of
the Geneva Conventions yeah one a
dangerous thing not that there is much
on my final question I want to ask you
if you feel optimistic about the
internet and what it may offer the
chance for free speech whatever that is
and communication of an understanding on
a more global level of what actually
imperial powers are doing the internet
is extremely important incidentally it's
an illustration of the way the economy
works like most of the economy the
internet grew out of the state sector
this is these are not market societies
the state sector in the United States is
the core of the dynamism of the economy
the entrepreneurial initiative comes
largely from the state sector research
and development and so on internet is an
examples and was actually developed
right here within the witches Pentagon
University you know it was a in the
state sector for about 30 years before
was handed over to private power but the
like computers and other things but it's
been a liberating in many ways it's it's
it's complex there are many conflicting
aspects to it on the belief it's you
can't chatter eyes it easily for people
who are interested in learning about the
world it provides opportunities that
never existed before so you can read say
Patrick Coburn robert fisk on iraq can't
do it here and this is great you can
read you can pick up all 20 on the
internet you can find sources from all
over a critical material and so on it's
a great technique for organizing in fact
almost all activism now is internet
organized the guy who committed suicide
behaviors outside explaining why it is
right and just you know the major social
movements no all right let's say the
world Social Forum Global justice
movements and so on almost anything
comes through the internet all of that
is very positive on the other hand
that's also
it has negative aspect it draws people
towards at the delusion immersion and
had as the sorts of things and their
extensive efforts did you know to
support that it also has the unfortunate
effect of fortifying cult-like behavior
so for example suppose I were to I
suppose I had a website which I don't
and I put up on it say I read that you
know some sorts that I give that George
Bush poisoned the water in Omaha you
know tomorrow somebody else would put
something and say yeah it's not just oh
my did the same thing in South Dakota
you know within a couple of days you
would have a cult saying George Bush is
poisoning all the water in the world and
then it would become a real cult you
know like religious immune cocoon-like
immune to evidence full of arcane
demonstrations that yes in fact happened
look at that coincidence in that one I
explained that and so on and pretty soon
