did I understand you correctly to be
saying that you thought that human
language is is an exceptional capacity
different and distinct from the
communicational behaviors of all other
living organisms well I think the the
crucial aspects of language do seem to
be really species specific and also
uniform across the species and those are
pretty puzzling facts for one thing it
seems that all of this only developed
very recently in evolutionary time has
put some numbers and the things I was
talking about it's a reasonable guess
that Homo sapiens appears roughly on the
order of 200 maybe 250 thousand years
ago that's extremely recently and it's
there's very strong evidence that Rini
hybrids is out there has done an
important paper on this to show that
within about maybe 50,000 years a
language had already been established in
a manner which hasn't changed since that
is as far as we know the groups that
began to separate them have the same
language have the same internal language
capacity that we do as however stresses
they have somewhat different modes of
externalization which is an interesting
fact but basically the same language so
something happened apparently very
recently very suddenly has no continuity
with animal systems every animal system
we know is basically a system of
communication so the waggle dance of the
B for example is a way in which the B
tells other bees in the hive what
direction to go and what hike to go and
what color to look for to get a flower
that's just not human language it's not
a communication system every other every
animal system
we know is either finite or continuous
in whatever since the physical system
can be continuous you can raise
questions about that but the waggle
dance of the B essentially is is a
continuous system between any two flaps
there's another possible flow without
lemon the human or the the calls of
monkeys are finally they can have ten
calls the human languages discrete
infinity it's very hard to find another
system like that in nature down to
really basic physics critters don't have
it in the organic but couldn't that be
attributed to just a question to go and
all these two do you believe that I
don't have any language Homo habilis you
know yes and no more erectus when you
say that well they may had some kind of
photo language so that evolved into the
way you say it looks as if these
auntie's ancestors of man did not have
any language according to what you say
is this really what you think it's
really not well defined because the word
the word language the word language is a
word of ordinary language it's kind of
like energy or mass or something like
that as soon as you these words are just
not usable in science you have to give
special technical senses of them so the
term to ask whether I mean you could ask
did the bees have a language do they
have right to they just
three hundred thousand years ago the
ancestor of man we are not speaking
anything which I don't believe I think
we have to be a little more precise than
just saying do they have a language I
mean like bees have a mode of
communication
homuth homuth Apes Apes have a mode of
communication Neanderthal undoubtedly
had modes of communication human
language is not a mode of communication
there's a sharp very a qualitative break
these monkeys anything with all the
organisms we know of have some means of
communication
they're always either discrete or
continuous finite or two continuous
human language crucially is neither it's
not a motive it's only secondarily used
for communication its intrinsic design
is a mode of internal articulation of
thought
there's nothing known like that in the
animal world
it's discrete and because I never said
that
like twisters speaking like a bee you
know it's a there is a big difference
between the B and a close ancestor of of
man and it would be very interesting for
the origin of language which is one of
the themes of the discussion do you have
at least some insight about what kind of
I would if you don't want to use
language whatever you like but where
they were communicating with each other
and it is known that in America there is
already the production of artifacts
which were design and erectus as well
and
very good evidence that they were
communicating with each other
why did you could you imagine a more
primitive language than the one we are
using in Homo sapiens this is the notion
primitive language or proto-language if
you either means nothing when you're
talking about human language there's
nothing there's no transition from a
finite system to an infinite system you
can't get there step by step it's a
one-time transition similarly there's a
one-time transition from systems of
communications of systems of
communication to that we have gestural
systems system the face these are all
presumably continuous with earlier proto
humans and apes and so on but there's a
sharp qualitative break from any kind of
communication system to a system of
expression of thought and now if you go
to the artifacts what we find is that
there's really no indication of complex
artifacts that indicate a kind of
creativity until sometime after the
appearance of Homo sapiens may be around
80 90 100 90 thousand years ago a
Neanderthal had extremely intricate
tools very but they had a very striking
feature everywhere and then orthos were
all over the world everywhere they were
the tools are identical they're very
complex in fact it takes technology to
duplicate them now but they didn't
change they were fixed they worked a
certain way every couple hundred
thousand years you start getting a new
way of flaking things
that stuck and so on soon as humans come
along soon means in evolutionary time
you know like tens of thousands of years
as soon as humans come along all of a
sudden you have this huge outburst of
creativity I mean the first known tools
or artifacts of any indicating any sense
of creative use or maybe around 80
thousand years ago by fifty thousand
years ago
you have cave art which is absolutely
modern I mean when Picasso got into the
Lascaux caves he said we haven't learned
anything in 40,000 years caves in Spain
that's the recent discoveries but take a
look at those what they are is a line
going this way or the impression of a
hand the difference between that and the
Lascaux caves is just overwhelming and
this is a very short period of time
notice when you talk about tens of
thousands of years in evolution
it means instantaneous that these things
are just happening at once so it
essentially happened apparently at at
once in this sense meaning very fast
there is a physical phenomenon which
took place then there is no mystery
there something happen so that the
capacity for what you mentioned develop
suddenly but the idea that you have a
simple doubling of the number of neurons
taking place there and having the global
neuronal work space increase in size you
know this is an issue which is extremely
important
because when you look at the monkey it
is not able to to link to a presentation
together to make a link between to a
presentation contrasting when you look
at a human is starting to make two or
three of our five until eight so it
means that the space the control space
in which you are building these
sequences of elements which could be
word is increasing and you may have from
the quantitative change of the global
neural network space a qualitative
aspect which is corresponding to what
you mentioned some of this we can just
prove some things we can prove that you
can't go from finite to infinite in
stages that's just a contradiction in
terms from finite the infinite means
once once you go beyond the list a small
list three to five to seven eight twenty
nine you go from one to three to
infinity kind of a joke the only numbers
are 1 2 3 and infinity the others are
just too big too complicated to exist
and what it means is there is no
transition from small numbers to
unbounded that has to be done in a
single step one day but why you say that
before almost happiness appeared you
know these physicians may have taken
let's say 500,000 years ago but I agree
with you that we cannot reconstitute
eastery at that time all humans have the
capacity of arithmetic infinite in fact
Darwin and Wallace were aware of this
they didn't have all the evidence at the
time now we have the evidence but I mean
if you take a a tribe in Australia or
Papua New Guinea that you know has had
no human contact forever as soon as they
may not have numerals that go beyond 1 2
3 & 4 but as soon as they're introduced
into a situation in which they have to
calculate say a market situation turns
out they've all got it inside that they
may use this for 5 and this pretend
something else for it but yeah and in
fact we don't even have to prove that
because it's got to be true there is no
way for a child to know that the numbers
go on forever just from experience
either you know it or you don't know it
it's a one-time thing
and the same is true of what's called
proto-language or primitive language
just means nothing there's a lot of work
on it it doesn't mean anything it's just
mathematically impossible so that we can
put aside and the same is true about the
distinction between a system of
communication and a system for
expression of thought there are no
intermediate stages it's one or the
other now with regard to artifacts it's
less clear than that you can't really
prove it but if you look at the record
there's a long period you know
years in which protohumans are making
various things a couple of times during
this period you get a change from one
style to another style when you get to
the end earth all or closest to us you
do get extremely complex tools but fixed
they're uniform
all of a sudden humans come along in no
time you have the Lascaux caves you have
the other caves the cave art you have
complex symbolic systems you have the
intricate social arrangements there's a
huge explosion and the only only really
plausible explanation for that is that
the things that we know were radical
changes qualitative they had to be are
correlated with this explosion of
creative activity and complex social
organization so this could get back to
your question as if whoever it was that
there just was a sudden qualitative
change which made humans very different
from with any other organism that's why
we're having conferences like this Kafka
aside apes are
