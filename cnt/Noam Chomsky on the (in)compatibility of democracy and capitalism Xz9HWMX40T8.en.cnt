well we have to decide first what we
mean by capitalism and what we mean by
democracy if we mean by democracy that
citizens have a equal share in
participating in determining decisions
that affect the society then capitalism
in any form is inconsistent with
democracy because it radically in most
forms I should say there is a form of
capitalism which could be consistent
with democracy it's the kind that Adam
Smith advocated at Smith was in favor of
equality equality of outcome and in fact
one of his main arguments for markets is
that under conditions of pure liberty
they will lead to equality it's not a
good argument but that was the argument
if that could happen which it can't then
you could say yes possibly it's
consistent with democracy otherwise
capitalism's and really exist any form
of really existing capitalism that's
likely to exist it will have sharp
inequalities it's based on hierarchy
domination production for profit not
need accumulation from the accumulation
of capital deprivation of others a
subordination of people who have to sell
that or labor in order to survive and of
course that's going to translate
automatically into any political
arrangement which will yield one or
another form of plutocracy we happen to
have a pretty extreme form right now so
but so for example right now in the
United States about roughly 70 percent
of the population
lower seventy percent on the incomes
skill have no influence whatsoever on
policy influence increases slowly as you
move up the scale at the very top the
question doesn't arise because they've
set the policy
so that's it's it's democracy in the
sense you're allowed to push a button
every couple years but it's a choice
between factions of a business party
with extremely enormous disparity of
influence over policy you can see that
very clearly you can see it's just like
in fact it was one the main topics
studied in professional political
science compare polling results on
attitudes with policy so for example
let's to pick one for about 40 years now
there have been regular polls asking
people what do they think about tax
policy
and large majorities are in favor of
much higher taxes on the rich and on the
corporate system policy does the
opposite direction and the same is true
minimum wage on national health just
about any topic you look at is a huge
divergence and that simply reflects the
fact that capitalism and anything like
the form we have at least is
inconsistent with democracy and you can
see why virtually any quasi capitalists
arrangement would have similar but
problems so the profit of a conclusion
is the opposite of what Friedman says of
course he meant must mean something
different by democracy he may mean the
right to push a button every four years
but not to participate in the
decision-making
