I've done a scene I've been really lucky
to have done a series of books with
Chomsky and working with him over the
years have really been struck by his
consistency his patience and equanimity
in and in terms of his intellectual
chops he's awesome in his syncretic
ability to take a wide and disparate
amount of information and cobble it into
a coherent analysis and like the dorje
Thunderbolt of Tibetan Buddhism Chomsky
with relentless logic peels away and
devastates the layers of deceit and
deception produced by the embedded
journalists of the corporate media and
the mandarins of state power and
American Empire always he reminds us
always he reminds us as he did this
afternoon on the lawn of the boulder
Public Library addressing a large
gathering there that the responsibility
is up to us we the citizens really must
change the society and culture if we
want to see a world of peace and social
justice and democracy in this country
earlier David Horowitz
but Chomsky does have his critics and
one must acknowledge them and one of the
leading critics is someone named David
Horowitz he wrote an article called the
sick mind of Noam Chomsky and this is
not untypical
of the kind of vitriol and and loathing
that is directed toward this incredibly
mild-mannered and you know self-effacing
man this is what Horowitz says you know
we have to do like good journalists
ping-pong journalists the good and the
bad his venomous message is spread on
tapes and CDs and the lecture circuit
Chomsky's influence is best understood
not that as of a religion Taleggio
figure but as the leader of a secular
religious cult as the Ayatollah of
anti-american hate this guy's deep this
guys did this cultic residence is
recognized by his followers his most
important devotee David Barr Sam Young
is an obscure public radio producer on
ke GNU in Boulder Colorado who has
created a library of Chomsky screeds on
tapes
all right fair and balanced we report
you decide well Chomsky at 74 is
indefatigable he spoke last night before
thousands in Denver he's leavin early in
the morning to give two talks in Los
Angeles he is as a bono of u2 once
called him a rebel without a pause and
he draws huge audiences wherever he
wherever he goes and he's literally
booked years in advance as he once told
me I'm not a charismatic speaker and if
I had the capacity to do so I wouldn't
use it I'm really not interested in
persuading people what I like to do is
help people persuade themselves
often Chomsky is introduced as someone
who exemplifies the Quaker adage of
speaking truth to power he actually
takes exception to that he says the
powerful already know what's going on
it's the people who need to hear the
truth and now celebrating 25 years of
kgn you please welcome Noam Chomsky
one of the things I've learned from many
years of not being a charismatic speaker
is that my voice doesn't carry very well
so tell me if you can hear me before I
okay well we're all aware that right at
this moment bodies are being torn to
shreds by infernal weapons unknown
numbers of people who's who have already
been driven to the edge of survival by a
decade of murderous sanctions may be
facing starvation and slow death under
these circumstances it's not very easy
to step back and try to ask why all this
is happening where it's likely to go and
what we can do to shape the future but
that's what I want to try to do about
the last question what we can do to
shape the future the answer is
straightforward quite a lot in fact
there's no one who anywhere who can do
as much as we can we're uniquely
privileged we have unusual freedom
that's not a gift from on high it's a
legacy that was won by centuries of
constant dedicated struggle and that's
really the answer to what we can do pay
attention to the legacy and carry it
forward privilege and advantages confer
responsibility
that should be truism what comes next is
hard
though personal choices one choice is to
face the responsibility not easy though
a lot easier than it is in other
countries other places not as privileged
as we are the other choice is to shirk
the responsibility and and the future
over to be determined by forces that we
can be sure are not benign well many
people in the world probably the vast
majority as far as we know are hoping
and probably desperately hoping that we
will make the first choice face the
responsibility and they view with dread
the consequences if we do not if we do
not act to control what they see as a
juggernaut that they regard as the
greatest threat to peace in the world
and these days threat to peace means
literally threat to survival
well not everyone is dismayed
so take Osama bin Laden if he's alive
somewhere
I'm sure he's enjoying mightily the
scenes that are portrayed in one way on
television here and in a different way
by correspondents and commentators who
are not embedded within the invading
system he's made it very clear what he
wants he wants a word of the death
between the evil empire and the billions
of people around the world and that's
what he's getting the political even
before the invasion of Iraq the US
political leadership had inspired
extraordinary level of fear throughout
the world not just the Arab and
slim world since the invasion the war
that the world is seen the one being
portrayed here that word has aroused a
wave of revulsion and that's actually
becoming a serious concern even the
policymakers here and it's reaching the
mainstream press so just in the last few
days the mainstream press has been
publishing lead articles about it they
report give you some quotes a growing
hatred of America regarded as a violent
aggressor cruel aggressor that's relying
on overwhelming force to crush anyone
who's in its way and worse still it
seems to be rejoicing in its ability to
destroy a defenseless enemy people
shooting with arresting rifles that
tanks and bombers the rejoicing over
that is not the inspiring great love
around the world furthermore Saddam
Hussein has been transformed by the
invasion he was regarded as a thug and a
despot and hated and he's becoming a
hero brave I'm quoting again a brave and
noble man his present his praises gush
from the lips of Arabs from nearly every
walk of life quoting long experienced
American reporters in Jordan in this
case the director of the Center for
Strategic Studies in Jordan says that
without doubt Saddam now occupies the
high moral ground across the Arab world
and he finds that very disturbing thinks
it's gonna cause huge problems for
countries like Jordan and Egypt
especially if there's any step towards
democratization because of the voice of
the people is heard he knows what voice
it's going to be it's going to be the
voice of radical
Islamists who are calling for a war
against America and also secular
nationalists who despise Saddam Hussein
but now admire because he's standing up
to this savage Americans and no one else
is and in death he's likely to become an
even greater hero
there have been polls recently taken by
American academics of the Arab and the
Arab world and what they find is also a
cause for a lot of concern a huge
majority from all over all over from
Morocco to the Gulf states and Lebanon a
huge majority want Islamic clergy to
play a greater role in government about
95 percent are convinced that the United
States has no interest in the region
beyond maintaining control over its oil
and incidentally those concerns go back
50 years that was the reason for what
President Eisenhower called a campaign
of hatred against us in the Arab world
back in the mid 19th late 1950s now they
knew about it they're convinced now too
that the US has no interest and he
incidentally and the his staff concluded
that that was correct that is their
interest and they were supporting
oppressive and governments and
preventing development because of the
interest in maintaining control over
Middle East oil that's the 1950s not
today now 95 percent are convinced that
that's still the interest along with
protecting Israeli power and humiliating
Arabs and Muslims or anybody who's in
the way relying on the fact that they
have no
well monopoly of violence by now they
even speak of Saddam Hussein with
reverence even though they hate him as a
murderous tyrant
well one recent story in the big long
story in The Washington Post about all
this opens by saying something ominous
is brewing that does not pretend well
for the United States and that's an
understatement
it does not that's quite an achievement
by george w bush and his associates
these discussions are referring to the
arab in the Muslim world actually that's
the world that they claim to be
liberating in fact it extends far beyond
seems to be worldwide it's not the last
few days that's gotten much more extreme
if somebody was watching all this from
outer space they might be led to believe
that George Bush was embedded in the
White House as an agent of Osama bin
Laden he's certainly acting that way
well you know we can
unfortunately it's not a joke it does
not portend will the consequences could
be very grim well we can we got choices
on this too we can decide to live in a
cocoon the cocoon that's created by
television and embedded commentators we
can admire ourselves for our
magnificence or we can look at what the
world thinks and ask why that's you
Candace a people have to decide for
themselves what's the wisest and most
admirable course and I don't think it's
a hard decision well as I said going
back we can go the the fear of the
United States of its leadership this
particularly this political leadership
although actually goes beyond that goes
back well before the invasion of Iraq it
was bad before but within a year Bush
and his advisers have turned the United
States into a pariah state it's greatly
feared throughout the world
it's regarded as the greatest threat to
world peace by substantial majorities
bankis last october the national press
was forced to recognize in quoting that
the world is more concerned about the
unbridled use of American power than
they are about the threat of saddam
hussein actually that's an
understatement no matter how much the
world hates saddam hussein it's only in
the united states that he's feared no
one else regarded him as a threat
including his neighbor's to hate him but
they're not afraid of that's a special
US property that's reached the point
where the the fear and concern over us
power has been featured in the national
media recently cover stories in Newsweek
and washington post recently the there's
a one of the major polling centers the
research centers is the Pew Center Pew
Research Center recently published a
poll on the image
of the United States around the world
Europe mainly it's plummeted that's
particularly a bush in his associates
most places it's still dissociated from
the country though there are some
exceptions like Poland and Turkey where
the country is feared and hated but it
will follow if they keep at it it'll
follow it will be - not them but
everyone the head of the non-aligned
movement that's governments of roughly
80% of the world's population former
colonies basically my Prime Minister
Mahathir of Malaysia is very
pro-american you know very much part of
the whole us international economic
project what's absurd Lee called
globalization he recently said that that
the United States today under the
current leadership is more dangerous to
the world than Hitler
I wasn't reported here we want to stay
in a cocoon but it's reported elsewhere
like England you want to get out of the
cocoon you should know that
well you look beyond that gets some ways
even more remarkable you won't know I'm
sure that every year the World Economic
Forum has meeting in usually in Davos
Switzerland it's usually very upbeat and
enthusiastic not this year this year it
was there was an atmosphere of what the
press called gloom the theme of the
meeting last January was building trust
and the reason for that was that the
World Economic Forum had just done a
poll which they'd released about trust
and leadership around the world and
they'd found a sharp decline and Trust
there was only one they had various
categories the only category that had he
majority of slight majority of the
population trusting them was
non-governmental organizations right
below them came the UN and spiritual and
religious leaders and below them were
Western European leaders keep going down
and get the corporate managers the very
bottom leaders of the United States it's
pretty amazing
Colin Powell was sent there by the
administration as their emissary he had
a very rough time he was bitterly
condemned the focus of the meeting was
the coming war with Iraq and I which
they were strongly opposed to and
weren't by no means impressed with
Powell's
Proclamation that the u.s. declares the
sovereign right to use force as it
wishes it's going to lead even if
nobody's following didn't win a lot of
hearts and minds this remember is the
core of the international establishment
these are the people who the business
press calls the Masters of the Universe
includes corporate executives who are
paying thirty thousand dollars each to
attend the major figures everywhere that
kind of opposition to government policy
is completely without precedent and it
extends right to the United States at
the heart of the the elite opposition to
the political leadership is again
extraordinary the major foreign affairs
journals American Academy of Arts and
Sciences and others popular opposition
also has absolutely no precedent there
was an international Gallup poll that
wasn't reported here in preference for
the cocoon last December and the results
were pretty interesting run through them
but just one result one one question
asked I had to do with the war that bush
and Blair and pow
and the rest are declaring and are now
carrying out a war that they carry out
without any calling themselves the
Allies but their allied only in the
sense that they're allied against almost
Universal world opinion the coalition
the coalition forces is the propaganda
system calls them a war carried out by
them didn't even barely reach ten
percent support in any of the countries
poll the opposition in Europe was
greatest in the countries that were
aligned where the leadership was lining
up with Washington over the overwhelming
opposition of their own population
that's incidentally being lauded here in
a demonstration of hatred and contempt
for democracy that also has no precedent
David was making jokes about France but
the reason for why France and Germany
are so reviled is that they're taking
the government's are taking the position
of the overwhelming majority of the
population and that's considered a crime
it's a pretty striking fact the
governments that are praised what
Rumsfeld calls the new Europe their
countries where the leadership is taking
their orders from Crawford Texas and
disregarding you know 90% of the
population those are the good guys
now what this tells you about the
attitude towards democracy among elites
here is pretty astonishing don't have to
come in on it that's I'm sure you notice
that the biggest demonstrations by far
in February mid-february
we're in the countries where the
leadership was going along with the
United States Italy and Spain same
figures are all same right through
Eastern Europe so Hungary for example
has also about 80 or 90% opposition to
the war under any circumstances and the
Latin America of course overwhelming
opposition are always overwhelming
opposition there to US military
intervention which they've had a little
bit of experience with the when the
Allies had to have their summit meeting
in which they presented an ultimatum to
the United Nations and not to Iraq they
presented an ultimatum to the United
Nations bush player Aznar saying you
follow us in 24 hours or else where did
they meet well they couldn't meet in any
country or their people around it's too
dangerous
now they met in a US military base on an
island that's where you gotta meet like
the World Trade Organization which had
to meet and Doha make to make sure
there's no demonstration be surrounded
by navies and that tells you a lot well
it's it's a real achievement and you
really have to ask how you know let's
say you're this Martian observer
how did Bush and his associates manage
to make themselves the most feared and
hated political leadership in the world
in fact maybe ever
and ashaming the country and ultimately
endangering its people had to do it
well you look back you can see how they
did it just without them through the
whole story it just started last
September because there was a big change
then last September a lot of important
things happened and they made an effect
on world and us opinion the first and
most important was the Declaration in
late September of the National Security
Strategy immediately and surprisingly it
was harshly criticized in the main
establishment International Affairs
Journal Foreign Affairs Council on
Foreign Relations which dissing him they
do it in sort of muted terms but you
could see the concern I was called an
imperial grand vision the government
announced a very remarkable doctrine
basically what it came down to is that
the u.s. is going to rule the world by
force that's the dimension in which it
has overwhelming dominance the u.s.
probably out spins the rest of the world
combined and military force by now it's
gonna rule the world by force and it's
going to do it indefinitely if the US
government perceives any potential
challenge to its domination of the world
it's going to destroy that's the
doctrine that was announced at some time
it's usually in the press it's called a
doctrine of pre-emptive war that's not
what they announced a pre-emptive war
has a meaning it means that if you're
under attack you know you're under
imminent threat of attack like say
remember back in 1983 the Russians were
going to bomb us from an airbase and
grenade well okay
say the Russian planes are in Grenada
and they're flying to Florida about the
bomb us and a pre-emptive war would mean
you're allowed to shoot them down before
they bomb and maybe even bomb the
threatening airbase in Grenada
that's pre-emptive war that's be an
imminent attack that's taking place
that's not what was proposed in
September what was proposed is that they
can attack anybody they decide to call a
potential threat now sometimes that's
called preventive war but even that's
not fair because they're allowed to
invent the threat it's not preventing
anything necessarily that's the doctrine
that was announced the goal to use
somebody else was to use force to
prevent any challenge to the power
position and prestige of the United
States and no legal issue arises if the
u.s. acts to prevent any such challenge
that's now the position of the rulers of
the country that out spins probably the
rest of the world combined and means of
violence are close to that and it's now
a forging new and very dangerous paths
over near-unanimous world opposition the
most striking and dangerous of them is
the development of lethal weaponry in
space which really does pose a threat to
survival of the species well I mentioned
I was quoting someone else it's
important who it was it was Dean Acheson
a respected elder statesman senior
advisor of the Kennedy administration
and quotes what he said in 1963 right
after the Cuban Missile Crisis which
almost led the terminal nuclear war the
roots of a Missile Crisis were a
campaign of international terrorism that
the Kennedy administration was carrying
out again in order to carry out what's
now called regime change in Cuba and we
know why one of the part of the freedom
that we've
obtained if we want to use it is that we
have unusual access to internal secret
government documents they get
Declassified there's thousands of pages
of them on this we can choose to ignore
them if we want are we going to look and
if we look we find that the reasons for
the campaign of international terrorism
were that the very existence of the
Castro government is a successful
challenge to US policies that go back
150 years what does that mean well 150
years of US policy is saying you follow
our orders or else and the existence of
that regime was successful defiance of
that furthermore it was regarded as a
threat because of the possible spread of
the Castro idea of taking matters into
your own hands
which has great appeal to people in the
region who suffer from similar forms of
oppression and we got to stop that 150
years of policy tell us that well that
was the reason for the international
terrorist campaign led right to the
missile crisis almost nuclear war just
learned how close it was after the
crisis was over the terrorist campaign
was renewed along with economic
strangulation and right at that point
Dean Acheson
informed the American Society of
international law that no legal issue
arises in the case of a US response to a
challenge to its power position position
or prestige well that's approximately
the bush doctrine of september 1992 and
this is the opposite end of the
political spectrum remember and that's
important to note one understand
ourselves remember what the political
spectrum is well why the shudders around
the world and the foreign policy elite
here in September last September well as
a reason Aitchison was describing
policy and it's true that is policy it's
been so for a long time but the national
security strategy last September
proclaimed it as official policy and
that's quite a difference an important
one actually you want to think about
this it goes back beyond that you can
find the policy described in the early
stages of the Second World War actually
before the u.s. even entered it
that's the there you can find a clear
announced discussion of what's now
called the Imperial grand strategy so
even before the u.s. entered the war
there were study groups of high-level
planners from the Council on Foreign
Relations it's kind of foreign policy
elite and the State Department trying to
decide what to do in the post-war world
and they concluded that in the post-war
world the United States must hold I'm
quoting it now must hold unquestioned
power and must act to ensure limitation
of any exercise of sovereignty by states
that interfere with us global designs
that's the September national security
strategy and they also recognize that
the foremost requirement to secure these
ends is rapid fulfilment of a program of
complete rearmament that's a central
component of an integrated policy to
achieve military and economic supremacy
for the United States
that's 1940 at that time those ambitions
were limited to what they called the non
German world they expected the Germany
might when when the European war at
least and the non German world was going
to be organized under the United States
rule as what they called a grand area
that included the Western Hemisphere the
former British
Empire in the Far East well shortly
after that Russia that beat back the
Nazi armies at Stalingrad and it became
fairly clear that Germany would
ultimately be defeated and these plans
were then extended to include as much of
Eurasia as possible and they were
implemented after the Second World War
they've been described since as in Dean
Acheson comment and now their official
policy well that's all important to know
in a society that really valued its
freedom I wouldn't have to be saying
this everybody would have learned it in
high school these are really important
things to know about ourselves
there's plenty more like it well let's
go back to last September
one important development which did
cause plenty of concern around the world
foreign policy a lead here was the
proclamation of the national security
strategy as something else happened in
September September was the opening of
the political campaign for the midterm
elections and that was combined with an
enormous propaganda campaign which began
to present Iraq Saddam Hussein as an
imminent threat to the survival of the
United States with insinuations that
Iraq was responsible for the September
11th attacks actually if you look at
this morning's New York Times Karl Rove
who's George Bush's minder as they call
him in Iraq he was he describes it this
morning
he says the purpose that he goal is that
in order to pursue the domestic agenda
of the administration it's necessary to
frighten the population you have to make
the population feel that they have to
shelter under you know behind the under
the behind the powerful leader is going
to save them from destruction
you can do that you can pursue your
domestic agenda otherwise not he's
talking about what we have to do in what
they're gonna have to do in the future
but he also says yeah that's what they
did in the past and that's correct
in September Condoleezza Rice showed up
with her prediction that the next thing
we're going to hear about Saddam Hussein
is a mushroom cloud they're planning to
destroy us and then that came as a
series of outlandish lies repeated
passionately by Bush and others
distributed quite uncritically by the
media and I had an immediate effect you
take a look at polls by September after
this campaign began roughly 60% of the
population believed it and continued to
believe it 60% of the population
plus-or-minus believes that Saddam
Hussein was an imminent threat they got
to keep repeating it to keep that level
up about half the population by couple
oh about a month ago it's probably
higher and how I believe that the Iraq
was responsible for the September 11th
attack that Iraqis were on the planes
those beliefs turned out to be highly
correlated with support for the war and
it's understandable if you think that
Saddam Hussein's an imminent threat
already destroyed the World Trade Center
planning something new maybe in the
clear bomb and then it's understandable
that you'd want to do something to get
rid of them that's a remarkable
achievement of government media
propaganda they have to bear in mind
that this is unique to the United States
nowhere else where anyone believes
anything like this nor is it believed
here by anybody who knows anything like
CIA foreign policy animals but it has
been imposed on the population
and that's impressive it's not the first
time but it's impressive if you and as
far as it was aimed at the election and
for the election it just barely worked
and they barely managed to maintain
control tens of thousands of votes not
much and something similar is going to
be needed for the next election that's
what rove says this morning this is for
the next election we've got to create an
image of George Bush as a powerful
leader savior who by then I'll be
marching off to slay some new dragons so
it's gonna be something to do next year
well for the guys in power the current
administration all of this is kind of
reflexive it's just second nature that
remember that these is almost the same
people who ran the country in the reagan
bush one administration's that twelve
years to do it it's a sort of
astonishing when you look at put
yourself in the position of the Martian
observer again
and recognize that it's just elementary
sanity if you want to figure out what
these guys are up to
to ask what they did during their first
tenure in power it's 12 years not
ancient history 1981 to 92 what they do
well so it's interesting that it's
almost never investigated through a
search and see how often people bring up
what they did the first time around well
if you do it you'll find that right now
they're following almost exactly the
same script in detail the first thing
the Reaganites did when they came into
office 1981 first thing they did was
drive the country into a deep deficit
Bush administration did exactly the same
thing this time the way they did it was
by a huge tax cut benefiting very tiny
percentage of the population and by the
biggest increase in federal spending in
20 years quoting The Wall Street Journal
but it's a fact biggest increase in
federal spending in 20 years at
goes to the rich huge tax cut for the
rich
well that causes a problem just as it
did in the Reagan years got a deficit
you have to have what's
