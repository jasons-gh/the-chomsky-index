there are a number of kind of dogmas
about language which I think are being
systematically refuted and they're held
by linguists too I should say not just
on a general public which probably Falls
in which I think are being undermined by
current research this is a minority view
I'm not speaking for the profession the
introductory comments that I'm supposed
to be contrarian so I try to keep to
that but for example one one general
assumption about language almost a Dogma
and philosophy common understanding
linguistics psychology is that language
is primarily a means of communication
and that it evolved as a means of
communication probably that's totally
false
it seems that languages evolved and is
designed as a mode of creating and
interpreting thought it's a system of
thought basically it can be used to
communicate everything people do can be
used to communicate you can you
communicate by your hairstyle you know
style of walk everything and yes
language can be used to communicate but
it doesn't seem to be part of its design
its design seems to be radically
different and in fact even seems to
undermine communication if you look at
carefully at the structure of language
you find case after case right at the
core of language design where there are
conflicts between what would be
efficient for communication and what is
efficient for the specific biological
design of language and in every case
that's known the communicative
efficiency is sacrificed it just isn't a
consideration and I think that's that's
a conclusion that has very widespread
significance
it in order to establish it you have to
look at technical work it's not the kind
of thing you can explain in two minutes
of you know exposition but it's not
profound it's not quantum physics 1/2 an
hour would certainly suffice and I think
it's a pretty far-reaching consequence
another general belief about language
again almost a Dogma in all the relevant
fields philosophy linguistics and so on
is that the meaningful the minimal
meaningful elements in language sort of
word like things pick out entities in
the extra mental world so the word say
river picks out the Charles River and so
on something that a physicist could
identify that turns out to be true for
animal systems animal communication
systems the symbols that appear are the
actions that are carried out do
apparently have a one-to-one correlation
with mind independent events so some
particular call of a monkey will be
related to leaves fluttering predators
coming sort of I'm hungry you know some
hormonal change it's just not true of
language like linguistic elements do not
have that property actually this was
understood by Aristotle was understood
in the 17th and 18th centuries
interesting work on it the entities that
we construct in our communicate
discourse expression interpretation are
largely mental partially mental object
there are ways in which they are modes
of in which we interpret phenomena but
they don't pick out entities in the
world that a natural scientist could
identify without looking into our minds
that tells us a lot about the nature of
language and about our own our own
nature languages
the core human property I mean this was
understood by Darwin by a long tradition
before them and it's very different from
the way it's usually conceived I think
those are among the conclusions that
have pretty widespread significance let
me stress again the very minority view
very few linguists would agree with this
but I think over time I suspect some
clear
