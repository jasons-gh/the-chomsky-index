[Music]
we begin our campaign I just want to
thank all of you you are warriors I've
been watching
I've been watching the fakeness two
weeks now and everything is negative
with less than 20 weeks until the u.s.
presidential election Americans are
still in the midst of a deadly pandemic
which has already claimed more than
120,000 lives and an economic downturn
that has brought the jobless claims to
over 40 million
hello I'm Peter Farley welcome to inside
America President Trump
kicked off his reelection campaign by
holding his first rally in months in
front of a much smaller crowd than
anticipated
while the president said that over a
million of his supporters had signed up
for tickets only 6200 showed up less
than a third of the arena's capacity
Trump uses rally in Tulsa Oklahoma to
energize his base amid his continuing
slide in national polls which now gave
his Democratic rival Joe Biden an
increasing lead recent state-level polls
also give Biden an edge in a number of
key swing states the Trump one in 2016
including Michigan Florida Pennsylvania
and Wisconsin in his campaign rally the
president was criticized for stoking
racial tensions and sowing divisions if
the Democrats gained power then the
riders will be in charge and no one will
be safe and no one will have control Joe
Biden is not the leader of his party Joe
Biden is a helpless puppet of the
radical left in Joe Biden's America
rioters looters and criminal aliens have
more rights than law-abiding citizens
and that's true
Trump also appealed to his supporters to
quote save America's heritage unquote
from those who seek to demolish it and
impose their new oppressive regime in
racially charged language the president
called the coronavirus come flu and
referred to criminals as hombres this
while recent polls show declining
support among some of trumps core
constituents including white women over
50 support among evangelicals dropped 13
percentage points and approval among non
college educated white men fell by six
points this comes on the heels of
scathing criticism by former national
security adviser John Bolton who
revealed in his new book that the
president repeatedly appealed to foreign
leaders to help him win a second term
writing about a meeting Trump held with
Chinese premier Xi Jinping Bolton says
quote he then stunningly turned the
verse a Shinto the coming US
presidential election alluding to
China's economic capability to affect
the ongoing campaigns pleading with xi
to ensure he'd win he stressed the
importance of farmers and increased
Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat
in the electoral outcome less than five
months before the elections these latest
accusations add pressure on the
president and his party as American
voters weigh their options to discuss
all this and more improve llege to be
joined for the entire program by one of
the most prominent scholars in the
United States Noam Chomsky professor
emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology MIT he's also a laureate
professor at the University of Arizona
dr. Chomsky authored more than a hundred
books on linguistics politics and
international relations
dr. Chomsky you've been for many decades
a leading scholar of linguistics today
when you hear the kind of language the
syntax the words that are being used by
the President of the United States what
comes to mind President Trump is unique
in many respects including his vulgarity
his lack of concern for minimal
conditions of respect for others it's
more the actions than the words so
President Trump has purged the executive
branch of the government of any voices
of questioning Authority almost totally
purged nothing but psycho fans it's
never happened before
he has gone to the extent of purging the
officials who are placed by Congress to
monitor the executive branches to check
corruption and malfeasance thrown them
out just last weekend he fired a major
prosecutor in the United States state of
New York who's investigating his crimes
fired him this is
he's taken on a few institutions he also
tweeted after the Supreme Court rebuked
him on a couple of occasions in the last
few days he tweeted out this saying
these horrible and politically charged
decisions coming out of the Supreme
Court are shotgun blasts into the face
of people that are proud to call
themselves Republicans and conservatives
some people listening to President Trump
at his rallies or reading his tweets
would suggest that he is Fanning the
flames of a cultural war
do you agree it he is he pitting
Americans one against the other by
calling his own supporters warriors
that's no secret
it's the openly expressed strategy the
Republicans are a minority party they
can appeal to vams on their own programs
their programs are total service to
wealth and corporate power can't get
votes that way well you have to turn to
what are called cultural issues
religious extremism white supremacy
xenophobia fear of others you have to
try to mobilize sectors like that so
when the president says in response to
the current demonstrations we have to
call out vicious dogs he knows what that
means
vicious dogs evokes memories of the
Civil Rights years wherein they deep
south vicious dogs were sent to attack
black demonstrators horrifying the
country that's what he's trying to evoke
we have to either use ominous weapons
against American citizens to ensure
force and violence and he's trying to
gather the armed supporters so they'll
be ready for attacking demonstrators by
as in fact they're doing isn't us
politics though dr. Chomsky often
predicated on the existence of enemies
whether it was the Soviet Union and
communism in the past radical Islam
terrorism today these culture wars
Republicans pitted against Democrats
liberals and conservatives
is there anything particularly new about
this Trump era when you compare it to
previous eras within American politics
and you've lived through quite a few of
them but back in the early 60s when you
were a vocal critic of the Vietnam War
you were considered part of the new left
and we often hear President Trump talk
about the radical left you were even on
the the list to the enemies list of
President Nixon are we seeing something
reminiscent of those days or is this
something entirely new those days were
bad enough but what Trump is Fanning is
much more extreme they take a look at
the official government statistics some
have just been released on acts of
violence and terror in the United States
when Trump came into office those
attributed the white supremacy were
pretty low and now they're almost older
almost all the acts of terror and
violence are white supremacy groups that
have been fanned by President Trump to
attack the general population I don't
know if you saw what happened in Bethel
Ohio week ago small town in Ohio where
some young women decided to have a quiet
demonstration to support the protests
around the country they were attacked by
organized armed militia hundreds of them
from all over totally outnumbered the
police is about six policemen in the
country there were maybe eight hundred
of them attacking the demonstrators no
president has ever called for that
before
nothing like though I was on Nixon's
enemies list was a joke everybody left
this is very different this is very
different the president railing quite
often about the radical left as we just
said also saying we will never let them
destroy our nation we won't let them
demolish our heritage often blurring the
lines between the peaceful protesters
and those who've been carrying out the
looting calling many of them thugs and
anarchists in fact I know that you
identify with anarchist policies and
politics calling it a tendency that is
suspicious and skeptical of domination
Authority and hierarchy when is
unjustified but doesn't that go against
the East ethos of democracy what is the
state of American democracy today well
first of all Trump is using the word
anarchist and a totally different sense
he means people throwing bombs
destroying the country and he has tarred
the entire Democratic Party with being
under the control of radical leftists
who are trying to destroy the country no
president has ever done that before
could be opposed illegitimate Authority
has nothing to do with what he is
describing he is trying desperately to
fan the flames of hatred violence white
supremacy racism in a desperate attempt
to hold on to power professor Chomsky
obviously the the killing the brutal
murder of George Floyd has triggered a
massive movement not just here in the
United States but globally as well
people asking for accountability for a
change
reforms to the criminal justice system
some going as far as demanding
reparations for the systemic oppression
of black people are these calls that you
agree with
it's very belated we have a history of
400 years of first the most vicious
brutal system of flavor
in world history followed by theoretical
freedom which turned into
criminalization of black life another
slave system lasted practically until
the Second World War
since then other measures of severe
racist repression leaving a bitter
legacy today of black life finally after
400 years there's a general awakening
not just to the problem of police
violence which is a symptom of something
deeper but what is at the root of the
problem deep systemic institutional
racism deeply embedded in the culture
and the institutions when there's being
a remarkable demonstration of protest
with enormous popular support two-thirds
of the population supports it far beyond
what supported Martin Luther King at the
peak of his popularity this could be a
major step forward it's infuriated the
far-right and their spokesman President
Trump who's trying to blame it on
radical leftists terrorists and so on no
these are peaceful nonviolent
demonstrations or which could lead to a
very significant and much belated change
in fundamental aspects of American
society but his supporters will say that
he is certainly rocking the boat he's
challenging the status quo do you agree
with those who believe that he in fact
presents a threat to the institutions of
the United States and that if he were to
spend another few years at the White
House these institutions could be at
risk at serious risk right now so I said
he's virtually eliminated the executive
branch
he's purging all of the inspectors who
monitor
malfeasance and corruption because they
are looking into the swamp that he's
created in Washington the one Republican
Lisa Murkowski dared to express a word
of discomfort with the Dear Leader he
reacted like a ton of bricks
said I'm gonna destroy you I'm going to
eliminate you everyone has to follow me
passionately loyally or obediently this
is sometimes called fascism that's a
mistake
it's a tin-pot dictator the kind of
dictator who takes control in some small
country that has a coup every couple of
years that's what he's imitating yes
he's destroying the institution's
purposely because he wants to control it
totally in his own hand for himself but
he's kept the support or at least the
the quiet acquiescence of the
Republicans on Capitol Hill except for
one or two who have shown their
discomfort with him and of course in the
last three days you've had a steady
stream of former aides who've come out
criticizing him including he is the
longest-serving national security
advisor John Bolton who among many
things said this I don't think he's fit
for office I don't think he has the
competence to carry out the job there
really isn't any guiding principle that
I was able to discern other than what's
good for Donald Trump's reelection
ideologically professor Chomsky I guess
it's safe to say that you and Bolton are
diametrically opposed but I guess you
might agree with him as painful as this
might be on this point that the
president is unfit to govern do you
agree with him he is unfit to be in any
office we are barely touching on the
major crimes that he's committing which
is destroying American democracy is
serious there it's a very minor crime
for Trump President Trump is dedicated
to destroying the press
for human survival on earth he is the
most dangerous criminal who has ever
appeared Hitler was hideous but he
wasn't trying to destroy life on earth
Trump is he knows it very well his
policies of racing towards the abyss on
environmental catastrophe are going to
eliminate the possibility of organized
human life in a few decades he's aware
of it and he doesn't care there is
nothing like this in history professor
Chomsky I mean you also speak about the
neoliberal capitalist model wouldn't
that be pursued by whomever makes it to
the White House some people believe that
Joe Biden is a status quo candidate he
himself told the the wealthy funders who
support him that nothing fundamental
would change if he were to be elected No
you know in this vote as in many votes
the choice is vote against we are voting
we have to vote against the most
dangerous criminal in human history who
if he has four more years might not only
destroy American democracy but bring the
world past tipping points on eating the
envogue level warming which will be
irreversible he might bring about
nuclear war he's greatly escalating the
threats we have to get rid of that
malignancy Wyden himself is susceptible
to pressure there is substantial popular
activism it's kind of coalesced and the
Sanders campaign Sanders is in fact
working on the Biden campaign it has
moved his policies farther to the left
than any US president since Franklin
Delano Roosevelt not what I want but
much beyond anything before that way we
have
Oh to save human society from cuisine
hopes are very low so the vote against
is a clear-cut case when you look at the
state of democracy today in the United
States the current voting system the
fact that it isn't based on the popular
vote so it isn't one person one vote but
the electoral college system which gives
more weight to rural areas which are
typically more Republican leaning have a
bigger share and a bigger weight in this
system is that something you'd like to
see changed it's a very the United
States is approaching a constitutional
crisis in the 18th century the US
Constitution was very progressive by
comparative standards we're now 250
years later if a country tried to enter
the European Union with the US
Constitution it would be barred by the
European Court of Justice the most
powerful part of these the government is
the if the Parliament is the Senate
Wyoming state of Wyoming has 500,000
people that's two senators California
has 40 million people as two senators
that also affects the electoral college
you get extra votes for the Senators so
the Senate is radically undemocratic in
fact if you look at the figures about
20% of the population a rural white
conservative religious could run the
Senate and could control the vote the
Republicans are based on that they know
there are a minority party and a
shrinking one and they therefore half
the suppress the vote voting is set up
to try to prevent the wrong people from
voting so they'll be that's why the
voting in the United States
is on Tuesday not on Sunday it's not a
workday so people have to take off work
or people can't do that that's why you
have these crazed shape to electoral
districts so that all of the urban votes
which are mostly working people like the
poor get very few representatives that's
why the Republicans are desperately
trying to suppress the vote some of it's
almost comical in Georgia the last
election a couple of weeks ago the
person in short the voting was set up so
that in black areas though almost no
voting booths that people had to stand
in line for seven or eight hours during
a work day to try to get to vote in the
middle of a pandemic in the rich white
areas you just go and vote Republicans
are trying to do this all over the
country because they have to there's no
other in fact trumpet said straight out
if we allow everyone to vote Republicans
will never win all election again do you
believe that US democracy would be
better served by a one person vote
rather than this archaic electoral
college system as I said this system
would not be tolerated
whether European Court of Justice it
just doesn't fit any 20th century
conception of democracy so yes a radical
change in the system is required and the
reason it's facing a constitutional
crisis is that this would require a
constitutional amendment but the small
states can block any constitutional
amendment so therefore it is a very
serious crisis in the longer term and
trump is driving it into an immediate
crisis we don't know what's going to
happen in November if he doesn't win the
election we don't know what he'll do is
out of control
nobody wants to guess what he might do
it's a very serious crisis and for the
world
not only because of us powered but
because the forces he's pursuing are
going or aimed at destroying the
possibility of organized human life on
earth people have to understand that
it's not simply a matter of destroying
American democracy it's a matter of
destroying the environment that supports
life he is massively trying to escalate
the use of the most destructive fossil
fuels every scientist knows this can't
go on for another couple of decades
we're approaching irreversible tipping
points we have to do something soon is
dedicated to making sure that we don't
to enrich his rich friends and himself
nothing like this in human history we're
a unique moment and so I think what
you're alluding to professor Chomsky and
what some people are saying in this
country openly which is quite
interesting at least as I can see it for
the first time in modern US history the
question that some are asking including
Joe Biden is not who will win in the
elections but whether the incumbent
would concede is that a frivolous
question it's not a frivolous question
that many people are asking it is a
narcissistic megalomaniac has one simple
doctrine himself will do almost anything
to maintain power and control the the
the it's a normal human being even a
ugly one like Richard Nixon if you no
longer can hold power he quietly leave
we don't know if Trump will do that
nobody does Biden is not asking a
frivolous question it's on the mind of
many people professor Noam Chomsky
thank you so much it was a pleasure to
have you on the program thank you so
much for being with us thank you now
there's little doubt that Professor
Trump's key is to American academia what
Paley is to international football at 91
he is witnessed and lived through 15
American presidents and obviously
survived McCarthyism and other
challenging periods in US history
whether one agrees or disagrees with him
on political philosophy on u.s. foreign
policy on politics not to mention
linguistics he enjoys a rare intellect
and intellectual property as one who
voted for Democrats and Republicans
alike Chomsky's fear of a second trump
term is telling and is probably
symptomatic of the mood of many
Americans but in short when both Chomsky
and Bolton appear to agree on a rather
critical point it should probably call
the attention of all Americans let us
know what you think but for now for me
and the entire team here in Washington
thanks for watching
