how do you understand science do you
think that it's socially or politically
neutral tune it to a degree I mean of
course it's influenced by outside forces
I mean like where the science goes where
the money is has to I mean it doesn't if
say in my field you'd work with pencil
and paper but if you're in the chemistry
lab you just have to get money otherwise
you can't do anything and the money
comes from one of several sources could
come from the government it could come
from a private corporation it's about it
you know those are the basic sources of
money which you pick and what you do
does affect the work you do it's also
what you do is affected by general
cultural attitudes so it's been argued
with some plausibility I think that say
in the way evolution is interpreted has
been influenced by the kind of society
in which evolutionary theories developed
it's been argued with some some degree
of plausibility on how much that the
competitive you know nature is written
tooth and claw social Darwinian approach
that evolution is affected by the fact
that it developed within a competitive
state capitalist society one very
well-known
biologist who's argued this is Lynn
Margulis whose work was on symbiogenesis
arguing that species change takes place
not by competition and you know defeat
of some genes by others but by
incorporating genetic genomes
essentially the organ into other
organisms bacteria so it's kind of a
cooperative mode of evolution if you
like it's possible that those things are
influenced by general social cultural
values and the fact that say nuclear
physics developed is not unrelated to
the fact that the military wanted to you
know the clear weapons but by and large
I think science develops for its own
internal needs I mean you can only work
on the problems that are at the borders
of understanding it's one of the reasons
why Pentagon supported science like MIT
like me that tended to be the most free
they the MIT say in the 60s was about a
hundred percent Pentagon funded I was
working in a lab that was 100% funded by
the three Armed Services was also one of
the country's centers of resistance and
there was no real conflict over that
Pentagon was funding the I mean Adair
view they were I presume funding the
development of the next stage of the
economy and from our view we were
working with things that looked
interesting
so the more or less mesh there's some
influence from one on the other
