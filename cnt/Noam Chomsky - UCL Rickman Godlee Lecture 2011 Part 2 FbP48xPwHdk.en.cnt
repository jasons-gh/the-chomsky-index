the Special Warfare in North Carolina
invaded the Jesuit University in El
Salvador and brutally murdered six
leading Latin American intellectuals
Jesuit priests along with their
housekeeper and their daughter all under
orders of the government which was very
closely linked to the United States
following direct orders that culminated
a decade of horrors and which began when
the archbishop who was called the voice
for the voiceless it was assassinated by
much the same hands during that period
about 70,000 people were killed in El
Salvador overwhelmingly by the US armed
and trained forces about twice that
number were killed elsewhere in Central
America and same years same source the
primary targets were the people's
organizations fighting to defend their
most fundamental human rights those are
the words of the assassinated Archbishop
days before he was killed while saying
mass pleading in vain and letter to
Jimmy Carter pleading for the end of US
military aid to the murderous hunta to
serious scholarship in the West and of
course to the victims it's well known
I'm quoting now that between 1960 and
the Soviet collapse in 1990 the number
of political prisoners torture victims
and executions of non-violent political
dissenters in Latin America vastly
exceeded those in the Soviet Union and
east european satellites and i can add
of course the hundreds of thousands of
people who were simply slaughter all of
this supported are tolerated by
washington included many religious
martyrs such as those who framed the
horrible decade in el salvador and the
mass slaughter as well
I'm quoting well-known Latin American s
John cotesworth in the recently
published Cambridge history of the Cold
War at coach worth picks the year
nineteen sixty four good reasons there
had been of course many similar Horrors
in earlier years but the u.s. crusade
against democracy and human rights in
the Western Hemisphere escalated very
sharply right at that time right after
Vatican 2 in 1962 the nineteen that was
a historic event the words of
distinguished theologian Hans kung it
assured in a new era in the history of
the Catholic Church the it was an effort
to restore the Christianity the Gospels
that had been what Christianity was in
its first few centuries which is why
Christians were persecuted but ended
when the Roman Empire took it over and
turned it into the Church of of the
persecutors not to persecuted in the
fourth century so this was an attempt to
restore the Christianity the Gospels and
inspired by that latin-american bishops
adopted what they called the
preferential option for the poor priests
nuns laypersons tried to take the
radical pacifist a message of the
Gospels to the poor and the persecuted
of the hemisphere people who were and
try to organize them and will recalled
based communities and urged them tried
to help them take their fate in their
own hands and work together to overcome
the misery of survival in the harsh
realms of us power this was recognized
it wants to be an intolerable heresy and
the reaction was very Swift the Kennedy
administration immediately helped
install vicious and national security
state in Brazil plague been
spread throughout the continent in ways
which should be familiar it culminated
exactly when the Berlin Wall fell these
events have been disappeared to borrow
the terminology used in Latin America
they suffer from a fallacy the fallacy
of wrong agency that we carried them out
therefore they cannot be in history and
you don't study in school you know read
about them people write about them and
so on we write about our nobility and
supporting the Eastern European
dissidents who surely suffered but not
even remotely like what was going on in
our own domains and I should add that
horrible as these events were there
barely a pee on a mountain as compared
with other crimes in that period notably
the Indochina wars that followed from
Kennedy's invasion of south vietnam
almost exactly 50 years ago it's also
been disappeared for the same reasons
fallacy of wrong agency a careful look
reveals that the grand area doctrines
continue to apply to contemporary crises
take what's considered the main one in
Western policy making circles and among
political commentators the Iranian
threat is considered to pose the
greatest danger to World Order and hence
must be the primary focus of u.s.
foreign policy Europe's trailing along
politely as usual this year is called
the year of Iran because of the danger
of that enormous threat which does raise
a question what exactly is the Iranian
threat you read the public commentary I
don't get much of an answer but there
actually is an authoritative answer
which is ignored the authoritative
answer is provided by the regular
reports to Congress by the Pentagon and
US intelligence agencies come every year
reports on the globe
global security and of course they
include a section on Iran most recent
was almost a year ago other reports make
it very clear that whatever the Iranian
threat is it's not military it's all
quote Iran's a military spending is
relatively low compared to the rest of
the region in fact it's less than a
quarter of that of Saudi Arabia and
miniscule is compared with the u.s. of
Cory its Iran's military doctrine is
strictly defensive designed to slow an
invasion and to force a diplomatic
solution to hostilities Iran has only
limited capacity to project force beyond
its borders they of course bring up the
nuclear option and say that Iran's
nuclear program and its willingness to
keep open the possibility of developing
nuclear weapons is a central part of its
deterrence strategy well the brutal
clerical regime in Iran is undoubtedly a
major threat to its own people who
hardly outranks US allies in that regard
but the threat lies elsewhere and it's
ominous one element of the threat is
Iran's potential deterrent capacity
notice that that's an illegitimate
exercise of sovereignty because it might
interfere with us freedom of action in
the region and it's of course glaringly
obvious why Iran would seek a deterrent
capacity just take a look at the
disposition of forces in the region
including nuclear forces seven years ago
the one of Israel's leading military
historians Martin Phan krefeld wrote
that the world has witnessed how the
United States attacked Iraq for as it
turned out no reason at all had the
Iranians not tried to build nuclear
weapons they would be crazy
particularly when they're under constant
threat by a constant threat of attack by
the United States of course in violation
of the UN Charter but remember that that
doesn't apply to the United States
whether they are in fact the developing
a nuclear capability we don't really
know but perhaps so well the Iranian
threat is described in the documents and
the reports goes beyond deterrence Iran
is also seeking to expand its influence
in neighboring countries and thus what
to destabilize the region as it's called
notice that when the US invade and
occupy invades and occupies Iran's
neighbors that's stabilization when Iran
tries to expand its influence a
commercial relations with its neighbors
that's destabilization that is
absolutely routine usage in foreign
policy commentary so for sometimes
becomes almost comical here's prominent
foreign policy analyst at James chase
former editor foreign affairs rather on
the liberal side incidentally he was
properly using the term stability in its
technical sense when he explained that
in order to achieve stability in Chile
it was necessary to destabilize the
country namely by overthrowing the
elected I end a government stalling a
vicious dictatorship sounds
contradictory but it isn't if you
understand the technical meaning of the
terms well other concerns about Iran no
time to go into they're interesting to
explore but i think they simply show
underscore what the guiding doctrines
are and they're continuing status and
imperial culture that's very much in
accord with the doctrines that were laid
down by FDR's planners back in during
the Second World War the United States
cannot tolerate any exercise of
sovereign
d that interferes with its global
designs and the United States and Europe
are of course engaged in punishing Iran
for its threat to stability and trying
to get it to become a more civilized
country but it's useful to recall how
isolated the US and Europe or the
non-aligned countries which is most of
the world they have for years been
vigorously supporting Iran's right to
enrich uranium within the region as I
mentioned the irrelevant public even
strongly favors Iranian nuclear weapons
the major regional power turkey voted
against the latest US sanctions motion
in the Security Council along with
Brazil which is the most admired country
the south is polls showed the turkeys
disobedience that led to sharp Center at
that point but not for the first time
turkey was bitterly condemned in 2003
when the government had committed a
major crime it followed the will of
ninety-five percent of the population
and refused to take part in the US
british invasion of iraq and that
demonstrated its very weak grasp of
democracy which led to sanctions on the
sharp century same today after the 2010
Security Council misdeed turkey was
warned by Obama's top diplomat on
European affairs Philip Gordon that it
must demonstrate its commitment to
partnership with the West follow orders
in other words a scholar with the
Council on Foreign Relations asked how
do we keep the Turks in their Lane their
departing something wrong in their Lane
means following orders like good
Democrats our style Democrats
Brazil's Lula it was admonished in a New
York Times headline he was warned that
his effort with Turkey to provide a
solution to the uranium enrichment issue
outside the framework of us power is a
spot on the Brazilian leaders legacy and
brief do what we say that's your
function it's kind of interesting
sidelight to all of this which has been
effectively suppressed the Iran Turkey
Brazil deal had been approved in advance
by President Obama presumably on the
assumption that it would fail and that
would provide an ideological weapon
against Iran that was revealed by the
British Foreign Office which released
the letter of support for ad after
Brazil was century when the effort
succeeded approval quickly turned the
century and Washington rammed through a
Security Council resolution which was so
weak the China readily signed and is now
chastised for living up to the letter of
the resolution but not following
Washington's unilateral directives which
go far beyond it that's the current
issue of Foreign Affairs the main
establishment Foreign Affairs Journal
well while the US can tolerate Turkish
disobedience though with dismay a China
is harder to ignore so the Press New
York Times warns that China's investors
and traders are now filling a vacuum in
Iran as businesses from many other
nations especially in Europe pull out in
fear of the United States and in
particular it's expanding its dominant
role in Iran's energy industries all of
this is quite in accord with the UN
resolutions but inconsistent with the
more extreme us demands they which have
no legal authorization other than what's
granted by
power the its attention to watch the
Washington reactions reacting with a
touch of desperation so the State
Department warned China that if it wants
to be accepted in the international
community that's incidentally another
technical term that refers to the US and
whoever happens to agree with it at the
moment if China wants to be accepted in
the international community it must not
skirt skirt and evade international
responsibilities which are clear namely
follow us orders China unlikely to be
impressed I suspect this led to some
amusement than the Chinese Foreign
Office's there's also a lot of concern
about the growing Chinese military
threat had a gun study that recently
came out warned that China's military
budget is now approaching one-fifth of
what the Pentagon spends to operate and
carry out the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan it's of course a small
fraction of the US military budget
China's expansion of military forces
points out might deny the ability of
American warships to operate in
international waters off its coast off
its coast China's Coast that's yet to be
I haven't come across a proposal that
that the u.s. might eliminate military
forces that would deny the ability of
Chinese warships to operate in the
Caribbean of course the fundamental last
imagery China's lack of understanding of
the rules of international civility is
illustrated further by its objections to
us plans to send the advanced aircraft
carrier George Washington to take part
in joint naval operations a few miles
off China's coast apparently allegedly
with capacity to strike
page beijing with nuclear weapons in
contrast the u.s. understands that such
operations are undertaken to defend
stability and US security and this is
discussed in the strategic analysis
literature let's pointed out that this
is what what they call a classic
security dilemma each side sees vital
interests take off the coast of China
the liberal New Republic expresses its
concern about the hardliners who now run
China's foreign policy and the most
severe charge is that China sent ten
warships through international waters
just off the Japanese island of Okinawa
while Chinese naval helicopters flew
dangerously close to Japanese ships and
that is indeed a provocation unlike the
fact unmentioned that Washington has
converted the island into a major US
military base in defiance of vehement
protests by the people of Okinawa who
are as irrelevant as the people of the
Arab world that's not a provocation by
the standard principle that we own the
world well putting aside deep-seated
imperial doctrine there's good reason
for China's neighbors to be concerned
about its growing military and
commercial power and although Arab
public opinion supports a an Iranian
nuclear weapons program I don't think we
should do so actually the foreign policy
literature is full of proposals as to
how to counter the threat of an Iranian
nuclear program one obvious way to do so
is not discussed namely work to
establish a nuclear weapons free zone in
the region that issue is arisen
repeatedly it arose again at the
non-proliferation treaty review
conference last May
of Egypt which was chair of the non line
countries in their name it proposed that
the conference call for negotiations on
a Middle East nuclear weapons-free zone
as indeed had been agreed by the West
including the US at the 1995 review
conference nothing had been done
actually international support for this
is so overwhelming that President Obama
was compelled to agree formally while
insisting that this is not the right
time and insisting that Israel be
exempted and of course the US which is
self exempted from international
obligations as already mentioned so the
Washington informed the conference that
it's got nice idea but not now is to
wait for a comprehensive peace
settlement and furthermore no proposal
can call for Israel's nuclear programs
to be placed under the auspices of the
International Atomic Energy Agency or
fan of cough or can call for release of
information about Israeli nuclear
facilities activities other than these
conditions it's a fine idea it's rarely
noted that the United States and Britain
I have a very special responsibility to
work to establish a nuclear weapons-free
zone in the Middle East when the US and
Britain had tried to concoct a thin
legal cover for the invasion of Iraq
they appealed to a Security Council
resolution resolution 687 in 1991 which
called under acted terminate its
development of weapons of mass
destruction well we can put aside the
claim but the resolution does committed
signers the US Britain to work to
establish a nuclear weapons-free zone in
the Middle East so the US and Britain
have a special unique responsibility for
this parenthetically parenthetically we
can add that US insistence on
maintaining nuclear
he's in Jaggu Garcia undermines another
nuclear weapons-free zone the African
one they regard that as part of Africa
Diego Garcia is you should know is a
particularly important case Britain
obediently followed orders and expelled
the population from the island so that
the United States could set up a major
military base which is used in fact used
for bombing the Middle East and Central
Asia it's been expanded under Obama to
accommodate nuclear submarines and also
deep penetration bombs aimed at Iran
that's a program that languished under
Bush but was taken up with enthusiasm as
soon as Obama took office and has been
considerably accelerated well well grand
area doctrine still prevails the
capacity to implement it has declined
the peak of us power was after World War
Two and when I as I said the US had
literally half the world's wealth that
naturally declined other industrial
countries reconstructed from the
devastation of the war decolonization
took it's rather agonizing course by the
early 1970s that your share of global
wealth had declined to about twenty-five
percent that's still huge but not half
the industrial world had become what was
called tri-polar us-based North America
Europe East Asia then japan-based there
was also a very sharp change in the US
economy in the 1970s the namely towards
financialization and export of
production no time to go into the
details but they're very significant
what happened is that a variety of
factors converged to create a vicious
cycle of radical concentration of wealth
that mostly in a top fraction of 1% of
the population
small huge concentration that means
mostly CEOs hedge fund managers and so
on that's the real source of the
tremendous inequality in the United
States it's like a tenth of a percent of
the population has enormous impact on
this that carries with it concentration
of political power and that in turn
leads to development of state policies
to increase the concentration includes
fiscal policies tax policies designed to
that in the rules of corporate
governance deregulation a lot more
meanwhile the same years the cost of
elections skyrocketed and that has an
effect it drives both political parties
and much deeper into the pockets of
concentrated capital it's increasingly
financial capital the Republicans for
them it's reflexive the Democrats who
are by now what used to be called
moderate Republicans they're not far
behind well while wealth and power
political power a very narrowly
concentrated thanks to the vicious cycle
for most people a real incomes have
stagnated for about 30 years they've
been getting by but with a sharply
increased work hours way beyond Europe
no debt and asset inflation which is
regularly destroyed by the crisis that
began as soon as the regulatory
apparatus was dismantled there weren't
any as long as the New Deal regular
regulatory opposite apparatus remained
in force through the 50s and 60s and
that's extremely serious well none of
this is problematic for the super
wealthy in fact they benefit from a
government insurance policy which has
the name too big to fail and that's a
very important means the banks and the
investment firms which make virtually no
contribution to the actual economy as
far as anyone though
bigsby finally beginning to be studied
by economists and looked at it before
but the banks and the investment firms
can make very risky transactions make a
risky transaction you get rich rewards
the system is going to crash inevitably
but when it crashes they can run to the
nanny state clutching their copies of
Hayek and Milton Friedman and the
taxpayer will happily bail them out
that's been the regular process since
the Reagan years and each crisis is more
extreme than the last for the public
that is and the coming crisis which is
almost inevitable probably still worse
real unemployment in the United States
is literally at the level of the
depression for much of the population
meanwhile Goldman Sachs which is one of
the main architects of the current
crisis is richer than ever just a couple
of weeks ago it quietly announced 17 and
a half billion dollars in compensation
for last year CEO Lloyd Blankfein it
gets 12 and a half million dollars bonus
and his base salary was triple I should
say that he tripled his base salary
because the rules of corporate
governments by the government have been
designed so that CEOs can pick the
panels that set their salaries with
obvious consequences well same things
happening in England just I've been here
a couple days every day's front page
describes another comparable scandal
well it actually wouldn't do to focus
attention on such things as these and
accordingly the propaganda system has to
blame others in the past several months
has been an interesting propaganda
campaign blaming public sector workers
there are fat salaries exhorbitant
pensions and so on all total fantasy
that's on the model of the Reagan I
imagery of some of your old enough to
recall of black mothers being driven in
there
chauffeured limousines to welfare
officers typically checks and so on in a
culture where lying is honored you can
get away with this kind of thing and it
has its effects and there are other
models which I need not mention not very
pleasant ones the conclusion is we all
have to tighten our belts not all
exactly some exceptions teachers are a
particularly good talk target and
they're the ones being targeted now
that's part of a deliberate effort which
i think is going on here to to destroy
the public education system means from
kindergarten right through the
universities by privatization in one
form or another that's again fine for
the wealthy it's a disaster for the
population and it's also a disaster for
the long-term health of the economy but
that's what's called an externality and
economic theory it's something that's
put to the side and decision-making as
long as insofar as market principles
prevail well elections have become in
the United States almost a complete
charade and other countries are sort of
following a couple of decades behind the
US by now that completely run by the
public relations industry after his 2008
victory Obama won an award from the
advertising industry for the best
marketing campaign of the year they
understood what was going on you know no
hope and change in the business press
the Financial Times executives were you
for it they described that they had been
marketing candidates like toothpaste
ever since Reagan and this was the
greatest success they'd ever had said it
would change the style and corporate
boardrooms and so on the 2012 election
is expected to cost 12 billion dollars
that's mostly corporate funding of
course no other source and it's not
surprising that Obama right now is
selecting business leaders for top
positions no other way to get them
the public is very angry and frustrated
but as long as the mawashi our principal
prevails it doesn't matter well I've
barely skimmed the surface of these
critical issues but I don't want to end
without at least mentioning another
externality that's dismissed in market
systems that's the fate of the species
that's an externality as far as
decisions are concerned systema the
financial system is plagued well
understood by what's called systemic
risk namely it's going to crash if it
works the way I described and systemic
risk is problem but it can be remedied
it can be remedied by the taxpayer but
nobody's going to come to the rescue if
the environment is destroyed that it
must be destroyed is virtually an
institutional imperative it's worth
bearing that in mind business leaders in
the United States are conducting openly
announcing that they're conducting the
massive propaganda campaigns to convince
the public that anthropogenic global
warming is a liberal hoax the that's
having an effect you can see it in polls
the executives who are running these
campaigns know perfectly well that it's
not a hoax very grave but they have no
option of following that understanding
in their institutional role they must
ignore that externality and act to
maximize profit and market share if one
of them decides not to do it he's out
and somebody else's dinner does do it
these are properties of the institutions
not the individuals and this
particularly vicious cycle could well
turn out to be lethal just to see how
grave the danger is you should have a
look at the new Congress in the United
States which is propelled into power by
business funding and propaganda almost
all of them are climate deniers they've
already begun beyond to
cut funding for measures that might
mitigate environmental catastrophe and
that's likely all disappeared we're
still some of them are true believers so
