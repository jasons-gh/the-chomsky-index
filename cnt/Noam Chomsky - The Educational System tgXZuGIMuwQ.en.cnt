I'm wondering how you see the role of
our educational system what it's doing
right now what forces are driving it and
what constraints are on it and how
should it operate
well I quoted the trilateral commission
view of the educational system namely
it's a system of indoctrination of the
young and I think that's correct it's a
system of indoctrination of the young
that was the way the liberal elites
regarded and they're more or less
accurate so the educational system is
supposed to train people to be obedient
conformist not think too much the witch
told stay passive don't cause any crises
a democracy don't raise any questions
and so on that's basically what the what
the system is about even the fact that
the system has a lot of stupidity in it
I think has a function you know it means
that people are filtered out for
obedience if you can guarantee lots of
stupidity in the educational system you
know like stupid assignments and things
like that you know that the only people
who make it through are people like me
and like most of you I guess who are
willing to do it no matter how stupid it
is because we'll we want to go to the
next step you know so you may know that
this assignment is idiotic and the guy
up there couldn't think his way out of a
paper bag but you'll do it anyway
because that's the way you get to the
next class and you want to make it and
so on and so forth well there are people
who don't do that you know there are
people who say I'm not going to do it
it's too ridiculous
you know those people are called
behavioral problems or something like
that they end up in the principal's
office or in the streets or selling
drugs or whatever and all of this is a
technique for selection for obedience
and I have I don't how to prove this but
I have a feeling that when you go to the
elite universities you find more
obedience and conformity probably
because you're getting the students who
were better able to do it well all of
that is functional that's the way it
works but it and it works right through
graduate school I mean if you Derek by
the time you get to graduate school it's
already a little more varied because
some real contradiction
developing the system the problem is
that you can't have progress this way
you know now especially in the sciences
and engineering that's a problem because
the corporation's need science and
engineering you know if you don't have
innovation you're really in trouble so
they have to encourage creativity and
independence because you can't get
anywhere if you just copy what somebody
told you you have to be challenging
things all the time challenging
everything you know thinking new
thoughts and so on and there you got a
real contradiction it's hard to train
people to be creative and challenging
and so on and yet to ensure that
somewhere else in their lives they're
conformist and obedient and never think
so you have problems that's a serious
problem in Japan dentally we think if
Japan has this tremendous superpower but
that's very misleading Japan for example
is very poor in science for example and
they're aware of it and part of the
reason is it's such as part of it it's
part of the same thing that makes them
good workers obedient workers it's a
very obedient society very differential
and conformist Society and one effect of
that is that you you know there are real
constraints against independent fries
and thinking and you see it in the
sciences very clearly the but it's a
problem here too so there are those
contradictions when you get to graduate
school they're beginning to show up they
show up much less in the ideological
subjects because there it doesn't matter
so much if people have you know there
isn't profits aren't made by historians
having original ideas about the French
Revolution so they can have conventional
ideas and that means that the the
pressure to try to support innovation
and freedom is much less and the
professor the pressures for conformity
on the other hand are much greater
because in the ideological subjects it
begins to be dangerous if people think
the wrong thoughts it's not so dangerous
if they have new ideas about physics
so you but nevertheless you know there's
you begin to get a little flux in the
system by the time you get to graduate
school and even at lower levels you find
it I mean there's you know there are
teachers who do stimulate thought and
sometimes they get away with it and all
the way through
you know if people are learning things
you just you just can't control you
can't make them just regurgitate what
they heard now there's a lot of pressure
to turn the schools into the Marine
Corps and there's a lot of support for
it
for example there's this bestseller last
couple of years by Alan bloom that was
all over the supermarkets closing of the
American mind yeah whichever you know
huge bestseller supermarket racks which
is where I read it things like that well
you take a look at what he's saying and
there was plenty you know a lot of
enthusiastic accolades for it and so on
he was saying that a couple of smart
guys will decide what the great thoughts
are and every student will memorize them
and that's education okay well you know
I mean that's a way to turn people into
pure automata I mean even if they happen
to pick the great thoughts there is no
way less likely to get anybody to think
about those thoughts than to make that
the curriculum that finishes them off no
but and I think that's the purpose
really I mean the purpose is just to
impose Authority you know here's the
great thoughts almost other stuff is
rubbish just learn those in your okay
I'll pick them you memorize them that's
basically the line
none of course that's that's the
opposite of Education that's the way you
study Talmud or something like that but
it's very popular and I think it
reflects the same concern over the
crisis of democracy that Galan was as
Blum himself was extremely the incident
that really got to him was a case in
Cornell where he was a professor where
some black students took over one of the
administer one of the buildings and he
was he said that's just like the not you
know a fact of the Nazis it's all
business about the Nazis and so on and
so forth well you take a look at what
happened and that isn't tell you what he
thought the and he says the faculty
capitulated you know just like Heidegger
capitulated to the Nazis and so on what
actually happened if you look back is
that there were real grievances
undoubtedly their students shouldn't
have done what they did
go into the building with guns and so on
but it was settled very amicably it was
settled amicably nobody was killed the
grievances were to some extent dealt
with and the net result was better than
it was before but he didn't tell you
what he thought they should have done
but it's sort of implicit I mean I guess
they should have bombed the place or
something like that but that's what
really set him off and in general what
set many people off was the you know the
the 60s are now described in the
literature as if it was a time when
students were running around burning
libraries and you know destroying the
foundations of civilization and so on
what was actually going on is they were
asking questions you know they were
raising questions they were looking into
things that people hadn't looked into
before they were not just obedient and
from the point of view of a lot of the
faculty that's equivalent to burning the
buildings they can't even that small
distinction you can't make that and this
pressure to turn the schools back to the
days when you didn't have to worry about
those things like disobedient students
asking questions about things that you
didn't tell them to think about
