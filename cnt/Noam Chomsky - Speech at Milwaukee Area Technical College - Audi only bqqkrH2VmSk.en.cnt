a series of topics have been suggested
to me they cover about they're all
interesting and important and cover
about anything when can think of easily
enough for many many talks and
discussions time is pretty limited than
since my wife knows I talk too much she
actually got me a pocket watch to try to
shut me up so I'll try to keep the
allotted time which means I'll only
touch on a few things i'll pick a few
that seemed to me of particular
relevance of significance but don't feel
bound by that for the discussion period
afterwards raised questions as you feel
fit well one issue that surely of
significance is the expectations of the
most powerful sectors so let's start
with that so take say the president
speaking of the what he calls the war on
terror actually before I go on I should
say that he's using the word terror in a
kind of a technical sense not in accord
with official definitions in the u.s.
code and Army manuals and so on he's
referring to a special category of
terror namely the kind of terror that
they carry out against us not the terror
that we carry out against them which is
typically what's traitor
that's a convention is not inventing it
that's a convention which is
unchallengeable you can look at the
massive literature on this and see it I
said I'll keep to it but not without
noting some rather serious objections of
course it's totally disgraceful and the
pure moral cowardice but it is the
convention so when I say terror I mean
that subcategory well speaking of the
so-called war on terror the president
says there's no telling how many wars it
will take to secure freedom in the
homeland meaning freedom from terror and
that comment is quite correct it's fair
the threats are limitless they're
everywhere they're at home the anthrax
attack illustrated that many experts
considered it much more ominous even
than 911 it's located been traced back
to a federal laboratory in the United
States so if you want to fight words
there plenty of places to bomb
furthermore all of this has been known
for a long time it's been known for a
long time that with contemporary
technology the rich and the powerful
have lost their monopoly of large scale
violence they still maintain an enormous
preponderance but it's no longer a
monopoly so a couple of years before
nine eleven technical material was
circulating about this one technical
paper pointed out that made an
assessment the risk assessment and
assessed that a well-planned effort to
smuggle weapons of mass destruction
meaning nuclear weapons into the United
States would have a ninety percent
probability of success far higher than a
missile attack with or without
missile defense even if it worked that's
sometimes called America's Achilles heel
that's the title of a collection of
technical essays by specialists about
four years ago published by MIT press
giving a laundry list some guidebook to
terrorists on various kinds of
horrifying atrocities that they could
carry out without much trouble and
that's been obvious certainly since 1993
when radical Islamist groups connected
to those may be part of those organized
and trained and armed by the CIA and its
associates in the 1980s came very close
to blowing up the world trade center
with very with more ambitious plans FBI
building the UN tunnels under New York
happens they didn't make it but building
engineers at the time pointed out that
with a little better planning they might
have killed tens of thousands of people
since then it's surely has been evident
to anyone with eyes open let alone the
technical literature that things like
this are very likely to happen you can't
predict when and where but something but
the fact that an attack of the
anticipated kind was successful on
September 11th in fact horrifyingly so
actually I think about it it doesn't
actually change the assessment of risk
very much maybe at all and the risk is
quite serious and it's known it's also
known that there are ways to increase
the risk substantially and that there
are ways to reduce it and those ways are
known to so for example if you're
interested in increasing the risk the
CIA goes gave some advice a couple of
weeks ago they pointed out that one way
to increase the risk of terror is to
attack Iraq they concluded that it's
very unlikely that Iraq is now
associated with any of the Islamic
terrorist groups but that if Iraq is
attacked it will very likely spawn a new
generation of terrorists bent on revenge
and it also may set off terrorist acts
they're already planned a perhaps plan
does a deterrent or as revenge it's been
discussed as by very mainstream sober
respected scholars in the field of
international relations and related
areas they've been pointing out for some
time that US adventurism is driving
potential targets to develop weapons of
mass destruction because that's the only
way to deter us violence I happen to be
quoting Kenneth waltz one of the most
distinguished of them but there are many
others and you read that in the
mainstream establishment publication on
the same store of terrorism for
potential targets of us violence there
aren't many deterrence available and one
of the few is terror one of the few
measures of deterrence that's available
against a state that is widely regarded
as a menace to itself and to mankind as
it pursues unilateral world domination
through absolute military superiority
under a radical nationalist leadership
which regards world opinion with
contempt as you can see i'm quoting in
this case i'm quoting from a senior
associate of the Carnegie Endowment for
international peace and until given
writing in a leading British Journal
London Review and even the national
press in the United States which tends
to be highly supportive of power
recognizes and quoting again that the
world is more concerned about the
unbridled use of American power than it
is about the threat posed by Saddam
Hussein
to be a lead story in the press national
press a couple days ago rather
significantly this is true of the
regional states the states right around
Iraq they're afraid or right but they're
afraid of the United States not upset on
the scene they despise said I'm insane
but they know that there's not much he
can do on the other hand there's plenty
that the u.s. can do and it worries them
that's even true of quate and Iran to
countries that were invaded brutally by
Saddam Hussein at a time when he was a
favored us Li that is an ally of the
people who are now in power or mostly
from that administration so just in
brief the threat of this category of
terrorism is serious and there are ways
to increase it and those ways in fact
are being pursued right now with very
fierce dedication it's not of course
that Rumsfeld and Powell and the rest of
them want to encourage terrorism but
rather they judge it to be insignificant
in comparison with more serious goals
and that merits some thought I'll come
back to it well there are also ways to
reduce terrorism they're known to even
aside from the most obvious way to
reduce terrorism and that's to stop
participating in it but I can't talk
about that because that violates the
convention so put that aside so keeping
to the convention one way to reduce
terrorism which is well known as careful
police work and that's successful it was
very successful recently in Germany
primarily much more than anywhere else
Germany recently broke up a major
al-qaeda cell through police's
investigation in contrast bombing
Afghanistan apparently had little effect
on terrorism may actually have increased
the threat according to US intelligence
reported a couple of months ago in the
New York Times and I noticed in this
morning's national press as well well
that's not a great surprise actually the
role of Afghanistan and terrorism
including 911 is still pretty obscure
how obscure was pointed out by the head
of the FBI in June Robert Miller when he
was testifying before the Senate
investigating committee and he informed
them this is eight months after the
bombing Afghanistan he informed them
that the FBI now believes believes
that's his word the FBI now believes
that the plot may have been hatched in
Afghanistan but was planned and
implemented and financed in in Germany
and the United Arab Republic Emirates
well that's what's now believed so it
isn't too surprising if bombing
Afghanistan didn't have much effect and
may actually have increased the threat
as US intelligence now concludes so it
was the purpose why do it in that case
well here's one possibility from
discussed by a reputable source abdul
haq is one of the most highly respected
of the afghan leaders who opposed and
fought the Taliban highly respected in
the United States incidentally and also
by the new Parts I government and like
quite a lot of other Afghan opponents of
the Taliban he was bitterly opposed to
the bombing and condemned
and called on the United States to end
it his argument was that the bombing was
parked from destroying the country was
undermining efforts of his and others to
overthrow the hated Taliban regime from
within and he went on to give his
judgment as to why the US was doing it
he said the United States is trying to
show its muscle score of victory and
scare everyone in the world well if
that's a correct analysis it was
successful at least than that well
putting such analyses to the side one
way to reduce terror is known a careful
police work not just in this case
another way to reduce terrorists pace an
attention to the people who have the
most experience in the matter so it take
for example Israel has plenty of
experience there's the security general
security services the secret police that
runs the occupied territories Shabak the
head of the Shabak recently retired Army
I alone pointed out very recently that
those who want victory against terror
want an unending war unless they are
willing to address underlying grievances
that's correct and Bush planners
understand it very well without hearing
it from him but they don't want to
address the underlying grievances in
contrast and on ending war even if with
more terror is acceptable and in fact
even more than acceptable it's even
necessary essential for I'm quoting
again for radical nationalists who have
adopted the classic modern strategy of
an endangered right-wing oligarchy which
is to divert mass discontent into
nationalism through fears of external
enemies that they conjure up it's the
same senior associate of the Carnegie
Endowment for international peace and is
one of the reasons why the world the
arch part of it regards the United
States as a menace to itself and to
mankind as it continues on this project
and there's really no secret about it
see it all around you it's a it's been a
very effective tactic in the current
elections it's managed to terrify the
public and overlooking what the
government is doing to them and for the
voting voting fear for somebody will
protect them from imagined enemies and
it's going to be even more important for
the next presidential campaign next year
and takes a karl rove Bush's main
political advisor I mean the last thing
he wants next year last thing is for
people to be paying attention to you
know their jobs and their pensions and
health care and social security and
destruction of an environment in which
their children might survive or the
extraordinary concentration of wealth
that's being fostered with the real
dedication by the extremist radical
nationalists in charge that's that would
be a disaster rather what he wants is
for the population to be singing praises
to the heroic leader who has
miraculously rescued them from a you
know unimaginably powerful foe colossal
power like some kind of Martian and by
then we'll be off on some other grand
adventure I mean any political leader
with any sense at all understands that
when you're carrying out a an assault
against the general population and
seeking to control the world by
unilateral military force all of this in
furthermore is just second nature to the
people now in power to the bush planners
remember they're mostly recycled raiga
nights that come from the reagan-bush
administration
20 years ago and they're following
pretty much the same routine if you look
at it including the war on terror which
was not declared on September 11th but
it was declared 20 years earlier by the
same people with the same rhetoric and
very much many of the same people in
leading positions you know what happened
then at least we should one example was
just given Archbishop Romero the decade
of the 1980s that horrifying decade
opened with his assassination had become
a voice for the voiceless as he was
called by his associates he was
assassinated by elite units closely
connected but two and supported by the
United States and I just set off a
decade of horror in Central America and
elsewhere the Middle East Africa all
under the huge amount of horrifying
international terrorism and destruction
all under the pretext of a war on terror
by the same people so you want to have I
mean elementary sanity dictates that we
want to learn about what's going on now
we would look at what happened then but
that top topic is also under a ban like
our terrorism generally you can check
the vast literature on the war on terror
since it was Rida cleared by the same
people on September 11th and you can
easily determine how much this highly
relevant very recent history has been
discussed well with that aside but
clearly that's what that all of this is
us as I say second nature to these guys
they did the same thing 20 years ago you
may well you're too young to recall but
you know your parents do that 20 years
ago there was another brave cowboy
leader in the White House he was
cringing in fear in the white house
surrounded by tanks to protect him from
Libyan hit men who were roaming the
streets of Washington
and a few years later he was wailing
about how Qaddafi wants to expel America
from the world no less and warning that
the Nicaraguan army is only two days
marching time from Texas so we'd have to
huddle in fear and they're planning to
carry out to conquer the hemisphere
following a script from mine comp that's
George Shultz he was the administration
moderate the Colin Powell of the day and
national emergency was called in the
United States because of the threat to
our security in existence posed by the
government of Nicaragua so if you think
we're in trouble now with Saddam Hussein
remember it's been a lot worse than the
recent past and it went on and on
Hispanic narco-traffickers you know
almost anything you can think of at that
time frightened Americans were an object
of considerable wonder in the world and
not ridicule sometimes and the
government inspired plenty of fear a
huge anti-nuclear movement developed in
Europe partly in fear of Reaganite
fanaticism and that's understandable and
now that the same people are back again
not without any deterrent there's even
greater fear so it's not surprising that
much of the world is regards the US as a
menace to itself and to mankind well
let's go back to nor is it surprising
that they're following the same policies
that only makes sense so back to ami
Ayalon and how to reduce terror if we're
interested namely address the underlying
grievances he of course was speaking of
Israel Palestine where the only solution
of the problem of terror is to offer an
honorable solution to Palestinians
respecting their right of
self-determination oh that
ah
that happens to be the conclusion of the
head of the Israeli secret police that
runs the territories but I was quoting
somebody else namely one of his
predecessors oshawott Huckabee who was
the head of Israeli military
intelligence and a leading Arabist and
that was 20 years ago that was after
another shocking outburst of army and
settler violence and the occupied
territories and there in mind that that
was at a time when Israel retained its
immunity from any retaliation from
within the territories to the quite
brutal and harsh practices it was
conducting there and also to its
compromise stealing land and resources
all of this is thanks to crucial us
support all the way through as it is
today otherwise it's totally impossible
that immunity from retaliation lasted
until quite recently so therefore the
violence and oppression and atrocities
were considered quite unproblematic by a
leet American opinion that brings us
back to the definition of terror it's
only what they do to us it's not what
they do that we do them which is
typically far worse just for reasons of
the amount of force available but it's
unproblematic for those who give
patriotism a bad name it terrorism is
often called a weapon of the weak this
is not true like most weapons it's a
weapon of the strong primarily except
they don't call it terror they call it
counter terror or something like that
well the observations of I alone and
harcavy they generalize and quite
obvious ways and in serious scholarship
there's just no question about it it's
recognized quoting now that unless the
social political and economic conditions
that spawned al-qaeda and other
associated groups are
dressed the United States and its allies
will continue to be targeted by
terrorists same point want to reduce
terrorism address the underlying
grievances it's true whether it's the
IRA or radical Islamists whoever you
like it's a truism it's only
intellectuals who are posturing before
the galleries who sink to such mindless
absurdities as the claim that
explanation is justification or who
claim that whatever is going on it's all
there for we don't play any role by
definition because we're so good or even
magnificent that's the common stance of
the powerful right through the ages
nothing new here we're just replaying
the same ugly and disgraceful record in
fact you have to insist on this so
strongly that even the government record
the internal US government record at the
very highest levels has to be rigorously
suppressed and is you can check again so
take George Bush's pathetic question why
do they hate us answer because we're so
good but the question was the question
he's not the first person who have asked
the question and anyone who wants to
understand these issues should know that
the question was asked a long ago 45
years before by President and Eisenhower
in 1958 this is an internal discussion
but it's now it's been public for years
I read about it 10 years ago when it was
declassified in 1958 Eisenhower
discussed with his staff what he called
the campaign of hatred against us by the
people in the Arab world and the staff
the National Security Council highest
planning body gave a gave the reasons
the reasons is a recognition
in that region that the United States
supports brutal and repressive
governments and blocks democracy and
development and we do it because of our
interest in controlling the oil
resources of the region that continues
right into the present now we don't have
secret documents we have public just you
know investigations and they lead the
same results I exacerbated by particular
policies that all of this incidentally
has Eppley nothing to do with hating
America these are mostly people who like
Americans who greatly admire American
freedom and democracy who participate in
you know these are managers of
multinational corporations no problem
with what's called globalization or any
of that stuff what they hate is US
government policies that block democracy
and development and support brutal and
repressive regimes in order to ensure
control over the resources of the region
and that goes on right up to the present
is a wave of anger and Pakistan for
example over us support for a harsh
military regime which is clearly
undermining democracy it seems true in
Central Asia and so over the Egypt all
over the place you have to be blind not
to see it perfectly blind purposely
blind because it's not hidden the
resources of the region are not a joke
either back in the 1940s in 1945 the
State Department described the resources
of the Persian Gulf as a stupendous
source of strategic power and the
greatest one of the greatest material
prizes in world history it's not a small
thing the US was of course committed
immediately after the war to taking
control of that stupendous resource and
material prize and did so the problem is
not access it's important to understand
its control the material prize yields a
huge flow of wealth to the United States
and various ways and the strategic power
translates into an instrument of world
control now that's quite critical for
understanding us goals in Iraq as the
second largest oil reserves in the world
a second to Saudi Arabia access has
never been a problem and it isn't a
problem now it's control there's a lot
of misunderstanding about that and it's
important to think it through carefully
well let me return to the expectations
of the powerful luckily for us they tell
us about it so an important public
document produced about two years ago by
the two and a half almost three years
ago by the national intelligence council
that's the collection of the highest
intelligence agencies with along with
academic specialists and others they
have a publication called global trends
2015 so whether they expect for the next
15 years here's the main prediction what
they call globalization will continue on
course it's its evolution will be Rocky
with increasing financial volatility and
a widening economic divide okay just
think about that for a minute according
to theoretically globalization is
supposed to lead the convergence
integrated market with a single price
and wage but they're predicting the
opposite a widening economic divide that
means less globalization and the
technical sense but more in the
doctrinally preferred sense that is the
people who matter will do just fine and
the rest sort of not our department more
financial volatility means slower growth
harming mainly the poor actually that
lifts the veil on another aspect of
foreign policy rather striking feature
for the past 25 years or so what's
called neoliberal policy or sometimes
globalization it's been a company this
period by a marked deterioration in
standard economic measures right across
the board growth of the economy
productivity investment
even trade and stagnation for most of
the population but a huge concentration
of wealth that's sharply true in the
richest country in the world us but it's
pretty general for the countries that
follow the rules those who didn't made
up much better it's rather striking with
the countries that follow the rules most
rigorously like Latin America suffered
the most while those that ignored them
like East Asia managed to escape the
general decline well there's a lot more
to say about this including the
tremendous attack on democracy that all
this involves or seeing it right now in
Brazil but there's no time for that the
conclusion of the powerful is we should
extend and intensify the global policies
that have had these consequences how to
be giving rise to major popular
struggles throughout the world that's
some of the most important developments
going on now but again have to put it
aside well let's return to the
expectations what are going to be the
effects of the widening economic divide
here's the national intelligence council
as globalization proceeds deepening
economic stagnation will foster
political ethnic ideological and
religious extremism along with violence
much of it directed against the United
States so we're back to the so-called
war on terror and underlying grievances
which have to be addressed unless we
prefer to more terrorist atrocities and
and an unending war and has been trying
to point out that's an as a rational
choice for a radical nationalists
extremist leadership which has the plans
that it does well it's interesting that
the same assumptions are made by
military planners and just to indicate
how narrow the spectrum is take some
from clinton-era documents so there's
another public document actually
intended for the public came out in 1997
published by Clinton Space Command
called vision for 2020
expect to happen in 20 years they
predict a growing gap between the haves
and the have-nots the have-nots are
going to have to be controlled it's the
same same prediction as the national
intelligence council about the
consequences of deepening stagnation and
a widening economic divide and that's a
good part of the thinking behind the
vast expansion of US military power I'm
even before September 11 that completely
outweighed any possible combination of
adversaries or allies number 11th gave a
pretext for a sharp increase it's
completely unrelated to terrorism but as
closely related to global dominance and
to controlling the widened though the
extremists will follow from the
stagnation and the widening economic
divide visions document gives an
interesting history of this they point
out that in the past countries had to
develop armies for self-defense the
example that they use is the united
states where the army was necessary in
self-defense for the peaceful people who
were spreading across the continent and
taking over half of mexico and they had
to be defended from the indigenous
population who were they were expelling
and exterminating or those who were
irrationally trying to keep mexico
that's called self-defense and that's
why we needed armies then they point out
that navies were needed to protect
commercial interests and investments now
there's a new frontier space so we got a
militarized space to protect us business
interests and investments and of course
to control the growing number of
have-nots as deepening stagnation
fosters extremism and violence that's
the war on
which of course there'll be another
terrorist war the most ominous
development is the militarization of
space its wish point discussing again
not much time but it is extremely
dangerous it might might lead to total
devastation in fact just by unintended
accident it's not unlikely in fact and
again the world is very frightened there
is an outer space treaty 1967 which bans
military use of space in the last couple
of years the United Nations General
Assembly has been reaffirming the treaty
the reason is they know the u.s. intends
to violate it and that's approved
unanimously with two opposed the United
States and Israel which really one
opposed because Israel's become
basically a US military base in the same
same is true of the un disarmament
Commission meets in last couple of years
has been meeting last clinton years and
since trying to do the same thing but
can't get through us won't allow it in
fact just last week october 23rd the
united nations again the first committee
which is essentially the General
Assembly approved two resolutions one
was a resolution to ban weapons in space
a second was a resolution to reaffirm
the 1925 Geneva Convention that bans
chemical weapons once again two
countries opposed the US and Israel they
both abstain and a u.s. abstention is
amounts to a veto actually a double veto
for one thing the decision is vetoed and
secondly it's vetoed from the media and
from history and in fact everything I've
just described has been vetoed in the
second sense the what happened last week
there was no report as usual and it's
pretty serious banning weapons in outer
space and reaffirming a 1925 Convention
against chemical weapons highly timely
to take some discipline to suppress all
this but the point is that
editor's and commentators probably
understand without anybody telling them
it's just not a good idea to allow
citizens to know of plans that may bring
to an end biology's only experiment with
what's called higher intelligence well a
lot of this is disguised as missile
defense but defense as usual means
offense and everyone understands that US
military analysts agree with Chinese
military analysts that missile defense
quoting them is not simply a shield but
it's also a sword it's an enabler of
action missile defense will provide the
United States with absolute freedom in
using or threatening to use force in
international relations cementing us
hegemony and making Americans the
masters of the world actually I'm
quoting military analysts in the liberal
and conservative press they're not very
different that's the reason behind the
the reasoning behind the national
security strategy that was released
couple of weeks ago and that seriously
intensified the growing fears of the
United States throughout the world well
let's come to the Middle East which is
the focus of present concern what are
the expectations there the National
Intelligence Council predicts a rising
demand for energy which they say will
undermine the Kyoto protocols whether
people sign them or not and will lead to
increased global warrant a warrant by
warming one of the main arguments for a
war in Iraq as I'm sure you know is that
once the u.s. regains control it can
increase production lower prices
increase the rising demand and make sure
there's twice as many cars on Milwaukee
streets and escalate the destruction of
the environment it's another threat to
survival but it's entirely rational
within a
lunatic framework the
the National Intelligence Council of
course talks about the Persian Gulf they
say the Persian Gulf region that's Iraq
and Saudi Arabia and Iran and so on that
will see large increases in oil
production capacity and will rise in
importance to world energy markets so
the US must control it as it has since
World War two the they go on to say that
the u.s. itself will not rely on Middle
East oil it's going to rely on more
stable sources in the Atlantic Basin
West Africa Latin America and Canada and
that's nothing new after World War two
the United States did not rely on Middle
East oil in fact North America was the
leading producer until about nineteen
seventy it's been mostly Venezuela since
importing to the US but this never
influenced the commitment to control the
stupendous source of strategic power and
the greatest material prize in world
history or even such secondary prizes of
Central Asia the goal is control and not
access that's important the war in Iraq
which is planned and will come unless we
stop it I pretexts are offered they're
pretty hard to take seriously I can come
back to them if you like but there
certainly are reasons one reason is the
regaining control of the stupendous
source of strategic power and at least
this part of it and the material prize a
911 gave a pretext for that it's a
long-standing goal and domestic
political considerations the kind that I
mentioned they dictate the timing it's
got to be this winter can't wait another
year because it has nothing to do with
the mushroom cloud that Condoleezza Rice
talks about nobody sane believes in that
but it has more mundane reasons it has
to do with the fact that there's going
to be a presidential campaign Karl Rove
can figure it out the there is a
security concern significant one
security imperative
but it's not securing the population
from threat it has to do with securing a
domestic program a program of service to
very narrow and unusually corrupt
sectors of corporate power along with a
continuing assault a continuing assault
on most of the population which is very
serious and the pursuit of global
dominance based on absolute military
superiority that has to be secured for
another four years so a war against Iraq
makes sense by next year the next phase
will probably be underway maybe I ran
that war may have already started the
Israeli Air Force which is not small
small country but remember it's a US
military base which makes it a powerful
country their own assessment the IDF
Israeli army their analysts assess their
Air Force and Navy they couldn't say
that they are more powerful they're
larger and more technically advanced
than any NATO power about over ten
percent of them are now permanently
based in eastern Turkey where they are
flying over at the Iranian border
they're based in these huge US military
bases in eastern Turkey which are places
for nuclear armed planes and they're
thinking about the next war Iran directs
over the Egyptian press refers to what
they call an axis of evil they're
referring to the u.s. Israel and Turkey
that's not a it's not a bad usage I mean
unlike the one invented by Bush's speech
writers this is a real axis Iran and
Iraq have been at war for 20 years it's
not an axis that North Korea was tossed
in to make it look as though it's not a
war against Muslims but this is a real
axis
and there's this plenty of evil to go
around and they're at work Iran is a
likely next next target and there's it
much more far-reaching plans you can
read about them in u.s. scholarly
sources although the best place really
is the Israeli press it's generally
quite reliable and it's particularly
informative now because of very close
links between the high-level Bush
planners and the extreme right in Israel
I'm not referring to aerial Sarang but
the groups to the right of show run so
Richard Perle top planner and Douglas
faith another one five six years ago
they were writing position papers for
Benjamin Netanyahu who's to the right of
shoreham he's his right wing critic way
out on the extreme these plans are
available you can read about them
they're pretty frightening and they're
frightening even to US military planners
the serious ones recently were highly
sharply criticized by one of the best
known of them Anthony Cordesman who's a
strategic analyst at one of the most
prestigious of them who concentrates
primarily on the Middle East and he
warned the government not to be caught
up in the plant I'm quoting him in the
plans of sillier armchair strategists
and more vocally irresponsible
hardliners he's referring to Pearl and
Fife and others who were very close to
the center of power and quarters man
himself is about as hard line as you can
get within any sector that retains some
elements of sanity and this again Indyk
is another indication of why the world
is so deeply concerned about us power
and it's exercise well there's a lot
more to say about this but my wife's
watch tells me I should shut up so I'll
just end with the good news and there is
good news the good news is that we are
very highly privileged we're not in
position of people
like Archbishop Romero who are going to
be assassinated by the us-supported
State terrorists or were not like the
people in two of the country's I just
visited in the last few months turkey in
Colombia the scenes of some of the worst
atrocities of the horrible 1990s still
going on all thanks to massive us port
and military economic and doctrinal the
doctrinal support comes from silence so
you know read about it we just
contribute to the atrocities and there
are people there kind of like us in fact
very prominent people leading writers
artists priests and Columbia and
academics and human rights activists who
are constantly struggling very
courageously for things like freedom of
speech or for defense of people who are
millions of people who are being
subjected to vicious miserable
oppression and destruction thanks to us
and they face dangers they face
assassination like Archbishop Romero and
not a few others they or prison or and
torture and other pretty serious
consequences we don't we don't face any
of this we are uniquely privileged we
have the means to determine whether the
ominous tendencies that are frightening
the world will continue or whether
policy takes a different course a more
constructive course and the enormous
wealth and power that we have in our
hand will be used to build instead of to
destroy
