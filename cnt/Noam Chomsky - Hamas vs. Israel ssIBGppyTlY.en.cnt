you mentioned free elections in gaza and
it's so great that they have free
elections which i
am definitely behind but you also
mentioned how they elected hamas
so i looked up the hamas charter and i
just wanted to quote a few things and
then see your thoughts on those
so article 28 um muhammad is dead
he left his daughters behind israel by
virtue of it being jewish and
having a jewish population defies islam
and the muslims
let the eyes of the cowards not fall
asleep we can
agree that hamas charter is horrible but
now let's look at the hamas charter
the hamas charter was written by maybe
half a dozen people
in 1988 at a time at a moment of an
extreme israeli attack on gaza
it has no status they've repeated over
and over again that it
doesn't apply anymore and if you're
interested in charters why keep to that
take the governing party in israel they
could uh
it it grew out of here that's its uh
ideological center begins netanyahu
its position never changed is that
the land of israel that the entire land
of israel
belongs to the jews that includes
today's jordan
okay in fact the old slogan was both
sides of the jordan
that's ours and this is to they've never
changed that
uh so that's their charter did anybody
pay attention to it
so you've mentioned israel's faults many
times which i think we can all agree it
has
significant problems and as an activist
we want to
deal with israel's faults but who i
didn't hear
okay i think we can all agree that
israel has many faults
now israel has money yeah and that we
would like to
do something about that um what do you
envision us also doing about
palestinian faults and how as an
activist can we
um deal with what the palestinians have
been doing what hamas has been doing
and yeah what do you see with that what
i mean
hamas are not my friends i don't like
what they do
but they've been doing not much what
they've been doing is what i described
i didn't have time to go through the
pattern but i'll repeat it you can find
it
starting in november 2005
an agreement was reached between israel
and the palestinian authority then not
hamas
israel completely rejected it and
hamas lived up to it not a single rocket
then came the january election and
israel intensified its attack
with u.s support after that there are
repeated
attacks israeli attacks and ceasefires
agreements
every ceasefire agreement is
approximately like what i read
what happens is israel completely
dismisses and disregards it
and maintains the siege in violation of
the ceasefire
increases the violence hamas lives up to
it
and israel officially accepts that until
agrees to that until some escalation of
israeli violence
leads to a hamas reaction and then
another episode of mowing the lawn
that's been going on since november
2005.
hamas is not a nice organization they do
a lot of rotten things
that's for the palestinians to worry
about but it has
nothing to do with us if we were
supporting hamas
nothing zero if we were supporting hamas
it would be our problem but we're not
and what they do
is for palestinians to deal with what we
deal with is what we are doing
which is supporting massive criminal
operations
all over the region blocking peace
that's for us to be concerned about
those who are
supporting hamas can worry about hamas
