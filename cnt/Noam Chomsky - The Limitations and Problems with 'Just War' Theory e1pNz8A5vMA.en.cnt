please join me now in welcoming our
guest professor Noam Chomsky
Thanks I think a useful place to start
might be with a recent academic study by
an Oxford professor of traditions of war
which contrasts two leading paradigms in
the study of Just War what the author
calls the brodien and Republican
interpretations first Perrin a paradigm
traces back to hugo grotius famed 17th
century humanists who found that the
dominant framework of thinking on laws
of war within this paradigm the law of
war is an act of States and just war
proposals are means to humanize to
introduce humanity in warfare one
tradition the contrasting Republican
paradigm traces back to Rousseau and the
uprising against monarchy in feudalism
and the late 18th century looting the
American Revolution this paradigm blends
war with justice with liberty and
equality individual and community rights
whatever else may fall within our
concept of justice
well these positions are of course
idealizations the real world is more
complex
the formal implementation of efforts to
introduce humanity into warfare do not
simply disregard questions of justice
but they do put them to the margins
they're not central to the codification
of the principles of world order and
practice with single exception of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
which has a pretty tattered history well
despite real-world complexities the
differences between these two approaches
suggest war I think deserve attention in
considering both the issues that are
addressed and those that are ignored we
might ask whether that itself is just
there are at least three major sources
of insight
into the concepts of just war the first
is the scholarly literature the second
is the underlying notions of human
nature that underlie our moral judgment
and the third is the International
codifications so I'd like to say few
words about each of these topics I think
it may help to indicate in advance where
I'm heading in brief my own conclusions
are that the literature merits careful
attention but is ultimately not very
instructive about just war
secondly that the notions of human
nature should be at the heart of the
discussion
although serious inquiry into this is
still in its early stages and third that
the codifications
are seem to be sensible but actions in
the real world
all too often reinforce a famous maxim
of Tacitus that the strong do as they
can while the weak do as they must so
let's start with some remarks on some of
the current literature on Just War that
one of the most recent studies is
Michael Walters book arguing about war
which merits particular attention but
not only because of the high praise it's
received but also because Walter is
responsible for the recent revival of
just worth the earth the strength I
think the book reveals both the
strengths and the weaknesses of Just War
Theory the strengths are that many of
the conclusion seem plausible enough at
least to me but particularly those
conclusions that pretty much reiterate
standard codifications the weakness is
that despite the book's title arguing
about war it's very hard to find an
argument you might try that as an
experiment and more accurately well
arguments are sometimes detectable they
rely crucially on such premises as seems
to me entirely justified or I believe or
no doubt and there's almost no
effort to bring in relevant background
information and evidence
Walter gives to paradigm examples which
in which base
he simply asserts that the wars are just
in fact so obviously just that argument
is unnecessary the two examples are
Afghanistan and Kosovo
he describes the invasion of Afghanistan
as a triumph of Just War theory which
stands alongside the bombing of Serbia
in 1999 as a nun controversial case of
Just War no argument is felt to be
necessary although in either case it
doesn't take much effort to think of
possible evidence that might bear on the
pronouncement that these are triumphs of
Just War theory and these are
considerations that would certainly be
brought by brought up by just were
theorists if the responsibility for the
military actions lay elsewhere well for
lack of time I'll skip illustrations but
can come back to them if you'd like to
be clear I'm not asking whether the
bombings of Afghanistan and Serbia were
right or wrong maybe they were maybe
they weren't I'm asking a different
question namely what does Just War
theory have to say about it and I think
if you look closely you'll find yet that
the answer is that it has nothing to say
about we're left with assertions of the
authors that state violence was
justified uncontroversially so and any
consequences whether anticipated or not
are entirely no doubt the fault of the
official enemy well another reason and
also highly regarded inquiry into Just
War theory is by moral political
philosopher Jean Elka Elstein the
paradigm of Just War she writes is the
bombing of Afghanistan and she adds that
nearly everyone with the exception of
absolute pacifists and a few lunatics
agree that the bombing of Afghanistan
was clearly a Just War argument ended in
reality nearly everyone that
excludes substantial categories of
people of the majority of the world's
population for example even in Europe
far more so in Latin America and also
leading Afghans who had been fighting
the Taliban and including us favorites
and virtually all aid agencies working
there but what's relevant is that this
constitutes the sole argument to
establish that the war was just in fact
uncontroversially so in facts are
irrelevant and though for the argument
is needed while al schneid does provide
criteria for just war so we at least
have the rudiments of theory four
criteria or even fresh criterion the war
must be openly declared or otherwise
what otherwise authorized by a
legitimate Authority the second it must
begin with the right intentions third
forces justified if it protects the
innocent from certain harm as when a
country has certain knowledge that
genocide will commence on a certain date
the fourth it must be a last resort
after other possibilities for the
redress and defense of the values of
state have been explored well the first
two conditions are vacuous declaration
of war by an aggressor that confers no
support whatsoever for a claim of Just
War and even the worst criminals claim
right intentions the third and fourth
conditions sound unreasonable but they
have no relevance at all clearly to the
case of Afghanistan
so therefore else tons parrot paradigm
example collapses entirely under her own
criteria he had just one word on the
classic modern work of Michael Walters
adjust and unjust Wars which I believe
you've been reading my personal
judgement is that his conclusions are
generally very reasonable also pretty
much in accord with the conventional
reading of the United Nations Charter
about what
and here is that the conclusions just
about invariably rely crucially on the
ubiquitous phrase it seems to me and so
on and you might test so just as an
illustration tech witty regards as the
hardest question in his words that is
the British bombing of urban centers in
Germany up to the end of the war Walter
concludes that such bombing quoting him
after the immediate threat posed by
Hitler's early victories had passed was
entirely indefensible maybe so but if
you check you'll find there's no
argument apart from the statement that
the policy seems cruel well that it does
Decimus cruel to me at least about what
does Just War Theory have to say where
does it enter into the argument and why
are relevant facts disregarded that are
after all relevant facts well the
character the theory is revealed further
when we look at the examples that Walter
gives is about a half dozen examples
which are just listed no argument or
discussion to show the to show that Just
War theory applies leaving in his words
no doubt the examples are mostly
unconscious although one might we'll ask
why some of these examples are chosen
but not others and for example the
Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia is
given as a case where there is no doubt
but not given is the Israeli invasion of
Lebanon which I suppose had about a
hundred times as many casualties and
many more during the 22 years of
occupation of Lebanon of southern
Lebanon in defiance of Security Council
orders so maybe there's a reason maybe
there isn't but whatever it is it's not
given that's all
examples except one the last example of
a case where Just War theory applies
leaving no doubt is the Egyptian
challenged Israel in 1967 that's the
sole example
long period covered we're just were
theory allegedly demonstrates that a
preemptive strike was just beyond all
doubt
well maybe the selection of cases and
the conclusions are correct maybe
they're not but what's relevant here is
the Just War Theory plays little if any
role in the argument which reduces
pretty much to declarations of personal
preference well I won't go on that these
are to my knowledge fairly
representative selections from Lee the
most highly regarded literature and I
think it's fair to conclude we're
generally that we learn very little
about Just War from Just War theory
although we do learn something about the
prevailing intellectual moral climate in
which the theory is presented and
honored it's not turn to the second
source of potential insight a second
source of potential insight into just
war theory that is their intuitive moral
judgments well here we are turning to
what was traditionally called moral
philosophy I think it's more aptly
described as moral psychology in modern
terms after the divorce of science and
philosophy in the mid 19th century a
century before that David Hume had done
his classic work on what he called the
Springs and origins of human nature
human recognized that knowledge and
belief are grounded in what he called
the species of natural instincts part of
their inherent mental nature he
recognized also that something similar
must be true in the domain of moral
judgment his reason was that our moral
judgments are unbounded in scope
we are constantly applying them in
systematic ways to new circumstances in
a manner that's
legible to others hence they too must be
founded on general principles that are
part of our nature
although beyond what he called our
original instincts meaning the narrow
our instincts that we share with animals
well that insight which i think is
accurate should lead directly to efforts
to develop something like a grammar of
moral judgment it's an enterprise very
much like the inquiry into the
principles that are encoded somehow in
our brains that permit us to do what you
and you and I are now doing and more
broadly to produce and understand
linguistic expressions over an unbounded
range and use them in a way which is
appropriate to circumstances and
intelligible to others even though they
may be quite new in our own history or
unexperienced in fact all of history
well as was recognized a century before
Hume these principles must be universal
and grounded in our nature and the basis
for acquisition of any particular
language today we would say that the
principles of language and moral
judgment are a part of their genetic
endowment part of human biology in both
cases they're culturally specific and
universal aspect both the case of
internal faculties of language and moral
judgment these things can be studied
they're part of science in fact studied
in rather similar ways inquiry into the
moral faculty in these terms was
undertaken by the leading American moral
and political philosopher of late 20th
century John Rawls who relied explicitly
on the analogy of two linguistic
theories that were being developed in
the 1960s at the time that he was
writing his classic work theory of
justice overalls in fact put this aspect
of his work aside under severe critters
by moral philosophers turned to horror
issues for him now the criticisms were
reexamined and I think adequately
refuted in a doctoral dissertation a few
years ago by John McHale who is now a
law professor at Georgetown forthcoming
book of his based on the dissertation
develops this and also presents
empirical investigation of moral
judgments in puzzling thought
experiments that have been designed by
moral philosophers this experimental
work reveals that intuitions in these
quite puzzling cases are typically
instantaneous and reflexive in adults
and children with systemic changes
through early childhood development much
as in other aspects of development he
then goes on to develop a theoretical
explanation in terms of fixed principles
that can be regarded as a development of
Rawls theory of justice and the much
earlier work of Hume and other classical
writers on our natural instinct there's
another book soon to come out by Harvard
primatologist and cognitive scientist
mark Hauser carrying such enquiries
further includes comparative studies and
were general
ideas about what he calls the moral
organ analogous to the language organ
other sub components of the cognitive
systems that are a core part of our
biological nature well in recent years
these topics have become a lively field
of theoretical and empirical inquiry
the four many points of view
incidentally this is a study of
principles that underlie intuitive
conceptions of justice and rights and
their cultural variety their limited
cultural variety and their universal
properties that could someday provide
foundations for a more substantive
theory of Just War but it remains
largely the task for the future though
it's underway and interesting and
interesting ways well finally a couple
words on the complication of these
intuitive judgments in the past century
say I'll keep to the period after World
War two
although the earlier conventions have
very clear and significant contemporary
relevance Hague conventions of 1907 for
example can come back to that if you
like the post Second World War
codification of the laws of war that
consists primarily of the UN Charter the
Geneva Conventions and the Nuremberg
principles later adopted by the General
Assembly well as you know I'm sure the
Charter bars the threat or use of force
except in two instances if authorized by
the Security Council of the United
Nations or under Article 51 of the
Charter in self-defense against armed
attack until the Security Council acts
the phrase armed attack is
conventionally interpreted in terms of
Daniel Webster's principle which extends
armed attack to cases where his words
the necessity for action is urgent it's
instant overwhelming and leaving no
choice of means and no moment of
deliberation any other resort to force
is a war crime in fact the supreme
international crime encompassing all the
evil that follows in the words of the
Nuremberg Tribunal I was high level UN
panel
median issued its report in December
2004 included among others a former
national security adviser Brent
Scowcroft it concluded that article 51
needs neither extension or a restriction
of its long understood the scope it
should be neither rewritten nor
reinterpreted last September UN World
Summit reaffirmed quoting that the
relevant provisions of the Charter are
sufficient to address the full range of
threats to international peace and
security the summit and further endorsed
the responsibility to commit ourselves
to helping States build capacity to
protect their populations from genocide
war crimes ethnic cleansing and crimes
against humanity and to assisting those
which are under stress before crises and
conflicts breakout the summit granted no
new right of intervention to individual
states or regional alliances whether
under humanitarian or other professed
grounds and it established no
responsibility to protect contrary to it
was widely alleged in news reports and
commentary the high-level panel of
December 2004 had reached the same
conclusion in words that were
specifically directed at international
and intellectual opinion and state
practice in the West in recent years its
words were these for those impatient
with declaring article 51 to be
appropriate as formulated the answer
must be that in a world full of
perceived potential threats the risk to
the global order and the norm of
non-intervention on which it continues
to be based is simply too great for the
legality of unilateral preventive action
as distinct from collectively endorsed
action to be accepted allowing one to so
act is to allow all
allowing one to so act is to allow all
now here the panel is proposing the
principle of universality namely that we
apply to ourselves the same standards we
do to others if not more stringent ones
now that's perhaps the most elementary
of moral truisms and it's the foundation
of Just War theory if that theory is to
be taken at all seriously the principle
however is flatly rejected in the elite
intellectual moral and political culture
of the most powerful states and 'six
plis Utley rejected by official doctrine
that includes the expositors and
advocates of Just War theory also
includes a substantial legal literature
pretty easy to Doulton and illustrate
this plenty of material and print about
it well in this and you can draw some
conclusions from that in this connection
and by saying that it's worth
remembering some eloquent words on the
principle of universality foundation of
Just War theory in any serious moral
theory the comments by Justice Robert
Jackson who's the chief counsel for the
prosecution of Nuremberg he informed the
tribunal that if certain acts of
violation of treaties or crimes they are
crimes whether the United States does
them or whether Germany does them and we
are not prepared to lay down a rule of
criminal convict conduct against others
which we would not be willing to have
invoked against us we must never forget
that the record on which we judge these
defendants is the record on which
history will judge us tomorrow to pass
these defendants a poisoned chalice is
to put it to our own lips as well the
supreme international crime for which
the defendants were hanged at Nuremberg
was defined clearly enough by justice
Jackson
Nuremburg he proposed to the tribunal
that an aggressor is a state that is the
first to carry out invasion of its Armed
Forces with or without a declaration of
war of the territory of another state
illustrations of that too are easy
enough to find and others are on the
horizon it's again noteworthy that these
considerations are virtually excluded
from the dominant intellectual and moral
culture in the West rather generally
although we have no difficulty at all
and applying them to official enemy
well once again there's nothing special
about our own country in this respect
except that it's more powerful than
others such evasions with regard to the
acts of one's own state are close to
universal they disfigure intellectual
history as far back as you go to the
maximum of Tacitus that I quoted we may
add an observation by President John
Adams power always thinks it has a great
soul and vast views beyond the
comprehension of the weak I think that's
another near-universal again all too
easy to illustrate from the traditional
practice of governments and the educated
class of us within them well to return
to the beginning that what can one learn
from Just War Theory my feeling is that
from the literature on Just War we
learned mostly about the prevailing
moral and intellectual climate in which
we live scientific inquiry in tomorrow
psychology and its roots in our nature
may someday provide important insights
but practice cannot wait for that day
any more than engineering has waited for
physics or medicine for biology for
centuries in these cases which are much
simpler ones and much more accessible to
inquiry than human nature thirdly the
codification of laws of war has
over time had a notable civilizing
effect but the gap between professed
ideals and actual practice is much too
large to be tolerated in my opinion
Thanks
do I think that there's a responsibility
to intervene in cases where Just War
Theory concludes that it is correct
intervene set the question personally I
agree with the UN Charter the high-level
UN panel of December 2004 and the UN
World Summit which I quoted but I can't
really answer the question because as
far as I can determine you can call me
if I'm wrong Just War Theory never tells
you anything it doesn't tell you when
it's proper to intervene what it tells
you is I think it's proper to intervene
well you know I may also think so but
there's a big gap between assertion and
argument between surmise and evidence so
if you can tell me we're just war theory
entails that we ought to intervene we
can consider the question but until ads
don't done we can't really consider the
question I was wondering do you believe
that it would have been right to
reassess article 51 of the UN Charter
and you believe that by not reassessing
and not rewriting it it loses relevancy
I'm sorry I didn't get it bye-bye say it
again by not reassessing it not reassess
your writing it
if you believe it loses its it has been
reassessed repeatedly for example by the
high-level UN panel of December 2 that
issue is reported on 2004 with many
distinguished participants I mentioned
Brent Scowcroft but there are others yes
that's exactly what they did they
reassessed the UN Charter and their
conclusion is what I read the UN World
Summit last September
again reassessed the UN Charter and
that's what it concluded maybe there
should be a further reassessment and
fine then let's undertake it and let's
consider their arguments or other
arguments but we can't say that it
hasn't been reassessed and what we can
say that we haven't paid any attention
to it that's possible in fact true but
it certainly has been reassessed by
very respectable and leading figures and
the conclusions in my opinion at least
are pretty justified however I get back
to the main topic I don't think just war
tel Theory tells us anything about that
when we judge these things we're judging
them on another basis on the basis of
actual evidence about what happens in
particular cases in terms of our
fundamental moral principles which we
should try to explicate and apply like
the principle of universality now that's
the way we should reassess it also we
should I think think seriously about the
statement that I quoted of the December
2004 panel that was directed to people
like us it was directed to intellectual
opinion in the West and can read it
again but what they said is the
foundations of world order based on the
principle of non-intervention
and the affairs of others not forceful
intervention is too important and too
fragile to be destroyed or the
consequences will be terrible because
for one to act is to grant the authority
to all at least if we believe in
elementary moral principles that's a
heavy burden to bear maybe we can come
up with a different conclusion in some
cases actually personally I think we can
but it has to be argued you said that
it's possible that article 51 needs to
be reassessed but you mentioned earlier
when you were referencing Walters book
that he said that the Israeli preemptive
strike was just or that he said that the
Israeli preemptive strike was justified
he was now stated that his arguments did
not really have justification by his
theory however in the case of the
preemptive strike he does say that there
are several criterion that are necessary
for the Israeli attack to be justified
specifically the fact that these
Egyptian army was standing at a state of
readiness that the Israeli army was
incapable of holding so under
article 51 even though Egypt had not yet
invaded Israel that they they were not
at war however what Egypt was doing
tactically put Israel at a severe
disadvantage so under our modern
definition of war it seems to me that
that ought to be it seems to me it seems
logical that it ought to be called an
act of war
what Egypt was doing putting Israel at
such a disadvantage so doesn't article
51 definitely needs the real article 51
clearly does not apply I read the
article I reckon we can argue that we
can argue that it was justified but we
can't say that article 51 justifies it
not under Daniel Webster's
characterization or any other one that's
accepted by the international community
we might argue and here's where I think
you could make an argument that if you
consider the range of issues that arose
at the time the preemptive strike was
justified maybe one can give such an
argument but the point is that no
argument is given to that effect
none of the relevant facts are
considered and this is regarded as one
of the half-dozen cases where Just War
Theory entails that the use of military
force was legitimate Just War Theory
doesn't entail that I couldn't tell
anything it what it tells you is well I
Michael worth Walter believed this was
justified but without giving any reasons
and without looking into the background
if you look into the background it's a
lot more complex than that it's a lot of
literature and scholarship on it the
u.s. didn't agree there were all sorts
of possibilities you could have taken I
mean I don't want to if you want to run
through the background but it's quite
intricate and complex going back to the
question of the free passage through the
Straits of Tiran and whether that should
be brought to the World Court which the
US and Israel refused to do and he
insisted on involves Israeli strikes
against Syrian targets
all sorts of things so yes there's a
complicated background you could look at
them you could decide maybe that in the
light of these complex these complex
circumstances practices are all is
entitled to make a preemptive strike but
that's not what's claimed what's claimed
is that without looking at any evidence
Just War Theory whatever it is it's not
easy to determine Just War Theory
entails that this is one of the
half-dozen cases in the last century in
which the use of force was no doubt
legitimate and the only case in which
pre-emptive strike was legitimate that
we can also raise the question of
universality I mean I don't believe and
I'm sure you don't believe now that Iran
has a right to say carry out terrorist
acts in the United States right now but
undoubtedly it's under serious threat
and undoubtedly the threat is simply
overwhelming as compared with Iran's
capacities but it would be outrageous to
suggest that of course and if it's
outrageous to suggest that why is it
legitimate in this case I mean for one
to act is to give the right tool and we
can give a whole lot of other examples I
mean let me give an even more outrageous
one okay not because except that of
course but just as an example nobody I
know of who's any sane that goes out
every December 7th and celebrates Pearl
Harbor Day however if we use these
arguments you can do it Japan on
December 7th attacked US military bases
in Hawaiian to effectively to US
colonies territories claim with you as
Hawaii and the Philippines Tech military
bases the Japanese were perfectly
capable of being of reading what was
being written and in US public journals
and in fact US intelligence which it
cracked the Japanese codes know that
they knew about it and what was being
written going all the way up to the high
military command being reported by you
know political commentators and the New
York Times was
that the United States was that b-17s
were running off the
Boeing assembly line that designs to be
able to earn the to the ground the what
they were called the antiques in which
the Japanese lived these wooden cities
with burn them to the ground with Air
b-17 attacks but furthermore b-17s were
being shipped from the Atlantic where
they were needed to pacific bases in
preparation for such attacks well you
know is that a threat that's a pretty
serious threat does that justify Pearl
Harbor I mean not in 10 million years
but effect doesn't why does why is this
justified do you think our operations in
Iraq are preventive or a pre-emptive and
do you think that our operations that
are acted just or unjust well there was
interesting terminology and then the
administration presented it and in fact
the National Security Council describe
to had that in mind but more generally
as pre-emptive war but it certainly
isn't pre-emptive word by any stretch of
the imagination more accurately you
could call it preventive war okay you
say we have to prevent a potential
attack against us personally I don't see
much justification for that even if you
accept that they believed all the
reports that Colin Powell was giving it
the UN Security Council and so on even
if we accept that all that was believed
it doesn't seem to me that a preventive
war in such a case is legitimate and as
you know the world didn't think so
either
there were international polls taken on
this and outside the United States and
to Olympus to more limited extent
England you could barely find a country
in the world where support for it was
above 10 percent in fact the only two
exceptions in the international polls
that were taken were India and Israel
but both of them had something different
in mind
now what they had in mind was their own
repression of occupied territories
Kashmir in the occupied
now they like the idea of preventive war
by the powerful but they weren't talking
about this how are the rest of the world
is almost non-existent 10% or less was
is it and again we have the same
question
if preventive war is legitimate under
those circumstances it's legitimate for
everybody okay that means it's
legitimate for Iran today I mean to take
another case it is simply undeniable I
read it right in US official document
that the United States has been carrying
out a terrorist war against Cuba since
1960 I mean at first it was with direct
participation more recent years is just
with tolerance but that has happened
isn't even questionable no John F
Kennedy assigned his brother Robert
Kennedy the task of running the
terrorist war I was to be his highest
priority Robert Kennedy's official no
more or less official biographer
historian Arthur Schlesinger who was
well-known historian it was a Kennedy
member of the Kennedy team a Latin
American advisor he writes that Robert
Kennedy's task was to bring the terrors
of the earth to Cuba and if you look
back at the record it was no joke and it
continued and now still based on US soil
and the u.s. harbors of happily harbors
terrorists who were involved in is that
you've cube of the right to carry out
terrorist acts in the US to prevent this
did it ever give them the right well I
don't think so I'm sure you don't think
so but if preventive war is legitimate
why not and in fact you know and there
are many other cases where it takes a
Lebanon in 1982 when his rule was
preparing the attack and in fact trying
desperately to conjure up an excuse for
the attack that were bombing Lebanon
hoping for some retaliation that can be
used as a pretext and that was a serious
attack killed probably maybe 20,000
people asteroid a large part of southern
Lebanon City
much of it did that give Lebanon Lee or
the Palestinians in Lebanon the right to
carry out the terrorist acts in Israel
prior to it to prevent the war well I
certainly don't think so I'm sure you
don't but if preventive war is
legitimate under such ambiguous cases as
Iraq why hasn't that legit so no I don't
think it was just I think it was
aggression Sir Walter it's Lee colas
paradigm when he describes it he also
describes three revisions one of which
being the human rights provision saying
that it is justified to intervene if
human rights are being violated would
you give any credence to the argument
that your son Saddam Hussein was in fact
a tyrant that did violate human rights
no he said even though even though there
were other reasons given for war such as
WMD and additionally aggressors or walls
are also describes aggressors as also
being just did you go against the war
okay go to war against and when when and
did he ever lose his status as an
aggressor from the first Gulf War
he lost his status as an aggressor when
he was driven out of Kuwait just as
Israel lost its status as an aggressor
when after 22 years its pulled at 11 but
and I can give plenty of other examples
close to home but as for the human
rights violations they were horrendous
and here is one of the cases where it
really is important to look at facts
before you make decisions and we know
the facts the Nazi group so yes Saddam
Hussein carried out horrendous human
rights violations fact he's on trial for
him right now
but have a look at the trial Saddam
Hussein is on trial for crimes that he
committed in 1982 my kill is in charged
with killing probably accurately killing
about 150 you're signing the death
warrant for 150 or so Shiites who were
involved
than an uprising yeah that's a crime
that 1982 happens to be an important
year in USA relations this should be
headlines and a free press in my opinion
it was a very important year 1982 was
the year in which Ronald Reagan dropped
your act from the list of states
supporting terrorism so the u.s. that
starts providing him with extensive aid
including military including means to
develop biological and chemical weapons
and missiles and weapons of men and
nuclear weapons he was dropped from
Donald Rumsfeld the next shortly after
went the firm up the agreement the next
charge against Saddam Hussein one's
going to come along it's been announced
is a much more serious crime the
atrocities against the Kurds in 1997
1988 they all unfold massacres Halabja
you know they were terrible and
protocool hundred thousand people u.s.
an object in fact the Reagan
administration blocked efforts in
Congress even to protest against it
furthermore the support for Saddam
increased and continued in fact Saddam
was given an extraordinary privilege
remarkable he was allowed he got away
with attacking a US naval vessel and
killing 37 soldiers I'm seaman in 1987
that's pretty astonishing nobody can get
away with that but we were supporting
the Reagan administration was so
strongly in support of Saddam right
through the worst atrocities even when
we get away with that I mean in 1980
this continued after the end of the war
with Iran after the worst atrocities in
1989 Iraqi nuclear engineers were
invited to the United States to take
part in a conference I was in Portland
Oregon in which they were a trained in
how to develop weapons of mass
destruction missus 1989 I furthermore
George Bush number one told us why it
was being done they said we have to
provide aid to Saddam because it's of
our responsibility to help
u.s. exporters and because he
contributes to stability in the region
in fact that continued I mean thinking
after the invasion of quake after he was
driven out of quake you know your AK was
quickly bombed into rubble the US had
total control of the area there was an
uprising April March April 1991 Shiite
uprising in the South probably would
have overthrown it they were rebelling
Iraqi generals good chance he would have
been overthrown the Bush administration
determined that they would essentially
permit Saddam the crush'
he was military helicopters other armed
equipment they don't have to do that
that led to a huge massacre and it was
described you know you can go back and
read the New York Times right after that
they said well you know it's regrettable
but there's a consensus among the US and
its allies meaning Saudi Arabia and
Britain there's a consensus that are
virtually quoting that Saddam Hussein
offers more hope for the stability of
the region than those who are trying to
overthrow him that's 1991 you know yeah
the human rights violations were
horrendous what does that even do with
invasion nothing
you
