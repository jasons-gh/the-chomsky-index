he's a world-famous academic in the
field of linguistics but he's probably
better known as a political dissident
and longtime critic of u.s. foreign
policy professor Noam Chomsky has spent
a lifetime highlighting in justices
around the world well last week he was
in Ireland where r prime times Robert
short caught up with him great powers do
not support human rights except
sporadically and they don't support
democracy Noam Chomsky has been an
outspoken voice on human rights and
foreign policy for decades he was in
Ireland last week for a series of
lectures he also recorded an interview
with prime time I asked him first about
the ongoing war in Syria series a pretty
awful situation in fact the two sides
are moving towards a kind of a suicidal
conflict
the only plausible way out is through
some form of negotiations that neither
side is capable of destroying the other
that's pretty clear in Flint so many
plenty of atrocities on both sides
mostly government but it's not alone
there's a big debate in Europe over
whether or not the Syrian opposition
should be armed and whether or not an EU
embargo on arms to Syria should be
lifted what's your view on that first of
all the opposition is being armed poring
arms into the areas likely to inflame
conflicts atrocities probably end up
helping the when your arms a group the
arms tend to go to the best fighters the
ones who are on the front and those
happen to be the Johnny elements
there's problems with what's called the
Middle East peace process is a process
organized and run by the United States
and there can't be a serious peace
process that way the u.s. is an advocate
not a neutral observer if there were to
be a genuine peace process it would be
administered by some country that for
one thing has a degree of international
respect do you think that there's there
has been any change at all in the
approach of the United States towards
Israel and the Palestinian territories
under President Obama because he was
actually criticized for his approach
towards Israel at one point over the
last couple of years actually under him
it's gotten worse which was totally
predictable like giant wrote about it in
2008 before he was even before the
primaries even just using his web page
was pretty clear that they can give you
the details if you like but it was
pretty clear that he was not going to be
willing to support anything that
involved Palestinian rights and apart
from some what's called soaring rhetoric
that's the term that's usually described
for apart from the soaring rhetoric
there's been nothing except making it
worse
in the case we ran no one knows
including us intelligence whether
they're trying to develop nuclear
weapons maybe they are general
assumption is that probably trying to
develop what's called nuclear capability
that means the ability to develop a
nuclear weapon if you choose to dozens
of countries have that the so are there
concrete measures you could take to
avoid the short of sanctions in war the
other are so one possibility for example
would be to try to renew an agreement
that was reached in May 2010 between
Brazil Turkey and Iran they agreed that
Iran would stop uranium enrichment it
would send its low enriched uranium for
storage elsewhere in fact a turkey and
in return the West would provide
isotopes whatever's needed for the
medical reactors in Iran that was the
agreement soon as that ground was
reached it was bitterly condemned by the
United States it's Obama the US media
denounced Brazil particularly for
carrying this out the head of the IAEA
the International Atomic Energy Agency
mohamed el borrowed they said that the
u.s. is refusing to take yes for an
answer the u.s. is reporting warlords
who are not all that different from the
Taliban and the question is what are the
effective they're staying there with the
effects of they're staying there will
probably be prolong the conflict isn't
Afghanistan I suppose a prime example of
the difficulties of intervention no
because there were no difficulties the
u.s. invaded
then we know why it was public no secret
documents needed in early October in
2011 22 thousand one George Bush
announced that it he demanded that the
Taliban hand over Osama bin Laden to the
United States for prosecution the
Taliban requested evidence though the
u.s. refused to provide any evidence
well that was the invasion nothing about
the moral concerns but should it be I
mean it is Afghanistan an example of the
rest of the world has a responsibility
towards towards the people where there
is no there is no state or at least
there was no stones of the Taliban was
there with what you're saying would be
true if governments of the world
accepted that they have a responsibility
for anything except the their own power
and the powerful the demands of the
powerful sectors within
