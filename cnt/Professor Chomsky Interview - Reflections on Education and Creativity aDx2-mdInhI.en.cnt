well the first thing I just wanted to
start off with is when I decided to
email you which was purely random I was
at a coffee shop and and I heard that
you had a kind of strange habit of
responding to email is very strange so I
actually did it as a writing exercise in
a way I wasn't you know thinking that
you were actually being right back and
the question was whether or not brave
new world or or was 1984 which one of
those was either a better book to teach
or a better kind of prophecy or
prediction of where we were guess what I
might have did I mentioned some yeah
exactly
yeah cuz I think that's much better than
either oh yeah so what was your what's
your reasoning for anything it's much
earlier right but I just thought it was
more perceptive right I mean first of
all I didn't think that 1984 was one of
our wills right just what a terrific I'd
barely finish it I thought it was kind
of obvious and wouldn't you know you
know where it's going yeah I had some
nice comments about Newspeak and this
rant that was good useful phrases but I
didn't think was much of a book and
Huxley's is you know it's science
fiction basically but some yatin was
talking about the real world Russia of
course it wasn't and in the early
post-revolutionary period and he was
discussing I think he sensed what a
tellurian system is like and it's a
projection you know but the projection
from something real or well had in mind
he probably had in mind England and
England social democracy which he
thought was going off in a dangerous
direction but it's quite a projection
and anyhow that's but it's just reading
it and see what you think
grateful I frankly I read it about 60
years ago I'm not I can't reproduce it
but I know I was impressed but so I
guess just a very basic question before
I get to some other you know topical
issues is I'm here I am from LA I just
kind of sent you an email I'm interested
in and why you make time for I don't
wanna say folks like me but what you
know it is about
you're kind of whether or not it's a
philosophy or just kind of who you are
or you're very open to people speaking
with you
given your schedule and given you know
other things to say oh no I mean I'm not
teaching anymore but I was the same when
I was teaching I I taught my my work
professional English tics class grad
grad courses but I also always taught
undergraduate courses on my own time on
the kinds of things I write about social
political issues and they the students
who took them couldn't you know they
couldn't really get credit for a program
through these courses weren't admitted
into any program so they were taking it
on their own
I often taught them in the evenings and
they're just open to the community and a
lot of people would come year after year
because they'd always talk about new
thing right but I think that's part of
part of one's and I would even say
responsibility that makes it sound too
August it's normal like why do you talk
to your children you know well it's not
that this was you only have two children
what if you only asked your children if
you only have two I have F 3 yeah but a
lot of grandchildren right but I'll talk
then
they'll occasionally ask me a question
but then they'll usually say something
like just the five minute later please
like don't go off you know but I mean
you respond like I say responsibilities
too fancy a word and it's just you're
part of the human race something you
think you've talked to people about that
might be worthwhile so you do it why do
I run around giving talks it's not the
same thing
be more convenient just to sit at home
and work what teacher has made the
biggest impact on you
well out of a very unconventional
education for the first till I was about
12
my parents were Hebrew teachers so they
did they worked in the afternoons you
know teach and so it and
they sent me to experimental kind of a
dewy-eyed school run by Temple
University and I was there from two
years old till high school and it wasn't
quite what you're describing but it was
a pretty open school that's foster
creativity independence you didn't take
two you only took tests but it was
didn't mean much like just to give you
an example I didn't know I was a good
student until I got to high school
literally I mean I knew I had skipped a
year but all that meant was I was the
smallest kid in the class nobody paid
any attention to it when I got to high
school and I discovered he's supposed to
you know be first in your class
and you have to pass all the exams but
it wasn't enough we've never had
anything like that you just did work you
were interested in you worked with other
people and there was a curriculum normal
curriculum but it was guided you know
but so the teachers from there I
remember actually but after that was one
professor at the University a couple of
people at the University
zelich Harrison oh if you know him who
is very a kind of charismatic person
actually my context of them were
political I mean I see erratically I was
in his department right Godfrey didn't
take many courses and I was I was just
about to drop out of college when I met
him because it was so boring but he
suggested I take his grad courses and
then start taking other graduate courses
and I came in contact with
intellectually very interesting people
but what qualities did he have as a
teacher that you really responded isn't
a teacher you know like our classes
would be there were a couple of students
that he the kind of work close to them
maybe half a dozen we'd meet in his
apartment or his apartment in New York
this is Philadelphia and talk about
politics science all kind of things and
he was a you know it was a kind of a
intellectual leader you know he a lot of
interesting ideas
people are interested but one classes
and I took classes with people like
Nelson Goodman a very fine philosopher
but he had just discussed his own work
and we thought about it and we argued
about it and discussed it and went off
on her own but actually I mean one of
the I was taking graduate math classes
I'd never had undergraduate math but the
there was one professor who I thought
was a fantastic
eita that is just the right way he
advanced real numbers or something every
what it was he'd come into class and the
blackboard cleared the blackboard and
write down something which and he'd look
at it kind of puzzled and you say well
let's figure out if that's a theorem and
then the class would and we'd read stuff
and studied stuff and ideas would come
up and sometimes they were good learning
sometimes they weren't he'd kind of
steered the discussion and by the end of
the class we'd have either proven that
they were disproven right yeah okay you
learn something that way but I thought
it's terrific way to teach
he doesn't even know his multiplication
table
or generations of us youngsters went to
school because they had to and both
communities boasted but one room and a
single teacher with which to educate
their entire and disordered progeny good
night children
happiest moment for the school children
of that sterner era was when school let
out but for some youngsters staying
after school seemed almost unavoidable
yesterday found only a half-dozen
advanced experimental school today in
tens of thousands of public schools from
Santa Monica California to Bronxville
New York progressive education is
important learning by doing
learning about practical everyday
problem that knowledge gained during an
actual experience is best understood and
longest retain
reading Dewey because our school I think
in May is a Dewey at school although you
know in practice not always and in you
know experience in education he links
education with you know experience and
memory so is it does it surprise you
that you recall so much more from your
educational experiences that involved
experience and you didn't know because
it was exciting and you were doing
things you were interested in I mean
look everyone of us knows if we got
through college you know you can take a
course and you're not interested in then
you have to pass an exam you don't care
one way or another and you memorize what
you have to memorize and you get an A in
the exam and a week later it can't
remember what the course was about in
fact there's an image in the
Enlightenment there's two competing
images during the Enlightenment about
education one of them is education is
like pouring water into a vessel which
is happens to be very leaky vessel
that's the take exam and forget what it
was the case the other is comes actually
from the guy who was the founder of the
modern higher education system film
phenom bolt humanistic he said education
is like laying out a string along which
the student progresses and students
progress in their own ways but you've
got the string in other words there's a
structure to what being students being
interesting introduced into it's not
like any random thing but then they
explore it and create in their own ways
that when you get to a place like MIT
you know science university it's almost
second nature like the famous physicists
euros world famous physicist was
teaching his freshman courses he he was
famous for saying that if students asked
him what are we going to cover this
semester you say it really doesn't
matter matters what you discover and I
cannot move any further back so there's
no cheat here
I'm going to release it right for my
chin here you realize as you have just
seen that the slightest push and this
will be my last lecture I'm going to
close my eyes I don't want to see it and
I'm going to count down from three to
zero three two one zero
I'm Noam Chomsky I'm a on the faculty at
MIT and I've been getting more and more
heavily involved in anti-war activities
for the last few years when was the
first time that you ever expressed
dissent in a classroom setting like in a
formal school setting where you didn't
just kind of internalized your
frustration you actually said something
I don't know I remember like in the
history courses you know in the latin
course I just study Latin but in the
history of course we were being taught
stuff their thought was off the wall and
I was in high school high school right
yeah I mean in elementary school you
just talk but sorry I said some things
but it was obviously just couldn't there
was no point you know it couldn't it was
like talking to the wall you know you
can couldn't penetrate too much so if I
never bothered I did it outside of class
I mean all radicals outside of class but
never thought you mentioned that in
formal schooling had a huge impact on
you and this is both your experiences in
New York visiting these bookstores as a
youngster this is kind of the accidental
nature of your your own career and you
know do educators undervalue the
importance of informal schooling or
maybe overvalue traditional schooling I
think that listen I mean in my own
experiment I was a Heber teacher to
teaching 10 year old 12 year old kids
and we taught the same way it was a duet
framework so we would the way to teach
the kids was get them interested in
middle school Hebrew school is one of
those challenging it is because for one
thing the kids don't want to come in the
afternoon and they'd rather be playing
somewhere and and middle school is a
difficult age anyway but this it worked
you know most of the kids got interested
and studied initiative pursued things on
their own but you had to set things up
so they get interested in it like it
often this class would start with games
again games that you would create yeah
or that we're part of the edge kind of
educational program that actually both
my mother and father who kind of ran the
school systems were due eight deeply
committed do educators so they had all
kind of suggestions and frameworks as to
how to pursue and then we did our own
way but games that involved learning
that they did involve learning language
or learning customs or learning
something else but in the form of
something that kids wanted to solve
puzzles and so on and they get
interested in something you go on then
you can do it at any level I so for
example I have a my sister-in-law was a
sixth grade teacher he wants to describe
very good teacher actually very
successful she told me how she taught a
class on the American Revolution before
a couple of weeks before the class was
gonna be on this topic she started just
doing things that were arbitrary and
annoying like compelling the kids to do
things they didn't want to do and it
didn't make any sense got worse and
worse and the kids got upset protesting
and right finally when it got to the
point where they were gonna be an
uprising in the classroom she turned to
the American Revolution and they were
all ready for you know they'd figured
out what it's about right all right okay
that's something the kids will remember
I think well it's true that our genetic
program rigidly constrains us I think
the more important point is that the
existence of that rich of that rigid
constraint is what provides the basis
for our freedom and creativity and the
reason I mean it's only because we have
pre-programmed that we can do all things
and exactly the point is that if we
really were plastic organisms without an
extensive pre-programming then the state
that our mind achieves would in fact be
a reflection of the environment which
means it would be extraordinarily
impoverished fortunately for us
we're rigidly pre-programmed with
extremely rich systems that are part of
our biological endowment I want to just
ask you about um structure and
creativity so what I found most
interesting about your work
language is that you correlated you know
creativity and the kind of infinite like
potential of language the fact with the
fact that it's restricted and I think
you said it's precisely those
characteristics of language that make it
an effective instrument for free thought
and expression seem to have their
origins in this innately
determined structure so I'm just
wondering what this apparent paradox
structure promoting creativity suggests
about the nature of creative thought
because it's normally associated maybe
that's a misperception with an absence
of structure and that's what creativity
is so and how does that reflect itself
in the classroom that's true that that's
commonly so that can possibly be true I
mean it's like it takes a the growth of
an organism say an amoeba or a human
being a human being has a a lot of
complex capacities and characteristics
even a complex internal structure like
the way your digestive system works and
so on I can do a lot of things but
that's because we're designed within a
framework that allows certain options
and blocks others suppose that the
genetic endowment said become anything
okay so arbitrarily you'd end up some
lump of something or other with no
capacities and no ability to do anything
it's the same with the arts no this was
understood in classical aesthetics so if
you read the aesthetic theories of the
8th 17th 18th century they understood
that creativity presupposes a set of
rules forms and rules if you you can you
can challenge the rules and like it can
be one form of creativity is challenging
the rules if you have no structure and
no rules at all it's you know it's like
tossing paint at the wall right that's
not not a creative act this is the value
of dissonance well there's got to be
some structure that provides you with
capacities if you don't have internal
structure this is for growth and
development but he'd be the same for
say creative activity is so what kind of
structures support creativity and what
kind of structures inhibit creativity
structures that support it or take say
writing a sonnet there are rules for
sonnet okay that framework of rules
enables people to do really creative
work you know you read classical Sun
instance if you had no rules at all you
just then I could write poetry I can't
and the structure that's there has to be
or takes a painting here - it's been
studying the history of art by Marsh
Bureau and others a painting is in a
frame well that alone imposes structure
it's on a flat surface okay that
requires you to invent perspective and a
long time before people understood it
how to make it look like a gown that's
flowing you know okay that that frame
itself just that simple even that simple
frame already imposed this sets the
conditions under which you can carry out
creative acts in a loneliness in my life
my father dead my mother dead my mother
far away my sisters my wife far away
nothing here with my own tragic hands
that once we rotted by a world a sweet
attention
let's take like Jack Kerouac on the road
that that's somehow less creative than
like a doctor but first he did he had no
rules he was just he but it's like not a
motive he might thought he had no rules
but if you look he did it's pretty
structured and otherwise it's just been
a random sentence that's going out and
it was nothing like that it's hard to
follow the buck anyway well I don't
think it's random it's not you know free
association right and if it was it would
be of no interest right and there's
development and plot and so on I'm even
concepts like plot and development or
an aesthetic framerate you don't want
the framework to be so rigid that you
always do the same thing like a
detective story where Perry Mason strays
everyone the same as the last one you
don't want that but a framework which is
rigid enough to meet to make it possible
to carry out creative acts but doesn't
inhibit the third eye well he's kind of
like you're your elementary school
experience which is teachers like that
present information that might be
worthwhile evaluating and allowing kids
to independently you know or it's like
this laying out the string model of
Education there's got to be something
there's got to be something there to
work with and what's there should be
challenging enough so you want to see
what you can discover within that
framework and then raise questions about
the framework so just I I didn't intend
to bring this up but if you take a look
at the the AP system in high school
which is I think it actually started in
the Cold War as a way to kind of
democratize education and give kind of
inner-city students a chance to have
this kind of high end education or this
this elite education but here you know
we take the brightest students in many
ways but provide them the kind of
narrowest of educational experiences and
so but at the same time this is what is
considered appropriate to enter science
and tech science if there's an
interesting series of editorials we
might want to take a look at and about a
year ago in science magazine near the
Journal of the American Association for
advancement of science the main science
journal the editor Bruce Alberts has a
series of editorials on science teaching
which are very well done he's talking
about California incidentally he is
talking about how he testified before
the California Education Commission on
science education and every proposal of
his was turned down but he wanted the he
said he describes the teaching of
science from kindergarten to graduate
school as deadening any child's interest
in science so when you you can memorize
the periodic table
okay you memorized it and so what you
know why should I bother with a periodic
table you can memorize the enzymes that
do so-and-so okay I memorized them and
finished that or they said they describe
the way people study great moments like
the discovery of DNA but they study it
as it was after it's finished so okay
here's the answer you know you lose all
the right sense and then he gives
suggestions estadio order teacher and
the suggestions are pretty interesting
so like this I remember he talks about a
kindergarten program which he the proof
of thought it was very good and the way
it worked was these are five year old
kids
they each child in the class was given a
dish which had on it in it much of
objects shells pebbles seeds other
things and then it had a task figure out
which ones are the seeds so the first
thing they did was have what they called
a scientific conference kids got
together and talked and figured out ways
in which they could tell what was a seed
and some bad ideas some good ideas and
of course guidance you know but and
pretty soon they got to experiments that
they could carry out to determine which
ones are seeds and finally at the end
they figured out which ones were seeds
at that point each kid was given a
magnifying glass and the teacher cut the
seed and opened it up and they looked in
and they found the embryo and they saw
what made it grow these kids learned
something look like some of us some of
our top students are the ones least able
to take their knowledge and apply it in
new situations and actually they
frequently like laugh at themselves they
call themselves Lab Rats because
whenever we present something that
didn't show up the day before either in
class or wasn't spelled out in the form
of instruction they have a ton of
anxiety and I'm wondering you know we
ranked number 17 in the world in
education a recent study say we were
that students in Latvia Chile and Brazil
are making gains and academics three
times fast
an American students work 25th in math
but our per pupil spending and the
amount of money people spend on college
counseling and everything that's
surrounding kind of you know the
test-taking culture a wheat we're number
one is that because the way we're
educating kids and at these exams I
think actually are better reflections of
whether what kids know than the SATs I
think it's called the peas eggs
well that's called teaching to test
businesses disasters like for example in
our admissions here you know we've
pretty high admission you have to have
high admission standards in a place like
that because the number of applicants
all of whom are pretty advanced is way
beyond the number you can take right but
we almost never paid attention to the
graduate you know the SAT type things or
even to it that were great I'm if a kid
comes along got all A's he's probably
too boring today bother with you know if
we ask that a middle school English
teacher
you know seventh or eighth grade or
maybe a ninth grade world literature
teacher that we feel it's her
responsibility but say she embraces her
responsibility of taking students with a
various level of literacy so you have a
kid who doesn't speak English very well
at all and a kid who's ready to read you
know um
you know you know Faulkner or James
Joyce but we think you know students
learn best when they're exposed to
various learning styles and her
responsibility to promote democracy in
the classroom so I'm wondering whether
or not and I don't mean this is like an
extreme hypothetical whether you know
MIT professor who teaches let's say
molecular physics should also be
responsible for teaching kids who
haven't taken say basic precalculus or
whether or not at that level it's
already selected out and the kids that
are in that class by the time you're at
MIT it's pre-selected right but you you
you have another life I mean this I know
there are people and I think it's a good
thing who give talks in high schools or
classes in high schools it's inner-city
schools and in fact this same famous
physicist who I mentioned before he also
wrote books for lay people you know
introducing physics to people who really
had no background in physics and did it
very
and that's another kind of you can't do
it at inside a place like MIT because
the priests elections dua but you have a
you know you're him and being you have
other things you can do with your life
but do you think select a tracking and
leveling in high school at any point is
necessary or should classes always be
this very broad democratic nice life can
be a mix for example in a high school
there could be a group of students who
happen to have a passionate interest in
mathematics okay they should have a
right to be able to be in a class which
is really pushing interesting questions
in mathematics though their students
aren't interested in me that doesn't
nothing wrong with that what shouldn't
be done is what I could see with my own
children we were in a mostly
professional suburb with so-called good
schools and so on by the time I kids
were in third grade they were ranking
the other kids in the class as smart and
dumb the smart ones were being tracked
into the higher track and the dumb ones
were being into the lower track and you
know but the third graders you know why
even have that concept in your head oh
look I want to have a few questions but
your bath has been very patient and he's
getting me the hook but I wanted to
thank you so much for taking the time
and you're you're an inspiration really
and it's I really appreciate it and you
know I hope to talk to you sometime soon
and hear more about what you're doing
and good if we have a chance okay thank
you so much
you
