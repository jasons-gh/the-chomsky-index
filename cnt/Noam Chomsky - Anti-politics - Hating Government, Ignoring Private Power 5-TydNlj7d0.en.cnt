what has been created by this half
century of massive corporate propaganda
is what's called aunty politics so
anything that goes wrong you blame the
government well okay there's plenty to
blame the government about but the
government is the one institution in
which that people can change
so one institution you can affect by
participation without institutional
change right that's exactly why all the
anger and fear is directed against the
government the government has a defect
it's potentially democratic corporations
have no defect
they're pure tyrannies so therefore you
want to keep corporations invisible and
focus all anger on the government so you
don't like something you know your wages
are going down blame the government you
know not blame the guys in the fortune
500 because you know read the fortune
500 you know the thing you just read
what they pay in the newspapers so you
don't read about the dazzling profits
and the stupendous this and the wages
going down and so on all you know is
that the bad government's doing
something so let's get mad at the
government it's the militia are just
this so-called patriot movement is just
one ass
notice first of all that their slogans
are very much like what the whole
propaganda system has been trying to
remedy our heads for 50 years the
government is the enemy and private
power doesn't exist okay now it's
obvious why big corporations who are
fighting the everlasting battle for the
minds of men would want that to be the
picture you have if the government is
your enemy and you can let's say when
people when 83% of the population think
the economic systems inherently unfair
that's supposed to mean they're angry at
the government if you can take that view
then those who run the private
institutions are quite well-off there's
no threat of democracy they can run
things peacefully the people are
demoralized and the normal weapon the
normal methods of democratic
participation to gain social ends are
excluded so it makes good sense for
corporate propaganda which
most of what we see in here makes a good
sense for it to be trying to stress the
message that the government is the enemy
and that and destress in fact eliminate
from sight the fact that private power
exists government is the enemy every
belt is in harmony you can't do anything
through the political system because
it's your enemy so therefore let us we
and run the private system let us run
everything and don't bother any politics
is a very scary phenomenon it can take
the form of that it is taking you know
forming what shouldn't be called
militias because remember militias are
things raised by States these are just
private armies forming private armies to
defend the country the people against
you know the UN forces being brought in
and the black helicopters by the Council
on Foreign Relations to commit genocide
or whatever story alike or else it's you
know fight against Lucifer and beast 66
who's doing this that and the other
thing and that's what if you take a look
across the country that's what people
are worried about and fighting against
aliens you know the devil the UN forces
the federal reserve I mean everything
except what's real namely private
corporate private tyranny private
corporate power the guys who are listed
in the fortune 500 well that's an
achievement
that's a propaganda achievement and
while the anger and the fear is real and
it's based on something and you got to
sympathize with it because it is real
when your wages have dropped 25 percent
roughly and say 15 years and you know
your wife has to work and your kids
candy and so on and so forth you have no
future and everything's rotten you know
a lot to be angry about but people are
not focused on what's doing that's the
difference between the days in which
there was a live functioning labor
movement that was organizing these
people exactly these people who work
together to change things
