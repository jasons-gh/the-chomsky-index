you
there's one obvious point so obvious
it's embarrassing
to mention it but all mention it anyway
and that is in the case of any threat or
use of violence there is a burden the
burden of proof has to be met by those
who advocated obviously that's true
whether it's domestic violence or
violence and International Affairs and
it's a very heavy burden no one has to
ever get an argument against the threat
or use of violence that's given you're
opposed to it every sane person so a
strong argument has to be given for it
and it's not an argument to say for
example what else can I do so you know
someone's beating their wife and
children and they say what else can I do
that's not an argument same in
international affairs or to take the
lead story in today's Toronto Star if we
could talk to the people who carried out
a attack on a kibbutz in Israel
yesterday and asked him why are you
doing it they can't just say what else
can I do that's not an argument that I
think that suffice is to eliminate the
arguments that are given for the bombing
of Iraq but we could discuss that and
then even one thing is clear the burden
of proof is on those who advocate
violence or even the threat of violence
and it's a heavy word the just one other
comment the basic issues were framed
reasonably well on the lead in stores
and oppressed today so just keep to that
there are two extreme positions
expressed one by the Bush administration
and Ricard this time who reiterated the
position that the administration has
been making extremely clear no one
should be deluded about it he said
something approximately like this that
we regard ourselves as having any
authority we need to attack Iraq the
Security Council can meet and discuss it
if they like
that has no particular interest to us
that's the position that has been made
clear and explicit throughout that was
reiterated again this morning
yesterday's news conference another
position at the other extreme which was
reported at Washington Post on a star
picked it up was the position of the
Arab League which endorsed the UN
resolution claiming that they had
explicit guarantees from Colin Powell
that it was not a that it was not a
trigger for a war that is that the White
House position is false you can make
what you like about that and
interestingly reiterating according to
the story introducing but in fact
reiterating a position was rarely
mentioned the Arab League statement
called for regional disarmament not just
disarmament of Iraq that was called a
new proposal not that's part of
resolution 687 the grizzled UN
resolution that's appealed to constantly
as authorizing war actually that does
doesn't do that but it does call for
disarmament of Iraq and also calls for
general moves or its general regional
disarmament article 14 which is always
omitted in the press coverage of this or
the White House coverage that goes back
10 years that was the issue right before
the first Gulf War I more or less
marginalized but the issue a major issue
at that time was whether Iraqi
withdrawal could take place from Kuwait
as Iraq and in fact proposed within the
framework of a regional conference on
the general problem general regional
problems of armaments threats and so on
which is all a code word for Israeli
weapons of mass destruction there
apparently was such a proposal was
turned down by the United States was not
reported by the press independently of
that two-thirds of the population in the
United States supported it
right before the bombing not
knowing that the proposal had been made
and turned down if they had known that
had been made and turned down probably
it would have been a much higher
percentage and it would have been much
harder to initiate that war and it's
possible that withdrawal could have been
achieved the State Department
negotiators thought it was quite
possible without the devastation of war
and all the horrors that followed
leaving plenty of problems but moving on
to what is a very serious regional
problem namely the capacity for
destruction and violence which is there
that is recognized by the US government
so for example the former head of the
Strategic Air Command Strategic Command
in the major government body that deals
with nuclear weapons leak generally
Butler pointed out a couple years ago
that the main problem of proliferation
in the region is Israel's nuclear
capacities which are far beyond anyone
elses and are part of the u.s. system of
regional and global dominance and Butler
pointed out that as long as that exists
of course it's contributed to
proliferation and violence and so on and
something has to be done about it that's
a reference really to the United States
these are so those are two opposite
positions on what's happening and the
issues I think my feeling is ought to be
framed in that context
one question so now now everybody US
governments is that what they want is to
disarm Iraq but many people says that
there is other reasons for instance the
volunteer Oh waving hand on petrol there
or the warranty of take the attention of
the United States away from that in
inner problems like Enron economy
problems what did or what is your point
oh I agree with the second position I
think in fact close to true isn't and
it's expressed very clearly in right in
the mainstream I mean I have to go out
to the fringe to find it so for example
last week's International Herald Tribune
there was a article by senior fellow of
the Council on Foreign Relations Yosef
Ibrahim who's been the lead Middle East
correspondent for The New York Times in
the Wall Street Journal for thirty years
he could hardly get more respectable
than that and he says exactly what you
just said he said the two reasons for
the war one is George Bush's the
administration's domestic political
problems which accounts for the timing
that's why it has to be now not say next
year and the long one long term one is
the fact that Iraq has the second
largest oil reserves in the world the
United States are gonna do something to
regain control of them September 11th
I'm not going beyond his article
September 11th provided pretext as it
arrived a pretext for many other things
like the intensification of Russia's war
in Chechnya and all sorts of other
things so it protects to do all kinds of
things and the domestic political
problems explain the time very clearly
in fact the Republican campaign managers
virtually say it
so the tactic worked brilliantly in the
current just past congressional
elections it was possible to and
people's attention was turned away from
the problems that really concern them
very seriously namely the assault that's
being carried out against the general
population by current administration
which is not so concealed but the
attention was turned away from that to
the fear of the monster going to destroy
us and the brave cowboy is going to save
us and that's going to be even more
important a year from now which is why
the war has to be now next year that'll
be the middle of a presidential campaign
and if you think about say Karl Rove
Republican campaign manager the last
thing he wants people to think about is
the fact that there are new tax cuts for
the rich the country's being purposely
sent into a big fiscal crisis to cut
back social spending that's a known
attack the limited medical support
system that exists pensions will be
shaky if though even exists those are
the environments being destroyed and
that's not what you want people to think
about when they're coming into an
election what you want them to think
about is no praise for the Magnificent
leader who saved us from imminent
destruction by you know Hitler and is
now marching on dozens of triumphs this
is classic you know this is in fact for
the people now at running the Washington
policy it's second nature this is simply
a replay of what they did 20 years ago
pretty much the same people who were in
the Reagan administration
act you can read this in the lead story
and this morning's Wall Street Journal
if you like though they put it a bit of
bleakly but what they point out which is
correct is that the current Bush
administration which is very many of the
same people who were in the Reagan
administration
I did exactly what they did 20 years ago
they quickly drove the country into a
big deficit by - number of factors but
the ones under their control were a tax
cut for the rich about 40%
the top one person and a big good be
governor remember this is a big
government Republicans are in favor of a
very big government but a government for
the rich so they increased government in
fact the Wall Street Journal points out
correctly that this was the biggest
increase in federal government spendings
in 20 years 20 years happens to be when
they did it the first time and now
they're doing it again and the purpose
is quite clear pretty blind not to see
it but you don't want people to be
paying attention to that it's okay if
readers of The Wall Street Journal do
they're trustworthy but not the people
are gonna vote they should be paying
attention to
so yeah the timing is it's clear that
you know they have to drive the war very
fast it's got to be over before the
presidential campaign started so then
you're on to the next and the long-term
interest is what is a hit Britain
pointed out that's the second largest
oil reserves in the world it's not a
matter of access the United States
doesn't care about access to them in
fact don't even tend to use them it's a
matter of control it's not quite
different if you control oil resources
first of all you can guarantee that the
enormous wealth that flows from them
will go to the right people like US
energy corporations and British energy
corporations of the US Treasury and the
lottery industry which will have
contracts and so on so forth so is that
and then it says commonly pointed out
State Department pointed out that 55
years ago
it's a stupendous source of strategic
power in the State Department and
strategic power means world control so
it's not a matter of access it's a
matter of world domination and ensuring
that the wealth goes to the people of
matter and those things you report
so yeah I'm sure there's a brain is
correct
given that you know resolution depends
how you interpret the resolution yeah
well there was a man on paper there was
a unanimous resolution in fact it was
not there was a resolution supported by
the US and Britain not opposed by
everybody else that's that's exactly the
split that I just mentioned the wording
of the resolution does not give us any
authorization to do anything but the
Bush administration made it extremely
clear couldn't be clearer before the
resolution was passed right after it was
passed and again today that it
interprets the resolution that's giving
it the right to do anything it wants so
to repeat the Security Council can just
talk if they like but we have the right
to do anything we want okay you really
have to be dedicated to self-delusion
not to see this I mean there is some to
the front-page story in The New York
Times about it right before the
resolution was as the resolution was
being introduced and it was accurate it
said something like this despite the
diplomatic niceties the Washington is
going to interpret the resolution as
authorization to attack Iraq when it to
do so and that's accurate
the diplomatic niceties are there so
that writers of editorials can talk
about the wonders of diplomacy and
multilateralism and so on and
commentators can praise Colin Powell and
do all these usual things but the
reality is exactly the way they
described it and since the
administration is being very open and
clear about it if one wants to be
deluded it's a choice but there's no
reason
North American to oppose it yeah I mean
there's huge opposition I mean it's in
fact it's completely without any
historical precedent there I mean I
don't think it took any talking all the
time I can't I haven't seen an audience
of less than a couple of thousand people
for a long time it's mostly about this
now and there's huge demonstrations for
this just ask yourself but when has that
ever happened when in the entire history
of European imperialism County the u.s.
is part of Europe and the entire history
when has there been massive opposition
to a war before it begin it has never
happened and it's not just here it's in
England and Italy there were like a
thousand people the other day this is no
never happened before I mean people
mentioned Vietnam but you know they
forget what happened in Vietnam and in
Vietnam at the US had been attacking
South Vietnam quite publicly for four or
five years correctly it destroyed the
country before there was any purpose
yes I was just wondering if you could
offer some context on the scene like a
quarter to it there I was wondering if
you could offer some context for the
ceiling off a quarter to a third of
Kuwait and the closure
well the Al Jazeera Office has been a
thorn in the side of all the governments
of the region I know also the United
States because it just reports
independently and they don't like that
when the Emir of Qatar was in Washington
right after 9/11 he got a dressing-down
by Colin Powell who commanded that he
control and effect
aljazeera because it was a was just much
too open and free and he then gave a
press conference in Washington which as
far as I'm aware nobody attended in
which he kind of ironically informed the
American press that there was such a
thing as freedom of the press and Qatar
was my detected even if the US State
Department's too was opposed didn't
leave much actually was reported in The
Wall Street Journal CNN world the and
that continues I mean as the as when the
US was bombing Afghanistan as it's the
Northern Alliance was moving into Kabul
and the Taliban fled the last thing that
the US did before they their own forces
took over was the bomb the Al Jazeera
station in Kabul
it was a missile attack on they claimed
it is an accident
you know they thought it was an arms
Depot or some story but nobody believed
that she I was in I was mom about a
couple of days later and the huge press
massive press there were just laughing
the all Jazeera people took it for
granted that of course they were bond
and the reason was clear they didn't
want filming of what was going to happen
al Jazeera what you can think what you
like about it but it's very open I mean
it has everyone from
you know I Israeli officials to radical
Islamists should just to be honest
they've even interviewed me a couple of
times
they're pretty far out but they just
have lots of things and it's been a it's
been an eye-opener in the Arab world
everybody turns into it from all over
the government's hate it of course and
keep trying to close it down in the US
government hates it too so you know they
want to get it out of Kuwait opening up
areas of Kuwait - that's just part of
the preparation for war and it's worth
remembering that even quite as opposed
to the war in fact there's no one in the
region who can be found who is in favor
of the war outside of Israel there's
strong opposition even from quaked and
Iran both of which were invaded by
Saddam Hussein when he was a US ally
incidentally and of course they hate
said I'm the saying most people in the
region despise and but they don't fear
because they know there isn't much he
can do the only people who are afraid of
them are American in the United States
because they're terrorized by the
propaganda so you know George Bush tells
him every day that if we don't do
something now it's going to bomb us
tomorrow and it works sort of the other
people who are afraid of them are Iraqis
but that's not a good reason to be but
that has nothing to do with the war
they're going to be even worse off they
were more opposed to the war for a good
reason but the people in the region
aren't free I mean they're afraid but
they're afraid of the United States like
most people in the world they're not
afraid of said I hate him but they're
not afraid of
and there's perfectly good reason I mean
everyone wants him disarmed but just
even imagine suppose he had nuclear
weapons what we do with them I'm Alexa
cause I had nuclear weapons in my garage
said could I do anything with them well
there's no nuclear weapons are of no use
whatsoever unless people know you have
but for having my garage nobody knows
about him I can't use it as a threat and
I can't use it to her as a deterrent
right you have to make it obvious you
have but the instant Iraq indicates is
in the most marginal way that it might
have weapons nuclear weapons it's going
to be obliterated okay
and if you you know that okay I'm it
takes a the you know the RAND
Corporation or the Pentagon I'm sure
they have they have groups meeting on
every imaginable contingency after they
even have contingency plans to invade
Canada if you're interested music they
do there's a good book on it but so they
yes they have contingency plans for
anything but I'll betcha they don't even
have a committee dealing with the
likelihood that Saddam Hussein will
threaten anybody with weapons of mass
destruction landed I mean nobody wants
him to have them of course but the
minute he gave any indication of having
them it's suicide okay if he wants to
commit suicide they're easier ways slit
his throat
North Korea had just recently announced
that it was still pursuing nuclear
capability why the lack of response by
comparison to the u.s. is dealings with
the rod what would be the motivation for
just sort of ultimately forgetting about
it I think the reasons are the ones that
were suggested before and that I quoted
yes of Ibrahim but I quote many others
North Korea does not have the second
largest oil reserves in the world and
conflict with North Korea wouldn't help
at all for political reasons in fact it
would be a catastrophe the first thing
that would happen is North Korea would
attack South Korea you know like that
Seoul Japan so there's no political game
to be made by that you see the fact that
North Korea announced it as probably we
don't have all the intelligence report
but it's very likely that the u.s. knew
about this for some time and the
question is why the u.s. decided to
release the information now and keep in
the debate and what North Korea is up to
you can also speculate the usual
standard assumption in the region and
one analyst is that and in South Korea
Japan as well is that North Korea's
playing a kind of a desperate game to
try to gain some to use these threats as
a negotiating card to get a twitch it's
desperately needs it's facing starvation
and destruction and if we were sensible
about this we would follow the lead of
South Korea they're the ones who have
the most involved and their position is
yeah we have to use this for further
diplomatic efforts to try to resolve the
problem and it's a serious problem
I mean if North Korea were to collapse
as it could it would be a complete
disaster for South Korea
I mean they would suddenly I mean you
know integrating East Germany into West
Germany was a serious problem and this
would be infinitely worse I mean it's a
collapsed country South Korea isn't that
powerful probably drive South Korea to
vast decline I mean you can read about
all of this in the Far Eastern Economic
Review in the standard sources book yeah
that's a people anybody sensible wants
to somehow integrate North Korea into
the world Korea and the world system
without causing a catastrophe which
won't be easy
do you see any sort of us responding to
any international pressure see being in
the Canadian anti-war movement
it feels somewhat hopeless to sort of
pressure the Canadian government to sort
of to act Trank includes the US
government because it seems they're not
really responding to international
pressure at all so do you see any role
of City I mean how much of an influence
you can debate I mean the point is
there's a now there's this clear split
among policy planners in Washington and
the sort of number of advisors that they
had and they're all hawks and
reactionaries but there is a extremely
there's a narrow ultra reactionary
fanatic group of extremists who are very
close to power in Washington Rumsfeld
parole Cheney and the rest and they're
frightening the Hawks
so the put aside somebody paper curry
went on just a couple of days ago the
main sort of hardline respected military
analyst strategic analyst for the Gulf
region is Anthony Cordesman
writes all the major papers and so on
and just recently he warned Washington
not to avoid not to pay attention to
what he called the neoconservative
extremists and silly armchair
strategists and their crazy plans for
really you know reconstructing the whole
region by which people I can find
frightening as do many right-wingers and
there is a split but he's talking about
people like Rumsfeld parole by Cheney
the ones who were really planning policy
and they don't have the world frightened
they have hawks in Washington Freud
and that the good reason the that's why
you're getting people like Youssef
Hebron writing things like I just quoted
which is pretty unusual the and that the
world opinion is going to have an effect
on those you know how those forces to
play out the more sane hardliners
understand that the United States can't
just run roughshod over the whole world
because it has approximately it's so
overwhelming essentially learning
military power the extremist elements
the radical extremists they scoff at it
they think we have overwhelming military
force and we can just compel anybody do
anything we want they don't like it get
lost and that split exists and it's
going to be influenced by public opinion
and activism in the United States and in
the world and these things interact like
when people in the United States read
about four hundred thousand people in
the streets and Italy that Spurs action
in the United States and so on it's an
integrated world so there's plenty that
could whether it's enough
you're a couple weeks ago and people
feel hopeless they feel there's nothing
you can do to stop the juggernaut well
they're wrong there's a lot that can be
done somebody else's murderer went off
the happy you know how this will play
out nobody knows you never know even if
you look at historical presidents it's
gone every way you like
so take say the same people 20 years ago
when they were coming in in the Reagan
administration it was very clear that
they were trying to follow their main
concern then was at Central America and
they're trying to follow the course that
was laid out by John F Kennedy who was
their model with regard to Vietnam so
they went through exactly the same steps
and the press might long as usual and so
on but there was an unanticipated
popular reaction in the United States
and they had to back off so they didn't
invade Nicaragua directly there were no
b-52s there were 100,000 American troops
rampaging around Central America
they resorted to massive terrorist
atrocities which practically wiped the
place out but it wasn't wasn't as bad
was fifty two's and troops running
around and they just had to back off
because of public opinion or if you go
back well may recall that German justice
minister was fired a couple of weeks ago
because of saying some obviously true
things which are impolite she suggested
she pointed out that Germany in its own
history has some recollection of the how
unscrupulous leaders were able to
frightened a very civilized population
into hysterical fanaticism with the
consequences to talk about but one of
the things that she didn't discuss him
which is worth thinking about is that
the Nazi leadership didn't trust their
own population there was too much
internal disorder understand so they had
to fight what was called what nowadays
is called a guns and butter war they had
to pacify the population by giving them
crumbs of while trying to fight a war
which is very much what Lyndon Johnson
had to do in the late sixties guns and
butter war and just as in the case of
Vietnam it harmed the war effort the
Allied powers Britain in the United
States where they trusted their
populations we're able to become
virtually totalitarian during the Second
World War there was a national
mobilization everybody participated you
never worried about buying washing
machines and so on and so forth because
people just eagerly participated so the
democracies were able to become far more
to talk terian than at the talat Aryan
States and that gave him an advantage in
fighting the war the Nazi economic czar
Albert Speer said thought about memorize
their claims probably plausibly that
this probably set the German war effort
back by about a year which could well
have been the difference between victory
and defeat
remember toward the end of the Germany
way more technologically advanced in the
allied it was mostly just Russia and the
massive force that was defeating them
and they beat the v2s were coming along
they in another year they might have
been able to hit New York nobody knows
what would have happened so yeah even
the most extreme you know mass murderers
and killers have to pay attention to
their own public opinion they can't
ignore and that goes all the way back
through history says nothing is hopeless
when you think that there is a lot that
can be done and I think this is one of
the reasons why for instance hearing how
people are just been clamoring to get
tickets to hear what you have to say I
think they think what they're hoping for
are some concrete suggests no there are
no the only concrete suggests enjoy what
everybody knows has known for a long
time the thing is to do it okay I mean
we all know how to protest and you know
dissent and organize and educate and so
on these are things that everybody knows
the hard thing is to do something about
so there were any magic keys about how
to proceed somebody would have told us a
couple hundred years ago but whatever
you're interested in whether it's
getting rid of slavery or women's rights
or saving the environment or stopping a
war and so on the ways of doing it are
perfectly well know what it's a matter
of will not knowledge
they want the word to be over by the
time the presidential campaign starts
and on to the next okay and that's in
the works so
well you know roughly I'm in Israel as a
militant independent country anymore
it's a basically an offshore military
base of the US and as such even though
it's a small country is very powerful
military force so according to IDF
analysts Israeli army analysts it's air
and naval forces are larger and
technologically more advanced than any
native power outside the United States
and over 10% of them are permanently
based in eastern Turkey the US bases
there and they're flying at the Iranian
border I mean they don't care much about
Iraq they figured it's kind of a
pushover but they are very concerned
about a grand
and they're probably plans in the works
some scholarly literature on this to try
to go on to dismember Iran and then
reorganize the whole region in fact some
of them are in public actually that's
what courtesan was referring to these
long-term plans which are semi public
which are scared the Hawks but the other
and so I think the idea is to have a
huge build up Saddam Hussein as some
photos monstrous proportions have a
miraculous victory you know in which we
were saved by the courage of the cowboy
and then we've all huddled in fear and
praise their leader and to go under the
next the German justice minister was
exactly correct and describing the model
that worked very well in Germany as long
as Hitler was winning victories easy
victories he was the most popular leader
in German history
and the Germany is is you know it's not
the Taliban and this was the most this
was the center of Western civilization
the most advanced culture in the world
science art literature everything peak
of Western civilization and it turned
out not to be that hard to drive people
into terror that they were that the
Western civilization meaning Aryan
civilization was under attack by the
Jews and they had to fight a war of
self-defense to protect themselves from
this monstrous peril and they didn't as
long as there were easy victories it was
very poppy
especially when the population was being
paid off from you know it's an extreme
case of the model but it's a familiar
model and I'm sure that they're thinking
of what went wrong and 1991-92 when they
didn't do it properly in fact remember
what they did then after the war in Iraq
which I in my opinion was avoidable but
anyway after the war there was a popular
uprising in southern Iraq which might
very well have overthrown Saddam Hussein
had rebelling Iraqi generals and so on
and Colin Powell and George Bush the
first I decided to let sit on crush it
okay so for reasons that pretty well
discuss and that led a pretty a pretty
ugly case so it wasn't just that you
know the end of the war but Saddam was
in place he just crushed the rebellion
with us support I didn't look to didn't
look like a magnificent victory then the
economic problems came along and they
lost election
that's why under the US putting
tremendous participate Canada you're
putting a lot of pressure on Canada to
increase what's called defense spending
defense means offense but standard so
they want Canada to increase military
spending for offensive purposes
part of the reason is exactly what you
say after the u.s. wins the war in Iraq
it wants countries like Canada to come
in and run the country okay
militarily that's called peacekeeping
and make sure that it works the right
way you know like the US will maintain
control of the oil resources and the
wealth flow in the right place and
Canada will pay the costs that's the
role and in the international system not
just Canada others will be enlisted to
the same purpose and they want to make
sure that some kind of government will
be there which will have some kind of
facade of democracy so we'll probably
have a parliament Prime Minister and so
on but it'll be a military run
government under the control of Western
power main US power with the you know
the kind of the client states like
Canada and others doing the dirty work
that's probably the plan
