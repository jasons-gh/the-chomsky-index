it was IU professor Chomsky welcome mr.
Chomsky it's an honor for me to have you
here thank you for being here
glad to be with you tell me after six
months of the Trump government it's
possible to say what about friends the
administration the Trump administration
well there's a one hand Trump on the
other hand the administration they're
somewhat different Trump is basically a
showman him you can he wants to make
sure that every day he's right at the
top of the television news they
concentrate on him and the headlines are
about him and that means doing one
strange performance after another that's
the only way to keep the television
cameras focused on you and it works if
you look over the past six months every
day of turn on ABC look at the New York
Times that's the three cars that's what
it starts with but to give that
administration his modest raishin is
something else you have to look at
people like Paul Ryan it was spent golly
behind the administration he's there he
represents the most savage wing of the
traditional Republican Party of the wing
that's deeply dedicated to providing
support for private power corporate
power and everything else
come made dismissed in fact if you look
at his actual proposals for the budget
they essentially eliminate the federal
budget except for the military and
support for the private wealth and
corporate power and step-by-step that's
what they're doing they take a look
every day usually by stealth something
is happening so for example and while
all attention was focused on the
Twitter's about transgenders in the
military as Secretary of Commerce
quietly enacted rules which will pretty
much destroy the fishing industry and
the Atlantic code
eliminating the regulations that have
been controlling the level of phishing
to prevent overfishing the agenda of the
government it's Paul Ryan's it's Ryan
McConnell it's it's a kind of a wind and
extremist rather savage wing of the
Republicans they've banned on Steve
Bannon there's nobody knows just what
he's doing he's a figure in the
background maybe the rest Putin's won an
analogy from Scotland he has his own
picture very clear he's explicit he
wants a white Christian America and
nothing else belongs he and in fact Jeff
Sessions sucker for the Attorney General
than this and they're acting in the
background one or another way but if you
look at the cabinet it's Wall Street
goldman sachs the most most conservative
reactionary elements that republican
party actually what's going on with the
health bill is very instructive every
proposal that's coming from the
republicans services analyzed by the
Congressional Budget Office turns out
it's eliminating health care for 20 or
30 million people the US system is
already the health system is a scandal
it's about twice the per capita cost of
other comparable mirrors and relatively
poor outcomes the Obama changes improved
it somewhat but for seven years the
Republicans have had one prime
commitment on their agenda destroy that
partly because Obama because Obama
initiated it and after eliminate any
terms of foreign policy what can you say
about Trump the Tramp foreign for lease
well after you know some aspects of
foreign policy I think his position is
somewhat more sensible whatever the
reasons are for it
he is he has made efforts to try to
reduce tensions with Russia which makes
very good sense the threat of accidental
war on the Russian border is very high
any serious strategic analyst is
terrified by the prospects and well
Congress including the Democrat sister
is increasing as acting to increase the
tensions Trump seems to be trying to
control and limit them whatever his
reasons may be that's very hard to
figure out his reasons but speculate a
habit for us do you think that why this
appeasement with with Russia with Putin
probably because he admires a stronger
authoritarian leader maybe business
interests but whatever the reasons
reducing the tensions does make sense in
the case of other areas and makes a will
regularly informed daily that the major
threat that we face is North Korea and
the tensions are growing up there and
the tensions are developing now there
happens to be a very simple way of
approaching the North Korean dilemma
namely accept the North Korean offer to
do exactly what we're asking them to do
we're demanding that they freeze their
nuclear weapons and missile programs and
that's exactly what they've over that
China and North Korea have proposed that
in fact they did two years ago under
Obama
it was rejected then it's rejected now
and the reason it's rejected is because
there's a quid pro quo now that the
United States call off threatening
military maneuvers right at the North
Korean border Trump for example has even
escalated that by sending a nuclear
capable b-52s and to fly right at the
border ships near the border and so on
North Korea may be the worst regime in
the world but they want that the goat
the regime wants to survive okay so one
perfectly sensible possibility would be
to accept the Chinese North Korean offer
for freezing their programs and move on
towards negotiations which might carry
things forward and they might succeed if
you look at the record of the actual
record it does show that whatever one
thinks about the regime they play a kind
of tit-for-tat game if you offer them
something that gives something back you
are a critic of Obama it's possible to
compare the Obama administration eight
years with the six months of Trump the
six months of draw for a real Horror
Story domestically it's just tearing to
shreds every constructive element and
social and economic policy no I mean
they're nothing cutting back of I mean
the worst element the most dangerous
element is his position on climate and
that's not Trump that's their Blair is a
golfer that's the Republican Party every
you take a look at the primaries last
year every single candidate without
exception either denied that what is
happening is happening or said maybe it
is but we shouldn't do anything about it
in fact the Paris negotiations which I
mentioned were aimed at a verifiable
trading but they couldn't reach it
because the Republican Congress wouldn't
accept that the Trump is an extreme
example of Republican denialism and this
is a matter of survival of the species
today what's most danger the climate
catastrophe or the nuclear weapons both
both of the different in character the
climate catastrophe is coming unless we
do something about it
nuclear war is a threat that we've
and living with for 70 years and if you
look at the record which is shocking
there has been case after case of very
close approach to a disaster there is
very significant information that
unfortunately the media are simply not
reporting on so for example in the March
though The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists
in scientific journal dealing with
strategic nuclear weapons had an
extremely important article in which
some of the leading specialists on the
topic analyzed the modernization
programs that Obama instituted and the
Trump was carrying forward and what they
showed is that they kill capacity has
increased enormously to the point where
there is now a first strike capacity
which would wipe out the Russian
deterrent and as they point out this
erodes they a very slender thread on
which stability has hung for many years
the things that as they put it this is
the kind of program that would be
carried out by a state aiming at a first
strike which will eliminate any
retaliation the Russians of course
understand there this is extremely
dangerous nos vamos fazer and Pokeno
Intel Valerie savolta Moscow professor
Noam Chomsky
[Music]
whoa telescope professor Noam Chomsky
linguist a attributes that for each a
medic Colonel professor Chomsky tell me
do you think that there is a decadence
of the American Empire in the world his
power that's a little misleading the
American Empire had its peak of power in
1945 at that point the United States had
probably about half of the wealth of the
world total security controlled the
hemisphere the oceans the opposite sides
of the oceans other industrial powers
had been seriously harmed or virtually
destroyed the US economy boomed during
the war manufacturing quadrupled was
laid the basis for enormous post-war
expansion that was the pink of American
power it started to decline almost
immediately the first significant
decline was in 1949 China when what is
called interestingly the loss of China a
very interesting and revealing phrase
and that's the basis for McCarthyism and
it was responsible for the loss of China
and so on and gradually the world began
to recover from work on disaster
decolonization and proceeded in its
agonizing way the world got more diverse
if your HSA 1970 the world was
economically tri-polar there was a North
American base of power based in the
United States european-based centered
and Germany East Asian base at that time
centered in Japan now including the East
Asian Tigers and China and then the u.s.
wealth was maybe 20% of the world that's
still enormous but not 50% of course us
and since then it's kind of stabilized
the
this is misleading however in several
ways why well one reason is that the
traditional measure of national economic
power is in terms of what are called
national accounts like post domestic
product but the way the world has
changed the last twenty years and that's
no longer a very accurate measure if you
take if you look at the world economy
from a different point of view who owns
the world turns out that US corporations
multinationals owned about 50 percent of
the world economy now that's not us
power but its corporate power based in
the u.s. furthermore if you look at the
military dimension of the US nobody's
even close do you think it's the place
of left in America Brazil in this world
that's a choice that Latin America has
to make if you go back a century
nineteen twenties the Wall Street
Journal they were describing Brazil as
the potential Colossus of the south
comparable to the Colossus of the north
generate resources not face no real
external dangers politically
sophisticated the educated populations
every reason for it to become especially
Brazil but all of Latin America another
center of power in the world it hasn't
happened in fact the one time it really
began to happen was during Lewis
government when along with his very
competent foreign secretaries said a
robbery of the Lula government was able
to turn Brazil into one of the
significant actors in the world stage
but they it simply has not been
sustainable what what is for a striking
to see why it's interesting for example
to compare say
stasia with latin-american say Brazil
with South Korea they go back say to
1960 the South Korea was at the level of
a poor African country a tickle actinic
at Brazil was much Richard per capita
and it's highly unequal in Brazil but
over overall the average per capita
income limits higher of the next 20
years 1960-1980 of both countries that
had a substantial growth rate pretty
comparable and then it stops
South Korea continues to grow and
develop becomes a major industrial power
now Brazil went through the famous 20
walked on lost decades but by now
Brazilian per capita income is I think a
quarter or half of South Korea's and
this is across the board Latin American
East Asia if you ask why other I think
there has been good analysis of it Latin
America has never controlled that it's a
leads they wealthy sectors basically
have no responsibility in the country
they do what they want they export
capital they import luxury goods right
the East Asia is quite different they're
under control but why the popular the
left's populated in Latin America did
not work at the end when as well a
Brazil Argentina even believe you why
this is an melancholic end I don't think
it's an end I think it ought to take a
fair rate of regression but there are a
lot of achievements which I think will
remain so take Brazil on the lots of
things were wrong but many things were
good so the there was a sharp decrease
in poverty
improvement and educational standards
but they locket power and there's a
regression law there's a regression but
I suspect it will come back I don't
think this has happened over and over
the the the fundamental reason is the
failure of Latin American societies to
control the concentrations of wealth and
capital and they leaped power and to
deal with the radical problem of
inequality I mean the Latin American
countries have ample resources they're
in a much better position to develop the
nice tasia no enemies however the
policies that have been pursued have
been quite different so in an East Asia
for example take South Korea Taiwan they
followed the Japanese model they
welcomed investment that was targeted
that was used under careful planning for
development at the same time Latin
America was importing the capital but
luxury goods not capital goods and not
targeting them do you think that
corruption is the main problem in Latin
America or not
it's a problem about a serious problem
but it's a problem everywhere everywhere
I mean even in Spain even in the United
in the United States it's dramatic
depends what we call corruption like put
it take Apple computers the biggest
biggest company in the world they
succeed in barely paying any taxes but
we don't call it corruption what it
amounts to is establishing an office in
Ireland and saying that's the company or
putting the about in the 1990s just as
an illustration there was a period you
may recall a great enthusiasm about
emerging markets no wonderful was too
invest in emerging markets in Latin
America in particular so out of
curiosity I subscribed the Department of
Commerce regular reports they give
detailed reports of every economic
statistic you can imagine one of them is
foreign direct investment in the in the
Western Hemisphere excluding Canada okay
part of Europe and was very interesting
turned out about 25% of it went to
Bermuda 15% went to the British
Caribbean islands 10% went to Panama
if it wasn't to build steel mills with
corruption we don't call it corruption
yet and that's a huge amount of money
one last question mr. Chomsky after so
many years you are 88 years old young
men do you think that the human species
are getting better that we are happier
today than in the past
happier is hard to judge I think there
has been there have been advances so for
example 50 percent of the world's
population or women other than great
advances and women's rights the name of
the civil rights generally there's been
a substantial improvement there is no
concern serious concern for the very
significant threat of environmental
catastrophe and 50 years ago there was
nothing there's much more opposition and
thick the United States opposition to
aggression is far higher than it was in
the past of the United States could not
possibly do something like the invasion
of Indochina the worst crime since the
Second World War that's out of the
question
lots of things to criticize some of them
pretty awful but
there's a general slow improvement with
periods of regression you are an
optimist so the choices are to be an
optimist and to do what you can to make
things better or to be a pessimist and
ensure that the worst will happen okay
thank you very much professor Chomsky

not 50% of course yours that and since
then it's kind of stabilized this is
misleading however in several ways why
well one reason is that the traditional
measure of national economic power is in
terms of what are called national
accounts like post domestic product but
the way the world has changed the last
20 years if that's no longer a very
accurate measure if you take if you look
at the world economy from a different
point of view who owns the world turns
out that US corporations multinationals
owned about 50 percent of the world
economy now that's not us power but its
corporate power based in the u.s.
furthermore if you look at the military
dimension the u.s. is nobody's even
close do you think it's the place of
left in America Brazil in this world
that's a choice that Latin America has
to make if you go back a century
nineteen twenties reading The Wall

Brazil as the potential Colossus of the
South comparable to the Colossus of the

you know transverses face no real

sophisticated the educated populations

for a striking to see why it's
