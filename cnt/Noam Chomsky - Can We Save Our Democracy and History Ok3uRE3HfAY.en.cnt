first of all professor Chomsky thank you
so very much for coming to speak to us
here at Brooklyn for peace and I myself
have this special privilege to to to
talk to you which is for me it's really
you know like a lifetime opportunity so
I cannot even describe how grateful I am
so thank you very much pleasure for me
I've if you remember we met when I was
at Columbia University Graduate School
of Journalism and perhaps that was the
first time if not the only time you came
to speak to the department students
directly yeah and that was also really a
great privilege for me and my fellow
students I remembered that at that time
back in 2000 three years before Iraq
were started you actually talked about
Judith Miller and New York Times and
things like that
and looking back it was like prophecy
that you picked out some important names
out of that very important newspaper and
and the way they do their journalism now
having been a journalism student myself
and working with the media and knowing a
little bit more about how corporate
media really works
sometimes I wonder is there any way we
can do something so that corporate media
is not really so overly powerful and not
able to brainwash the American people
and the world people so easily is there
anything that we can do one way is worth
by honest dedicated participation
actually there are plenty of journalists
who do courageous honorable work I may
not like their the framework at which
they present it but it's you can learn a
lot from it like I read the New York
Times first thing every morning and
there are journalists who do understand
the limits and try to press them break
through them introduce material that
doesn't conform to standard doctrine up
they'll run into constraints but it can
be done
another possibility is developing
alternative media which can influence
the major media simply by their critical
exposure of things that are happening so
an organization like fair for example
the fairness accuracy in media which
does is very sharp and intelligent
critical analysis of the media I presume
has an influence they'll never can admit
it but I'm sure they read it and are
influenced by it
another approach is just to change the
nature of the country popular opinion
can have an impact on the media I might
mention that although a lot of my work
is on the media is critical a good part
of it is defense of the media and it's
interesting that that can't be noticed
so for example if you take the book
manufacturing consent Edward Herrmann I
it's considered harsh attack on the
media condemned as a conspiracy theory
so if you actually read the book which
almost nobody does about a third of it
is defense of the media against a severe
attack by liberal organizations it's
about the free freedom house the
published day to volume study
extensive two-volume study condemning
the mainstream media for essentially
losing the war in Vietnam it's about the
Tet Offensive it's called big story
two big volumes and it's a sharp attack
on the media I may be one of the few
people who actually read the two volumes
if you read them it's interesting the
first volume is denunciation of the
media the second volume is documentation
to try to back it up if you look at the
documentation it refutes the conclusions
in the first part and what it actually
shows is that the journalists performed
professionally honestly courageously
described what was happening but within
a framework of subordination the u.s.
power and doctrine
so they described what was happening but
they said well it's on it's an
unfortunate effect of our the failure of
our effort to defend South Vietnam the
u.s. was defending South Vietnam about
the way the Russians were defending
Afghanistan but the doctrine is so
strong that it cannot be questioned so
that's the framework our noble defense
of South Vietnam is not working but
within that framework there's honest
rageous work the journalists didn't like
that they'd much rather be accused of
being traitors who are the courageous
Tribune's of the people who were
undermining a power and doctrine then
being described as honest professionals
who are conforming to doctrine
unconsciously that's not the image they
like so they don't like this picture but
that's pretty common okay one of the
questions that always comes to my mind
is how to bridge the gap between the
various segments of the ordinary working
class people
for example I've worked with the
immigrant rights movement after 9/11
when so many hate crimes were happening
throughout the city and as a matter of
fact wrote the country and myself being
a first-generation immigrant from
Calcutta having come from a poor
background I've actually seen how poor
immigrants live in New York City and in
various parts of the United States and
so they are struggling and many of them
do not have papers they're undocumented
immigrants and then for the past six or
seven years I've been working with one
of the biggest labor unions in in New
York City the Electrical Workers Union
and I've been working as the labor
educator teaching them some classes on
economics and politics and media and
whatnot now there is such a huge gap
when it comes to understanding the
Solidarity that there could be instead
of finding solidarity for each other
there is so much animosity and acrimony
and even hatred about poor immigrants
undocumented immigrants how do you
bridge the gap it's an old part of
American history goes back 150 years the
immigrants who came were treated very
badly you go back to the late 19th
century Irish immigrants were treated
practically like african-americans like
in Boston were huge Irish immigration
you could find signs saying on the
restaurants no dogs or Irish the some of
the stories are pretty awful like
American the gynecological if I could
have a glass of water maybe the modern
gynecology was developed at places like
Harvard Medical School by
experimentation with live subjects and
mostly black also Irish who were treated
not very differently
the
immigrants from eastern and southeastern
Europe were called mostly Huns and
bitterly condemned this continues what
changed it was workers struggles so if
you get to the great strikes of the
1890s you know homestead things like
that that overcame the divisions in the
working class between the already
established immigrants and the new ones
who they feared and hated the same thing
happened with the black-white relations
much of the hostility was overcome by
joint struggle happened again in the
1930s the CIO organizing that brought
together the groups that had had lots of
hostility racism and antagonism and that
runs right through the history you can
understand the hatred and antagonism
that we made it and they're threatening
us by working more cheaply than we do or
most of its myths but myth is easy to
establish and it can be overcome by
common struggle and by education one of
the real serious consequences of the
decline of the labor movement in the
last half-century is the decline in
worker education you go back to the 19th
century working people that were very
poor that most of them didn't go to
school but they were often very well
educated like the so-called factory
girls the young women from the farms who
went into the textile mills and around
eastern Massachusetts and the Irish you
know artisans were coming to the mills
they read modern literature what was
that in modern literature what we regard
as classics they were politically very
astute you look at their journals they
had their own illiterate they had the
room journals
very sophisticated an Irish blacksmith
let's say in Boston he had enough money
it would hire a boy to read to him while
he was working and that didn't mean
reading comic books that meant reading
what we now regard as classics the
British working class it was the same
there's a wonderful study of reading
habits of the British working class when
Jonathan rose he concludes they were
better educated than the aristocracy and
I can remember I'm old enough to
remember the 1930s my my family were
mostly first-generation immigrants
Jewish immigrants unemployed mostly
unemployed working-class very many of
them didn't barely went to school but
the discussions were the latest concert
of the Buddhist Budapest string quartet
Shakespeare plays every branch of
psychoanalysis every political movement
you can think of that was working class
culture and there was working class
education that many leading
intellectuals that most of them
incidentally associated to the Communist
Party you not allowed to say that that
is true were devoting time and energy
well-known scientists to workers
education a lot of that has just
seriously declined and disappeared and
working-class culture is no nothing like
that what it had been in the past and
all of that matters I mean it's not just
knowing the facts about contemporary
society being part of the the the
general intellectual culture of the
treasures of the intellectual culture of
the past that makes a big difference and
there are absolutely no reason why that
can't be part of ordinary
working-class culture and society has
been in the past it can be known that
could make a major difference also in
understanding questions of say racism
for example knowing the history would be
very illuminating the histories are very
striking
it keeps recapitulating over and over
for example we might remember that the
first aside from Orientals
there was always oriental exclusion laws
but in immigration laws the first real
racist immigration law was 1924 and it
was designed to keep out Jews and
Italians that was 1924 they were the
ones who were denounced and attacked
well they finally made it into society
no others are being subjected to that
professor Chomsky you've just mentioned
about the importance of history and my
own personal feeling and experience
having lived in two countries for
approximately half of my life each first
half in India and second half in the
United States in both countries there is
obviously a huge ignorance particularly
when it comes to the younger generation
otherwise they're very smart people I'm
not even talking about the economic
underclass right now I'm talking about
middle class educated young men and
women unfortunately they have no sense
of history in either country and that is
in my opinion that has really
contributed to their lack of
understanding of politics and economics
and people struggle how do you change
that scenario well partly that's the
educational system which is
designed to prevent understanding of the
real world that's increasingly true in
the last 10 or 15 years with the drive
towards what's called accountability
imposing what amounts to corporate
values in the school system so training
to test we all know from our own
experiences that you can take a course
that you're not interested in and study
for an exam and get a good grade and a
week later you forgot what the course
was about you learn when you have
motivation when you're engaged when
you're searching yourself and so on
that's what good teaching is teaching to
test kills that whatever the motive is
of the people who are instituting it the
consequences are to undermine
understanding and serious education and
to turn people into passive obedient
automata but even the content of the
school curriculums is is designed in
such a way that children cannot get a
real grasp of what the history is so for
example what you and I were just talking
about labor history immigrant history
you'd have to look really hard to find
any of that discussed in American
schools that even in places like say
Pittsburgh where a lot of it was
happening
it's just wiped out and it's right that
because it's a business run society
schools like everything else or largely
run by the business community and this
is not what they want people to know I
could at my own I happen to live in a
suburb with which is considered you know
progressive academics professionals and
so on good school system I remember when
my one of my daughter's was in school
1969 and I have to be that she was 10
years old 4th grade I was looking
through one of her text book
on Colonial New England the design of
the book was that the there was a
protagonist Robert boy their age who was
being shown the wonders of colonial New
England by an older man that was the
general structure and I was curious to
see what they would do about the big
massacres so I looked up the Pequot
massacre
one of the worst massacres and what
happened is that the colonists waited
until the men had left the village to go
hunting or something then they went in
and slaughtered all the women and
children and elderly people and that
everyone fled and it's considered a
great victory so I won't see how it was
what I was described that's how it was
described but as a triumph and in fact
as the protagonist Robert afterwards
says something like I wish I were a man
and had been there so I could have done
it to my wife I showed it to her she was
kind of appalled naturally and she went
to talk to the teacher teacher didn't
understand what she was talking about
couldn't and she said live like you know
it's describing what happened you know
that's the educational system I'm there
after all
- huge crimes that are the basis of
American society the one is the
extermination of the indigenous
population the other slavery are they I
mean there's like a mention of them but
are they taught are there consequences
taught the consequences are very evident
right today in the african-american and
the remnants of the Native American
communities is that presented as and in
fact it's the basis of the growth and
development of American society is that
presented that take say the imperial
wars some of the greatest American
writers like Mark Twain bitterly
condemned the imperial wars the
Philippine war
Twain was a bitter opponent of it his
essays his anti-imperialist essays were
virtually suppressed for almost a
hundred years 90 years even now they're
more or less unknown these are just not
part of the things that were taught our
own history is not thought and that's
understandable those who are in elite
physicians in decision-making physicians
have no interest in having that talk
goes all the way to the universities I
mean there's exceptions of course but
and there have been changes so for
example takes a Howard Zinn's a people's
history when that first came out it was
very harshly attacked by the historians
it wasn't permitted into schools by now
kids are reading it in school
it's and other things have come along it
can be changed but it's work and the
workers education programs they can be
revived and would be very valuable for
working-class people and for dealing
with the human problems of the kind that
you described and so to get back to your
first point the hostility between the
established working class and the
immigrants would be extremely valuable
for the participants in that conflict to
know what 150 years of history has been
and how it's been overcome repeatedly I
have one more question given that in
both India and the United States the two
countries I know well in both countries
we've recently seen a huge right-wing
landslide victories and on one hand
being on the so-called progressive side
it's very disturbing and troubling to
people like us but on the other hand
isn't it true that over time left a
quote-unquote left and quote-unquote
liberal really have lost touch with the
day-to-day struggles of the ordinary
people and they have kind of practice
their elitist
politics and that has actually worked
more to their detriment and if that is
the case I sometimes think and I've
actually written about it that it's time
that we come out of this traditional
left-right box and liberal conservative
box and because at the end of the day
the struggle is really between the 1%
and the 99% is there any way we can find
commonalities across the 99% and bring
them together as long as they're sane
and moderate people and build solidarity
well they're similar there's differences
between the two countries but yes these
developments are taking place Congress
party has you know it's hard to see why
poor and working people could dedicate
themselves to it given its record you
take the Democratic Party here with a
long ago abandoned the white
working-class doesn't even pretend it
was actually a recent memoir that came
out by Al from four men in American
history is the person who takes credit
probably with some justification for
moving the Democratic Party to the right
to becoming what used to be called
moderate Republicans the kind of Clinton
Democrats knew Democrats he thinks
that's wonderful they essentially
abandoned the economic issues that are
critically significant for most of the
population we've lived through a
generation of neoliberal attack on the
population in which for safer working
people now they're kind of back where
they were in 1969 that's serious if the
Democratic Party says well we don't care
about you you know you're just do
something else why should they vote
Democratic
if the latest vote the last election
last week was the lowest turnout since I
think around 1948 middle of the war when
people didn't vote why well for one
reason because whether people understand
what is shown in academic political
science that their voices just don't
matter the opinions of maybe 70% of the
population Louis seventy percent on the
income scale are simply disregarded and
as you move up the scale there's a
little bit more influence when you get
to the very top fraction of 1% of the
population they basically make policy
now people don't have to read academic
political science to know that they know
it in their lives
so I bother as the political I mean
what's happened over the past roughly 40
years is that both parties have shifted
to the right
the Democrats are essentially what used
to be called moderate Republicans the
Republicans are just off the spectrum
they're not a parliamentary party
anymore and that's actually recognized
by leading conservative analysts the
most one of the most respected of them
Norman Ornstein American Enterprise
Institute describes the Republican Party
today as a radical insurgency that has
abandoned parliamentary politics that
you can see it in the last ever since
the Obama election and Mitch McConnell
and others made it very explicit right
off the happening one policy
ruin the country as much as possible
hope that people will blame it on the
Democrats and then maybe we can get
power back again and we can follow our
program of dedicating ourselves with
utter servility to the needs of the very
rich and the corporate sector well now
of course in order to gain votes they
can't say that so what they've done is
mow
lies sectors of the population that have
always been there but I've never really
been politically mobilized like
evangelical Christians nativists who are
afraid that they are taking our country
away from us white racists gun people
who are so terrified that they have to
carry their guns into church because
maybe somebody will come after them you
know these sectors the population are
there and that's now the base of the
Republican Party it was very striking to
watch the primaries electoral primaries
that one after another person came out
from the base each one crazier than the
last
you know Backman can Santorum all raving
lunatics the Republican establishment
was frightened and they poured money in
to try to destroy them and they managed
to knock him down and get one of their
own men in from the kind of
establishment Republican but only by
undermining the base and they're facing
it again right now the base that they've
organized and had to work in I sequester
their commitments are so far to the
right as is no they can't they're having
a hard time keeping it under control I
mean I don't want to draw analogies too
closely but it has some similarity to
what happened in Germany in the 1930s no
I'm not the only one to point this out
incidentally it's leading German
historians of a job it's frightening
well we have so much to talk about but
we have so little time so we probably
have to unfortunately come to a close I
just have one final thirty second
question what's afternoon Chomsky what
is always going to carry the Noam
Chomsky torch forward you plenty of
other people there's lots of people they
should be more prominent better known
but they're doing really good work thank
you very very much thank you for your
time yep
you
