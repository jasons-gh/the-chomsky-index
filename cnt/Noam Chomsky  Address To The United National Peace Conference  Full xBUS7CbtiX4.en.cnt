I'm very pleased to have an opportunity
to say a few words at the Albany United
National anti-war conference and I'm
sorry that circumstances make it
impossible for me to be would be there
with you in person there's no need to
elaborate on the significance of the
task that you're undertaking or the
scale of the challenge we all know that
very well to repeat some things well
known to all of us the United States
spends about as much on war and
preparation for war as the rest of the
world combined it's technologically far
more advanced there are plans on the
books for future Wars that range from
tiny drones that can murder people in
their living rooms to space platforms
for near instantaneous and massive
destruction anywhere in the world the
United States is responsible for about
seventy percent of arms sales and the
United States is alone in barring a
global treaty in regulating the global
arms trade actually for accuracy the
United States is not quite alone it was
joined by Zimbabwe in the latest vote at
the United Nations a fact which is
apparently to him too embarrassing to
merit reporting the United States is of
course now fighting two wars of
aggression in Asia and it's planning a
third military spending is escalating to
unprecedented Heights under Obama much
concern is being whipped up about the
deficit let's put aside the fact that we
should be running a deficit to grow out
of the economic tast raphy that was
caused by the financial institutions
that are now put in charge of putting
band-aids on the cancer for which
they're primarily responsible along with
representatives in Washington but taking
the deficit seriously about half of it
is due to military spending and the rest
is mostly due to the hopelessly
inefficient and costly health care
system imposed by the same hands but the
obvious way that ways to deal with the
deficit are off the agenda a rather
attention is focused on depriving poor
people of their meager benefits well
considerations such as these are serious
enough for those who care about these
this country but there of course
marginal as compared with the costs to
the victims of our dedication through
criminal violence I'll omit the
horrifying details which are familiar to
all of us well I happen to be speaking a
month before your meeting in Albany and
the current pace of events is so fast
that what I say is sure to be outdated
by the time you meet at least in part
I'm speaking shortly after the
McChrystal fiasco and in fact on the day
of the confirmation of his superior
General Petraeus as his replacement it's
generally assumed and quite plausibly
that among the consequences of this
change will be relaxation of the rules
of engagement so that it becomes easier
for US forces to kill civilians and also
extension of the war well into the
future as Petraeus uses his considerable
clout and Congress to achieve this
result the same may well be true of the
war in Iraq we I won't through the run
through the ugly history of that but
will only mention one crucial feature of
that war the u.s. invaders were
compelled to retreat step by step from
their initial war ends that's a major
triumph
mass nonviolent resistance in Iraq the
invaders were quite competent that
killing insurgents but they could not
deal with hundreds of thousands of
demonstrators calling for elections that
the occupying authorities sought
desperately first to avoid then when
they couldn't prevent them to subvert
these facts are of course denied by
apologists but they're understood by the
most serious analyst one good example is
the fine British correspondent a Middle
East specialist Jonathan Steele his
important book on the war is called
defeat quite accurately as the US was
forced to back down war aims came to be
straight as stated with greater clarity
the usual boilerplate about democracy
did not suffice as Washington sought to
hang on in the face of Iraqi resistance
and domestic opposition to the war that
it was unable to quell in november two
thousand the bush administration issued
a declaration of principles for the
United States and the Iraqi government
the declaration states that the US
forces are to remain indefinitely in
Iraq and it commits Iraq to facilitate
and encourage the flow of foreign
investments to Iraq especially American
investments I'm quoting this brazen
expression of Imperial will was
underscored a few months later when Bush
issued another one of his signing
statements in this he declared I'll
quote here that he'll reject crucial
provisions of congressional legislation
that he had just signed including the
provision that forbids spending taxpayer
money to establish any military
installation or base for the purpose of
providing for the permanent stationing
of united states armed forces in iraq
or to exercise us control of the oil
resources of Iraq ensured nothing of
that kind will be tolerated even if it's
passed by Congress and signed by the
president well that was January 2008
that was a last gasp shortly after that
the Bush administration was compelled to
sign a status of forces agreement with
Iraq that eliminated all of these
demands at least formally and I stress
formerly the United States is committed
to withdraw its forces in 2011 and in
fact us forms have US firms oil firms
have not done well at all in the
competition for Iraqi resources but
again stressed formally there's very
little reporting from Iraq and
information is quite sparse it does
appear however that construction of the
huge military bases US military bases is
continuing and it's explicit that Obama
has budgeted a substantial increase for
the huge u.s. embassy in Baghdad not
like any embassy anywhere in the world
it's in fact a city within a city and
Obama has also budgeted the similar
proposals for Islamabad and trouble all
of this indicates plainly enough that
the Obama administration is preparing
for a long stay with a heavy footprint
well as if two wars in the region are
not enough Obama is now building up for
a third war against Iran it's widely
claimed that Iran poses the most severe
crisis facing the United States Congress
has just strengthened the sanctions
against Iran Obama has been rapidly
expanding its offensive capacity in the
african island of diego garcia just
claimed by britain
Britain had expelled the population so
that the United States could build the
massive military base that it uses for
attacking the Middle East and Central
Asia the Navy is expanding facilities
there for nuclear power the guided
missile submarines with tomahawk
missiles which can carry nuclear
warheads each submarine is reported to
have the striking power of a typical
naval carrier battlegroup the Obama
build-up also includes hundreds of
so-called bunker buster bombs the most
powerful in the arsenal short of nuclear
weapons these are intended for blasting
hardened underground structures aimed
for Iran of course the planning for
these bombs began under bush but
languished Obama accelerated the program
sharply as soon as he took office and
there now to be deployed years ahead of
schedule of course aimed at Iran very
restricted we respected British
strategic analyst and flesh he points
out i'm quoting him they're gearing up
totally for the destruction of iran the
u.s. bombers and long-range missiles are
ready today to destroy 10,000 targets in
iran in a few hours the firepower of US
forces has quadrupled since 2003
accelerating rapidly under obama a u.s.
fleet along with an israeli naval vessel
is reported to have passed through the
suez canal on the way to the Persian
Gulf where its task according to our
press reports on quoting is to implement
the sanctions against Iran and supervise
the ship's going to and from Iran the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Admiral Michael Mullen visited
Afghanistan a couple of days ago a
couple of days before i'm speaking on
his return he went is
to meet senior military officers and
planners the major Israeli newspaper
Haaretz reports I'm quoting that the
meeting focused on the preparation by
both Israel and the United States for
the possibility of a nuclear capable
Iran almost none of this has been
reported here although or maybe a cynic
might say because it's plainly of
extreme significance and urgency these
increasing threats of military action
against Iran or of course in violation
of the United Nations Charter and
they're also in specific violation of
security council resolution 1887 of
September 2009 which reaffirmed the call
to all states to resolve disputes
related to nuclear issues specifically
peacefully in accordance with a charter
which they're speaking specifically of
the reach of the Middle East region the
charter of course bends the use or the
threat of force well what exactly is the
Iranian threat there are many
apocalyptic pronouncements but they
don't descend to the level of evidence
or argument there's also an
authoritative answer it was provided by
thorough government reports to Congress
on the military threat of Iran last
April the brutal clerical regime in Iran
has doubtless a threat to its own people
but it does not rank particularly high
in that respect in comparison the US
allies in the region particularly Egypt
which Obama went out of its way to
praise and of course it's not the threat
to the population of Iran that concerns
the report rather it's concerned with
the threat that Iran poses poses to the
region and to the world well the report
makes it clear that the Iranian threat
is not military
quote the report Iran's military
spending is relatively low compared to
the rest of the region and of course
miniscule is compared to that of the
u.s. they say that Iranian military
doctrine I'm quoting again is strictly
defensive designed to slow an invasion
and force of diplomatic solution to
hostilities Iran they say has only a
limited capability to project force
beyond its borders what about the
nuclear option well they report says
that Iran's nuclear program and its
willingness to keep open the possibility
of developing nuclear weapons is a
central part of its deterrence strategy
not offensive though the Iranian threat
is not military that does not mean that
it might be tolerable to Washington
Iranian deterrent capacity is an
illegitimate exercise of sovereignty
that interferes with us global designs
specifically it threatens us control of
Middle East energy resources that's been
a very high priority of planners since
World War two they recognized that
control of Middle East energy resources
provides substantial control of the
world quoting one influential liberal
Democrat sixty years ago expressing a
common understanding that's a burly
Iran's threat goes beyond deterrence
it's also seeking to expand its
influence that's called destabilizing
the region US invasion and military
occupation of Iran's neighbors that's
called stabilization Iran's effort to
extend its influence in neighboring
countries is destabilization and it's
plainly illegitimate which is
incidentally normal usage beyond the
crimes of deterrence and trying to
establish friendly relations with
neighbor
Iran is also supporting terrorism the
government's reports continue by backing
Hezbollah and Hamas if as well on Hamas
happened to be the major political
forces in Lebanon and in Palestine that
is if elections matter in this case the
only relatively free elections in the
Arab world well it's normal and
understandable for elite opinion to fear
the threat of democracy and to act a
deterrent but this is a rather striking
case particularly alongside of strong us
support for the brutal regional
dictatorships well there's a lot to say
about the terrorist acts attributed to
Hamas and Hezbollah which pale in
comparison to us Israeli terrorism in
the same region and in large measure our
resistance to us Israeli aggression and
violence and they could also easily be
terminated if the United States and
Israel wanted to do so okay so from us
that means accepting ceasefires and in
general accepting political settlement
instead of preferring violence brutal
repression and expansion as they're
doing recognizing that they're in
violation of international law and even
specific Security Council resolutions
well that's a long topic of talked and
written about it elsewhere as of others
and I won't go into it here there is a
model for democracy in the Middle East
in the Muslim world despite serious
flaws namely Turkey which has relatively
free elections and has also been subject
to harsh criticism in the u.s.
particularly by the Obama administration
which was particularly incensed just a
few weeks ago when turkey joined with
Brazil in arranging a deal with Iran to
restrict Iran's enrichment of uranium
the deal was pretty much along the lines
that the u.s. had in fact
demanded Obama had praised this
initiative in a litter a letter to
Brazil's president Lula da Silva presume
apparently he did that on the assumption
that the initiative would fail and would
provide a propaganda weapon against Iran
well the initiative succeeded the US was
furious and quickly under minded by
ramming through a Security Council
resolution that was so meaningless the
China cheerfully joined at once
recognizing that at mostly limited
sanctions would impede the Western
interests in competing with China for
Iran's resources once again Washington
acted forthrightly to ensure that others
would not interfere with us control of
the region or whatever the effect on
proliferation the political class
understands very well the threat of
independent forces in the region so
steven cook who is a scholar with the
Council on Foreign Relations he pointed
out that the critical question now is in
his words how do we keep the Turks in
their Lane following orders like good
Democrats New York Times headline
captured the general mood it reads Iran
deal seen a spot on Brazilian leaders
legacy in brief do what we say or else
you'll suffer the consequences if that's
unclear any mafia don can explain
there's no indication that other
countries in the region favor and US
sanctions any more than turkey does on
your ends opposite border Pakistan and
Iran have just signed an agreement for a
new pipeline signed it in Turkey in fact
even more worrisome for the United
States is that the pipeline might extend
to India the US has been trying hard to
stop that in 2008 the United States
reached a treat
within the supporting it is nuclear
programs which indirectly supports its
nuclear weapons programs and that was
pretty clearly intended to stop India
from joining the pipeline in the end
Pakistan incidentally are two of the
three nuclear powers that have refused
to sign the non-proliferation treaty the
third one is Israel all have developed
nuclear weapons with you as support and
still do under Obama well no sane person
wants Iran to develop nuclear weapons or
for that matter anyone one obvious way
to mitigate or maybe eliminate this
threat is to establish a nuclear weapons
free zone in the Middle East now that
issue arose once again at the
non-proliferation treaty conference at
the UN headquarters in early May of this
year Egypt is the chair of the 118
nations of the non-aligned movement and
s chair it proposed that the conference
back a plan calling for the start of
negotiations on a Middle East nuclear
weapons free zone as in fact had a great
been agreed by the West including the
United States at the 1995 review
conference on the non-proliferation
treaty where Washington was kind of
backed into a corner and it formally
agreed but it insisted that Israel be
exempted and of course that has given no
hint of allowing such provisions
provisions to apply to itself Secretary
of State Hillary Clinton stated
wonderful idea but she said the time is
not right Washington also insisted that
no proposal can be accepted that calls
for Israel's nuclear program to be
placed under the auspices of the
International Atomic Energy Agency as in
fact the Energy Agency is now advocating
though without report here
and it's just us again insisted that no
proposal can be accepted that calls on
signers of the treaty including
Washington to release information about
Israeli nuclear facilities and
activities including information
pertaining to previous nuclear transfers
to Israel I'm quoting Washington's
position all of that is blocked Obama's
technique of evasion is to adopt
Israel's position that any such proposal
for a nuclear weapons free zone must be
conditional on a comprehensive peace
settlement which the United States can
delay indefinitely as it's been doing
for 35 years with rare and temporary
exceptions well Obama of course has made
a rhetorical commitment to
non-proliferation that's received much
praise even a Nobel Peace Prize one
practical step in this direction is
establishment of nuclear weapons free
zones another is withdrawing support for
the nuclear weapons programs of the
three Non signers of the
non-proliferation treaty well as often
is the case rhetoric and actions are
hardly aligned in fact they're in direct
contradiction in this case facts that
pass with essentially no comment or
attention well instead of taking
practical steps towards reducing the
dire threat of nuclear weapons
proliferation the United States is
proceeding to take major steps towards
reinforcing us control of the vital
Middle East oil-producing regions by
violence if other maintence do not
succeed with very ugly prospects well
let me turn finally briefly to Obama's
major current war Afghanistan the
official goal is to protect ourselves
from al Qaeda al Qaeda is what's called
a virtual organ
with no specific base the professional
literature describes it as a network of
networks an example of what's called
leaderless resistance that's even more
so now than before whatever al-qaeda is
it has relatively independent factions
loosely associated throughout the world
that's for Afghanistan the latest CIA
estimate is that there may be fifty to a
hundred al-qaeda activists in
Afghanistan and there's the slightest
indication that the Taliban want to
repeat the mistake of offering sanctuary
to al-qaeda which raises questions about
what we're doing in Afghanistan well
there is a new strategy as you know and
the first exercise of Obama's new
strategy was when US Marines recently
conquered Marja small town in Helmand
province which is the main center to the
insurgency here's the report about that
from the New York Times quote the
Marines have collided with the Taliban
identity in Marja are so dominant that
the movement appears more akin to the
only political organization in a
one-party town with influence that
touches everyone we've got to reevaluate
our definition of the word enemy said
we're good dear general Larry Nicholson
commander of the Marine Expeditionary
Force in Helmand province continuing
with Nicholson most people here identify
themselves as Taliban we have to
readjust their thinking so we're not
trying to chase the Taliban out of Marja
we're trying to chase the enemy out
namely the Taliban well you can parse
that if you like but the Marines are
actually facing a problem that has
always be deviled conquerors and that is
very familiar to the United States from
Vietnam back in the early 60s the
leading US government scholar lamented
that
the enemy was as he put it the only
truly mass based political party in
south vietnam and any effort to compete
with it politically would be like a
conflict between a minnow and a whale
our you know there will therefore the
only strategy the US could undertake is
to overcome the enemy's political force
by using Washington's comparative
advantage and violence with horrifying
results that I don't have to review
others face similar problems for example
the Russians in Afghanistan in the 1980s
where they won every battle but lost the
war although it's interesting to learn
from the top US experts there were
fighting with the Mujahideen in the 80s
and who now say that the Russians were
indeed beginning to make progress by the
mid 80s when they adopted the now
fashionable Petraeus coin strategy and
the same experts agree that they met a
one had it not been for the massive
support for the majority by the United
States Saudi Arabia and Pakistan which
included high-tech weapons that
neutralized Russian helicopter forces
also well to remember that the goal
according to the CIA officially was not
to liberate Afghanistan but to kill
Russians the US faces no such opposition
in Afghanistan well after the Margit
triumph the us-led forces were poised to
assault the major city of Kandahar the
US army took polls there which is
released and discovered and reported
that the military operation is opposed
by ninety-five percent of the population
and that five out of six people there
regard the Taliban as in their words our
Afghan brothers well that's again echoes
of earlier conquests for these reasons
the plans were delayed that's part of
the background for the McChrystal fiasco
well under these circumstances it's not
the least surprising that the
authorities are concerned that domestic
public support now low made road even
farther there was a recently leaked CIA
memorandum which observes that the
Afghanistan missions low public salience
has allowed French and German leaders to
disregard public popular opposition and
to steadily increase their troop
contributions to the US war despite the
opposition of eighty percent of the
German and French published public's
it's therefore necessary they say to
tailor messaging to forestall or at
least contain backlash and several
proposals follow for how to delude the
public in the United States the media
can be counted on to fulfill the needed
role voluntarily well this CIA
memorandum should remind us that states
have an internal enemy their own
population which has to be controlled
when state policy is opposed by the
public as is often the case the battle
to control the internal enemy is highly
pertinent today and it should be a prime
concern for those who hope to confront
today's severe challenges as you're now
doing and your task could hardly be more
important thanks
you
