a professor Noam Chomsky in his listed
in anybody's catalogs among the
half-dozen top heroes of the new left
the standing he achieved by adopting
over the past two or three years a
series of adamant positions projecting
at least American foreign policy at most
America itself his essays and speeches
are collected in his new book American
power and the new mandarins are usually
mr. Chomsky writes non-political books
for instance syntactic structures in
1957 a Cartesian linguistics and in 1966
and topics in the theory of generative
grammar 1965 he is a highly esteemed a
student of modern language and
linguistics who teaches nowadays at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and has taught before at Berkeley
Columbia and other strife-torn
universities he was a member of many
organizations and then it societies
including I'm sure he would want me to
mention the Aristotelian Society of
Great Britain in one of his essays mr.
Chomsky writes quote by accepting the
presumption of legitimacy of debate on
certain issues such as this one one has
already lost one's humanity I should
like to begin by asking him why under
the circumstances if by being here he
stands to lose his humanity he consented
to appear in the first place because at
first of all life I didn't quite put it
in those terms I don't think I think the
good is yeah but I think that there are
I say that there are certain issues for
example ostritz
such that by consenting to discuss them
one degrades oneself and to some degree
loses one's humanity and I think that
that's true nevertheless I can easily
imagine circumstances in which I would
have been glad the debate Auschwitz for
example if there were some chance that
by debating Auschwitz it might have been
possible to eliminate it or to at least
mitigate the horror of what was going on
and I think I feel the same way about
Vietnam and I really think that there is
no fundamentally there is no argument
anymore at an intellectual level in my
opinion but I think it's very important
to discuss it nevertheless at what level
is there an argument well there that
there is a policy which i think is a
destructive and devastating policy it's
continuing and the policy the
continuation of the policy is to some
extent based on the fact of public
apathy or public acceptance hence there
still is the necessity to convince
people that that they should act
strongly to put an end of this policy at
what point was there an intellectual
argument at which point did an
intellectual argument in favor of or
intervening in Vietnam ceased to exist
well as I say there I think that there
may have been a time when there was
something to debate for example I think
that in the middle 50s though I was
opposed to the policy and I think that
it was right to be opposed to it
nevertheless I think it was a debatable
issue in a sense in which it is no it is
no longer a debatable issue why is that
because at the moment I think it's
really an issue of the survival of the
existence of Vietnam as a as an entity
as a social and cultural entity I think
that's what's at stake but even that
could be intellectually argued good news
well in the same sense in which
Ostrogoths could be intellectually I
mean in a different sense no I think in
the same sense in fact don't forget
there were people who argued in favor of
Auschwitz engage no no I've gotten that
at all I haven't had any such on this
program though do I intend to but it
seems to me that even if what you said
were correct there could be a perfectly
legitimate argument over for instance
the continuation of the state of Angela
or the continuation of the state of
Biafra or the continuation of the state
of go on but not even I didn't met talk
about the existence of the state I
talked about the existence of the
society as a social and cultural entity
yeah that's what's at stake okay well
what if it's a stake or might there be
two points of view
about how to help it evolved into its
natural forms right oh there are many
different points of view I think they're
very legitimate are there any legitimate
art they see that's it they're very
legitimate issues that can be argued as
to how the United States ought to most
efficaciously
put an end to its destructive actions in
Vietnam there are many different
alternatives that might be thought of
yes the one way of course to put an end
to America's necessary intervention is
to conclude the war successfully that's
a way one possible way is by destroying
which I think it's probably the most
likely outcome yeah well nothing since
one way in which we put an end to the
Nazi occupation of France was by
destroying Nazi Germany right that's
right
and it seems to me that this was a
position which is a terrible position
and mutatis mutandis it's temos you know
it's not only i yeah but people with
whom i the squeal I guess Arthur
Schlesinger jr. refers to your
theological certitude and your liberal
application of them to or everything
subject in what you touch so the subject
of your own intolerance of other
people's point of view is I think itself
linguistically interesting first of all
I don't accept that criticism you see if
you look at that quotation you'll notice
that I put it in there and recall the
context I said that when I argue the
issue I feel a tone of moral and
emotional falseness which I want to
explain but then I go ahead to argue the
issue so that's a side remark intended
to explain my own feeling of emotional
and moral falseness which is real I do
feel it but nevertheless I then go ahead
for 300 pages or so to discuss this and
really sure I don't I don't really
believe that it's fair to say that I'm
not annoying tolerate of the told is you
don't end the book by saying I'm kind of
odd and in feeling this you say
everybody is odd who doesn't agree with
me right no I don't think this is
certainly the burden of your book I
wasn't aware of them I mean I think that
I've given you know an argument well
maybe this is maybe this is a universal
difficulty you are having not being
aware of certain people's reading of
your position well then let me say I
think there for example I think I take
it very qualified and temperate position
on many many issues in this book for
example take the issue of the the
background of the Second World War which
a lot of time on you noticed I end up
with a statement saying that I don't see
any way to give a clear sharp resolution
clear sharp answer to the question what
we should have done under such and such
circumstances I discuss someone who did
take a very strong and I think very
honorable position namely AJ musty
mm-hmm
and I say that I wish I could come out I
wish I could answer the question for
myself whether I feel that I would have
taken or would have rejected that
position but I don't see any way to do
it because the issue is mixed there are
many issues I feel that way on the other
hand see when the issue is the you know
when the issue is let's say three
million tons of bombs dropped on Vietnam
I don't feel that way anymore
nevertheless I'm still perfectly willing
to argue the issue though calmly quietly
and as you would have saved the dropping
of the bombs and doesn't exactly you
know or the atom bomb would yes see
others I'm willing to argue the dropping
the atom bomb but I do feel that it's a
war crime sure but I do think that you
put some people at a disadvantage by
your a priori assertion that any
position the disagrees with your own is
intellectually a barren well I didn't
mean that really let me explain it
didn't come across but what I meant what
I meant for something else I wanted to
honestly state my own emotional and my
own my own feeling about entering into a
debate over this issue
what no Portnoy was no I think that the
point is that I think it's only fair to
an audience of readers to say this is
the way I approach the issue and you
read me on the basis of this
understanding the best I can give as to
the way I'm approaching this issue and
it's perfectly true that when I do if
you notice what I say is that
increasingly over the years in
discussing this issue I felt this
feeling of emotional and moral falseness
and I think it would only be on us to
express it so then to go ahead with the
right so but you you also say that you
hate yourself for not having come to
that position earlier that's a very
great great mistake but I hope to give
you a little solace
