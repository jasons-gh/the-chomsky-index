it's common discourse if you you know
he's studied in political science or
international relations read the press
governments are committed to security
that's their major goal they're
committed to security against their
enemies there's a couple of things that
are not asked security for whom and who
are the enemies well it turns out that
one of the major enemies is you one of
the major enemies of every government is
its own population there are dangerous
we got to know everything about them
that we can we have to control them we
have to make sure they don't get out of
hand every power system believes this
certainly governments do and this is
demonstrated with spectacular clarity
and the especially especially the book
which brings it together in ours
I mean I'd read the reports when they
came out reading it together in the book
it's different you should see it much
more dramatically second point is whose
security are they concerned with is it
security of the population well
certainly not in fact after the plan of
the book reports the spectacular lion
Obama you know she fell Examiners high
officials about how this this operation
is protecting us from I think the first
claim was 54 terrorist attacks were
foiled and then it went down to about a
dozen terrorist attacks with foil and
finally there was a government
Commission which was appointed to
investigate how many terrorist attacks
were foiled they had access to
high-level security internal documents
all the best sources they did find
something one one person had sent eight
thousand dollars to Somalia that's what
this massive operation of control of
everything you do is
about well that tells you whose security
is being excluded example of whose
security is being protected it's the
security of state power from its enemy
and one of the main enemies is the
population occasionally array of light
comes through on this tribute to Harvard
I'll quote the professor of the science
of Government at Harvard I always liked
that table those professor the science
of Government at Harvard Samuel
Huntington back in 1981 he pointed out
that I forget his exact words something
like this that power has to operate in
the dark when it's exposed to sunlight
it wilts and evaporates and then he went
on the same time to say that ever since
the Truman Doctrine 1947 it's been
necessary to try to convince the
American people that we're defending
them from the Russians of course we're
not other goals but that's we have to
convince them and that requires the
power operate in the dark that's the
reason for secrecy this all of this
demonstrates it clearly you can find it
just by searching through declassified
documents if you go through that bore
and occasionally illuminating activity
you find that genuine security is almost
never an issue what is the main issue is
making sure that power can operate in
the dark for its own reasons support for
state power and support for private
power one of the striking things that
emerge from the Snowden revelations been
emphasized in this book is the extent to
which economic espionage is at the core
of these massive operations and not just
the United States
like for example Canada big mining
country uses these techniques to try to
find out what's happening in the British
in the bridge
in the mining and energy the industries
us doesn't say trading partners and so
on you have to expose everything for the
benefit of the forces that really matter
which are not the population the
population has to be controlled subdued
frightened misled and these are among
the lessons that I think come out with a
dramatic clarity from the revelations
and particularly for the book which
together thank you so much for that
you
