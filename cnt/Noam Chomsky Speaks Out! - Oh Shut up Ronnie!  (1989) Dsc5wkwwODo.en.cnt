this program was made before the
Sandinistas lost the elections of
February 1990 typically states regard
the general population as an enemy
that's normal the task and role of the
population is to be apathetic obedient
passive if it's what's called a
democracy they're supposed to show up
every once in a while to ratify elite
decisions but if they get involved in
anything beyond that they're causing
trouble and they have to be controlled
and they're an enemy in the case of one
of those newspapers what happened is
that the u.s. runs security forces
surrounded the office with tanks
destroyed it drove the editor out of the
country with assassination threats after
several assassination attempts and took
care of one of them in the case of the
other one the our security forces there
are forces remember our security forces
picked up the editor and another
journalist in a in a restaurant in san
salvador took them outside cut them to
pieces with the machete and left them in
a ditch somewhere the rest of them that
took care of the second newspaper so
there's no more problem of freedom of
the press in El Salvador meanwhile I
should say in Nicaragua nothing remotely
comparable has happened the opposition
claims harassment and of course it
always hits the front pages of the
newspapers but they're not expecting to
be murdered tortured and this opposition
is extreme it's the kind of opposition
which has never survived didn't have
been a Western democracy in times of
crisis laprincia for example and the
groups around it are openly support the
u.s. attack against Nicaragua nothing
secret about it some people call him a
radical other people say he's just a
realist I'm referring to Noam Chomsky
one of America's Outstanding
intellectuals we have a speech which he
gave in which he analyzed the American
mass media the American power structure
and the American policy in Central
America and you'll be able to see it
right now on alternative views
although this presentation by Noam
Chomsky was made before the Sun and East
has lost their elections of 1990 is
analysis and information are still
extremely important to view and listen
to because the establishment media did
not present them today we have a
videotape of a talk with Noam Chomsky
who's one of the top critics of u.s.
foreign policy in the media Chomsky for
the last thirty years has been attacking
US intervention in the third world US
secret covert wars and the media is
covering up of these events in American
foreign policy I first heard Chomsky
talk in 1966 at Columbia University when
he was the first intellectual to really
speak out against US intervention in
Vietnam and he wrote an article after
article making speech after speech
documenting US intervention in Vietnam
the secret wars in Laos and Cambodia and
attack in US foreign policy throughout
the 70s Chomsky continued to document US
intervention in different parts of the
third world and of the media covering up
the u.s. foreign policy crimes and
presenting legitimation of US policy
recently Chomsky with his friend Edie
Herman had published a book called
manufacturing consent that talked about
how the mass media develops operates to
develop consent around u.s. foreign
policy and for support of the capitalist
system and an imperialist foreign policy
through a variety of different
strategies Chomsky and Herman offer what
they call a propaganda model for the
media in which they have a theory of the
different filters through which the
media filters out uncomfortable content
content that would be uncomfortable for
those that run the media those that are
involved in the US power structure Frank
what's the first filter that Chomsky
talks about well the first one they talk
about is the twin thing of limitation of
ownership
the one thing technological advances
since the 19th century starts and
the 20th century started has have made
it impossible for just anybody with
limited capital be able to start a mass
medium it just requires too much and
then of course when you do need capital
you've got to go to the banks and so if
you can't don't have access to the banks
as any labor or working opposition
wouldn't get any money from banks well
then you're just out in the cold they're
just too much technology and too much
money for the normal working-class
people or organizations to be able to
have a mass medium and that leads to the
second filter which is the advertising
license to do business Chomsky points
out that in the nineteenth century in
the United States and in Britain and
most capitalist democracies there was a
very vigorous working class press that
all the different left-wing political
parties the unions the anarchist
movement all had their press that was
very critical of the existing system the
capitalist power structure and there
were attempts of the by the governments
in the 19th century to censor this left
wing press finally they decided it was
better to let the marketplace do it one
of the ways that the marketplace worked
to filter out the left-wing press and
unpopular opinions opinions would be
unpopular to the capitalist was through
advertising supported media by making
media the press later broadcasting
dependent on advertising support this
meant that advertisers had the choice of
who they would invest their advertising
revenues in what sorts of newspapers
what sort of television and other media
so this forced the press to broadcast
media today to submit to the needs to
the ideologies to the interests of the
advertisers and only to broadcast ideas
that advertisers would want to support
in fact Frank there's another sense in
which both business control of the media
and advertising support of the media and
even a more direct way filters out on
popular opinions within these mainstream
media and that is that the big media
like the television networks have a
gatekeeping function they have managers
reporters who filter out ideas that will
not be hospitable to the owners of the
press to the power structure and the
people that control them and likewise
advertisers have ways to censor programs
General Electric once was one of the
sponsors of 2020 and when Jane Fonda
came on who's an outspoken opponent of
nuclear energy that General Electric is
deeply involved in they refused their
sponsorship so this put a message out to
2020 and other documentary shows that if
you want to get GE sponsoring you can't
have an anti-nuclear point of view or
advocate so this filters out the
anti-nuclear point of view in fact
General Electric now owns NBC they've
completely taken over NBC is easily the
most conservative of all the networks
and that's because the ownership creates
a sort of ethos within the news and the
documentary sections of these media the
people like Tom Brokaw and the others
have produced the news know that if they
want to keep their jobs they can't say
anything that gee doesn't want to hear
whether they're out so it's these kinds
of filters Chomsky is talking about
advertising ownership that filters out
on popular opinions unpopular from their
population their plan popular from our
poornima
the third filter is the sources which
are used by this tablished media the
types of media reporters and all they
because of economics and lack of time
and lack of number of reporters they go
to where it's easy to get news and where
you get that well from government
sources where there are leaks and their
press conferences so you got the State
Department it's easy to get stuff from
them and the Pentagon and the White
House and at the local level you go down
to the local police department to get
the news and also a business
operations and trade organizations are
good sources that's one aspect of this
mass news media sourcing but the media
go further than that reporters think tip
so facto these people in government and
business are credible because their
status and prestige and there were
neckties those little phallic cloth
phallic symbols to show that they're
male and so anyway then the flip side of
this is that they look askance at
anybody who has different points of view
either from the lie right or from the
left they will take the words of these
establishment people without question
because their objective we just reported
what they said their lies that's not our
fault
Reagan lies we're just reporting like I
said but if somebody's say from the
lessor no left or noam chomsky they only
don't know we better check this out
before we talk to him anyway we can't
find any good reliable people from the
left so that's why you get just a narrow
range of people and ideas coming from
the media what's the fourth building the
fourth filter is slot and air enforcers
the media are very sensitive to public
opinion because one they depend on high
ratings for their advertising rates they
don't want to do anything to alienate
broad sectors of the audience and
secondly the advertisers are also
responsible for public opinion or are
also responsive to public opinion
because they're very worried about
boycotts of their products they don't
want to be associated with controversial
shows so if any programming gets a lot
of flack from different right-wing
groups the networks are very worried
about this as advertisers are so the
very fact of the possibility of flak
filters out controversial opinion that
might arouse the ire of different
right-wing groups and in the 1970s in
the 1980s a lot of these right-wing
groups organized themselves to give flak
in case there's any liberal or leftist
or progressive views in the media that
the right-wing doesn't lie
the organization accuracy in media jerry
falwell x'
christian groups and various other
right-wing groups give phone calls write
letters to the media give them flack
every time there's something on there
that they don't like and it's this kind
of pressure that makes the media also
filter out controversial ideas and
particularly liberal or progressive
missed
ideas v filter is anti-communism and
we've seen that those of us who grew up
in the mccarthy era and all have seen
this happening for decades and how it's
used for social control as well as how
to control what's happening in the
medium because if somebody happens to
say something is a little too liberal or
left there soft on communism or they're
promoting the communist line so it helps
to fragment the left and it also permits
those right-wing elements in left
organizations like the labor unions or
know what should be left organizations
like the labor unions it helps the
anti-communist to be able to take
control of these and purge any of the
more progressive elements out of it it
helps to keep opposition politicians in
line to just say oh you're soft on
communism that's enough to make enemies
lily-livered liberals are on for sure
hmm so with all these different filters
the mass media according to Chomsky
manufacturers consent to the existing
system people conform to submit to the
institution's values policies of the
established society and the media makes
sure that nothing gets in that's going
to disturb this legitimacy of the system
it's going to raise questions create
problems for the managers of the system
when over Chomsky and Herman go through
a lot of case studies in which the media
manufactured consent around us foreign
policies in Vietnam the Reagan policy in
Central America all
different ways that the media actually
served the interest of conservative
policy by manufacturing consent around
these policies of the subject matter of
these books but there is also a problem
which media constantly have and that is
they say okay we're the watchdogs of the
system we're objective we present all
points of view and so they have to do a
little bit of muckraking they have to
bring a little bit of other things and
you have some reporters who are really
seriously interested in digging into
some of the skeletons and so you do find
some of these things happening in the
media so this drives the people and the
elites and the right-wing crazy but the
as Chomsky and other people have pointed
out this still can be effective because
they don't present enough of the
opposing points of view or enough
alternatives to the way of looking at
things or doing things so the people
really can become just kind of confused
or disoriented rather than completely
believing the establishment line so this
is functional too along with apathy they
hope that the populace will be apathetic
and the media have a way of of doing
this also when Ellis turned to Noam
Chomsky and get his views on the
American power structure the mass media
and the American policy toward Central
America it's a production of the media
process group some access activists in
Chicago and the program is called labor
beat
we propose as a segment of public access
our labor access channel the workers of
Chicago should be not only consumers but
producers of information as the streets
are a podium for free speech the
airwaves are a forum for visual
expression of our concerns as people who
shape and create our society
what's the next phase of the war and
peace process in Central America on
March 2nd 1988 noam chomsky professor of
linguistics and philosophy at MIT spoke
on this question with Northwestern
University campus sponsored by the
Evanston Committee on Central America
Chomsky is the author of numerous books
and articles on international affairs
and is an expert on Central American
politics here are excerpts from that
speech I wanted to do was focus
attention on the coming phase of the
conflict now well over a century old
between the United States and
essentially essentially the population
of Central America that's been an
ongoing war an unequal war the victims
are all over there and there are many of
them it entered a new phase in the 1980s
and it entered another phase beginning
on February 3rd change and the character
of this war and I do want to focus on
this coming phase February 3rd I picked
because that was the day in which the
Congress responding to substantial
popular dissidents imposed certain
limits on the what the World Court
called the unlawful use of force by the
United States and its attack against
Nicaragua I'll come back to the
background and details of that but let
me mention that February 3rd is also
opens a new phase in another war that's
been going on at the same time and
that's a war between the our government
and its population now that's not
unusual
typically States regard the general
population as an enemy that's normal
the task and role of the population is
to be apathetic obedient passive if it's
what's called a democracy they're
supposed to show up every once in a
while to ratify elite decisions but if
they get involved in anything beyond
that they're causing trouble and they
have to be controlled and they're an
enemy now among elite groups there's
variation there are tactical variations
and the Reagan administration happens
be at a rather extreme end of a spectrum
but it is it's not the spectrum hasn't
changed it's the old spectrum they just
happen to be extremists within that
spectrum and their fear and hostility of
the general population is also extreme
also they happen to be pretty open and
frank about it so they tell you if you
bother to listen one of the first things
that the Reagan administration did back
in the early 80s was to establish within
the State Department a thing called be
an institution called the office for
public diplomacy which had the task of
controlling public debate and discussion
setting the framework for discussion so
it carried out operations like what they
called operation truth which is one that
or will would love and it had about as
much relation to truth as you would
expect something to have with that title
it was exposed all of this was exposed
more or less last summer in the by one
of the few reporters who actually gave
serious coverage to the iran-contra
hearings by that I mean didn't just pick
up the release that was handed out but
actually bothered to look up the
documents Alfonso charty of the Miami
Herald back around July or August or so
he exposed the unit and now a study of
documents that had been released about
the office for public diplomacy and he
went to members of the Reagan
administration high administration
officials and asked them to explain you
know account for all of this and they
were quite frank and happy about it they
described the this brainwashing
operation
as one of their most spectacular
successes and one which is correct if
you think about a lead opinion was very
successful in setting the discussion and
debate about Central America in the
Quran in particular in fact one high
administration official described these
operations to chardee as the kind of
operations you would carry out an enemy
territory now that's a telling an
accurate phrase from the point of view
of the administration the population is
enemy territory and the people are
inhabitants of enemy territory and you
got if you can't control them by force
you got to control them by property
and now again that's not a position
that's unique to this administration
it's a standard position going into it
later if you like it's very it's long
articulated in our history back to the
origins of the of our society and it's
very typical of other societies as well
but the Reagan administration is at an
extreme point and they did they were
very proud of their successes in the war
that they conducted an enemy territory
at home that is the ideological war now
if you can't control the if you can't
control the population by force and you
even and you can't even control it by by
propaganda the state is phases of the
lemma and if that only one thing they
can do in that case and that is to go
underground and in fact that's just what
happened during the 1980s operation
truth worked very well the office of
public diplomacy succeeded very well
among elites who basically agreed with
the policies anyhow but it didn't work
very well among the general population
in fact it worked very badly the
population is more dissident and active
today than any time in the last
generation
contrary to what you often hear there's
not much articulation of this because
the elites don't reflect it and Congress
is on a very weak reflection of it the
media virtually no reflection at all but
in the general population there's plenty
of activism and dissidents and you can
tell it and the Reagan administration
learned it very quickly they were very
quickly driven underground they were
driven underground by the opposition the
inhabitants of enemy territory who were
not going to tolerate the actions that
they intended to carry out now
clandestine activities in any state are
a pretty fair measure of the level of
popular dissidents open violence open
overt terrorism and aggression are far
more efficient than clandestine
terrorism they just work a lot better
and furthermore they don't bear the risk
of exposure which sort of causes all
kind of problems when it occasionally
happens so when a state turns to
clandestine terrorism clandestine
violence it's because it's forced to and
it's forced to by its own population
clandestine activities are not a secret
from anybody else what are called cover
operations are obviously not a secret to
the victims the kinds of operations that
were in there so it takes a the
operations that were partially exposed
during the iran-contra hearings plainly
they weren't a secret to the victims
they weren't a secret to the mercenary
states who were enlisted in the cause
they weren't a secret to shady
businessmen like you know Richard Secord
and the rest out to make a buck
in fact they weren't even a secret to
Congress and the press if you want to
know the truth they were just at a low
low enough level so they could be
suppressed the only people that they
were secret from was enemy population
the enemy territory at home there they
were a secret the general population
didn't know about them and that's the
point of seek of clandestine operations
clandestine operations are always a in
part a war against the domestic enemy
and when a state carries out extensive
clandestine operations it's very much
afraid of its domestic enemy and that's
what happened in the 1980s during the
period August 2 January August 87 to
January 88 the Reagan administration
Congress and the media so elites
generally had a certain task their task
was to demolish the Guatemala City
Accords to which they were opposed and
the Accords were unacceptable to
Washington therefore they had to go well
how do you do it there were a number let
me first notice that there were a number
of features of the Accords which were
completely unacceptable in Washington
the central feature of the Accords was
what the simultaneity feature you look
at the way the Accords were structured
they were based on the idea that a
number of things have to happen
simultaneously in the various countries
and so on
now that's unacceptable to the United
States for two reasons for one thing the
simultaneity requirement would plates
barriers in the way of the United States
attack against Nicaragua and that's
obviously unacceptable
if the because the United States intends
to continue the attack in one way or
another so that's out and on that
there's an elite consensus there's no
debate over this in the media or in
Congress with very marginal exceptions
the simultaneity condition has to go the
Accords must be interpreted so that
applied to nicaragua and nicaragua alone
that's what that means and that was done
very effectively there been a number of
studies of the media that give the exact
numbers but anybody's been reading the
papers or watching the tube knows the
story the idea that there have to be a
number of things happening at once is
unacceptable because it would place
barriers to the u.s. attack and since
that's not acceptable simultaneity
condition which is the core or the
accords has to go there's another reason
why the simultaneity condition is
unacceptable it would place barriers on
the US attack against the populations of
Guatemala El Salvador and Honduras
because the Accords call for measures to
preserve Liberty and security and
freedom and you know access to free
expression and so on and so forth a
whole range of measures which are
completely unacceptable to the United
States and cannot be possibly be carried
out unless without structural changes in
those countries that would take that
would eliminate the whole security
apparatus which was designed with the
support of the United States in the case
of Guatemala and Honduras and there's
and developed and imposed by the United
States in the case of El Salvador
designed precisely for the purpose of
preventing that to happen it was
designed for the purpose of traumatizing
repressing torturing and killing if
necessary the domestic population so
that they won't cause any problems
anymore those are the kinds of states
where you don't worry about propaganda
you go after the jugular if people start
to open their mouths and that's what we
did down there and plainly those
measures cannot be stopped there's no
way for the Accords to apply to the u.s.
terror States it's inconceivable they'd
have to undergo a radical internal
transformation
so therefore the simultaneity
requirement is unacceptable for that
reason alone now let me stress again
that there's an elite consensus on this
for example say take the matter of
freedom of the press you'll notice that
there has been no debate in the United
States no discussion in the United
States during this phase of the Accords
on freedom of the press saying El
Salvador in fact what we hear is they
already have freedom
press and a certain technical sense
that's true that is there's no law in El
Salvador which says you can't have an
independent newspaper you don't need a
law there was an independent press in El
Salvador in 1980 when the United States
moved in to turn it into a Nazi style
terror State there was a free press in
fact there were two independent
newspapers not leftist or anything like
that mainstream independent newspapers
La Coruna con el Independiente well
they're not around any longer in the
case that they were never censored
because we hate censorship in the case
of one of those newspapers what happened
is that the u.s. runs security forces
surrounded the office with tanks
destroyed it drove the editor out of the
country with assassination threats after
several assassination attempts and took
care of one of them in the case of the
other one the our security forces there
are forces remember our security forces
picked up the editor and another
journalist in a in a restaurant in San
Salvador took them outside cut him to
pieces with the machete and left them in
a ditch somewhere the rest of them that
took care of the second newspaper so
there's no more problem of freedom of
the press in El Salvador and you'll
notice that nobody none of these sudden
libertarians who were so concerned about
freedom of the press have called for a
reopening of an independent press in El
Salvador nobody ever heard the words
electronica el Independiente you hear
about La Prensa including many lies but
nobody hears about free and of course
nothing remotely like this ever happened
in the garage WA but you never hear a
word about freedom of the press and in
El Salvador in fact these events that
these two newspapers to be precise there
were three references to what I've just
described in the entire 1980s in the New
York Times so he can't claim that we
don't have a free press here but it was
so you know if you're really a scholar
and you got a terrific memory you can
remember that something unpleasant
happened there but it's certainly not an
issue
we don't look into the question we don't
nobody calls for freedom of the press in
El Salvador and for two very good
reasons for one thing Washington the
Office of Public Diplomacy has ordered
us that that topic is off the agenda
we're not supposed to talk about that so
I'm there for being loyal cowards we
naturally obey so that's one reason the
other reason is that the call for a free
press in El Salvador would be ridiculous
you can't have a free press in El
Salvador without first dismantling the
whole terror system that the United
States installed precisely to ensure
that you can't have things like a free
press or for that matter Bible study
groups that might turn into peasant
self-help groups and in fact all the
developments that cause Washington to
unleash the terror apparatus so the
sense is absurd to ask for a pre press I
guess is no point in doing so in any
event no one asks about it meanwhile I
should say in Nicaragua nothing remotely
comparable has happened the opposition
claims harassment and of course it
always hits the front pages of the
newspapers but they're not expecting to
be murdered tortured and this opposition
is extreme it's the kind of opposition
which has never survived it have been a
Western democracy in times of crisis
laprincia for example and the groups
around it are openly support the u.s.
attack against Nicaragua nothing secret
about it I just had the I guess I'm not
sure it's happy experience but
experience of reading three months worth
of La Prensa I must be the only person
outside the CIA who actually has all of
La Prensa since the time was opened in
my office at home and it's just openly
Pro contra don't even hide it no it's oh
it's simply a US government
disinformation or Oregon I mean to allow
the journal to publish it's as if in the
United States during the Second World
War the media were largely dominated by
Japanese fascist journals calling for
the overthrow of the US government and
the liberation of you know the
territories in the Pacific from the
racist murderers in the United States or
something like that
I mean such things are inconceivable you
know it never happened in the West and
the same is true of what we call the
opposition which openly identifies with
the u.s. attack against Nicaragua and
regards the US is there only basic
political support well that they they do
get harassed
you know they get censored and that sort
of thing they don't get murdered in El
Salvador there's nothing even remotely
similar instantly the press knows all of
this but will never report any of it
inconceivable if they report these
things though every journalist in
Managua and San Salvador knows it but
again nobody is talking about the
application of the terms of the Accords
which would permit the opposition even a
mild opposition to function nobody's
talking about those conditions in El
Salvador that's off the agenda and in
general all the simultaneity
requirements are unacceptable because
they would require the dismantling of
the terror apparatus that the United
States took such pains to impose and
still supports now another feature of
the Accords that's unacceptable was
international verification the Accords
had in them a provision for verification
an international verification commission
which included the five Central American
countries the Latin American democracies
the Contador countries the OAS the
Organization of American States and the
United Nations well plainly that's
unacceptable essentially for the reasons
I just mentioned international
verification would put barriers in the
way of the US attack against Nicaragua
and the u.s. attack against the
populations of El Salvador Guatemala and
Honduras via the terrorists apparatus
the military regimes which were either
imposed or supported for that purpose so
that's unacceptable another reason why
international verification is
unacceptable to the United States is
that the Latin American country is
though dependent of course on the United
States after all we are the 800-pound
gorillas they're dependent on the United
States and there are limits beyond which
they can go nevertheless they have a
degree of independence they have a
degree of independence and therefore
they're not allowed in at all in fact
nobody with a degree of independence
from the master of the hemisphere is
allowed in so plainly international
verification has to go and in fact the
demolition job on the accords was
completed by January by January the
simultaneity condition was thrown out
international verification was
terminated and in fact nothing remains
of the Accords they are finished they're
part of ancient history nothing remains
of the go out
of course the press may talk about the
RAS cords and so on but either they're
lying consciously or else they're
unwilling to bother to look the fact of
the matter is there is nothing left of
those Accords what is left is a version
of the Accords written in Washington and
transmitted by the press and accepted by
Congress and that version says Nicaragua
has to exceed two arbitrary demands
stated by the United States government
whatever they happen to be
that's the Accords and that's all there
is left there's nothing left of the
original text well what were the means
used to destroy the Accords this is a
very successful demolition job what were
the means used well there were two kinds
there were military means and there were
ideological means you might say the
military means were first of all and
most important the intensification of
the CIA supply flights that was the most
important event that happened during
August to Dan uary as I mentioned the
supply flights which of course illegal
to start with were sharply intensified
to about two to three a day and also US
surveillance flights which is a very
expensive surveillance apparatus
although fanciest sr-71s and u2's and
satellites and spy ships off the coast
of so on are carrying out intensive
surveillance of Nicaragua and that was
extended to now both of those operations
are significant the supply flights are
crucial in fact critical because as is
recognized on all sides of this debate
the Contras the proxy army are not
guerrillas they have no remote relation
to guerrillas the KGB doesn't fly two to
three supply flights a day into El
Salvador to keep the guerrillas in the
field and nobody's talking about sending
humanitarian aid to the guerrillas you
don't have to because they're part of
the country they're rooted in the
country they fight inside their own
country they've got their own network of
support in fact the reason for us terror
in El Salvador has been to try to
destroy that base of support but they
don't need supplies they don't have to
give it to the countries on the other
hand have to get everything from food
- fancy communication equipment - boots
- arms and so on because they're not
part of the country they're a foreign
implant that's what it means to sit in
fact you nobody nobody really denies
this is not a topic for debate you know
the Reagan administration first ones to
tell you that this force is going to
collapse unless we continue to provide
them with arms and supplies the meaning
of that which they don't bother to tell
you in the press but you can figure it
out
the meaning of that is they're not
guerrillas because nobody does this for
guerrillas and in fact that's written
into the Accords it sounded well
understood in Central America you take a
look at the actual wording of the
Accords and they say that an the
indispensable element for peace in the
region is an end to any form of support
and they mention military logistical
propaganda or whatever - two kinds of
groups namely irregular forces and
insurrections movements now the
distinction for that is that the
irregular force of the Contras foreign
for foreign organized forces attacking
some country the insurrectionist
movement our movements our indigenous
guerrillas and the indispensable element
of the Accords is the termination of any
form of support for them any form
logistical or whatever and of course the
as a corollary the use of one country as
a territory for for insurrection astoria
forces attacking another in January the
International Commission the
verification Commission gave published
its report now that was plainly the most
important thing that happened in January
here's this commission made up of the
five Central American countries in the
Latin American democracies and OAS and
UN had investigated all the countries
they finally came out with a report now
we can finally get an independent
objective assessment of the compliance
with the with the Guatemala City of
Courts well it was mentioned in the New
York Times we have a free press it got
actually one sentence in the New York
Times buried in an article by James
Lemoine in which he stated that the
conference that the Commission broke up
in this agreement well in fact this
report was unanimously accepted but that
was the total description in the news
report on January 14th when fifteen
report was issued on the 14th
other here and there you could find the
Chicago Tribune actually covered it in
this case but there was very little
coverage well and you can see why the
conclusions of the Commission were just
not useful for ideological warfare why
well first of all the Commission
denounced the United States it singled
out the United States and the United
States alone for condemnation because
the United States had undermined the
indispensable element for peace in the
region by continuing its support for the
irregular forces attacking the garage or
from Honduras and in fact from Costa
Rica and that that's the central
condemnation in the Accords well plainly
that's useless now the Commission went
on to say that they couldn't provide
detailed comments on the particular
countries of the region and the reason
for that was that three countries
objected El Salvador Guatemala and
Honduras the three u.s. terror states
would not permit a description you can
figure out for yourselves what the
description would have been and but the
US wouldn't allow it
through its clients it blocked any
description of the however they did
carry out a press conference in Costa
Rica and there the delegates discussed
this at Latin American representatives
spoke openly at the press conferences of
what they called they said they were
shocked by the attitude of patent fear
in the faces of opposition people and
trade unionists in El Salvador in
Guatemala the two u.s. terror states
claimed there's no point reporting that
the Commission also praised Nicaragua
for what they called concrete steps
towards democratization despite the
ongoing u.s. aggression well it's
plainly useless in fact none of this is
useful for ideological warfare so
therefore it didn't happen and the
reporting is virtually zero in the New
York Times which is the most important
newspaper worse than zero one sentence
which was a lie the Commission plainly
had to be disbanded and the u.s. simply
insisted that it be disbanded the main
US client in the region Jose Napoleon
Duarte who is a Democrat by definition
because he follows us orders it's also
one of the worst murderers and
three of Latin America and he's reviled
and detested throughout Latin America
for this region but here he's very
highly praised he said with some insight
I think that it wasn't really necessary
to have an International Commission of
verification because he said the press
would suffice for verification that's
quite right that provides that expresses
a real insight into the workings of the
press well that took care of the
international verification Commission so
one element of the course the basic
element of the chords is gone no more
international supervision and
recognizing that the powerful make the
rules and the weak just obey Nicaraguan
President Ortega then announced that
Nicaragua would adhere to the conditions
of the Accords alone a lot happened
between the time of the speech by Noam
Chomsky on the 3rd March 1988 until
about the 3rd of April when this
videotape was made March 1st the
conscious attack to Nicaraguan village
March 2nd the Republic encounter aid
plan was voted down the next day talks
between the Nicaraguan government and
mosquito Indians began by March 4th
Democratic contr aid plan was voted down
two days later there was an
investigation of misuse of American
funds in El Salvador
March 9th negotiations between the Sun
and aces and the Contras were canceled
the next day the Contras released a
captured American the day after that the
country is agreed with talks with
Nicaragua
March 12th Robert McFarlane pled guilty
to withholding contr information from
Congress on the 15th Senate voted to
force the President to inform them about
covert operations the next day the Costa
Rican President opposed contra aid then
the big four was indicted for conspiracy
the u.s. sent troops to the Honduran
border saying the Nicaraguan invaded
which Nicaragua at nine the next day the
troops did arrive from the United States
and the following day Oliver North
resign Duarte and El Salvador almost
lost control of the National Assembly
American troops moved within 15 miles of
Nicaragua and the Nicaraguan country
talks reconvened on the 24th temporary
truce
the Nicaraguans and the Contras was
ironed out all the heavies pleaded not
guilty and the Contra gate affair March
28th Nicaragua freed the prisoners under
ceasefire agreement and the next day the
negotiations began on the 30th Congress
approved more contra aid they prefer the
ceasefire began in Decorah guaa the next
day the u.s. sent 1300 troops to Panama
that's of March 27th 25,000 people have
been killed in this American sponsored
contra war against Nicaragua
and there's a very good article in the
propaganda review in the winter of 1988
that's the anatomy of a disinformation
campaign that illustrates very well Noam
Chomsky and Edward Herman's view of the
media and the way they manufacture could
sent to certain conservative policies
what this article deals with is the way
that the mass media presented the
aftermath of an attempt to assassinate
the country leader Eden Pastora that
took place on May the 31st of 1981
Pastora was a sandanista hero hero of
the Nicaraguan revolution who went to
Nicaragua with the Sandinistas after the
Revolution and was a major figure in the
government he then left Nicaragua
because he thought they were becoming
too closely involved with Cuba and the
Soviet Union
so eventually Pastora joined the Contras
and started engaging in fights against
the Nicaraguan government to try to
overthrow the Sandinistas he got
completely fed up with the other country
forces though that were directed with
the CIA so I made the thirty-first of
1984 he called a press conference to
denounce the other cultural leaders to
separate himself from them and to
renounce his Contra activity at that
press conference a bomb went off that
wounded many of the journalists there
that harmed past Dora and some of his
contra friends and the killed some other
journalists right after that bomb went
off
ABC and PBS reported that the bomb was
set off by a Basque ETA a terrorist who
was working for Nicaragua the Basques
are a mountain people in Spain who want
an autonomous country free from Spain
and from France and had been engaged
occasionally an armed struggle for
Basque independence for many years and
what happened was a disinformation
campaign was set up there was a
so-called Basque terrorist of involved
in themselves in terrorism in political
assassinations and violence in Central
America as surrogates of the Nicaraguan
Contras the source for this story was a
former member of the el salvador
liberation group who told the member of
a reagan group the office for public
diplomacy that the Basques were very
active in terrorist activities in
Central America the office of public
diplomacy was a Reagan administration
office there was the first state
propaganda bureau that the US government
ever had that is an agency to create
propaganda and disinformation for a very
specific policy which was that of the
Reagan administration policy in Central
America so the office of public
diplomacy put out a report that they
paid one of their employees to publish
that the Basques were very active in
terrorism in Costa Rica El Salvador and
other Central American countries this
had the first effect of souring the
relationships between the Costa Rican
government and the Sandinistas all sorts
of stories were leaked to Costa Rica and
newspapers at the time the Costa Ricans
were trying to get better relations with
the Sandinistas that the Sandinistas had
sent terrorists to Costa Rica to carry
out political assassinations to bomb
people in the Costa Rican government in
the US Embassy in a country forces there
and although there was no evidence ever
that bosque were actually operative
there that stories were printed in Costa
Rican newspapers so after the Pastora
attempt at his assassination the bombing
of Pastora the office of public
diplomacy revealed documents about this
Basque terrorist group and claimed that
one of
top tariffs were there who was the one
that was attempting to assassinate
Pastora and he was a sandanista he
terrace and leaked this story out to the
media
well ABC and PBS both picked this story
out there were dupes of disinformation
on June the 1st ABC on their world news
room tonight
reports boldly stated that there is
quote growing evidence that the
Sandinistas have hired international hit
men from a Basque terrorist group known
as the ETA to have Pastora
killed they then went into the whole
details of the supposed Basque terrorist
operations in Central America and said
that all the evidence points to this
Basque hitman and presented this as a
sandanista plot which some people
thought might be a prelude to a US
invasion of sand and east of nicaragua's
was an attempt to create hostility and
tension between the Costa Rican and the
sandanista government now this is ironic
because as it came out later the guy
that really did the assassination
attempt of the Pastora was was related
to the john hall Oliver North Richard
Secord network it later came out that
this terrorist whose picture was at the
news conference a well-known
international terrorist landed on John
Hall's our ranch got explosives from
Hall that were provided by Richard
Secord who was a top man in the north
Network and that Hall gave him the
explosives gave him the false passport
and press credentials to get into the
press conference and that helped an
escape later this was this came out in
the Christic Institute lawsuit which
began with the lepen Kabbani
one of the plaintiffs in the Christic
Institute suit was Tony IV known and
Martha honey who Tony was a harmed in
this bombing and so he did research and
point it to John Hall's
Ranch so all the leads pointed to John
Hall Chomsky talks about other ways in
which the media simply lie about things
for instance he made a study of the
Washington Post and The New York Times
for January February and March of 1987
he looked at all the editorials and
found they were all anti sandanista and
he said Chomsky said they're two very
striking things about these sanity's the
government compared to the others
government's in Central America Honduras
Guatemala and El Salvador one that
Sonnen ista government doesn't slaughter
its own population whereas the other
three hunters Guatemala and El Salvador
have killed over a hundred and fifty
thousand of their own citizens just in
the 1980s and second that's never
pointed out by the media is that
Nicaragua was the only one of those
countries in which the government has
tried to direct services to the poor and
diverted resources for social reform and
education
he said well Honduras is a little bit
different from Guatemala and El Salvador
they they're don't kill somebody but
they just let the rich rob the poor so
it's also very interesting his analysis
in another propaganda review this in the
winter 1987-88 Chomsky says that very
interesting things happen in the 1920s
he talked about even a world war one a
bunch of American Historians offered
themselves to President Woodrow Wilson
saying that they wanted to do some
historical engineering so that they
could get together and engineer the
facts of history so that was sort of the
state and in 1921 famous American
journalist and pillar of the
establishment walter Lippmann said that
democracy can exist only if there is
manufacture of consent among the people
so you can see the problem democracies
have Soviet Union or totalitarian states
they say by God this is it and we have
state censorship but you can't quite
work with such a heavy hand and
democracy so what they have to do they
have to control what goes out and they
have to control what people think
so as Chomsky said one of the ways to do
this is to create a debate so that it
looks like a lot of opinions are working
a lot of different information is coming
in but actually it's all working within
a very narrow margin very narrow
spectrum all acceptable by the elite
knobs key is one of the great
intellectuals of our time and yet let's
see I saw him once on with an interview
with the guy from PBS Illinois that's
our interview series with Chomsky at the
time at his book manufacturing consent
came out but he's hardly ever on the
mainstream media simply because he's
such a radical critic well then I might
know that he's our he's a very
respectable professor at MIT he's one of
the experts in the field of linguistics
he's one of the top theorists of
language and linguistic activity in the
whole country so he basically has two
academic careers as a researcher and
critic of American foreign policy in the
media and is a specialist in the science
of linguistics where he's probably one
of the most respected theorists in the
entire world for that matter here's an
example of what the establishment does
to Chomsky as well as not letting him on
TV he's been forced to publish most of
his work with small circulation presses
because the big mainstream mass
circulation organizations won't won't do
it
there they almost did once back in the
early 70s warner modular publications
which is a subsidiary of Warner
Communications signed a contract with
Chomsky Chomsky and Edward Herrmann to
write a book called counter
revolutionary violence bloodbath in fact
and in propaganda well the manuscript
was written and accepted 20,000 copies
of the book were
granted there were ads put out in the
New York Review of Books promotional
Flyers were listed by it by the
publisher but the parent company Warner
started sniffing around and Warner's
William Sarnoff who was offended by the
criticism of the US government ordered
the publication not take place well the
president of the Warner subsidiary
Claude McCaleb protested this and tried
to work out a compromise so that they
could do it but Warner was interested
only in getting rid of the book may not
only got rid of the book that got rid of
Claude McCaleb as the president of the
subsidiary then they did away with a
subsidiaries usually they don't put
ideology over finances obviously they
lost a lot of money that they paid
Chomsky in advance for the book they
printed $20,000 $20,000 you know
hundreds of thousands of dollars but the
book was such an explosive indictment of
US foreign policy that they just didn't
want to publish it South End press
eventually published it in two volumes I
think was called the Washington
connection it basically is a study of
state terrorism sponsored by the CIA the
way that the CIA has supported state
terrorism for instance in Indonesia in
the 1960s the CIA engineered an
overthrow of the democratically elected
government and hundreds of thousands of
leftist were killed in Indonesia in this
project sponsored by the CIA later in
East Timor one of the Indonesian
island chains the Indonesian government
working with the CIA carry out a
bloodbath their state terrorism that
again the CIA was involved in and they
went through Vietnam and went through
Central America all the ways that the
United States government particularly
the CIA have supported state terrorism
this was just too explosive a book for
Warner's to publish so he just covered
it over the incident created a big pure
are in trance that reported quite a bit
about it but not in the United States
this is blatant censorship there that
brings us to the end of another
alternative views we'd like to thank
