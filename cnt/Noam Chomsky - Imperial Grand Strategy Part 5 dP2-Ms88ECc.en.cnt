range of those who call themselves
anarchists which is pretty broad yeah
there would be at least a general
agreement that whatever social
structures and arrangements are
developed they ought to maximize the
possibilities for people to pursue their
own creative potential and you can't
make a formula for the know people are
too different and they ought to be
different and the differences ought to
be encouraged yeah and it's just like
with raising children you want something
done fast you don't just say here's the
rigid framework out sometimes people do
but shouldn't say here's the framework
you're supposed to follow and my own
view I differ from some of my close
friends on this is that we should be
cautious about trying to sketch out the
nature of a future society and too much
detail it's not that it can't be done it
can be done it can be done in
interesting ways different ways and has
been done but I think the real question
is to what extent is it important to do
it as to what extent is it important to
just try an experiment and chip away at
existing structures and so on actually
another problem which I think must be
faced is that at any particular point in
human history people have not understood
what is oppression it's something you
learn I mean if I get back to my say
parents and grants that they my
grandmother she didn't think she was
oppressed by being in a super
patriarchal fan
where the father would walk down the
street and not recognize his daughter
when she came because you're not
supposed to not because you didn't know
who she was because you know nod to your
daughter she didn't feel like a freshman
I just felt like the way life works I
mean what psychic effects it had
internally you know that's a complicated
question but as anyone involved in any
kind of activism knows say the women's
movement I mean one of the first tasks
is to get people to understand that
they're living under conditions of
oppression and domination it isn't
obvious no and who knows what forms of
oppression of domination we're just
accepting yeah without even noticing
them and at some further stage of self
enlightenment and communal understanding
will recognize those the things we have
to do and we can't plan for them we
don't know about link to that then did
Emma Goldman a seeker older man feared
for the fuddler may not be an immediate
revolution became very influenced by I
think Gustav Landau who talked about
that the state isn't just out there is
inside us that we have to become
ourselves as free as we can be in in
capitalism that in fact that she was
always worried that there may be chance
that people won't be ready for
revolution and that there is a way of
developing the politics of the personal
so maybe more people could be ready to
experience that life that's possible
that's quite true I mean people in fact
there are you know the people understand
this the best are those who are carrying
out the control of domination in the
more free societies like the United
States and England where popular
struggles have won a lot of freedom over
the years in the state as a limited
capacity of course is very striking that
it's precisely in those societies
that elite groups the business world
state managers and so on recognized
early on that they're going to have to
develop massive methods of control of
attitude and opinion because you can't
control people by force anymore and
therefore you have to modify their
consciousness so they don't receive that
they are living under conditions of
alienation and oppression subordination
and so on in fact that's what I mean
you know probably a couple of trillion
dollars a year spent on this in the
United States very self-consciously I
mean from the framing of television
advertisements for two-year-olds to the
net to what you thought in graduate
school economics programs it's designed
to create a kind of a consciousness of
subordination and also of and it's also
intended specifically and pretty
consciously to suppress normal human
emotions so normal human emotions are
sympathy and solidarity I mean not just
for people and if we thought stranded
dolphins you know it's it's just a
normal reaction of people and if you go
back to say the classical political
economists people like Adam Smith this
was that
was the core of human nature and
societies got to deal with this well you
know one of the main concentrations of
the advertising and education is to
drive that out of your mind
and it's very conscious in fact it's
conscious and social policy right in
front of our eyes today as it says it
take the effort to destroy Social
Security what's the point of that well
the point event there's no there's a lot
of scam about the financial problems of
isn't out result of nonsense but the and
of course they want you know they'd like
Wall Street to make it killing but
underlying it all I think is something
much deeper
Social Security is based on a human
emotion a natural human emotion which
has to be driven out of people's mind
namely the emotion that you care about
other people you care it's a social
responsibility responsibility to care
whether a disabled little across town
has enough food or whether a kid across
the street you know go to school or
something and you have to get that out
of people's heads you have to make I'm
saying look you're a personal rational
wealth Maximizer if that disabled would
have didn't prepare for her own future
it's her problem not your brother it's
not your fault that she doesn't have
enough to eat so why should you care
there is no such thing as society is
about thought you said yeah I mean
there's only you maximizing your own
wealth and subordinating yourself to
power and not thinking about anyone else
and that has an effect you can see it in
attitudes no just get back to your point
and the same is true of those who are
trying to change society to more decent
forms yes you're going to have to do
with people's consciousness and
awareness and as I say every organize
your nose I mean technically women's
movement was a striking example it
begins with consciousness-raising groups
where people talk to each other and
bring out elements of their lives that
they may not perceive very clearly and
it's true across the board in
educational institutions and factories
everywhere else as for striking to see
how these this has worked over the years
and if you go back to the early days of
the Industrial Revolution say like read
around here a little orange that places
for the textile mills were being created
and so on among the people who were
drawn into the Ehrlich factories young
women from the farm is a you know Irish
artisans from the slum dozen or so on
there was an extremely radical
consciousness yeah it was just natural
it's just the natural assumption it's in
there that a very fruit press something
that's been lost but the free press of
those days expressed to just took for
granted that wage labor is pretty much
like slavery and that those who work in
the mills are on obviously why do we
need the boss is telling us what to do
and that there and that the whole
factory system industrial system is just
crushing our cultural values and
creative impulses and turning us into
robots and so on and so forth all of
this was understood taken for granted
you go back to a working-class
neighborhood today you won't find it and
that'll be it's not that they people to
be taught it it has to be brought out
from their inner nature where it's been
suppressed by very conscious effort
actually you know it's for striking to
see how consciousness is so you know
about like a century ago as Taylorism he
was introduced into industry Taylorism
for Frederick Taylor's yes that element
so the idea was to basically the idea is
to turn workers into robots
so every motion was to
how many choices they become essentially
broke was it was it was like everything
else it was initiated and in the
military system because there you can
carry out experiments cost free and cost
and take risk taking and so on but then
I was transferred the industry mass
production system and so on and I did
Lenin was very enamored oh yes you know
basically the same conceptions as
capitalist knowledge and the idea was to
robotize work but it was very quickly
recognized that like the nineteen
twenties that what they called on job
control you know turning person into a
robot on the job can be extended to off
job control that is controlling every
other aspect of life the same way so why
should people not be robots in their
entire day and to be a robot means to
focus your attention on what we're
called the superficial things of that
that fashionable consumption not care
for one another not on working together
to create a decent environment not the
you know what the world be like for your
children just turn turn you into a
passive consumer and obedient a person
who pushes buttons every couple of years
and stuff that's democracy follows
orders don't think and identify your own
value as a human being in the amount of
useless consumption that you can carry
out and that's off job control and it
and it runs from well through all the
institutions and it's a huge and yes and
yes to overcome off job control and make
people realize that you know your value
as a human being isn't how deep you can
go in debt and how many credit cards you
can max out to get commodity
that's not your value as a human being
it's something else I mean when you go
to a there you go to a mall and over the
weekend and you see young kids we're in
their spare time young girls usually
their spare time what's fun you know
it's window show yeah yes and that's you
didn't want to do it can't see it do it
but what this tells you about how
people's consciousness has been modified
by off job control that's pretty
frightening yes yes I linked to that as
well
one of the things that I think is
striking when you look at the history of
alligator is it is it is most popular it
was almost an organic movement and
answering community needs to Jewish
Anika's in New York in the 1890s in
Spain obviously but Argentina as you
mentioned France isn't community also
being destroyed by things such as
technology we're now there are more
communities in cyberspace then maybe the
type of community that you or I may have
grown of myself um you know there's a
coal mining community where you knew
everyone and everyone knew you and yes
there were tensions but you had that
sense of relationships isn't that really
going very quickly and isn't technology
helping that go and maybe the technology
is pretty neutral integer right it could
go in that direction in the opposite
direction not I mean technology could in
fact be used to let the workforce and a
factory run it without any managers by
providing people at the workbench with
real-time information that would enable
them to join
making sensible decisions that's another
use of this Shoji where's that
technologies and get developed in fact
they're very interesting studies of how
it does work so one of the main studies
was done by some of the best was nobody
David Nobel we used to be here doesn't
mean he's a terrific work on a lot of
things but the main one the main one of
the main types he studied it was called
numerical processing that is computer
controlled machine tool production that
kind of thing and that was like
everything else developed in the
military system where you can do it at
public cost but it was designed there
were a lot of different ways of
designing pointa so one way of designing
it would have been to eliminate
managerial levels and put
decision-making into the hands of
skilled mechanics who would who sort of
knew what they're doing they're usually
people know more anyway than the guys in
the office upstairs yeah and I'm sure it
was true in the coalmine yeah mine work
the guys then undergrad one is sitting
in an office in New York somewhere but
so put the decision-making into their
hands and the technology could have been
designed for them and studies were done
showing that would even increase profits
but it was done the opposite way it was
done in such a way as to increase levels
of management control which is highly
inefficient 2d skill mechanics I and to
turn them into robots only to just push
the buttons well that's a choice as to
how to use technology and it's a kind of
class warfare but it has nothing to do
with the inherent nature of technology
and I think the same is true here
however the point the point you make is
an interesting one and I don't you know
I don't know what's gonna come of it but
it is true that there are virtual
communities yes which are very real I
mean I would say that 95% of my clothes
friends I've never seen yes we just
interact all the time on the internet
and you know my age figure it's
perfectly reasonable when I see my
grandchildren do it I don't like it much
I mean I think they have to learn yeah
it's about face-to-face meeting well
disappointed yes because I mean my son
does instant messaging and instant
messages with people whom one is at
school he can hardly talk to you know
but on it provides a neutral framework
but I'm worrying obviously because I'd
rather he spoke and interact it I agree
with you I don't know what the kind of
effect this is gonna have on young kids
growing up I mean they live in an
imaginary world yeah and even
interacting with people who are adopting
false personalities and you know when
kids used to like Dungeons and Dragons
well okay on the other hand when you're
living we know a lot of your life is in
an imaginary world with characters who
you have created created themselves and
you don't have face to face human
interactions with that can't have
psychic effects which I don't think we
understand that it could be pretty
taking that a step forward you know that
there is a tendency certainly in the
last ten years of anarchism we call it
primitive is our neck of primitivism who
suggests that capitalism is so rotten
but technolog the technology involved a
couple ism is so rotten but you thought
to just get rid of the whole thing it's
so destructive so corroding so so
horrible that it's just damaging people
let's just get rid of it instead you
know tobacco or forward it in their eyes
to a more natural organic world at one
with nature
these are possible I mean that you know
I sympathize with the people that say
that but I don't think they are
realizing that what they're calling for
is mass genocide
because the way society is now
structured and organized urban life and
so on and so forth if you eliminate
these structures everybody dies
for example I can't grow my own food
it's nice idea but it is not work not in
this and in fact none of us want to live
a hunter-gatherer life it's there just
too many things in life that the modern
world offers but just on plain terms of
survival that's calling for the worst
mass genocide in human history yes and
unless one thinks through these things
it's not really serious yes yes sorry a
couple of quick things that a lot of
people I know in Europe know you through
your your introduction to Daniel
Carranza anarchism and we slight
wide-awake a press put out his no girls
no master's in English it's a great book
it's obvious that for Koran he was very
keen to blend what I think he felt with
the bust best aspects of anarchism and
the best aspects of socialism into this
libertarian communist libertarian
socialism Aryan socialism for them do
you do you think that those two terms
libertarian socialism and anarchism as
synonymous or do you think there are
real differences because in terms of
political discourse aren't well-defined
capitalism trade you know state pick
anyone you know they're pretty loose
terms which is okay it doesn't make
sense to try to define terms carefully
when you don't have any explanatory
theories embedded in it but the fact is
that we can't really answer the question
anarchism covers too many things
libertarian socialism covered
too many things but I think I think I
mean I said with us with what he's
trying to do I think it's the right
thing I think he looked carefully there
are really close similarities in
relationships among the the ADI state
the more a D status and Eve and artists
left elements of social of soap of the
socialist Marxist movement it's a sake
people like anything and I cook yes
others just close similarities between
them and met some of the wings of the
anarchist movement like the
anarcho-syndicalism thanks pretty hard
to make much of a distinction between
panicles councils and our position is
conceptions about organized society
there's some differences but they're the
kind of differences that all exist some
people are working together and
comradely relationships so yeah that's a
sensible blend in my view but I mean a
much sharper distinction is between all
of these movements and the various forms
of totalitarianism like Bolshevism or
corporate capitalism yeah so on yes
there you have a real break you know you
took toilet Arian structures on the one
hand freezers free societies in the
other in fact I think there are
similarities between significant ones
between the Praetorian socialist suze
orman an are kids on this blend and even
very mainstream thinkers like John Dewey
yeah yes they're striking similar I know
he was caught influenced by Stilton the
modern school and he took a lot of those
ideas and so look about the visitors you
know basic view was that unless we
eliminate what he called industrial
feudalism and turned it into industrial
democracy which is means pretty much
control then the whole formal democratic
system doesn't really mean very much and
he comes straight out of the mainstream
there yesterday yeah couple of quick
things and I know from from reading
you're very much impressed I think it
will be good by people I panicked I
can't go to not left communist strand I
take it you don't see a danger of things
like workers councils or the work of
panic or Gore to lead into another form
of totalitarianism you think that breaks
from that plenty of danger right but the
same there's also a danger that
participatory participatory economics if
they did their health care in ISM I mean
every one of us has been in movement
meetings we all know the dynamics if
you're you know whatever you're working
on you know putting a traffic light in
the corner
organizing resistance against the
Vietnam or whatever where maybe there's
a meeting of people and there's you know
there's we differ in our liberals of
tolerance for boring activities I mean
some people just drop off pretty fast
like me for example I just can't
tolerate so much of other people really
committed to basically control it and
there is a natural dynamic in which the
most free cooperative libertarian
structure can turn into an authoritarian
mode just by virtue of who's going to
stick around and you know take enough
control and finally make the decisions
and everybody wants to go do something
else and so on and so forth those are
always dangerous the last person
standing isn't and you'll never overcome
and we're all perfectly familiar with it
from groups of friends affinity groups
working on
yes so yes those are always problems
gonna deal with them you can't there's
no magic formula for preventing that
from Agra okay and link to that I guess
is is what do you feel about the role of
class and change in anarchism there's no
doubt that certainly I think in America
there is a tendency manic ism in new
anak is sort to see classes belonging to
the past it really isn't the most
relevant foci loci change anymore
I mean others people have worked in
community industry I mean if you if
those are your jobs they you don't have
any problem in class you know who gives
the pluses and who takes of it gives the
orders and it takes them and you know
why the capital you understand the
capital concentration that lies beyond
the choice of those who give the orders
and those who take the orders now those
are class differences often some other
domain you can say I don't see them but
better into the real life of people who
live and work in the society and I don't
think they had much problem discerning
class differences and their significance
there's a huge difference between giving
orders and taking yeah yes and even if
it's true that the people who are giving
orders are taking them from somewhere
else but that's the nature of
totalitarian systems it's not the top
guy gives the orders to the bottom guy
there's levels of transmission through
which orders are taken and given
managerial supervision then the
decision-making the various kinds and
that creates a whole variety of class
fundamental class differences and there
are plenty of people who just take the
orders or else run starve
yeah choice sure sure in fact we see
class issues arising all the time
I mean takes a real concrete issues like
one of the very concrete issues right
now is what's called outsourcing uh-huh
what attitude should people take third
outsourcing and their conflicting values
I mean first of all outsourcing is a
very misleading term outsourcing is
internal to totalitarian institutions
I mean if GM outsources that means they
are transferring jobs to some company a
firm under their control which is able
to escape labor laws environmental
constraints and so on and to give them
cheap inputs for the next stage of a
manufacturing but that's all internal to
command economies so outsourcing is it's
kind of like a pretense I'm do the free
market or definite it doesn't it has to
do with internal workings of command
economies all right should what should
our attitude towards I mean if people
here are losing their jobs because you
could get a worker you know 10% of the
cost and say India or China should we be
for it or against it well you know as
arguments both ways and I think all the
arguments are highly misleading because
they're accepting a framework we
shouldn't accept I mean if you accept
the framework that says totalitarian
command economies have the right to make
these decisions and the dip the wage
levels and working conditions are fixed
facts and then we have to make choices
within those assumptions well you know
then you can make an argument that poor
people here ought to lose their jobs to
even who are people somewhere else
because that increases
the usual story but why take this yeah I
mean you know there's there's other ways
of dealing with the problem
for example rich people here like people
like me for example you know who we're
on top few percent of the income ladder
we could cut back our luxurious
lifestyles pay property taxes or all
sorts of things and I'm not even talking
about Bill Gates and the people who are
reasonably privileged instead of
imposing the burden on the poor here and
say well you poor people have to give up
your jobs because even where people need
them over there we could say ok we rich
people will give up some small part of
our Ludacris luxury and you kind of use
it to raise living standards and working
conditions elsewhere and to let them
have enough capital to develop their own
economy by their own means and then the
issue won't arise but it's much more
convenient to say poor people here ought
to pay the burden under the framework of
command economy totalitarianism
that's easy with but you know if you
think it through it certainly killed no
no and every every social issue you
think of that real life on you know the
ones you read on the table sure that has
these properties we we don't have to
accept and shouldn't exactly the the
framework of domination of thought an
attitude that allows only certain
choices to be made and those choices
almost invariably come down to how to
put the burden on the poor myth that's
class warfare yes you know you don't
want to call it class don't use a word
but its class worth it even by real nice
people like us who think that it's good
to help workers in jail
but within a framework of class warfare
which preserves our own privilege and
transfers the cost for the quarter a
year and yeah that's these are critical
again matters of raising consciousness
among very decent people you know yeah
our friend I his isn't a more grim
question that yes faltering declare in
the 1900s in an essay talks about the
hope she has of of a peaceful change
into a better world and talks about then
the masters who are creating such a
system that they're going to meet a
horrible war wind now are we still in a
situation where a peaceful transition to
a free a better world is possible for us
or is can we not say or is it unlikely
as it years ago on actually nobody knows
but my own subjective judgment you know
low credibility subjective judgment is
that the opportunities for peaceful
change are considerably greater now than
they have been in the past and the
reason for that is that the repressive
apparatus of state and corporate power
has been reduced you can't break up
strikes with Pinkerton guards anymore I
won't get away with it you can't send
out the you know police to smash up the
working-class suffering tenants that
comes due
the National Guard you can get away with
it anymore
look at all that makes a difference I
mean enough victories have been won yes
so that repression has reduced I mean
just take a look at this simple question
of how many workers get killed in labor
action well you know it used to be very
high oh yes and it went up to late 1930
yes is it I mean I can remember it as a
kid you know workers getting killed in
labor actions by security guards you
know Pinkertons police that has stopped
yes
I mean maybe occasionally it'll happen
but you know it's a substantial change
soon having that you know look at the
Emma Goldman papers you know we look at
the New York Times or we get students to
look at daily papers of the 1890s I
think every week there's a wonder in the
world to get us you all down the hill I
saw that as a kid yeah you know
childhood memories of watching police
wade into women's dryers I decided a
textile plan just beating the out
of them well you know I don't think you
get away though no all right
and that generalizes just like it would
be much harder now for the u.s. to
institute a military coup and say Brazil
then it was 40 years ago much harder in
fact probably impossible because they're
just enough changes so that people won't
accept it enable and the structures of
power of dissolved by now in fact a lot
of the structures of power are very
fragile a lot of them have shifted from
direct coercion to indoctrination and
thought and attitude control well you
know that's bad enough I'm just bad
enough to have your kids bombarding the
Reverend this television but it's a lot
different than having them beaten over
the head right oh yes yes and having
torture chambers are out there so those
changes mean that there are many more
options for peaceful change but it does
make it more complex to fire it back
yeah makes a very complex but you have
to fight out of at least if there's a
Pinkerton college you know who your
enemy your enemy is and when it's your
friendly executive and the soulful
corporation is really on the same side
that you are and so on and so forth yeah
then it's harder but doesn't mean it's
impossible no no a couple days ago II
give his personal things away but I had
to give a talk which I do every year do
a terrific group of young mostly young
labor activists you know group at
Harvard which is run by a fantastic
person activist feminist terrific this
program for the bringing of the labor
young labor leaders into Harvard was it
begun I guess around 1940 as part of the
corporate academic reaction to this
perceived threat real threat of
significant radical labor action that
might just revolutionize the country I'm
after all the sit down straight it is
like one thought away from taking over
the plant it was really close and it was
understood well part of the technique of
undercutting that as it was becoming
harder to use Pinkerton guards and
police and someone smashed this up it
became understood that what you have to
do is socialize the rising young Labour
leadership civilized yeah teach him how
to bring him the heart of it and do what
hard work to boot it in fact what it
does with its own students teaching them
how to have a light conversations and
class over there you know solidarity and
drink the right wine and just pick up
the right
and relations and so on so this is stick
these young guys in the business school
and I'll see world friends and we all
doing the same thing that's almost over
and went on like that for years until
the years ago so that must instantly
it's become international and the reason
is all these ideas are you can just
guarantee below the surface
thanks puncture the surface slightly and
it all comes out because it's also
natural anomalies
it takes massive effort to beat it down
but and by now it's completely different
yes but and has big effects all
throughout the world because for
everywhere well that can be done in all
kinds of places but those are modes of
peaceful change and if I'm just in
around life than I was they fled to very
big changes and in the past anymore
you know something like that the changes
going both directions so on the one hand
you can't crush homestead the way you
could 100 years ago on the other hand
the consciousness that led to farms dad
is going hmm
so it's not just progress but rebuilding
that consciousness is a lot is is the
kind of peaceful activity that can be
carried out and is in many respects a
lot easier than fighting the National
Guard yes yes
final question because think we ran out
of time I've just been working on
Bergman's book now on that just a K
pressive just republished it what is
anarchism
Rena's letters in the twenties when is
working on the book and he's finding it
very difficult one of the things that is
trying to come to grips was I think in
the book is well why haven't people come
to this idea this idea which to me is
just common senses is just what we were
saying it earlier this natural instinct
almost is solidarity and support and
I've seen Russia I've seen
totalitarianism in action why haven't
you kissed ideas had a greater impact in
the world I think he's talking about now
that's eight two years ago nearly and
and and the question we're also facing
as people at least believe what is an
Emma Goldman says anarchism is the only
belief that shows man men and women
their true self who they can be we see
that we know that instinctively it's
still such a minuscule impact is that
true or is it I don't think it's true
that it's an excellent thing I mean a
lot of the progressive social change of
the past century you know isn't
anarchists like an aggressive taxation
is an anarchist Social Security is an
anarchist but it's a reflection of
attitudes and understanding which if
they go a little bit further do reflect
anarchist commitment and they do they
are based on the idea that they really
should be solidarity sympathy community
mutual support mutual aid and so on and
so forth and opportunities for creative
action and they're all based on these
they don't you know they're subdued and
channeled and modified so they don't
take real libertarian forms but they're
there and they lead the social change
but why hasn't it going further well a
large part of its violence episode takes
a workman's experience in Russian
he entered into a violent attempt Aryan
state I mean up until the Bolshevik
takeover ku revolution while you're
gonna call it up until that there were
very significant popular libertarian
sometimes anarchist initiatives all over
running from peasant anarchism of
Ukraine to workers council was the
Soviets small it's over whatever simply
smashed by force the great violence I
mean Lenin and Trotsky were to tell
Astaire and extremists they had a theory
behind it they were kind of dedicated
Marxists who believed that backward
primitive countries like Russia
can't go to socialism
masters principals tell us that and
therefore we have to drive it drive the
country by force through the stages of
essentially state capitalist development
and then ultimately something will
happen I mean they weren't repeating the
master accurately this required
suppression of many years of Marx's
later work which were literally
suppressed I am studying the peasant
societies in Russia she's on and so
forth but that doesn't really matter I
mean the point is they had a conception
that used to had the force it was it
wasn't easy
like you know to destroy you know
mullahs movement or crunch dot eliminate
the soviets and so on wasn't a trivial
operation both carried out and Berkman
saw out and he saw the tellurian vicious
totalitarian society arising and very
much the way anarchist had predicted yes
I mean because and spelled it all out if
I can Trotsky initially before he joined
it said what was gonna happen as did
Rosa Luxemburg than others but it
happened so that and that's their
variant our variant was different
Wilson Berkman was writing right after
Wilson's Red Scare which made the
patriot act look like a tea party I was
a violent or oppression run by the
progresses Woodrow Wilson and others and
not just affecting anarchist it's not
just demagogue when it was kicked about
but no you think people pretty much in
the mainstream yes like Eugene Debs
leading labor figure hey I mean Wilson
is completely addicted tossed over the
GL because he raised some questions
about the nobility of Wilson's War and
refused even to grant him amnesty and
everyone else was right at madness to
this was really addictive and it really
fresh tin dependent thought professional
labor at a big affect us as violence
alongside the violence
is the rise of massive propaganda that's
the rise of the public relations
industry is to try to control attitudes
and beliefs but quite apart from that
there's something quite simple I mean
there are disciplinary effects to the
way life is organized takes a student
today students today have many are more
in some ways there are a lot of ways
they're freer than they were 60 years
ago their attitude some commitments and
so on the other hand a more disciplined
yes they're disciplined by debt yes yes
part of the reason for arranging
education so you come out with heavy
debt is there your disappointment or
let's take the last 20 years the
neoliberal years roughly what's called
globalization rule a lot of it is a very
striking part of it it's just named
discipline it wants to eliminate freedom
of choice and impose discipline how do
you do it well if you have a couple in
the United States now working 50 to 50
hours a week to put food on the table
you don't have time to think of it I
know how to become a libertarian
socialist we're not worried about is how
do I get food where can i shop cheaply
yeah yeah I gotta get the kids to take
care of and I got something doing them
you know when they're sick I've got to
go to work and what's gonna happen to
you know oh the and that's very that's
well design techniques of imposing
discipline and there are costs to trying
to be a dependent and it just takes a
trying to organize a labor union and if
you're the organizer there's gonna be a
cost to you I mean maybe the workforce
or gaining but there's a cost to you and
we know there is
we know the cost is not just in energy
and effort but just in punishment
yes and the people who are living in
fragile circumstances have they make a
reasonable calculation they say why
should it take the closest thing I have
to get by so there are many reasons why
normal instincts and attitudes don't
come out but you know over time they
often do where we have social changes to
the better okay
hey thank you for your time it's really
kind okay really kind of you great to
meet you as well thank you for you
