one thing go in response to this um you
know I I think one thing that's
important to keep in mind is that very
little of what this administration or
the Bush administration day was actually
new ideas there they were their old
existing ideas resurrections of certain
plans and programs I mean if you look at
the Phoenix program in Vietnam which was
this assassination program that was
being run in Vietnam there are very
serious parallels to what the United
States was doing in Iraq you know people
think that the dominant historical
narrative is that the surge won the Iraq
war in general you know Petraeus had he
not gone down for you know the only
thing that seems to be capable of taking
down the powerful is this true now what
they what they do in their top secret
chambers they can wage all the so-called
secret wars they want but if they do
something in their own secret life then
you can bring them down but but Petraeus
is often celebrated as the sort of hero
who won the Iraq war because of the
surge but in reality you had this
merciless killing campaign that was
being run by General Stanley McChrystal
and Admiral William McRaven where they
were just bumping off you know the
leadership of any cell that we pop off
pop up but also just killing a
tremendous number of people in general
and and so you had military figures that
grew up in a certain era with an
understanding of these programs and when
when Cheney and Rumsfeld came into power
with with Bush they really saw even
before nine eleven happen saw the the
historical moment that they had in front
of them to sort of redraw maps and
implement a vision of the world where
iran-contra was a noble act and sort of
the model for how the US should be
conducting its foreign policy I don't
know if you many of you know this but
Cheney was in Congress at the time of
the iran-contra was being investigated
and he authored the minority report in
the house of defending iran-contra and
and and viewed it as a sort of heroic
necessary action and and they they have
this view of the unitary executive the
idea that when it comes to these
national security issues that the White
House is essentially a dictatorship and
that Congress is only function is to
fund the operations but not be involved
with overseeing them or having any
meaningful oversight of these operations
and President Obama really had an
opportunity to roll back some of the
executive branch power grabs that Bush
and Cheney had engaged in and instead he
sort of doubled down on them and and has
been waging is unprecedented war against
whistleblowers and using the Espionage
Act and reserving the right of the state
to keep secret from the American people
of evidence that would indicate why
someone was being assassinated to keep
secret to use the state secrets
privilege in repeated lawsuits brought
against former officials or torturers
having cases thrown out of court using
the full power structure of the
executive branch in the same excessive
way that was being used under Bush and
Cheney Jeremy you we're talking about US
officials know if you could respond to
what Jeremy said and also you have
written extensively about the killing of
a some of the month and I was wondering
if you could comment on that the killing
of us on the premises one of the board
everyone one bomb everything sorry
I was saying a plenty of unpopular
articles on one of the most unpopular
had to do with the murder not killing of
Osama bin Laden some bin Laden was a
suspect there are principles believe it
or not that are not only in the
Constitution but go back to 800 years to
Magna Carta foundations of
anglo-american law that's they put it in
narrower terms with the general
principle including jeremy's quite
correct expansion of it to people other
than our own citizens is that a person
can't be punished by the state without
due process of law and a speedy trial
last year's reasonable principal ones in
the Constitution its narrow Philip so in
Constitution didn't naturally did apply
the Native Americans it didn't apply to
blacks dubiously apply them women who
considered property people about over
the years that expanded unless it gets
the point where the journey was talking
about it's just human beings that we
can't go ourselves in civilized society
anyway those are the principles Osama
bin Laden was a suspect in fact
eight-person a donor they doubt that he
was responsible but my personal opinion
is nothing that stands up in a court of
law after the evidence after a trial
series trial I was pretty clear that the
u.s. government didn't want that he was
captured apprehended by the most skilled
masters of war use the Somali warlords
the expression that exists in the world
eighty of my thing he was defenseless
the first story that came out was that
they had to shoot him because his wife
lunch at the seals
but that's far as they were on those
nothing it's just apprehended
defenseless murdered body thrown into
the ocean leaving of his questions as to
why I know the dangers of this opera one
of the aspects of this operation so it
was a criminal that might be totally
complete criminal act no justification
but there's more to it than this and I
was kind of reminded of it when Jeremy
talked about the the Yemeni testimony at
the Senate was if you might have looked
at the little tiny the court on that
your thumbs he said something else and
testified he said that for years the
alki dishonest radicals of pride of
people have been trying to turn the
people of this village against the
Americans and they didn't succeed but
you succeeded with one arm stroke you're
creating more people to kill you as you
pointed out and the same is true of the
assembly
assassination good first of all he said
the action itself was extremely
hazardous the Navy SEALs were sent in
were under orders to shoot their way out
if they got into any trouble well if
they'd started the Pakistani army is a
professional army or committed committed
the defense of the country's sovereignty
the country if they hadn't caught there
and tried to shoot it what should the
way out that they wouldn't have been
left alone the American forces next door
would have come in and massive force and
we might have been involved in nuclear
war quite possible that was part of the
threat but there was something else that
happened reported recently in Scientific
American but it was known in the way
that they identified and bob was through
a fraudulent ventilation vaccination
campaign had doctors posing to do any
polio vaccination in a
the work area of this town well they
pretty soon figured out it's not four
areas the rich area so they stop the
program in middle from one cell actually
running the program was criminal using a
vaccinated a vaccination program and
doctors to try to apprehend a suspect I
think that violate Christmas my backyard
Hippocratic oath but then they stopped
at the middle because the coder in the
wrong area more crimes then they finally
identified it but one consequence of
their actions was to if there is all
always and the society series concerned
about what outside of Americans are up
to when they come in and start you know
sticking needles with people and so on
it's always there takes a lot of work to
overcome that hostility and it was being
over common packed in Pakistan now it's
gone they will not permit people to come
in carrying out vaccinations if polio is
almost wanna the world Pakistan's one of
the last places which survives okay
we're encouraging the spread of polio
and as one commentator point
well back to the MA in the Senate one of
these days people are going to look at
this crippled child and say you did it
to us and you can guess what I have in
that if you missed that testimony in the
Senate and the first-ever Senate drone
hearings of this young Yemeni activists
and freelance journalists you can go to
democracynow.org because last Wednesday
we played it in full you can watch him
and also read the transcript but no I
wanted to ask you to follow up on
Jeremy's opening point around the
killing and closing point the killing of
Americans vs. people anywhere well I
attorneys was exactly right and I think
the murder of Allah kiya we should be
honest about it was he took out the New
York Times the next day there was a
headline which said something like the
West West celebrates death of radical
clerics could we murdered radical cleric
then concerns began to mount in effect
was an American bit of a problem
begorrah
that's pretty scandalous obliterate with
Jeremy said doesn't matter whether
they're Americans or whatever they are
they're people going back to bank card
and the concept of people free of these
that should be free of state terror has
been expanded over the years
substantially and it should be extended
to include people they should be free of
state terror and i should say that i
myself am kind of hesitant about some of
these like i can myself right now
plaintiff in a suit on thee against the
NDAA NDA proposals of all the latest
national defense authorization act
included includes provisions which make
it which optional for the government if
it chooses to place american citizens
under indefinite detention in the
military prisons who's a credible front
yeah back to Magna Carta much worse and
Chris Hedges to organize the suit to try
to oppose this and I signed on up with
reservations because with differences to
make if they're American citizens I'm in
the same NDA act authorized in fact
makes it mandatory in some circumstances
for the government to place non-american
citizens under in
preventive detention to be this way we
should be that's what we should be
concerned with the suits at least taken
an interesting course Obama originally
that said that he was opposed those
provisions of the Act we would designer
then when the casement court at the
lower court level the government that
case the plaintiffs one the judge threw
out government prosecution on the dirt
because the oppressed the prosecution
refused to answer a simple question will
these plaintiffs be subject to
administer attention could they be
refused to answer that so judge threw
that out qivana immediately took it to
the higher court I chose you how much
opposed to it will work its way to the
Supreme Court given the Supreme Court
probably minute well you know these are
things we should really be concerned
about it's not if you want to know what
I'm sure you all know
detail what happens to non-citizens
recently tested on so resembles the
recent book came out by Australia to fit
a hill I think his name is very much
worth reading he's a young man who was
hiking around somewhere northern
Afghanistan great David Hicks David
Diggs young he was picked up by the top
by the northern will I ask you of his
allies they sold him for Valley to the
American forces and then he describes
his years in Agra and then at Guantanamo
seven years the torture the sages of the
cruelty are just indescribable these are
American soldiers you know I think
American soldiers just really have to
read that many when those American
history won't surprises it much but
spring front of our eyes he said
something quite interesting in his
testimony which are struck like he says
the soldiers first these guys were
shackled bound could move surrounded by
all kinds of military police and so on
we said the guards were afraid of the
prisoners he said the guards have been
so brainwashed by whatever training they
went through that they thought these
prisoners were super unit is that the
guards would come to his cell sometimes
where he's shackled sauna asked him to
some of his piece like you don't climb
on the ceiling church was a miss
Penniman faculty took them out to be
interrogated a coupla two Marines around
them to make sure that they didn't carry
out some incredibly monstrous act but
his soldiers have probably seen in a
video movie somewhere but he said they
really were terrified of the premiums
and that felt something else about our
own society that what are we doing to
our own society blender creating such a
terror and fear among word very people I
mean it's kind of like a having guns
we've get an armed armed policemen
schools that what you want you to
children to see that it doesn't society
we have to have it the people with guns
around to protect you from zone on a
magical danger and they can press
another series as far as America culpers
concerned to my firm should be concerned
about this is a very friend so I always
asked him goes back to colonial times
very straight today it is taking over
remarkable force if you look at the you
know the gun culture the people who are
pressing for having guns are terrified a
lot of were simply terrified they're
like these guards standing outside
person what are they terrified of God
guns to protect ourselves from boo
federal government the United Nations a
summer baby we don't know what a
horrible acts is coming after us but we
have had done to protect ourselves put
aside the fact that doesn't be any good
but I kill each other but appear
throughout the society is simply
incredible okay jerk just like a couple
of things in in response that the I was
remembering when you were talking about
David Hicks story this this case that I
came across in Yemen of a journalist
named abu laila Haider Shia at when when
President Obama first authorized the
bombing of Yemen was in December of 2009
that the first strike that we know of
authorized under the Obama
administration was on December 17 2009
in Yemen there hadn't been a bombing a
u.s. bombing there that we know of since
november of 2002 the first drone strike
actually that that was conducted outside
of afghanistan was in Yemen 2002 and it
killed a number of people including a US
citizen named Kamal darwish and and he
actually was not was not supposedly the
target of that strike but they claimed
that he had ties to a terror cell called
the lackawanna sex which like many of
the plots we've seen lately seemed to
have been the in large part the FBI
breaking up its own plot and which is
really scandalous if you look at how
many times this is happening in all
these cases of entrapment but so
President Obama starts decides to start
bombing Yemen in December of 2009 they
do this strike on what they are told by
the Yemeni government and by us
intelligence is an al-qaeda training
camp and that there is this notorious
al-qaeda figure who's known to be in the
camp well it turned out that this guy
when we
went to Yemen and spoke to people that
knew him and knew the infrastructure of
AQAP that he was an old jihadist who had
fought in the Mujahideen war in
Afghanistan and had a very peripheral
connection to al-qaeda so it seems like
what happened is that the u.s.
outsourced is a lot of intelligence
gathering in Yemen to notoriously
corrupt Yemeni officials and agencies
and enter the Saudis and the Saudis have
their own war that they're waging inside
of Yemen the u.s. defect dictatorship of
Ali Abdullah Saleh was playing multiple
sides playing the Saudis playing the US
playing various tribes inside the
country there were several occasions
when Saleh fed the US intelligence
saying someone was all hided it turned
out to be in a political opponent of the
regime that was being killed or
assassinated by the US on behalf in the
service of the dictator of Yemen and so
in this case in December 17 2009 they
bombed this village supposedly to kill
this one guy who does not seem to have
been anything even vaguely resembling a
senior al-qaeda figure in the country
and and and after the missile strike
happens the Yemeni government puts out a
press release taking credit for the
strike saying and conducted these
airstrikes and the Obama administration
congratulated the Yemeni government on
taking the fight to the terrorists in
Yemen a number of tribal leaders in
Yemen got phone calls from this small
poor bedwin village called el maje Allah
that this missiles had slammed into the
area and had shredded people into meat
and these tribal leaders went there and
also a young this young journalist
albela Haider Shia who had done
reporting and worked for The Washington
Post for ABC news for Al Jazeera he was
a very very well-known journalist in
Yemen and he was known because he was a
brave guy who would go and actually
interview al Qaeda figures much of what
the United States knows about certain
leaders in Al Qaeda come from the room
comes from the reporting about the Lalla
Haider Shia he if you could look at it
one way and say he was a very valuable
guy to have out talking to these people
because it helped the US intelligence
officials understand or operatives
understand who it was they were
supposedly trying to kill and then but
that's that's for a different story so
this guy goes through these tribal
leaders go there and they they take
photographs of the missile parts and
they then share show them broadcast them
on al-jazeera and other outlets and
share them with Amnesty International
and Amnesty International has a weapons
expert come in and analyzed them and
they determined that they were that
there was a cruise missile attack and
when when Rick and I were in IV on
province we had the parts film they're
still there in the desert by the way you
can go if you want to try to go to Allah
Jill you can go there and they're still
in the middle of the desert with general
dynamics and made in the USA right there
visible we show this in our film we show
the the aftermath of this bombing and
the missile parts that were still there
you know at well after the bombs to drop
but the u.s. also but the other web
bombs they found there were cluster
bombs which of course are banded or
under international conventions and the
cluster bombs are basically I saw the
effect of them when the US was using
them in the Kosovo war in 1999 i went to
the niche market place after it was
bombed in serbia and saw the aftermath
of it they're like flying land mines and
they shred everything in its path into
into meat and limbs and is horrifying to
see the aftermath of any bonding but
cluster bombs are a particularly brutal
weapon and there are unexploded cluster
bombs that were left there and after the
bombing and taken place some children
were playing near a cluster bomb and
picked one of them up and it blew them
to pieces two days after the bomb
bombing had happened so they take these
pictures they send them to Amnesty
International and these shakes tribal
shakes organized a gathering to say that
this is not the Yemeni government that
did this because Yemen doesn't have
these missiles amnesty does an analysis
of them and determines that they were in
fact US weapons and that only the United
States could have been responsible for
that bombing and so this sort of scandal
was brewing inside of Yemen because of
the people who were killed there there
were at least 46 people killed 14 of the
people killed were women and 21 were
children when the Yemeni Parliament
which is a which is supported by the
United
it's went to investigate it they listed
all of the dead their ages their names
their genders and I got a copy of that
report and and have the list of every
single person that we know of that was
killed in that strike and we added it up
and it was 14 women and 21 children
among the 46 day and in the pursuit of
trying to kill this one person who the
president of United States had been told
was this high value target who everyone
in Yemen says was a an older Mujahideen
who had primarily done his jihad in
Afghanistan and not inside Yemen with
this starting to become public this
Yemeni journalist was going on Al
Jazeera and was helping other US media
outlets report that story that it was in
fact a US strike US officials were
denying it and eventually that
anonymously said yes we were behind the
strike but General David Petraeus said
that no civilians were actually killed
in the strike and that it's all a big
exaggeration which was very offensive to
Yemenis of all political stripes and so
it was an enduring scandal and this one
journalist was really pushing this story
and he continued to report on other on
the expanding US air war in Yemen and
one night in the middle of the night he
was in the middle of a he was out with a
cretinous it was a political cartoonist
and they were shopping and he was
snatched by US backed us trade
counterterrorism forces in sauna the
capital of Yemen and was taken to the
political security prison and was beaten
bloody by the security services and told
that he was to stop talking about the
missile strikes and then they released
him onto the streets and what this
journalist did was to go straight to Al
Jazeera and say I was just beaten by the
political security officers and they're
trying to stop me from talking about the
US missile strikes that are happening in
the country and and soon after he did
that his house was raided by the CTU the
counterterrorism unit which is a JSOC
and CIA trained entity and they snatched
him out of his home and disappeared him
for 30 days and no one knew where he was
and then they hauled him into a court
that has been specifically set up by the
ship to prosecute journalists for crimes
against the state and was ultimately
convicted of being an al-qaeda
facilitator because he facilitated
al-qaeda members being able to speak to
the media and which I've talked to
people in US intelligence who actually
also believe that this case is
outrageous because they said you took
off the streets one of the best
reporters that we would read who act so
we could actually understand what was
going on in Yemen because of the
notorious corruption of all of the
informants so he is put into this prison
he's put on trial total sham trial his
lawyers refused to present a defense no
lawyer would represent him at his own
request because he said I don't want to
recognize a shred of legitimacy of this
process and we have video of him when he
is in prison they bring him in front of
the into the courtroom in us in a Cell
they have him in a cage of the cell and
as they're pulling him away he said my
crime is exposing the American missile
attack on the tiny Bedwin village of el
maje Allah and I beyond province they're
putting me in jail because I exposed
their cruise missile attack and they
said this is what happens when Yemeni
journalists are real journalists and
they pull him away and they and they
disappear him into this prison there was
so much outrage in Yemen from his tribe
and from from human rights organizations
and from mainstream civil society in
Yemen that the dictator Ali Abdullah
Saleh had no choice but to issue a
pardon against abdul allah Haider Shia
this happens a lot in Yemen someone gets
arrested the tribes protest and then the
person is released he said oh it's a
game that's been playing out in that
country for a long time so he's gradient
marked in the official news service the
Saba news agency does a report saying
that this journalist is going to be
pardoned that day the dictator of Yemen
receives a phone call from the White
House not from some liaison not from
Secretary of State from President Obama
himself personally and president obama
tells the dictator of Yemen that he's
deeply concerned about news that a blue
Ella Haider Shia is going to be released
and the pardon is torn up unless you
think I'm making this up where I've just
heard it secondhand I know this because
the White House put it on their own web
site in a readout of the phone call from
that day and when I called the State
Department to ask them this is a year
and a half after Abu Haider had been in
prison since his phone call what is the
US State Department's positioned on abu
laila hydra they said our position
remains the same as articulated by
president obama in that phone call we
believe he should be kept in prison so
this journalist is in prison because of
the President of the United States
making a phone call and having his
pardon ripped up and he's not doing well
in prison I'm in touch with his family
he's my understanding is that he's
losing starting to lose his mind which
is very common with people that are kept
in solitary confinement or in these
conditions and none of the news
organizations that worked with him in
the US ABC news/washington post and none
of them have said anything about his
case no where are they when he's getting
them sensationalist footage when he
interviewed Anwar Awlaki they all wanted
to broadcast his comments about Nidal
Hasan you know who conducted the
massacre at Fort Hood Texas and they
wanted to ask they want to know what
I'll lucky said about the underwear
bomber you know why we know what I'll
walk you thought about that because
hablo Layla Haider Shia found him
interviewed him and published it in the
washington post on NBC and yet when he
is in prison they say nothing it's
shameful it's shameful and that's often
what happens in these cases journalists
like like myself and others we go into
these countries and and and you know I I
encourage people to read the
acknowledgments in my book because I
tell you I name the names of all of the
journalists in Yemen and Somalia and
Afghanistan and elsewhere around the
world who made it possible for this
story to be told and they're the real
heroes of this unfamous journalists who
report oftentimes not in English take
the great risks people like me I go in
and I can go somewhere for a few weeks
or a month and I depend on them to be
able to tell these stories and when so
when something happens to one of our
colleagues Somalia journalists are being
gunned down in record
numbers in Yemen journalists are being
thrown in prison if we don't speak up
when we have a platform and and defend
our colleagues we should be ashamed of
ourselves and we should be ashamed to
call ourselves journalist as we wrap up
this is the week that the bush library
is open Dallas aware there is an
evaluation a reevaluation going on of
his record it's a tenth anniversary of
the war in Iraq and today we're talking
about the years of the Obama
administration can you talk about
President Obama's record let me tell you
what I felt and maybe saw the resting
felt when I saw the pictures of the bush
library presentation there was a group
of men standing there former presidents
once every lie every one of them as a
major criminal he is continuing the
grand tradition the great surprise I
just said the sentence that came to my
mind at the time is actually from Thomas
Jefferson who said once that he said I
tremble for my country when I think that
God is just and someday will bring us to
his judgment well if we can't bring them
to some kind of judgment either Don the
courts
at least in public opinion then like
what Jeremy said we're not doing our
duty just as responsible people end with
you this is your second major book your
first book was Blackwater the rise of
the world's most powerful mercenary army
where you really reframed you reframe
the whole discussion about mercenaries
in the privatization of the US military
suffice it to say here we are what six
years later and erik prince had to move
the founder Blackwater to Abu Dhabi and
you remain here in the United States
and I wanted to ask with this second
book and Jeremy is going to be signing
afterwards and I encourage everyone to
get this book not just for interesting
summer reading but that we can see a
spring in a summer of us farm policy
when we are informed what a difference
it makes to begin with those tools to be
empowered to challenge what we how we
are represented in the rest of the world
but I want to ask you Jeremy finally
your new book it's called dirty wars the
world is a battlefield what are you
hoping to accomplish with this book and
why you even call it dirty whores the
one
one one thing that I think you'll notice
if you if you read the book oh you know
I talked to friends about the you know
when i wrote Blackwater I think I've
grown up a lot since I wrote that book
in a sense because something really
strange happened to me after I wrote
Blackwater and that was that I started
to get emails and other electronic
communications from from people that had
served in special operations forces or
worked with the CIA not senior officials
I don't have not with the powerful ever
in fact when I was talking about this
official who told me what he said about
the killing above the lopmon I had to
chase him around the campus of the
University I found him on and you know
he did not want to speak to me I had to
sort of chase him that's that's pretty
much the only interaction I had with
powerful officials it's chasing them
somewhere at home but but but I started
to get communications from the operators
and people that were doing these
operations and you know there was a sort
of a pattern to them early on and
sometimes they've come to events and
come up to me afterwards and they'd say
you know I don't allow much I don't care
very much for your politics but you were
totally right about black water you
can't stand them and I got to know
people in that world in that community
because they also were had problems with
Blackwater it didn't like various
actions or problems that the company's
actions have caused for their units or
the fact that they were getting paid so
much more than the conventional soldiers
whatever it was but I started a dialogue
with with some of these people that
continues to this day and I learned a
tremendous about from them about how
these operations run and what I tried to
do in the book I mean I hope I succeeded
to a degree with it is to weave in and
out of stories that show the complicated
landscape of the killing fields and the
the men who do the operations on the
ground the figures who are identified as
the targets the civilians that are
forced to live on the other
the barrel of the gun or in the place
where the bombs are going off and to put
it in a historical context I think if
you would ask me years ago what I think
you know what I want to accomplish or
what I think should be done I would have
pretended to have an answer because I
think it says you know I'm bullheaded I
I think that we unfortunately are only
at the very beginning of a conversation
that we have to that's urgent and that
we have to have in this country about
how far we as a society of let things to
go make things go since nine eleven in
the name of protecting our security and
I concur very much with what gnome said
about being gripped by fear you know
fear is a very powerful force and if you
don't figure out a way to confront it
and not be owned by it then things like
the patriot act happen and and civil
liberties get rolled back and you know
people say oh I'd baa and people that
are whining about that are crazy and
it's conspiracy theory and all of these
things and you just have just study
history it starts somewhere it starts
with an idea and then a crisis happens
and they implement the idea that's been
laying around its it you know it's it's
it's a it's a very old concept and my
hope is that people use the book as
actionable intelligence which is
actually an until you know a terminus to
the CIA or in the target of business but
I want it to be actionable intelligence
to work toward a democratic process of
confronting our own fear and also
holding those in power accountable
whether they're Democrats or Republicans
I think all of us should be defined not
by the public pronouncements of
politicians but by what we do in
response to the actions they're doing in
our name and that's the spirit
about eight and everybody
all right yeah
you got here what about
hey how you doing you out so much
okay you're get everyone look at
everyone
