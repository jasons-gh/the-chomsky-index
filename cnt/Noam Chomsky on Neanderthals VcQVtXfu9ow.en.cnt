Chomsky recently has been accumulated a
lot of information about the genome of
Neanderthals and because particular
because of Svante Paabo School in
Leipzig and others some people believe
that the Nano dolls were possessing
language as well would you be so should
be exclude completely under now the task
from the other sync language according
to opinion well then there's been a lot
of work coming out recently from the Max
Planck Center in Nijmegen alleging that
Neanderthals had speech capacity
I think it's complete nonsense frankly
there's but instead of that there's a
paper that just came out about it if
you're interested by came out in
frontiers of Psychology by half a dozen
authors I was one of them but other
specialists in the topic dick Lewontin
one of the major evolutionary biologists
and Johann ball is major student of
birdsong mark Hauser primatologist the
Charles yang computational scientists
and Bob Berwick covers all these fields
they it goes through all of this stuff
in some detail and I just think it's
really fantasy I mean it's based on
evidence so skimpy that you just can't
build anything on it I mean it's true
that Neanderthals didn't survive until
maybe thirty thousand years ago and
anyway they and there are sites where
Nandor we have both Sandersville and
hominid human you know human Homo
sapiens of mixed so there was
interaction one of the big discoveries
allegedly as this excited people is the
discovery they've done genomic analysis
of Neanderthals finally does a Finnish
scientist has been able to do this
and it turns out that there's a small
percentage of Neanderthal genes in
humans mostly I think in around the
Mediterranean area where there were a
lot of Neanderthals and that's supposed
to mean something it means absolutely
nothing I mean but the biologists are
well aware that you get species across
fertilization at some low level even
distinct species so this literally tells
you nothing and in fact as far as I know
most of the evidence that's presented
just doesn't stand up I mean if it were
true it wouldn't tell you anything
so suppose Neanderthals had also
undergone whatever or suppose that
whatever this change was happened say
seven hundred thousand years ago prior
to the separation of in the under
thousand Homo sapiens okay same same
problems and an additional problem how
come for seven hundred thousand years it
never exhibited itself in the
archaeological record another mystery so
I would simply the same is true if you
could suppose you could show some day
that Apes there's been an enormous
effort to try to show that apes can
acquire something like language I mean
if if that ever succeeded it would be a
biological miracle it would mean that
Apes had this incredible capacity that
has made it possible for humans to soar
take over the world but they never
thought of using it I mean it would be
like trying to find finding say on some
desert island a perfectly constructed
bird which had never thought of flying
until some humans came and said hey why
don't you fly I mean it's not a logical
impossibility but no biologist should
expect anything like that and in fact
the whole enterprise is kind of
senseless
then there's no point to try to do it it
can't work out the fact that it doesn't
work out shouldn't surprise anyone and I
think the same at the moment I think the
same can be said about the under
thoughts but have a look at the articles
and current issue of frontiers it
