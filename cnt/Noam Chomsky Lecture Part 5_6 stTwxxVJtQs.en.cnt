essentially gave corporations karke
launched by elections after that case
the the white hats knows that it's going
to need to raise about a billion dollars
for its reelection campaign that's the
context in which this and other recent
appointments need to be judged i think
east quite right take a look at GE about
half of its workforce is abroad roughly
half of its revenue comes from abroad
also it's not a i mean it does produce
mostly abroad but it's substantially a
financial its most a lot of its revenue
from financial operations for which you
did get a hefty bail out the appointment
is Harold that is for job growth if you
think for a minute it has very little to
do with job growth know what it has to
do is with is follow the money about a
century ago the great political
financier that mark Hanna said that two
things are important in politics they
said the first is money then I forgotten
the second one that's far more truth
today vastly more true especially after
the radical changes of the last thirty
years and the restriction of electoral
democracy to hardly more than a shadow
well the State of the Union speech is
going to be all about jobs we know that
jobs has a special meaning in the
English language it's the way you
pronounce the obscene word profits
that's where you're not allowed to say
so what you call it is jobs when you're
when a politician says I'm working to
increase jobs you're supposed to
understand I'm working to increase
profits so when you appoint the head of
GE to produce jobs and me
well helping export jobs and you know
bail amount of his financial operations
get into trouble and so on that's
improving jobs that's the standard
rhetorical device there used to be a
counterforce unions but they're now
virtually destroyed in the public sector
and incidentally that's against the will
of the working population many polls on
this popular working people strongly
support the unionization in fact the
United States is unique in the
industrial world in that there's a huge
body of work
oh it looks like a third
country as compared with almost any
other certainly an industrial country
with many others in fact there have been
massive social and engineering problems
state policies state corporate social
engineering programs to try to maximize
use of wasteful use of fossil fuel it's
a very interesting story in itself that
course severely harms the environment
and the future and how's that being
dealt with we don't have to have you
know talk about the the wonderful future
we think what's happening right now as
you know Obama basically took over the
auto industry government pretty much
owned it there were number of things you
could do one thing was to continue the
policies that the auto industry had been
following the closing plants shipping
jobs abroad the cutting down salaries
and attacking unionization well that's
exactly what they did meanwhile while
this was going on while the government
was closing auto plants shipping jobs
abroad the Transportation Secretary Ray
LaHood was in Europe he was traveling
around in Spain trying to use federal
stimulus money to get contracts to build
high-speed rail the things that could
have been done perfectly well in the
factories that were being closed here
but with less profit than the less money
for the financial for Goldman Sachs and
the rest so therefore not a not done
actually there is more that could have
been done there could have been the oh
if the auto industry managers didn't
like that there is an alternative once
the government essentially owns the
industry could turn that over to the
workforce the workforce and the
community so-called stakeholders maybe
with some help could run the factories
profitably without the need for
layers and layers of management and you
know bankers and so on and do the work
here in fact there have been efforts to
to carry that to carry that through they
don't have so far they haven't had
enough community support or public
support to succeed but they could that's
the same is true of green technology
everyone agrees that's the future growth
area but that's the growth is in places
like Spain and Germany and particularly
China US investors do invest in green
technology but in China now because
there they get support for it not here
the u.s. is a society that's going to
fall behind but concentrated wealth and
power will do just fine as long as the
population allows it and without going
on that's the crucial matter throughout
whether it's Egypt or the United States
will we allow ourselves to be subject to
the guiding principle of domestic and
international affairs namely the
powerful do what they want as long as
they can get away with it as long as the
ignorant then meddlesome outsider stay
quiet and passive that principle has
been contested right through American
history now that's why the domains of
the justice and freedom have expanded
quite considerably over time but not
uniformly there are periods of
aggression like right now it's being
contested right now and today literally
today in places where the conditions are
far more onerous than they're here Egypt
for example recovering the spirit of
democracy and justice there which is a
deep current of US history recovering
that is possible but that's a choice
won't happen by itself and a great deal
turns on how that
the choice is made
unfortunately we don't have time for
Question and Answer I'm sorry but there
will be a book would you like to do
question at certs Richard it's your call
mr. dr. Chomsky
we actually are going to have a few
questions
we can't go too long ago because just
like you Lana or it was known that a
translator yeah if I may thank you for
being here as pleasure to see you again
a couple of related questions it seems
to me that the way things are moving
forward or is a you know it seems like
they're ruling class is on a path of
self-destruction what is happening to
the liberal class were the guardian of
situations by sugarcoating things I a
related question yet stated in the past
that regarding global shift in power
such as second such countries as India
and China that you felt the the you
mentioned that the nations that are
divorced from internal power structure
or or basically won't have much role in
the global global system if you could
elaborate on that as well to the
liberal class who's the liberal class
it's the Democrats it's Obama Obama
supporters they are like Clinton said
Eisenhower Republicans for the reasons I
mentioned they're partly out of
necessity you know what they think is
necessity and partly out of choice
they're pursuing the policies that I've
been describing it's a little different
I mean there's more complexity than this
so if you look over the democrats have
somewhat different constituency than the
Republicans they do have they used to
have at least a working-class
constituency of poor minorities women
and so on and they do to some extent to
respond to their interest so over the
past there have been some good studies
of this no one of the best is by Larry
Bartels good political scientist and
what he points out is that if you take a
look over many years comparing
Democratic and Republican
administrations the general population
aside from the very rich does somewhat
better under Democrats not a lot and now
the Democrats are increasingly as I said
becoming moderate Republicans Obama's
the liberal hope it's his policies are
the ones were seen at my point was was
basically isn't if the current trend
continues isn't that destabilizes
society and this certain third world
model that we're in or or begin you're
going to work
the question I have is is given given
the current economic situation if this
trend continues creating a disability in
the society the traditional role of new
liberalism was to prevent or to maintain
the society and and what happens if this
condition continues how do what it were
are the Liberals that used to maintain
be a guardian of preventing yes
traditional role well first of all
remember that the main counter force to
the business run class war which goes on
all the time the main counter force has
been the labor movement that's why the
labor movement has been under such
bitter attack actually all through
American history but it keeps reviving
but since the Second World War when it
was quite strong there has just been a
major concerted attack on unions if
you're interested in the scale of it
some good studies there's a book by
elizabeth phones wolf not particularly
liberal but she goes through the
corporate offensive propaganda offensive
to try to undermine unions a beginning
in the early 50s I mean it's just
staggering cinema media you know
takeover of sports league churches
forced courses and captive audiences and
factories schools and major attack and
it's it's been successful in the private
sector unionization is and you know is
below ten percent now they've all it's
also succeeded in creating fear and
hatred of unions among a lot of people
not among working people they want them
but along much of the population you
know you're supposed to despise unions
it's pretty dramatic this way this works
I mean I don't know if you guys look at
old movies but back in the early 1950s
1953 when all this stuff was beginning
there were two major films that came out
one of them was a huge hit it's called
on the waterfront the hero is Marlon
Brando and the theme of the movie is
that you know this ordinary Joe you know
this honest working man Marlon Brando
drew finally stands up and overthrows
that corrupt union bosses it ends up
with him throwing the union boss into
the ocean or something and you're all
supposed to cheer that's one of them the
other movie was a really great movie
which almost nobody has ever seen it's
called salt of the earth it was a very
inexpensively done movie where the theme
was feminism and labor it was about a
strike an important strike which was
actually one with a Hispanic woman more
or less leading it and a lot of worker
participation so beautifully done movie
