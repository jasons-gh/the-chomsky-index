that's a matter of choice I mean you
know you have to choose each person to
what extent
by self-interest to what extent am I
going to care about others there's no
nobody can lay down a legislation about
that we can have our own views about the
topic so tell you my view you tell me
your view I think people should be
concerned with other not just with their
own self-interest of course you can't
dismiss your own self-interest you want
to survive live a decent life enjoy
grandchildren and so on and so forth
that self-interest but substantial part
of your life should be I think concern
for others and in normal human beings it
is sympathy is a deep principle altruism
is a deep principle not just rather unit
I'm just takes a Dolphins who are very
remote from us in the evolutionary scale
million years or so but many people are
doing demonstrate great courage to save
dolphins who were swapped on the beach
because we have sympathy
I think you cannot deny either I think
the tough thing is to acknowledge it the
way we have been sort of program so far
by the whole knowledge development
paradigm is we like to pretend their
self-interest is on a back burner that
is the public interest that drives us
it's the disinterested search after
knowledge the travelers and precisely
because of that I think your generation
is going to look at my generation pretty
harshly because now that you can see
that problem it's a white you to pretend
that you have no self interest why can't
you acknowledge it because if you
acknowledge it I place you in a better
position and myself in a better position
to test whether my self interest is
driving and whether the outcomes I don't
like because they do not achieve my self
interest and therefore prevent me from
seeing that while my self interest may
not have been realized Allah a wider
mutual community interest may be
realized so I think we need to
acknowledge that it's part of us let's
not hide it put it on the table put the
community interests on the table put the
interest of preserving nature in its
totality on the table then ask ourselves
wait a minute you want to do ABC is that
going to lead to a destruction of nature
or as an enhancement is that going to be
building the community or destroying the
committee is that going to be building
my humanity or making me in you make and
I think those are the tests but you
can't matter reach those tests if we
don't say put the self interest on the
table put the mutual interest on the
table
and put the wider interest of our
responsibility to major so I'm not yet
at the point where I say that there's a
contradiction but I say acknowledgement
is the precondition that we have reached
how do you balance between that too well
I i think in one way the balancing
between self-interest and and and the
global interest as essentially
increasingly becoming interweaved in our
society as countries and nations become
more interconnected notions which were
once possible about and and more are
more aware of one another notions which
once possible whether they were war or
hostility actually get reduced now at
the same time obviously part of the
challenges we face around the world are
a the whole issue of modernity and
modernity changing civilizations around
the world to the to at least from some
people's perspective they are regret and
thus generating tensions and I think how
we balance that and how we're going to
resolve that issue this is probably one
of the greatest questions of our time
