this might sound kind of branded that I
would really like to ask your inner wide
think they're just preoccupied with
popular Salafis right now in our culture
those zombies things like then yes well
my thinking I've never seen a real study
but my guess is that its reflection fear
of disparate then when it's a very
frightened country the United States an
unusually frightful fun and in such
circumstances people concoct either
first gate or maybe adequately fears
that terrible things happen that you
need that the fear in the United States
is pretty interesting cultural phenomena
and she goes back to the colonies that
there's a good stage of a very
interesting quote by a very good
literary critic where's Franklin it's
called the war start I want to take a
look at to study the popular literature
the kind of leader do you know most
people read the method from the earliest
days of the present when isn't present
adjusted television but just kind of
popular culture and there are couple of
themes that run through pretty striking
led to a curation for one thing of one
major theme father is the we're about to
face instruction from some terrible
awesome entered enemy and in the last
minute were saved by a superhero or a
super weapon or in recent years high
school kids going to the hills the chase
related rush things like that
that's been the Bronx through the
hospital us and there's something turns
out that the enemy this horrible enemy
is about destroy it is somebody worth
depression so you go back to the early
years the terrible enemy was the ending
for going to destroy us I mean the
colonists reports invader they're
invading the con whatever you think that
the endings of attending that are
terrible but is this even in the
Declaration of Independence of people
read it every July 4th how many people
pay attention with the reading telling
me we're looking runs world but she read
it and pay attention this is pretty
remarkable capacity so one passage is a
list of the build indictment against in
George the third thing with explaining
why the concert both one of them is he
unleashed against us the merciless
Indian savages whose known way of
warfare and torture and instructions on
well Thomas Jefferson who wrote that it
was very free figure of the
Enlightenment a new birth well but it
was the merciless in the English set
whose non-waiver warfare was destruction
of murder and word that taking over the
country and the driving out our mating
native but it's switched the creation of
independence and nobody comments on it
for him towards of the year that's
another sign of the same concern after
that it became the slaves there was
gonna be a slave revolt terrible Slater
people and the slave population black
population
that killed the kill all the men you
know great boat women's for the country
but it's not about that and it goes on
through the center becomes a modern
times Hispanic narco-traffickers but the
comment and destroyed society one thing
after another and this these are real
fear but that's a lot of what lies
behind me extremely unusual gun culture
at that stage it's quite unique Hamza
have deaths by gun in the United States
way outside there's a kind of Asteria
about having guns large part of the
population because we just haven't have
to happen to protect himself from boot
from the United Nations from the federal
government from and maybe from Zhan we
were hit we just have to have done to
protect and that's not known elsewhere
in the world you may be in say Siri
hundred is for something like that but a
hundred is not in that piece that has an
unusual security that's a great great
freedom that's quite remarkable and I
suspect that when you're bringing up as
part of it I think it said it much of it
is kind of just a recognition at some
level of the psyche that if you've got
here food on somebody's neck there's
nothing wrong and that the people who
are present may rise up and attend
themselves in your drop and another's
strange properties in countries always
that of the fear of the invented to
damage it
said that there is some kind of a
paranoid streaming focus for the new
