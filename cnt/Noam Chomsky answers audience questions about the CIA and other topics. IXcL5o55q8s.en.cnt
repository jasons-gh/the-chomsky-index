they're recruiting for this they're
recruiting for the CIA they're
recruiting for the CIA they're not
recruiting for they're recruiting for
the CIA they're not recruiting for
Microsoft or you know you know Wall
Street this this concentration on CIA
atrocities is one of the techniques
that's used to avoid criticism of the
government of real power if you can
blame something on the CIA you know this
kind of rogue outfit then you do exactly
what the government wants you to do and
the CIA is therefore what's called the
not plausible deniability it's the
phrase that's used inside so if the
government wants to say you know
overthrow the Indonesian if Washington
wants to overthrow the government of
Indonesia you say ok the CIA did it and
then you can say well you know we don't
know anything do it that's just that
rogue outfit if something goes wrong the
CIA is an agency of the executive branch
of the government they do what the
executive branch of the government tells
them to do there's a long record rich
record and there are some exceptions but
overwhelmingly the CIA is just an agency
of the executive which acts in ways to
provide plausible deniability
to sort of keep us clean if something
goes wrong then you blame them if
something goes wrong now that's true on
case after case so yeah when we when you
talk about the CIA you should think of
that as a metaphor it's a way of
describing what the executive branch of
the government is doing and the
corporate backers of the executive
branch and they've got this agency which
carries out the ugly stuff for them and
that's what secret agencies are like in
most states so I think one should be
cautious about that and it's not wrong
to blame the CIA for this that and the
other thing but remember they're there
and that's not the brain question that
President Obama's sincerity and veracity
and saying you'll be working yeah he
probably said it somewhere but that's
like one of these statements like
Hitler's statement that we invaded
Poland to protect ourselves from the
wild terror of the poles I mean there's
a perfectly predictable statements by
every leader I'm gonna be working for
peace and justice and trust in me and so
on so those are the kind of statements
you ignore because they're meaningless
they're predictable every powerful
leader will say the same thing and they
do so you ignore it and pay attention to
what he actually said well it turns out
that comes down to practically nothing
his campaign was very well designed so
that it would be vacuous he pretty his
managers Ranna
extremely good campaign it was such a it
was so good that the advertising
industry which gives an award every year
for the best marketing campaign of the
year they gave it to the Obama campaign
was and executive executive recorded in
the business press that we're saying you
know really exultant they were saying
we've been marketing candidates like
commodities ever since Reagan and this
is the best we've ever done it's going
to change the atmosphere in corporate
boardrooms you know new ways of doing
things and so on and it sells in Europe
too if you watch the Zoltan campaign you
know well if you read the New York Times
for example couple days ago as a front
page picture of the different dresses
that Michelle Obama wore you know in the
morning she were addressed from this
fancy designer and the afternoon it was
some other fancy designer and
all the young people loved it and they
want to touch of Obama and so on yeah
that's good marketing campaigns but what
is and it was the same right through the
campaign I you know you've paid
attention so you know it was basically
vacuous I mean like on israel-palestine
literally the only statement he made was
the one I quoted on stay wrote other
than you know the usual vacuum
platitudes
I'll talk tomorrow about Obama in the
Middle East so go into it now but put it
simply it's probably more hawkish than
Bush did if I understand what's the
current situation of the Norman
Finkelstein case yes well the situation
is that he was he's written an extensive
and outstanding work on Israel Palestine
international law other things and he
was coming up for tenure at DePaul
University and there was a huge attack
on him you know may not get you had to
try to destroy him
and it came he came pretty close to
being appointed despite it but at the
last minute you know the for whatever
reason the administration overturned the
faculty you know the faculty
recommendation to promote him to tenure
okay now you know that is an attack on
academic freedom of course but it's a
very special case the special case has
to do with the lunatic at Harvard Law
School named Alan Dershowitz who
who makes old-fashioned Stalinism look
pale literally I won't go through it but
Finkelstein made the mistake of writing
a book
he's a very meticulous careful scholar
and nobody never find anything wrong
with what he says but he wrote a book in
which he ran through Dershowitz is a
best-selling apologetics for Israel and
sure there was just a tissue of lies and
fabrications and slanders and support
for the atrocities and so on and it was
a very careful meticulous job now
they're sure it's is a lawyer he
actually wrote a book called something
like advice to young lawyers and he
gives some good advice he says if you
have a client and you know that he's
guilty as sin what you should do is
anything you can up to outright
violation of law to get him clear clear
okay now they're sure which has two
clients himself in Israel okay and he
acts on his own advice so that he knows
he can't respond to what Finkelstein
wrote so therefore he launched into a
campaign of you know of vilification and
slander the kind of never seen and I
think he could find it in the Stalinist
literature just to give you an example
Norman's mother who he Revere's is a
survivor of Auschwitz
okay so Finkelstein actually published
an article in which he says she survived
Auschwitz because she was a cop oh you
know a collaborator with the Nazis you
know this is see if you can find
anything like that in the Stalinist
literature or anywhere you know that's
the kind of thing that was going on and
he and you know he probably and managed
to mobilize funders and others and of
course the
most vulgar parts of the Jewish
community got involved and the Catholic
University is vulnerable because they
can be accused of anti-semitism okay
that's one of the background weapons
anti-semitism
and somebody mentioned this before I
don't know maybe you but this use of the
notion anti-semitism is extremely
cynical the Dennis it's conscious so the
leading Israeli statesman the most
admired statesman of Evan admired
particularly because he had an Oxford
accent that always but he was considered
very distinguished in our static
Englishman but he gave he wrote an
article once in one of the American
Jewish journals Congress weekly in which
he explained as like thirty years ago he
explained to the American Jewish
community what their task was he said
their task is to show that any criticism
of Zionism which means criticism of
Israel is either anti-semitism or the
result of neurotic Jewish self-hatred
okay that that amounts to 100 percent
okay so that's your task and that's
exactly what they do
and certainly had two examples of
neurotic and a Jewish self-hatred I was
one and the other was I have stone you
know it was a dedicated Zionist all his
life but we're that because we were
critical of Israel so and in fact the it
is written in Hebrew there are two terms
two words Republicans there's the word
that means propaganda which is used for
everybody and the word that's used for
themselves which translates as
explanation see the assumption is that
everything we do is so obviously correct
that all we have to do is explain it to
the goyim you know to the non-jews and
then they'll understand and that's the
line constantly you know you read the
stuff so that's our Evans advice so
every criticism is either anti-semitism
or Jewish self-hatred the campaign what
else could there be since everything
that's done
obviously right Finkelstein is you know
his you'll have a very hard time
teaching after this because he's been
defamed badly but he's getting on he's
writing a lot very good stuff he's
giving hundreds of talks all over the
place
he's got a new book almost coming almost
out this reason we'll be out and both
here in abroad you know it's not the
best situation we're all buddies making
out okay
source of inspiration what people have
done you know I mean I'm like take say
the Palestinians and they've survived
it's astonishing you know that's a
source of inspiration to have survived
and a tack like this that goes it goes
back a century but is intensifying in
recent years and to still be struggling
to get your voice heard like Greta's
doing that's inspiring and people do
that all over the world you know here
too
I mean there just take here where the
struggles are much easier you know we're
privileged but a lot has been achieved I
mean I think say that the presence of
this audience I mean a couple of years
ago you could barely get ten people in a
room to hear about this and if you had
them this talk would be broken up I mean
I could give you examples from my own
background
it takes a what was probably the makes
it take the last election I mean I
didn't like any of the candidates that's
probably clear to you but nevertheless
just consider the fact that the
Democratic Party had two candidates a
woman and an african-american I mean 40
years ago you can dream of that I mean
10 years ago you couldn't dream of it
where'd it come from well you know I
came from activism mostly of young
people engaged dedicated people who just
made the country more civilized far more
civilized I'm gonna take my own
University MIT when I got there 50 years
ago if you walk down the halls it was
obedient white males well-dressed doing
their work differential you know so on
they walk down the halls today it kind
of looks like this yes half women third
minorities in formal relations among
people a lot of it a lot of act not not
as much as I'd like to see but a lot of
activism on all kind of things
all right that's happened all over the
country I mean the issues that are now
concerned people didn't even exist forty
years ago I mean take say the Solidarity
movements which grew up and around
Central America in the 80s mostly in not
in the elite centers you know it was
like churches and Kansas and that kind
of a lot of it from evangelicals well
you know that's the that's a real
breakthrough in the history of
imperialism nothing like that's ever
happened and nobody in England or France
or Germany or the United States or
whatever ever dreamed of going to the
targets of imperial attack living in the
villages they're trying to help people
and even to offer them some protection
with the white face but you know
thousands of Americans did that in the
80s that's really significant it's a
reflection of a major cultural change
but you're never going to read about
this and the newspapers are the last
thing they want you know but it's it's
changed the society well that's
inspiring and these people worked hard
and faced a lot of danger you know not
the kind of danger you face in the third
world but real and put aside easy
lucrative careers to devote themselves
to these things
okay that's inspiring you can go on and
on
