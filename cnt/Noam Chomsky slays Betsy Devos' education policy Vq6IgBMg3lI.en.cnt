[Music]
when you answered my email you you told
me about the trip to Rotterdam that was
quite an amazing story could you tell me
where well you you you had some memories
about about the Netherlands about
Rotterdam in particular 1953 you were on
the trip to Europe and you were on a
boat on a Dutch boat or in German boat
that was was Dutch dredged out of the
Rotterdam Harbor a couple weeks during
the war was an amazing story so let's
let's talk about education I want to
focus on education because that's my
core business as well so it's hard not
to talk about the corona crisis but
let's do it in combination with
education
what has the christ has done to
education well it's had a big effect for
children it means they're not having the
enormous advantage of congregating
together in a in a school setting which
in a decent school can be very valuable
they're stuck with home schooling which
sometimes is okay so it's not up to the
level of universities it's very unclear
whether you're gonna see why so the
there's been in the United States or
anywhere where the neoliberal rules have
been followed there's been a sharp
cutback public funding for new versions
state universities in the United States
as state funding as sharp or decline now
they're being hit with another blow many
rely on collisions including foreign
tuitions and cons with it
huge financial blow the education is
it's pretty clear that in the fall
most universities will still be doing
online teaching they're preparing today
preparing with my colleagues for the
online course at our University this is
okay
but it's not like having a live
classroom right there for large classes
lectures or from standing arms so you
can adapt but it's how universities and
schools would emerge from this isn't
from your I suspect we know one thing
that's happening all of the more their
harsh little sections persisting with
the constant class war that they pursue
Lantis Lee they would like to privatize
education eliminate public system which
of course means works for the rich not
for anyone else but that's the core
principle of the more savage version of
capitalism the move over in every domain
super gently take rates today Trump is
trying to kill the postal service
because the Postal Service doesn't make
profit for the rich they'd only provide
services for the population so in parts
of this country nothing this one HP I
don't care if even this Vincent's thing
the postal service in many communities
I've seen it myself this place where
people go to the post office tell
somebody who's talking to me good
friends there's also something in the
background telling the black-footed much
is very serious
the post office is extremely dangerous
this highly efficient it serves people
and it can get people to think maybe you
can do something for yourselves not
maybe through the government not handed
over to the private enterprise to blood
so it's out of your hands
I'm in the core of neoliberalism in the
Netherlands private States many roles is
to destroy democracy to move decisions
from government which I some
accountability population then to
private hands by the tyrannies and for
joy would you have no incidents when you
get people to believe the government's
can't do anything well of course they
can such after not that when you have an
efficient service that's working to
everyone so that's something you
described in this book as well education
as a system of indoctrination is your
message from this book is it still
relevant for today it can be doesn't
have to be amended or also breaks from
the what the official system the system
this is imposed was this larger system
indoctrination a spiteful in the United
States by parties you can see it in
programs that have committed years the
programs are basically teaching to test
mm-hmm those tests the children have to
learn sixth amount of things then no let
me just
later forget with you know that's my own
experience actually the worst possible
model education you go back 200 years
this mean ridicule like I was called
pouring water into the fashion worst
kind of education and a very leaky
person that's actually we've all
experienced some cup courts you are
interested in she wants attention
we worked passage and two weeks later
and that has a good advantage of
indoctrination locking created I mean I
talk to school teachers have heard some
school teachers call me just wilted six
cream teacher came up to me actually she
told me experience just talking about
something in class we go when the
teacher was forced to tell her aunt
you have to study for me yeah like wish
you depends on you myself and that
cousin perfect thanking challenges to
it's already I just
you don't have to salon I know we hear
about Trump all day long but Trump is
not the one who is responsible for
education that's Betsy DeVos how would
you how do you look back on her and
nearly four years in office
what's diverse she's probably the
coolest most distant of the collection
of
criminals in the Trump administration
we're saying is private smooth that's
what get rid of the public school system
and she's every move she makes
it's just sheer sadism
so a couple of days ago she came out
with it
agent saying whether some of this
stimulus money is going to school but
some of this were released for students
you're in trouble
he said it cannot go to doc I students
it's a cool undocumented kids who were
brought here as children thank you today
we have to strangle what's that
satisfies more sadistic imposes
justification for her what parts of
Education where comes a very rich back
their foundation turns out to be the one
that's funding these demonstrations like
governor's offices they're trying to get
them to stop the lockdown which of
course you're going to see spreads
runaway but that's a way to feeling
there's nothing to know
the main principle it is rid of public
education you don't want it so kind of
thing it makes people think the
government to do something that's a very
good idea privatize charter schools we
will impose the well we can of course
knock out anything useless like aid to
children special needs
I will just take the people who serve
and well that's Betsy DeVos what about
her predecessor Arne Duncan was he so
much better it wasn't great but at least
it wasn't a dedicated sadist and he
wasn't I didn't like his race to the top
punitive accountability standardized
testing so so how did you break with
those rules in your own teaching
practice how did you make sure that you
nurtured creativity in your own
classroom I chose I my background was
doing a presentation
my father was a special education home
when my parents sent me to it
experimental aggressive doing school
Temple University which I've never very
impressive education to play so I just
experienced it on my way I started
teaching when I was a teenager
did you ever see that's kids in the
afternoon and then Sunday morning pretty
tricky I was gonna get busy partly out
of interest partner that's always
working my way through college it's a
hard teaching experience these kids
admitted school your friends are welcome
a vegetable no it's not a classroom but
it was possible to use ways of getting
them excited about these material
exploring understand things they can be
done right now in this
Sciences you were working to devise
science programs for schools
yes very good you know they were my guys
from kindergarten to high school so I
can't 110 your garden program was
started by the teacher is each kid
Michelle and on the shield a number of
objects see Angie opposes a challenge
find out which ones can grow then the
class as a session really kids when they
talk about what you might do
the teacher is there she's sort of like
I come up with some ideas and finally
after a couple of sessions they figured
out a way to determine that it succeeded
good so once they've determined that the
teacher there's a microscope cuts every
kid looks inside that's at the
kindergarten go to the high school a
really great program just pretty-looking
is to ask the cost how can a mosquito
fly in the rain turns out if you look at
it it's kind of miraculous
it's a raindrop little raindrop Hudson
Steven if that something of that force
is a human means we'd be crushed
hmm so how can it work that learn some
physics mr. Clarington biology to work
through the hard problem it's not really
get it
you're intelligent that can be done in
any level and of course at the college
level work spiritual it's not always
done that without very boring cords
intro but if you get to replace like you
see MIT where I spent all my life
classes my grades of almost famous
statements top physicists to his
freshmen class when he opens in the
classes doesn't matter how much thick it
is what are we going to cover it doesn't
matter what we do covered it matters
would you discover well that's the
guiding principle so if you don't learn
all the facts chosen one Nobel laureate
what he used to do with his graduating
classes I'm gonna give you a lecture
without looking not any sources this is
what I think so your job besides
yourself right yeah
charles murray author after bell curve
once told me in our interview that
universities are irrelevant
especially since nowadays many
universities are offering MOOCs and it's
really you don't have to be an MIT on or
go to Harvard for four years in in order
to develop yourself so how sustainable
is the university system well with
people like it's not sustainable but
suppose you ask Marie today would you
like to see a vaccines we need to run a
virus yes yeah executives point
Oxford University your insect ability
pretty well and first take anything else
I mean you charles murray not may not be
interested in say Shakespeare's plays
but suppose somebody is interested so as
they're interested in the wealth of
their culture and unlike you they just
don't want to kick it down the word
office or some Wall Street Titans should
they have a change how sustainable is
our school system it's it's sustainable
if the population wants to sustain it
it's the population say in England or
votes for the Tory government whose
position is like universities University
departments have to sell themselves on
the market so if Oxford wants to have a
classics department they have to show
that they can sell it if he wants that
you can turn first-class educational
institutions into third-class commercial
institutions in common
Tory effort to destroy these cultural
Wilson futures have that is equivalent
to you I live in Arizona has the lowest
funding per capita in the country but
for education action second Louis
Mississippi was lower do that then kids
come into college with I teach not
knowing how to rate an issue very small
just like everyone else there's no
illusion woman once I you know
legislature the early sons in principle
except for the freedom said
started by the Koch brothers which
agency wonder what the rest has to
advise now when the current streets one
possibility is that the Legislature will
keep the professionals which way people
have voices we can have a live
university system like an attraction if
the cost is today's business model has
been employed to get into business
services manager miss Felicia managers
who yesterday served managers managers
maybe has to try to CB hmm hmm - Maxie
boost the tuition to shut this travesty
there's no economic justification today
it's easy to demonstrate take other
countries including the ones that have
the best record education system it's
just like South Africa Mexico look very
high quality higher education system
about Finland maybe you know this book
Finnish lessons it was written by
professor called Pastis albergue and he
wrote in his book that Finnish education
is so great because the Finnish system
borrowed or copied many American
inventions like the do we
philosophy like cooperative learning
even standardized testing at some point
so how come all these great inventions
work in Finland and don't work how come
american educational infinities don't
work in America but they work in Finland
but the elephant's mom and take the New
Deal programs
first part in country Appalachia
functioning now you can't do it remember
Reagan government is the problem not the
solution which translates as meaning
take decisions away from the public
sector and put them in hands of private
charities that's the translation then it
serves wrong one of the things that
suffering is another thing that suffers
hilt so take right now hospitals don't
have any extra words don't have
equipment why they'll run on a pistol
small businesses you have to have
efficiency you don't anything spear I've
just enough to get by like if you're
running it over the assembly lines
that's something that's treated somebody
would she could shake it easy something
that stops really started sir health
system that's exists even without it
even in normal times okay so you go to
West hospitals in the world
I'm clear organization and the false of
suicides minute small
it's just total disaster
take a look at what's happening in New
York no doctor conversion to absolutely
equipment nothing what's everything back
to the bone that's following so yeah
it's a disaster of course that's what
happens is novels education this woman
when do a system ever widely practiced
in the United States to see person what
they did it just and you can find it
actually meant States to one unusual of
standards of business Francis later when
you can see it the United States is
frankly the only in the world that
doesn't have a public information system
minor friend Jim practice yesterday
the corporation for under nothing let me
see are there any let's go back to the
postal service treatment merriment take
a look at the US Postal Service why was
it founded in the first place why did
the framers of the Constitution included
Postal Service know why because they
believed in government subsidy for the
free and independent press well most of
all the Postal Service was distributed
management insurance at very low cost
what's a morning free independent press
less we will understood the searched
amendment then the business culture
started crushing point you can flick
back so there's always a struggle
you're also victims well there's a very
class conscious business place which
wants to tried right out of people's
lives anything for yourself
Richmond powers get extreme people
that's it devotes its Collins offices
other any easy easy fixes for education
how can we cure this ill system straight
for where we can that's restorative
dealer measures by the way we could take
say the pandemic
why isn't didn't even come there was no
one's very two scientists certainly in
2003 after the sergeant mm-hmm probably
knowing it isn't enough if there's
somebody do something
who's going to do it not the drug
companies are loaded with process but
you don't make any money out of
preparing for something catastrophes in
a couple years so they won't get stupid
they do most of the creative work and
what they can't government is the
problem not the solution
[Music]
mysteries not just capitalism that's a
distant the government yesterday so
therefore we get it changed
yeah it's not utopian to say let's go
back something like the new to you well
how's it how for example there's
something called the roadie oh there's
also popular pressures
which made a big difference so that it
takes a the Democratic Party well it's
that's a corporate party ever since what
its policies has changed take a look at
the see like wait in the list of any
Democratic Party why not cuz that's what
you want
that's because eating it the doors
popular pressure sores in it
well more can be first sack take take
Bernie Sanders's
main positions and take a look at the
commentary on them in the left part of
the mainstream press I don't care about
the rest did the more list the present
center these two main positions are
universal medical care and free higher
education can you think of any countries
that has universal medical tour can you
think of anything that don't get every
country as is in some slum really how
about free higher education
so what Bernie Sanders is programs are
saying let's rise to the level of other
countries now take a look at the
commentary Jay Paul Katami to say well
these are great ideas American public
isn't really what they're saying is the
American public is somewhere in the 14th
century
you know they're not ready to do what
every other country that's total
attention what is the effect of driving
into the head even if literally it means
it's not true he did the same with
children's if you tell them you're not
working and you can tell population you
say we can vote if we wanted
system but Trump was elected in office
four years ago do you really have High
Elves that that if we go to vote in
November again that it's going to change
anything well in the best case scenario
it's going to be Joe Biden then what is
education going to change for the better
sure first we get rid of the worst
you'll get rid of that he devotes
they'll have an opening to do something
new after that comes popular activism
and it can change things even with Nixon
and Reagan popular pressures change that
was their plans you have someone a
little bit more open and responsive
making a lot of difference looking for
history that's the way it's worked let
me even take the New Deal if it hadn't
been for the labor movement for
political parties activism
I mean we're taught that we're like the
kids in school any opportunities
available was all its flaws it had to be
very free country nobody's gonna put you
in jail if you if you do what we're
doing - yeah maybe people won't like it
maybe this job you know it's not you
know sure it's true so you have to go to
good hopes what do you think is going to
happen in November then the worst in
November part of the reason is because
of the left there are segments of the
left we were taking basically the
position of the Communist Party in
Germany on monkey the early 30s under
Stalin George everyone except you
there's a social fascist so don't
they're no different from the knowledge
such as join so declining the brother
building belieber movement apetito
monster they weren't the only ones David
that's
fascist light is being reiterated today
my turbines just another corporate day
challenge I would be happy to speak I'll
vote for Trump and destroy everything of
course they don't say although Treecko
they say I won't provide you know
arithmetic the same as adding the word
so I'll do myself
I'd say my conscience is clear I'm not
voting for Trump well in fact I'm
casting a vote for Trump not for
destruction of the environment not for
stuff in the courts with ultra-right
young lawyers in command anything from
happening regeneration escalating the
war in the Middle East for just
referring the World Health
Organization's numbers of people saying
what my conscience my last question why
don't we have half an hour my last
question is about you professor Chomsky
I've seen so many interviews but I try
to come up with a question that wasn't
that hasn't been asked yet and the
question is if you had to describe
yourself in three books three musical
songs and three dishes
what kind of Chomsky do we see all right
well let's let's when we talk about free
minds let's end it a different way what
three books do we do you advise people
to read to see the worlds from maybe a
new perspective afraid I'm not very
helpful I'm asked this question all the
time every day are good that doesn't
last minutes when I think about it
that's always the same answer I can't
possibly say there's too many dimensions
too many choices it really depends on
what you're interested in there's a
general answer we won't
but you have to find it yourself look at
the library or browse around you'll find
a ton of things that are industry I
always ask my interviewees who do you
recommend me to for me to interview next
who do you aspire in who inspires you as
person like as doctors and the nurses in
the front line people fighting their
rights in poor communities right now
poor communities all over the world
people are getting together for mutual
aid let's help you save it shouldn't get
so that goes on all the time that's what
subscribe yeah yeah I know well thanks
for your time professor Chomsky I
enjoyed our talk and thanks for spending
some time with so enjoy the rest of your
day and bye bye it
