I want it we'll get back to the election
on a bit I do want your thoughts on 2020
but two other things I want to cover
with you first
is something of a kind of new outbreak
of a debate over speech and the left and
it's written by there was a very I think
in fact a very good but very provocative
Matt Taibbi article dealing with this
but more broadly beyond that sort of
particular controversy you know and and
then again I think he wrote a very good
piece but I think they and I want if
correct me if I'm wrong I want to
connect this with perhaps some of your
work around manufacturing consent and a
sort of substantive view the freedom of
speech because it seems to me right now
that one you know it's sort of fallen
out of favor amongst some on the left
and I actually think more ominously I
frankly I prefer to just have that
actual debate with people but some have
sort of reverted to a very narrow
libertarian position which is that if
the state isn't mandating something then
it's not an issue so then we don't have
to worry about as an example media of
monopolies or openness on tech platforms
as an example of course you know you can
hold up these atrocious examples of all
sorts of obscene and bigoted people
taking advantage of these platforms but
at the same time we know that the sort
of overall arc of sort of controlling
these things will have implications for
as an example and best get a u.s.
foreign policy or something like that so
anyways that's I'm giving you a lot of a
preamble here but I'd like your thoughts
on how you relate to the question of
speech and in fact even when it's quite
controversial and why you hold it my
guess is both a political and moral
principle if I read you correctly first
of all it's we should think a little bit
as you pointed out before about the
history why is this issue arising them
is it new hmm it's the norm for decades
but it was always targeted against the
left so nobody paid attention to it way
beyond anything that's happening now
right they don't just give you personal
experience
others have far worse ones and meetings
broken up violently disrupted talks
canceled the books destroyed so for
example the first book that you
mentioned manufacturing consent first
book the dead Herman and I were together
was in early 70s the book was published
by a very successful publisher 20,000
copies were printed the publisher was
owned by a big multiple major
corporation mega-corporation and one of
the executives and the corporation saw
the ads they didn't like it I won't look
at the book was horrifying and demanded
that the publisher withdraw it from
publication and when they refused he
destroyed the entire publisher put all
of its books all of its stock was
destroyed all the books to prevent it
from distributing the book of errands
did anybody care out of curiosity I
brought it to the attention of leading
civil libertarians Lee not himself and
the a a cou of an agency any problem
thought state censorship if a
corporation decides to destroy a
publisher in destroy oil and stock to
keep some book from appearing what's
wrong with it
in fact it was hard to find been back
Dickian was about the one person who
found something wrong with this but
that's not the only time I could give
the other cases of mine where books were
withdrawn from publication and I was
asked to return the advance because I
had some political content that the
she didn't like other people have been
fired faculty positions eliminated so
movie carrot that wasn't censorship it
was directed against the left vastly
beyond anything that's going on today
now that doesn't doesn't justify what's
going on today first of all I really
wouldn't roll at the left so when the
New York Times withdraws an op-ed which
I don't think they should have done it's
pretty hard to call that the left when a
lot of young people decide to the
platform some speaker I think they're
making a bad mistake even from a
technical point of view much better ways
to deal with him like he can run a
counter session where you expose what's
going on and uses educational
opportunity a lot of things can be done
so I think it's wrong in principle and
it's tactically wrong like it's a gift
to the far-right they're lovely but and
the platform's but we should bear in
mind that it's a very small part of what
has been the norm for as long back as
you want to go it's no targeting people
who are considered respectable in the
mainstream so it's a problem but it
should be quite aware of what's going on
but yes it's the wrong thing to do stuff
and it thank you and and and really just
underlying that that delineation that
just because it's happening in the in
the private sector does not mean that
it's not an enormous threat you know
particularly to the left obviously you
just watched a Michael Brooks show video
