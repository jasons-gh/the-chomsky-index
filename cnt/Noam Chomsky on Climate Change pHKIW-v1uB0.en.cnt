a unique moment in the whole history of
the human species its seriousness and
significance
it can't be underestimated you you you
and your generation are going to have to
make a decision now as to whether
organized human life will continue on
the earth that's not an exaggeration the
environmental crisis is growing it's
inexorable it's not going to stop
if concurrent tendencies continue in
your lifetime better your children of
the prospects for organized human
existence will radically decline this
it's not really controversial take a
look at any issue of science journal
every issue that comes along so work
forecasts we have already made this
decision incidentally for other species
the current level of species extinction
due to anthropogenic global warming
human created global warming is already

killing species at the level of the
asteroid 65 million years ago and we're

few decades
not long by maybe three to six feet that
will be a disaster for coastal cities
but much worse than that coastal plains
like Bangladesh will be inundated that's
hundreds of millions of people fleeing
trying desperately to survive famine
thinks is an immigration crisis now just
wait a couple of decades and when it's

faster than it's been far faster 100
dollars if not faster than a recorded
time
