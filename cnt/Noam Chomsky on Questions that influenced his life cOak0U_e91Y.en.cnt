well I mean my life and work have been
kind of schizophrenic a part of it is
what we've just been talking about the
other part is in linguistics philosophy
cognitive science that part is
intellectually interesting in
challenging the first part it is not
very challenging intellectually I think
what is understood about the world is
pretty much on the surface we don't have
far-reaching significant theories of
with explanatory force of about the
kinds of topics we were talking about
it's mainly a matter of just looking at
the phenomena honestly with an open mind
and without ideological blinders and
then I think things pretty much fall
into place
not without disagreement in controversy
but without any intellect particular
intellectual depth on the other hand the
other aspect does have a lot of
intellectual depth and they're they're
real questions very significant
questions about what kind of creatures
human beings are we're radically
different from everything else in the
biological world that's obvious in
innumerable ways and it's it's a good
case can be made that the core of the
difference is actually language and
language has very mysterious properties
which are not understood there's a long
tradition puzzling about them that just
as puzzling as they were in the past we
may never have an answer to them the the
main problem I'm there a lot of problems
about the nature of language its origins
and so on but the fundamental problem is
about voluntary action how can we for
decart say this was a huge crucial issue
is sort of the source of a lot of his
dualism and theory of mind how can human
beings have the capacity to freely use
an infinite unbounded number of
expressions in an innovative way new one
which are appropriate to circumstances
but not caused by them which is a huge
difference and which are intelligible to
others who can recognize that they could
have it evokes thoughts that they could
have expressed the same way sometimes
called creative aspect of language use
where does this come from and it's
actually a special case of something
more general voluntary action and that's
just not understood now there's a recent
review of the topic by two leading
scientists video bTW on German which
studies the state reviews the state of
the art and they put it rather
graphically they study voluntary motion
you know picking up something from the
table they say we're beginning to
understand the puppet and the strings
but we don't know anything about the
puppeteer we simply can't ask serious
questions even about where it's coming
from
what's going on now there are dogmas
about this in the sciences and
philosophy it's claimed that it's all
you know determined by physical law and
so on actually nobody believes that
whatever they say it's but whatever you
want to argue about that the fact is
nothing is understood about it it's a
crucial problem and not the only one so
for example if you look at the words of
natural language you know simple words a
tree table house river door whatever you
begin to look at them and think about
their meaning carefully turns out they
have a very complex and intricate
meanings this was actually known thought
about in classical Greece and an early
modern philosophy and that raises very
significant questions how are they
acquired by children without virtually
without evidence how did they evolve
complete mysteries then if you turn to
the core computational side of language
what Descartes pointed to and Galileo
described and so on now how do we have
this capacity to
create use comprehend an unbounded
number of structured expressions which
is nothing like anywhere in the animal
world where does that come from
what's its nature and so on I think
these are really pretty deep questions
which lead in all sorts of directions
including to the kinds of questions we
were talking about before that's over
again Adam Smith and many of his
contemporaries the core of human nature
is a kind of creative need which must be
encouraged and developed in any decently
functioning society and any interference
with it is illegitimate that's the
source of authentic libertarianism which
is very different from Friedman's type
authentic libertarianism I think it
reveals itself in the modern age mostly
in the anarchist tradition left in
Turkish tradition
