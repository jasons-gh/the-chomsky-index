year of the human species is now at a
unique point in its history history of
any species we are now in a position to
destroy the possibility for decent
existence and we're racing headlong
towards that interesting goal there's
also a long-term shadow over everything
that's the threat of nuclear war been
here since mid 40s and it has not abated
it's still real but the environmental
crisis the nuclear crisis we know that
least is something you can do about it
we know what could be done in the case
of the environmental crisis it's not
obvious that anything could be done but
what is obvious is that we are acting to
make it as bad as possible when there's
a bipartisan consensus and media
enthusiasm about a hundred years of
energy independence that translates into
saying we should get every drop of
hydrocarbons out of the ground and
ensure that the danger is as great as
possible and unfortunately that's what
we're doing
