and the first question was having spoken
about the Russian threat and the Cold
War and what kind of relationship do you
think Russia seeks the u.s. seeks with
China in the future so I imagine this
being also very important the future
power of China the second question was
can you hear now well if you take a look
at what's happening now take a look at
this morning's newspaper The Washington
Post the main newspaper that deals with
Washington affairs there's a report of
the US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel
who finally concedes that
the Putin is withdrawing forces from the
border of Ukraine but he says and
Washington backed him up that this is
not enough though they after we throw
all the forces and we cannot overlook
the fact that they already placed forces
there and that's permanent notice that
the issue is not whether Putin is
withdrawing forces from Mexico and
Canada
I mean if Russian forces were in Mexico
Canada we wouldn't be here to talk about
it there'd be a nuclear war tomorrow if
not yesterday but he's withdrawing
forces from within Russia from the
borders of Ukraine which the US and the
West have been trying hard to assimilate
into the Western economic and military
system on the borders of Russia and
that's considered perfectly legitimate
it's Putin's fault not ours but what's
happening is that this is driving the
Russians consciously towards the closer
alliance with China how can they
possibly react and there are natural
relations between China and Russia China
Russia Siberia Eastern Russia has huge
resources China needs them there's all
sorts of historical antagonisms they've
been practically a war many years but
yeah it's driving them towards a closer
alliance and it's tending to reshape
world affairs in that manner actually
this is happening on China's eastern
border maritime border as well China is
being pretty much barred from its own
the waters off China's shore China wants
to exert influence over them and there's
a conflict about that
notice the conflict is not about the
waters off California or the Caribbean
that's not an issue the u.s. controls of
everything the question is the waters
off the coast of China and because of
recognizing those difficulties China is
moving towards Central Asia it's
establishing close relations with many
of the Central Asian states interesting
relations for now by now you can
actually take a high-speed train from
China to Kazakhstan you can't take one
from Boston to New York but and but it's
true that these pressures are driving
China toward Central Asia or driving
Russia towards China China has
established some years ago the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization which is
includes China India Pakistan Kazakhstan
other Central Asian countries the u.s.
requested permission to be an observer
that was refused the Iran requested and
is accepted it is an observer and this
system is gradually developing and will
become a significant system in world
affairs but we're quite consciously
pressing them in that direction it comes
from a premise the premise is we own the
world and if anybody else is doing
anything it's there there's something
wrong with them
hi what you wrote about the influence of
corporate America in Germany during the
thirties with the government behind
doing this Steinman from the State
Department supporting Hitler and fascism
and I would like to hear about that and
if you know about an Tony satton I was
reading about from him long ago he made
a very detailed research about the
relationship between corporations and
fascist governments he has some crazy
theories about global communism so I am
confused because the corporate analogy
is quite interesting he take documents
from Hoover Institution and he was
supposed to be in contact - so that's
the US relations with Nazi Germany
during the series yes well there's
plenty of evidence about that as far as
the business world is concerned sure why
not major US corporations IBM four were
factories installations in Germany it's
actually continued right through the war
under various guises you know they set
up fake corporations and they were
participating actively but that's
corporations aim to make money and to
expand power and they had no real
objections to Nazism in fact looked at
it rather positively the Nazis were
doing the right thing
they were crushing the labor movement
they were eliminating dissidents of
course destroying the huge communist and
Social Democratic parties what's to
object as far as the US government was
concerned it was kind of ambivalent the
State Department was quite pro-nazi 1937
the State Department urged that
the United States take a tolerant
attitude towards Hitler because Hitler
they described it described him as a
moderate standing between the forces of
the extremists of left and right and
therefore we should support him in the
hopes of a more moderate Germany
emerging after Munich you know the
Munich Agreement late 38 Roosevelt sent
his most trusted advisor Sumner Welles
to the Munich Agreement you take a look
at what he reported on the way back he
reported that now we're on the way to a
new era of peace with the moderate
Hitler who's accommodating in wants the
same things we do we should look forward
to it goes on they take George Kennan to
one of the great statesmen the most
revered statesman of the 20th century
one of the framers of the modern world
he was the console the US Consul in
Berlin in those years he stayed until a
Pearl Harbor till Germany declared war
he was in Berlin September 1941 he was
writing back dispatches from Berlin
this is after the war it started you
know saying that we shouldn't be too
harsh about Germany they're pursuing
their national interests in a reasonable
way and we should cooperate with them
that can the British were even more
extreme they had very close relations
with economic and political relations
with Germany I mean in retrospect this
is called appeasement it's supposed to
be a bad thing but that's retrospect at
the time if you look that was not the
general attitude and in fact the support
for Mussolini was even more extreme
they've actually a love affair with
miscellany literally Roosevelt described
them as that admirable Italian gentleman
who was pursuing the right course until
sort of at the end of the third easy
sort of got misled by Hitler
things weren't so good but it's
basically a good person and some of the
commentary was just when you look back
at it it's hard to believe
so in 1932 that's 10 years after
Mussolini had destroyed Italian
democracy smashed the labor movement he
was attacking Ethiopia the leading
business magazine in the United States
Fortran magazine had a cover story on
Italy's progress and how wonderful it
was under Mussolini and the title you
have to know American slang to
understand that I'll explain it the
title was the wops are unwell
wop is a term like nigger or kike or
something like that it's a derogatory
term for Italians so the wops were
unwrapping themselves they were no
longer like these degenerate Italians
under Mussolini that's the leading
business magazine now this goes right
through the thirties and you say
something very important about stopping
the world they could last up the world
it was a it was a great speech in a
calling only a small question concerning
a international appeal which you signed
about three years ago that all
universities should reject military
research worldwide
a big vision a big vision but if one
repeat visions then they can be come
true this in this car in this city there
is a
a research institution ki t sounds
similar as MIT where you come and you
know what militarization that is this ki
T is doing military research and if you
would repeat your appeal on the K IT
administrator it could be a good point
for all of us and for peaceful science
I have to say a sign appeals all the
time I just signed one outside the door
in fact and I can barely remember them I
just don't remember this one but let me
talk about MIT military research is a
very interesting phenomenon MIT where
I've been since 1955 is the leading
technological scientific institution in
the world for years up until the 1970s
was almost entirely funded by the
Pentagon okay like I was working in a
lab which was a hundred percent funded
by the three Armed Services if you take
a look at my publications in the 50s and
the 60s they have an acknowledgment to
the armed services in the late 60s as
student activism finally developed there
were there were protests against
military funding and a commission was
set up the usual thing to investigate
military funding at MIT I was on it
students wanted somebody on it who
wouldn't be sympathetic to them so I was
put on it and the results are published
it's a very it was very interesting to
investigate it turned out that maybe 90%
of the academic budget forget something
like that was funded by the Pentagon and
it turned out that was that the only one
department at MIT was carrying out any
military research guess which one the
political science department the
political science department had
something called a Peace Research
Institute that did give away the Peace
Research Institute was involved in
counterinsurgency work in Vietnam they
were sending students to Vietnam to do
their dissertations on how to pacify you
know
you know what that means the peasants of
South Vietnam you know were being
massacred that was the only department
now what does that mean well military
research is a device for compelling the
population to fund the profits of
high-tech industry that's one of its
major functions so you take a look at
say computers the Internet lasers micro
electronics satellites run through the
whole gamut where'd they come from
they come mostly funded by the Pentagon
at institutions like MIT taxpayers pay
for it because the Russians are coming
so we have to pay for it and the end
result is you know Bill Gates is the
richest man in the world Steve Jobs
couldn't set up Apple the first
computers that reach the market were 90
1977 Apple that's about 30 year after 30
years of development mostly in the state
sector that's where the risky costly
work is done Internet was in the state
sector also for about 30 years reverse
and that over to private enterprise and
in fact if you look at MIT funding in
the 50s and the 60s into the 70s mostly
the Pentagon
that's declining and what's increasing
is funding from the National Institute
of Health and other health-related
institutions and I think everyone
understands this except the economists
who can't understand that because
they're working on abstract models of
free markets which have almost nothing
to do with what's going on but what's
the reason for that is that in the 50s
and the 60s the cutting edge of the
economy was electronics based and a good
cover for public spending there to
create the economy of the future
is the Pentagon increasingly the cutting
edge of the economy is biology based so
now the taxpayer pays in different ways
if you look around MIT and other
research institutions MIT there others
are like this in the 50s and the 60s
you saw electronic firms Raytheon high
tech in a big electronic firms walk
around MIT today
you see Novartis other pharmaceutical
corporations ripping off stealing the
technology that's being developed in the
state sector and using it for the
profits of the future that's the way the
economy works is a very you know if you
read the newspapers Financial Times the
German economic newspapers they're
constantly talking about free enterprise
and markets and so on I'm into some
crucial facts about markets and you
could like them or not but there are
some properties that they have that one
property is that say if you invest in a
risky enterprise and you invest for
decade after decade and the risks risky
and costly and if after all of this
there's some profit supposed to go back
to you that's not the way the economy
works the taxpayer is extorted
essentially to pay for the risky and
costly developments literally for
decades and doesn't get a penny back for
it the profits go to private enterprise
that's our free enterprise economy and
the and the Pentagon was a funnel but
the but you're right about military
research that shouldn't be on campus
actually I don't think this should be
there either but for different reasons
it's an attack on democracy and freedom
that's enough that's true whether it's
the health Institute's to the Pentagon
whatever the device is people are not
making the decisions
back in the 1950s if the population had
been asked would you like your taxes to
go to IBM future corporations like
Microsoft so that maybe your
great-grandson can have a smartphone or
would you like your taxes to go to
education and health infrastructure
decent Society and so on
people might made a different decision I
think they would have that's why they
weren't to ask that's why you have to
keep the population in the dark because
they're not allowed to make decisions
like that and hello
Thank You mr. Chomsky my question is how
we wicked solve or bring up us what more
protests here in Europe of course now we
have a big problem of right-wing
movements everywhere also here in
Germany the lives of media are still
there they bring them more up and if I
see the the politic of the EVF and also
the toy cahier what they the the
mechanism of austerity they are
installed in Ukraine what yeah what
could be the right way to of your
knowledge and your knowledge to
to bring or take the society note had to
fight or make a non-violent fight
against this futuristic regime and also
the dysfunctional fascism here in Europe
and Germany I would invite here from the
an acoustic and communistic block of the
occupy occupy protesters in Frankfurt to
the opening of the new ACP and Frankfurt
in autumn thank you
well I mean I think we should take a
lesson from the the powerful and the
rich that they understand this perfectly
well that's why the population has to be
kept in the dark
actually the professor of the science of
government I love that term at Harvard
leading policy at electoral Samuel
Huntington once pointed out that power
must remain in the dark exposed to the
sunlight it begins to evaporate and he's
right though that's what lies behind the
kind of things I was talking about you
know much more about it here so one
thing you can do is to shun expose power
to the sunlight and it will evaporate
that's why if the massive secrecy has to
be maintained but that's not enough
exposing power to the sunlight has to be
a preliminary to the only thing that has
ever worked in history mass popular
organization and that has achieved
results it has a plenty of results I
mean right now the troika is trying to
dismantle and destroy the Europe's great
post-war achievement the Social
Democratic welfare state and they're
pretty frank about it Mario Draghi the
head of the central bank has said a
couple of years ago that the social of
the social contract is dead it can't be
maintained why not for economic reasons
just because they have the power to
dismantle and destroy it well it doesn't
have to happen the power is actually in
the hands of people like you but it's
got to be exercised and that requires
organization and action as an individual
you can do very little but when you get
together you can do almost anything and
that's been demonstrated over and over
again through history
I mean you mentioned occupy which is
interesting and important I mean I
thought if I had been asked myself say
should people occupy Zuccotti Park in
New York my judgment would have been
it's it's pointless I was completely
wrong it was very successful remarkably
successful within days weeks there were
hundreds of Occupy movements around the
country others in Europe I actually
spoke at an Occupy event in Sydney
Australia they were all over the place
it lit a spark which had a real impact
and it changed a lot of things changed
the discourse put inequality on the
agenda for the first time and now
phrases like you know one percent
ninety-nine percent just common coin and
it's it's but remember that occupy was a
tactic tactics it wasn't a movement it's
a tactic that has every tactic has
diminishing returns can't keep doing it
over and over and this one in particular
couldn't be continued you cannot occupy
a central square say in New York or
Boston over the Widder it's just
impossible you're sitting under five
feet of snow you know but and the
population won't accept that after a
time so it has to turn into a movement
and to some extent it has but I think
that's the answer to your question
there's no magic tricks that's the one
that's worked all through history it's
made real achievements if there's always
regression the power systems don't say
thank you we're going to give you the
power they try to maintain themselves
and that's the story that's class
struggle goes on through history and
it'll continue
hello mr. Chomsky my name is Abram and
I'm a student at the Faculty of
linguistic in Italy and they won't ask
you about Europe European o'banion about
the situation in the political situation
in Egypt and about the last elections
for the president and what could what
could be the right way for the Egyptian
to change this situation thank you
so you're asking about the current
situation in Egypt particularly well the
the Arab Spring which took off in
Tunisia and Egypt and then spread was a
very exciting development and what the
what happened is it's a mixed story and
I think it's kind of in a waiting period
right now what happened in Egypt it
Egypt the first country where it began
was Tunisia Tunisia is a kind of a
French protectorate and the French of
course supported the dictator manali
in fact supported Ben Ali to the point
where it really became an embarrassment
when the population had actually driven
Ben Ali out of the country the French
Minister one of the French ministers
went to Tunisia for a vacation you may
remember that in Egypt it's mostly a
British u.s. dependency so they took the
lead in responding and they responded
exactly the way you always respond
there's a if you're going into the
diplomatic service you should understand
this there's this there's a formula for
reacting when your favorite dictator
gets into trouble first what you do is
support him as long as possible but when
it becomes impossible because the
business classes have turned against him
where the armies turned against him what
you do is send him off somewhere issue
ringing speeches about your love of
democracy and try to restore the
original situation as much as possible
and that's exactly what was done in
Egypt there was an Allah there were
quite interesting developments this look
place and I think they're lasting it's a
labor movement Egypt has very militant
labor movement long history of labor
activism which is always crushed under
the dictatorship but it was kind of
liberated by this uprising and it
remains very active as strikes worker
occupation of industries and so on
that's continuing they couldn't crush it
but there was there was an election of
the left and the secular forces were so
busy fighting each other that they could
not take an active part and by default
the Muslim Brotherhood won the election
well they the military retains control
they essentially stayed in power you
know under the Morsi government finally
they you know tal Merrik movement came
June 30th no Egypt is moving I think
into a very dark period the a lot of I
mean I had big arguments with my friends
in Egypt about this on the left and the
secular sectors they supported the
military takeover
believing that the military would
institute democracy and freedom I mean
you know that's such an illusion you
don't know how to describe it that's not
what the military does you know what
they want to do is maintain their huge
economic Empire and maintain their power
and control the population and now
that's exactly what they're doing
so the April 6 movement you know the
leaders are in jail its repression
they're killing thousands of people
that's it's a dark period but I don't
think it's over the military government
can't possibly deal with the problems
that led to the uprising they go way
back to the neoliberal policies and all
sorts of things and there's plenty of
ferment then I suppose it'll blow up
again but this time I hope with more
sophistication I was in Egypt and right
in the middle of this and I talked to
people like hum didn't serve I just the
opposing candidate others who were
activists and the what they call the him
of the left and the secular movements
and they simply couldn't get together if
they had gotten together they would have
actually won the presidential election
and they've got to overcome that maybe
they can but I think there's a lot of
promise there still it's a dark period
what happened in the rest of the Arab
world was just the uprisings were mostly
crushed by force like in Saudi Arabia
which is the leading US ally like
Britain before it the US has
systematically supported the radical
Islam against secular nationalism they
much prefer radical Islam to independent
secular nationalism so Saudi Arabia is
the darling most extreme radical Islamic
state in the world and there there were
efforts at Friday afternoon protests
they were crushed instantly by force
so much so that people were afraid to
get out in the streets in Riyadh and
Bahrain young cities and military force
to crush it the amur it's mostly crushed
in Libya you know the story in Libya
there was a UN resolution which called
for ceasefire and negotiations the
Western powers written in France in the
United States immediately violated it by
becoming the Air Force of the
anti-qadhafi resistance and the result
was to turn Libya into just a
monstrosity
it's run by competing militias I mean
it's whether it can be put back together
who knows and meanwhile the effect of
the attack on Libya has spread right
through North Africa and into the Levant
Libyan arms are all over the place
jihadi groups spreading all over Obama
speech the other day was about the
threat
of the expansion of what he calls
al-qaeda they thought it that's a that
name of them mean anything for the
various radical Islamic Jihad II groups
that are growing up largely as a result
of Western actions the other spreading
it all over Libya was a case in flooring
well you know it's the so far the Arab
Spring is a kind of a mixed story hasn't
had the achievements a lot of us hoped
for as some but I think it broke a kind
of a logjam in the Arab world and
probably it'll go on from there
but how it proceeds depends on how
Egyptians and others are able to handle
the situation that they face the West is
certainly going to try to prevent
independent developments but they may
not succeed and there's one striking
case in the last decade that you should
pay close attention to that South
America for five hundred years since the
conquistadors South America has been
controlled by the imperial powers last
century and a half the United States now
South America has become the most free
and liberated part of the world in the
Western Hemisphere the United States and
Canada are isolated take a look at the
hemispheric conferences US and Canada
are alone against the rest of Latin
America there was a dramatic
illustration of this recently maybe a
saw at the shore the open society forum
did a study of rendition rendition is
one of the most extreme forms of
barbaric torture that humans have
developed if the United States wants
people to be tortured what they do is
send them to countries run by people
like Qaddafi or
Assad Mubarak or other nice guys send
them there so they can be tortured there
and then we can say well we didn't have
anything to do with it and and then you
get whatever you get out of that well
there were countries that participated
in rendition most of Europe for example
most of Europe was participating in
rendition by cooperating with the United
States and sending people to their
favorite Middle East dictatorships to be
tortured in fact most of the world
participated one region of the world
refused to participate Latin America
which is amazing
first of all Latin America has been
almost total US control you know for
over a century and during this period
Latin America was the world center of
torture as long as the US was running it
now Latin America was the one region
which refused to participate in u.s.
administered massive torture well that's
the kind of thing that could happen and
it could happen in the Middle East
although hello can you hear me
no I'm I should say that I've been
wanting to pull Emma sighs with you for
a long time and I'm very happy to have
the opportunity my concern is with your
theory is that it besides the fact that
you're immensely informed you're
primarily informed about what has
already happened and the conclusions
that you draw based on your observations
of what has happened in the world so far
I think that the the important thing
that we need to think about is what
motivates the human being to do what he
does and I think when you talk about
forces such as you have mentioned
various kinds you have to think of what
the instinct that is behind them and my
feeling is that the instinct of the
human being in the capitalist era in
which we live and have been living since
the invention of agriculture is that he
loves to belong and I think that our
major instinct as human beings is the
need to be part of something that's
bigger than we are and I think that the
the answer to the Arab Spring or the
answer to what's happened with Russia
what's happening in Ukraine is that
people are afraid of being left alone
with their wonderful ideas somewhere on
an island my feeling about what you said
is that it's not sufficiently oriented
towards what might happen in the future
the more people there are the more they
will be dependent on belonging
I don't think I'm disagreeing as I said
before as as individuals there's a very
little that we can do to confront the
enormous problems that we face but when
people get together and organize and
form mass movements they can do a great
deal why not then they belong to
something they belong to something what
it's happened all the time in the past
Oh
for for thousands of years that's how
feudalism was overthrown that's how
slavery was eliminated in more recent
years that's how women began to get
minimal Rutan you know equal relatively
equal rights
it's just case after case French
Revolution carried things forward and
then there was a regression very common
the the activism of the 1960s to be more
recent civilized the West considerably
many ways but there was a regression
that's what happens power systems do not
give up willingly they'll fight back
there have been progress they'll fight
back we can then go on from a higher
plane that's what history is like only
if you let them win if if if you let
them win first of all first of all we
should recognize that what exists isn't
remotely like capitalism I mean I gave a
couple of examples but could go on there
is a system of state corporate power but
it's not immutable lots of ways to
overcome it and remove it and some of
them are being pursued effectively right
now so for example take the United
States place I know best the old Rust
Belt the industrial region which is
declined seriously because of a decision
to undermine manufacturing and to crush
the workforce there is a reaction the
reaction is this
worker owned enterprises which are
proliferating throughout this region now
that can't expand and if there's enough
popular engagement it could expand
dramatically so for example a couple of
years ago Obama essentially nationalized
most of the auto industry okay well if
there had been an organized popular
movement there were several choices he
could he could have made one of them the
one that was made was to essentially
hand it back to pretty much the same
owners and go ahead doing exactly what
they were doing before producing cars
another thing that could have been done
is handed over to the workforce let them
own and direct it and let them produce
the things that the country really needs
for example high-speed rail that what I
said about China and Boston is like a
scandal that could have been done and
with enough popular organization and
activism it would have been done but you
can't blame the lack of that on some
human instinct you can only blame it on
the failure of people like us to do what
we should have been doing and if you do
it you can have these effects as it's
always happened in the past but
sometimes the effects are dramatic but
takes a the women's movement okay it's
half the world's population if you take
a look at American history it's not that
different elsewhere but you go back to
the American Revolution the colonies
took over British law naturally
according to British law women were not
persons they were property a woman was
the prot legally a woman as the property
of her father and the properties handed
over to the husband one of the arguments
against allowing women to vote was that
it would be unfair to unmarried men
because a married man would have two
votes since obviously the property votes
the way its owner does
over the years this that was chipping
away at this but it wasn't really until
the 1960s that are almost totally
collapsed in fact in 1975 which is not
that long ago the Supreme Court
recognized that women are legally called
peers they are legally permitted to
serve in federal juries okay that means
they're persons that's a big change I'm
in the audience like this wouldn't look
like this 50 years ago when I came to
MIT 1950s it was white males obedient
well-dressed deferential and so on he
walked down the halls today it's half
women third minorities informal
relations which means a lot
activism all over the place and that's
happened all over the world it's
happened in Germany I've seen it and
when I come give talks over the years
just looks different each time well
those are big changes major changes and
they didn't come by wishing for it they
came by organized activist efforts which
were hard met a lot of resistance but
won a lot of games and it can be done in
many other ways too
but thanks a lot I really left here so
radical and well inform view and also
very much in favor of these emphasis on
grassroot politics which really are the
basis of any change
my question is you may know when Obama
won the first election whole Europe
especially Germany was totally in favor
of him I think there were about 90
percent of the population in favor of it
this has changed as you know and so
people ask and also I myself asked
myself why did he never close Guantanamo
why he did he didn't he stopped kuba
boycott why didn't didn't he
restrict NSA activities and so forth is
it simply to do with the fact that he is
not able to do that he doesn't have the
power to do it or is it also all also
did we have a wrong impression of his
real attitude well all I can say is that
in in 2008 before the primaries I wrote
about Obama no nothing much was known
about him he had no record but I just
took a look at his record and his
presentations of himself on his own
website and it was obvious that this
person has no principles there's nothing
but rhetoric you know I mean for example
you take a look on his website 2008
before the primaries so for example take
a look at his when he was a senator he
had almost no record but he did do a few
things and he was very proud of them and
one of the things he emphasized on his
website was that in the year 2006
when Israel invaded Lebanon for the
fifth time practically destroyed half of
it
Obama sponsored a resolution in the
Senate in and demanding that the US
government permit Israel to continue the
attack until it achieves its objectives
and to punish anyone Hezbollah Syria
Iran which tries to impede Israel in its
destruction of Lebanon destroying half
that so than half the country again as
they've done repeatedly killing and
killed over a thousand people that was
this achievement that he was most proud
of in the Senate and it goes on like
that the rest of it was empty rhetoric
hope change I'm a nice guy you know and
so on and so forth I try to find
something else there was no reason to be
disillusioned because there was no
reason for the illusions in the first
place and when you look you can see it
and it's true but it's true that people
are kind of always waiting for a savior
and no savior is going to come that's
not how things work it's you know you
can if people can create the conditions
under which some decent person may
become a spokesperson but they don't
come from above and organize the
movements it takes a Martin Luther King
a very significant person I respect him
a lot he would have been the first to
tell you that he did not create the
civil rights movement civil rights
movement was created by young black
activists in the south who sat in at
lunch counters rode freedom buses got
beaten tortured killed tried to register
people form the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee finally drew in
supporters from the north you know
finally had a big mass movement and
Martin Luther King was an effective
spokesperson for it and he deserves
plenty of credit for that
don't criticize it but that's how
leaders come and interesting it's
interesting to notice what happened with
Martin Luther King there's now a
national holiday in the United States
Martin Luther King Day and every year
there's a lot of rhetoric and what a
wonderful person and so on take a look
at it almost invariably the rhetoric
stops with Martin Luther King's I have a
dream speech in Washington okay which
did lead to significant civil rights
legislation because of the mass movement
he didn't stop there he went on to
confront class issues he went on to the
north in fact when he was assassinated
he was supporting a public worker strike
sanitation workers strike in Memphis
Tennessee and he was on his way to form
to lead a march on Washington again to
form a Poor People's Movement not a
black movement a Poor People's Movement
to strike it class issues he was
assassinated the March took place anyway
it led by his widow they did set up a
tent city in Washington resurrection
city Congress is the most liberal
Congress in American history they let it
stay there briefly then they sent in the
police in the middle of the night and
smashed it up and drove everybody out of
town that part of Martin Luther King's
history is gone it's okay for the point
of view of a northern liberal it's fine
to attack racist sheriffs in Alabama but
don't look at what we're doing that's
not allowed and there was not enough
popular support for his later efforts to
succeed that's the fault of people like
us who didn't do the things we should
have done it's not gonna get a leader
will save you unless you do the work
then you can get spokespersons but
hi Chomsky thank you very much indeed
for this chance that I can actually ask
this question from you because this
means a lot to me I am a philosophy
student at the University of Stuttgart
and I'm more than lucky to be in German
in study philosophy because I was born
in 1986 under the bombs of Saddam
Hussein I'm I'm a child of war and I
know what does that mean and I'm the
post-traumatic stress and everything
else
I dislike my government more than
anything else like any other Iranian
activists but I know you that you left
your hometown Massachusetts to New York
in 2009 to support the Iranian hunger
strike I remember that and I saw the
pictures and I'm very proud of that but
actually I want to make my quick I want
to I want to put my question here right
now because I know a lot of people are
waiting and I AB studied your I've read
your articles about cognitive science
this philosophy of language I'm a big
fan I should say that but my but my
question is that look what what happened
from the American foreign policy
shutting down the civilians commercial
airline and the u.s. general get a Medal
of Honor for that and is still keeping
down and killing more than 250
passengers on board and supporting the
IRA I can finance in Iraq for the for
devar and and the coup d'etat against
Messiah and I ask myself that we are
taking part in the Iranian basically a
tonta atomic talk between Iran and the
European countries and wash on the
United States and so this is this is
gonna be my question it's like can we
trust Americans can we trust American
policy and if you don't is it gonna be I
mean the the Russia is it gonna be the
best next option and if you're if you're
so much under pressure from different
sides and you are not a developed
country like Germany and if you don't
have many options and a table what can
you do what can I do
do I have a chance as an Iranian citizen
has an Iranian citizen
of course the the option come of the
options under severe repression are much
greater or fewer than the options for
people like us here who have many
opportunities which we don't use so the
situation in Iran that could be improved
if the West had a different position
okay I would not presume to tell irani
ins what they should do under the
conditions they face they have to figure
that out for themselves but we can ask
questions what we should do so for
example right now the line and the West
is that Iran is the greatest threat to
world peace okay
you hear that all the time I'm sure you
hear it here it's an interesting
question why Iran is the greatest threat
to world peace I mean that's there's an
answer you get it from US intelligence
and and the Pentagon in there are annual
presentations to Congress Iran is
disobedient Iran has very low military
spending it has even by the standards of
the region its strategic doctrine is
defensive it's designed to deter an
invasion long enough for diplomacy to
take place
they say if Iran is developing nuclear
weapons which they don't know it would
be part of their deterrent strategy to
deter an attack and the US and Israel
and Germany and their allies can't
tolerate that no country should have a
deterrent against Western violence in
the West Iran is described as the
greatest threat to world peace there are
also international polls you tell me
whether they reported here I can tell
you about the United States the last
December there was an international poll
run by the major polling organization
in the West's Gallup and the United
States British equivalent and one of the
questions that was asked was which
country is the greatest threat to world
peace guess which country was first so
far ahead that nobody else was even
close the United States okay now you
tell me how it was reported here in the
United States the media refused to
report it with a single exception a
right-wing Murdoch rag tabloid did
report it and said look this shows how
crazy the world is you know that's I
betcha it wasn't a headline here without
looking well okay we can do a lot of
things about this in fact it's only very
concrete that we can do actually the
Germany can do there is you know p5 plus
one the Security Council plus Germany
and there are whatever threat people
think you know conjure up any threat you
can make about Iranian nuclear weapons
there's a way to deal with it very
simple way it's on the table move
towards establishing a nuclear weapons
free zone in the region okay is that
possible yeah it's possible
in fact support for it is so strong that
even the United States has been forced
to formally say it's a good idea but not
now
in December 2012 there was a there was
supposed to be a conference in Finland
to carry forward this plan for a nuclear
weapons free zone Israel announced that
it would not attend here an announced
that it would attend with no conditions
a couple of days later Obama canceled
the conference okay
the European Parliament objected not
Germany but the European Parliament
passed a strong resolution saying should
go on Russia called for it to go on the
Arab state
wanted to go on but if the US doesn't
support it and its allies don't support
it it's not going to happen
well that could be a significant step
forward that's concrete feasible it's
not going to happen without removing the
darkness you got to expose it and then
doing something about it
I think that would help Iranian
dissidents it would help removing the
kinds of outside pressures which give
the hardliners their own justification
for crushing dissidents as you know I'm
sure so you know that we can't do a lot
but we can do some things and what
Iranians should do I again would not
presume to tell them
hello mr. Chomsky first of all I want to
thank you for being so inspirational
while you're holding the speech I'm over
here Oh
while holding a speech there was one
thing keeping me busy I mean you touch
this topic already slightly it's about
corporations you but you still focus
very much on the governmental level but
observing and increasing let's say
intelligence and connectivity in a huge
are also in small international
corporations and reaching a level of
let's say artificial intelligence
already combining with what you said
about power being is vanishing when
being tracked outside in the sunlight I
was asking myself what's your advice or
how can we approach this to have more
power from the sector dragged into the
sunlight and be more visible and second
questions what is maybe you could use a
couple of more words on how you see the
power being focused in this area thank
you how is power focused and what can we
do to help it get to evaporate by
opening it to the sunlight and take a
look at this audience this happens all
over the world anywhere on the there is
an enormous disparity between demand and
supply I mean I see it every day when I
go home at night I'll get a couple of
dozen in the
to talk right every time you talk
anywhere wherever it is around the world
there's a huge mob of people who are
engaged interested concerned and not an
atomized not organized very few people
are willing to answer those demands
there's just think about it very few but
it can be done by almost you know any
any person who has you have to have a
certain degree of privilege you have
have enough privilege to be able to
spend your time doing some research you
know it's it's not quantum theory um
it's available to anyone everything I
said today anybody could find out if
they put the effort into it not it's not
profound you know but you have to do it
and that's the way popular movements get
organized and when they become powerful
enough they can make major changes there
are no magic keys nobody's ever
discovered them it's always the same way
it educate try to educate yourself
educate other people organize with them
pick the forms of activism that make
sense depending on the circumstances
there's no formulas and they go on as
far as you can gonna hit a reaction then
you have to be able to confront it
that's the way it's always been the way
it always will be and there are no
limits the licks the target last
question please hello good evening one
final question mr. Chomsky how would you
comment on the fact that one of the
world's biggest companies is a private
military contractor in the frame of
three and risky surprise and all that
should I speak louder so how would you
comment on the fact that one of the
biggest companies in the world is a
private military contractor a private
military contractor which one did you
have in mind originally it was the
Blackwater or something Oh Blackwater
you know if you look at the history of
imperialism a by and large the actual
atrocities and crimes were carried out
by mercenaries often people from the
country itself so you take a look at
South Africa under apartheid as some of
the worst atrocities were carried out by
black units mobilized and not to fight
tribal battles or one thing or another
when the British ran in India it was the
seat boys the Indian soldiers who were
suppressing the population and who are
providing the forces for British
aggression elsewhere that's the French
had a Foreign Legion
you know that's the usual pattern the
United States deviated from that pattern
in Vietnam and in Iraq it sent its own
soldiers that for imperial conquest
that's not a good idea
civilians ordinary you can't take people
off the streets and in a year turn them
into brutal sadistic murderers it's hard
you know they have other instincts and
to its credit the US Army fell apart in
the 1960s the army fell apart soldiers
began killing their officers got hooked
on drugs
finally the top military command wanted
to take him out because it was
destroying the military that's why they
moved to a professional army no draftees
professional army now
in more recent years they've been going
back to the traditional Imperial thigh
pattern
mercenaries they're called contractors
not mercenaries but if you look at the
US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan I
think a majority of problem or probably
contractors like the former Blackwater
but that's the traditional Imperial
pattern it makes sense for an imperial
power to keep its own civilians away
from the vicious dirty process of
crushing and destroying people you hand
that out to professional killers who are
trained for it yeah that's when South
African apartheid collapsed the South
African state terrorist forces became
mercenaries they're picked up by western
states to use for for the run of war for
so Blackwater you know it's now changed
its name are simply reversions to the
traditional sensible Imperial pattern we
don't have to tolerate that of course
that's up to us
