Noriega was no that's kind of gone month
I mean now he's demonized and he's you
know forty years in jail and so on but
in fact he was a kind of a minor thug he
was a thug and a killer and a
narco-trafficker and so on but by the
standards of the guys we support he's
not particularly noticeable the in fact
it was just a trial before he was just
tried in Panama for one of his worst
crime alleged worst crimes killing a few
goes to us about a four there's one you
know guy was decapitated that this isn't
found body somewhere everybody Noriega
did it and there he was just tried for
that and every was amazement they didn't
convict him in Panama which caused the
big furor and in fact though you won't
read it the American press if you read
the conservative business press in
Central America you'll discover that the
federal prosecutor had a theory which he
was sort of the theory of the
prosecution that in fact Noriega was
involved but he was involved as a CIA
agent who was trying to get rid of this
guy because he was questioning the you
know war in Nicaragua so uh to get back
to Noriega he was on the American
payroll as a gonna murderer a narco
traffic or though of a minor type until
about the early 80s in 1984 in fact
there was an election in Nicaragua which
Noriega just stole my violence quite a
lot of violence in fact the wrong guy
was going to win the guy who was gonna
win is somebody called and that he was a
conservative nationalist but somewhat
independent the United States didn't
like him and wanted some other guy to
get in who in fact was a former student
of George Shultz's his name is Barletta
I think his name was for anyway he was
the guy was supposed to win and the
thing was arranged so that he did win
the Reagan administration which secretly
subsidized his campaign sent him
congratulations seven hours before the
election results were announced George
Shultz then flew down to authorize the
the great achievement you know
challenging the Sandinistas to meet our
high standards of democracy that was
1984 you know we're still not exporting
Noriega but cheering him on you know and
he destroys elections by violence and
kills people and so on and so forth well
around a year or two later the attitude
behind the shift the problem was that
the thug was getting a little too
independent
you know subs are fine I mean doesn't
matter whether it's a minor one like
Noriega or a major major one like Saddam
Hussein if for that matter Hitler who we
also supported for a time they're fine
you know as long as they follow orders
but if they become independent they
become as bad as priests who were
organizing Bible study groups then
they're bad guys and you got to get rid
of it so about 1986 1987 the u.s.
shifted its attitude toward
and instead of becoming sort of a nice
guy on our side he became as hit Koppel
and you know those guys called him you
know one of the most odious creatures in
the world you know kind of people the
United States Americans love to hate and
so on and so forth
major propaganda campaign was concocted
to turn him into a sort of Leary and
figure and that was all a build-up to
the invasion of Panama which
incidentally remember was George Bush's
celebration of the end of the Cold War
the invasion of Panama took place about
a month after the Berlin Wall fell and
we were condemned by the United Nations
you know United States had to beat those
two Security Council resolutions and so
on but they moved in they there's big
furor about the fact that Noriega had
stolen election which was true although
with much less violence than in the one
in 84 that we endorsed but this time he
wasn't just following orders
so we invaded Panama not killed however
many people and destroyed but we felt
like an in-store installed a regime of
bankers and narco traffickers and other
crooks who everyone concedes including
the government wouldn't stay in office
for 10 minutes and once they had
american forces behind them and the
country is going down the tube as you'd
expect the narco traffic drug the drug
laundering is about doubled since then
but they did kidnap Noriega and brought
him here for trial and if you look at
the trial the charges against him were
virtually entirely from the period when
he was on CIA
payroll
