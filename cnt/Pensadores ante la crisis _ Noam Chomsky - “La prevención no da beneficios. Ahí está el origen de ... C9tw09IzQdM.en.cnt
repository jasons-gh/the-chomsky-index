estamos aqui con nonsense key and last
exam and hilarious delicacies ah hi
no one how are you doing it's also been
20 years since the in Seattle counter
the Seattle protests and also almost 20
like a bit less than 20 years from their
general protests like there was like
there's been like left-wing action for
quite a long time it's just that it
doesn't quite seem to like settle
somehow why why do you think but these
are very close to lift victories now you
don't know you don't win in one shot
take women's rights it isn't as if
somebody stood up in 1965 and said yeah
let's have women's rights so long
struggle against a lot of opposition
abolition was even longer civil rights
harsh and brutal they say the anti-war
movement in the 60s strongly opposed
uniformly by all the media was
impossible to get into the major media
to talk about virtually impossible a
movement did develop powerful strong
movement neither developed its own media
like ramparts magazine others were
people could break through the media
monopoly but it's never been easy it's
not easy now so you don't just snap your
fingers and things happen have to work
on it the way the sunrise movement
managed to break through it get the grew
new deal operate the way snake workers
young activists in the South from the
early 60s were able to break through the
if it file a brutal barrier of vicious
racism it wasn't simple what got killed
beaten brutally attacked by the
the police state troopers and other sirs
extremely ugly but they finally managed
to get some successes okay that's the
way things happen the power doesn't say
please take it away from us professor
what what can we do what can the media
do to fight this propaganda this this
information that that doesn't appear in
the newspapers but appears in the
pockets of people that goes straight to
their phones if your reporter in the
newspaper a report on the fact that in
order to improve his electoral prospects
President Trump is perfectly consciously
slaughtering huge numbers of people that
African Yemen may be the editors won't
let the article through I don't know
well actually there are some reporters
who do this it's not 100 percent so
there are you read the media carefully
you can learn a lot about these things
but the basic stories are simply
marginalized write a column or an
opinion piece or a news report for that
matter which reports the fact that some
here's a possible news report try on
tests all over are saying another
pandemic is coming harsher than this one
unless we do something to prevent it and
the way to do something to prevent it is
to look at the sources of the current
pandemic so let's look at those sources
and I'll do it for the first time it's a
possible article in fact it should be
everywhere i I imagine you mean that the
source of this pandemic is our our
relationship with animals in the natural
world so that's no see that's a part of
it but a small part very small for the
primary source of the pandemic is
something called capitalism exacerbated
by neoliberalism we see that
stantly as soon as we look at what
happened okay it's pretty simple 2003
there was a enormous coral einen
coronavirus and epidemic SARS epidemic
very similar the virus to the current
one it was contained but scientists
pointed out right away just the way this
is 2003 just the way they're doing now
that there's going to be another one
coming what's not enough to have
knowledge then or now somebody has to do
something about it who can do something
about it well the drug companies huge
profits inflated by new liberal
mechanisms very rich all the resources
laboratories but they're blocked they're
blocked by something called capitalism
there's no profit in it you don't profit
by planning to deter a disaster that's
going to occur in a couple of years so
thanks to capitalist logic they're out
what about the government actually the
government does most of the research
supports most of the research public
funding national labs of research
institutions and university most of the
research that and development that leads
to drugs and vaccines is in the public
sector so why doesn't the government
step in that's where you get
neoliberalism savage form of capitalism
which says go back to Reagan and
Thatcher
there's no Society the government is the
problem not the solution everything has
to be placed in private hands government
can't do it so thanks to savage
capitalism the government is blocked so
both sources have blocked that's the
main source of the pandemic this is this
is such an honor it to me I'm I'm very
very glad I got to see you tonight happy
to talk to you sorry I'd have to leave
[Music]
you
