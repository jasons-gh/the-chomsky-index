well first - what just like to thank you
it is an absolute honor to have you join
us with the Oxford political review this
year I just want to start with a
question on manufacturing consent and
your thesis on it where you previously
suggested that back when you wrote it
anti-communism and the war on terror
we're examples of filters employed as
major social control mechanisms what do
you see is the primary social mechanisms
in Western news today and what do you
see their counterparts as in non-western
countries or democracies after the
corpse of the Soviet Union there was a
sort of an interim period when there was
a search for something new to be the
pretext for military intervention and so
on and actually that interim period is
quite interesting because the clouds
were lift and the pronouncements were
pretty interesting and accurate but so
you learn a lot about Paul Jose by
looking at those fumes while historians
unfortunately sort of avoided but it's
very interesting so George Bush the
first was the president the up with a
pretty strategy heading on budget
Clinton administration came in with some
Strategic Command document on the
Central's as post Cold War deterrence
but all those things who said there's
not going to be any peace dividend I
forget it we have to maintain a system
why because of the technological
sophistication of third world countries
nobody left
a week the main industrial base which is
a euphemism for the high tech industry
but largely that's the best the creative
innovative work is usually done by the
publicly funded institutions and and
that move of the private corporation but
our marketing and profitably the system
works we have to maintain that thirdly
we have to may an intervention maintain
aimed at the middle east and then came
an interesting phrase
where are the reasons for intervention
meant laid at the Kremlin's door in
other words we've been lying to you for
50 years
it wasn't the Russians that made us as
intervention forces it was what's called
radical nationalism those are the core
principles that were enunciated in the
interim period some new prefix began to
come one of them was which said global
war on terror another was the concept of
humanity which has been used in very
interesting ways for coming to the
modern period we have the enormous
threat of Iran one of the major issues
no you had as the greatest globe that
constantly reiterated we have to protect
ourselves from the Iranian threat it's a
very interesting claim there happens to
be an extremely simple way to prevent
any alleged of Iranian nuclear weapons
very simple straightforward Institue the
nuclear weapons free zone in the Middle
East is a very intense and very
effective we've seen the effectiveness
of inspections with the jcpoa which iran
please doctor complete so how about
moving to establish a nuclear weapons
free zone well is there a problem
Iran is strongly in favor of vociferous
lis in fact the g77
not former downline countries about a
hundred and thirty countries strongly
and safer one problem us won't allow the
issue comes up NPT non-proliferation
treaty review sessions every five years
heated by the United States so do you
think a new free zone is likely given
Russia and China's sort of new
incentives with regards to not
necessarily aggression but definitely
their defensiveness in the in the region
of the Middle East but Russia certainly
is Russia supported the Assad government
Russia invaded a country in the Middle
East as Russia had done anything like
what Britain did in invading Iraq what
would he think of the claim that Russia
might have played a role in the 2016 US
elections then yeah there were a high
level investigations by National Academy
and others they could find no detectable
and effective russian intervention but
the whole issue is very interesting i
really with you that there's an issue of
lobbying and dominance of big money in
American elections now let's talk about
the twenty twenty elections and what's
going on right now what is your read on
a Democratic field
how can a Democrats winning again its
trunk well the first thing the Democrats
have to do is to stop working for Trump
they're his best ally it's incredible
how they're shooting cells in the foot
so take this furor over impeachment it
was obvious from the first moment that
the impeachment issue may be a huge gift
to Trump in order to get impeachment
through the Senate you have to have
two-thirds of the vote the Republican
Party is in Trump's pocket there
owned by Trump the Senators has zero
integrity they're terrified of clumsy
days perfectly obvious they're all gonna
vote to acquit Trump no matter what he
does okay that was obvious and events
therefore it was plain that the outcome
of the impeachment hearings would be a
further more if you watch the they were
a total farce from the first moment they
opened on the evidence whatsoever I
think and behave as they did it began
with the floors continues with the
floors and as a predictable outcome
great gift to trump
if admissible that's want desperately to
have him win the election they can keep
doing them the other thing they could do
is to turn to the issues turns out most
of them publicly supports Democratic
positions with these theoretical ones on
most issues return to those forget the
nonsense of trying to impeach Trump on
some thing for which he's probably
guilty but nobody cares fact if you look
at his puppet his poll results when the
impeachment hearings started he had
about forty percent for approval went up
about ten percent during the perfectly
predicting you know what there is a
choice
someone who probably at the root there's
something quite similar it's not Sanders
as policies policies are extensions of
the New Deal it wouldn't surprise to
delayed Eisenhower very much but the the
threat that he poses his or is inspiring
a mass popular movement which doesn't
show up every couple of years to push a
lever it keeps working constantly to
change policy and how do you think how
do you think Bernie could sort of appeal
to the mass public because it seems to a
lot of us who do have sympathies to
would seem that he just needs to win
what we called a sort of centrist or
medium voter do you think that's a myth
or do you think that the swing vote are
in that sense the sort of centrist voter
does exist and should be appealed to in
order to win the election it's a
consideration that has to be taken to
account but it cuts both ways
I mean Sanders will certainly and in
fact was heah name much of the
establishment it's basically the
democratic transition and discourse of
the population you don't like as follows
in the other hand if he doesn't pass
group the largest and either abstain on
the other hand would you personally
endorse or bat Sanders again considering
that you stood up to I believe you would
you endorsed Sanders in 2016 I was
wondering if you would I was wondering
if you'd personally support Sanders
again for this year's election no
Sanders Sanders Bernie Sanders yes there
is the consideration get mentioned and
disregarded
Sanders runs he will is subject to a
campaign of vilification and
pronunciation I would want to push back
against your analogy between Corbin and
Sanders because as someone who's quite
sympathetic to Bernie I am less
sympathetic to Corbin in that I think he
presents a platform for left-wing views
that leads to not just self defeating
this but also alienates individuals of
particular ethnicities of particular
views that he hasn't necessarily spoken
out for in defense of so I'm thinking of
Jewish members of the Labour Party who
felt alienated by Corbin's leadership
and whatever we think of as personal
views I don't know but it seems that
Bernie unlike Corbin is more were able
to rally people around him even if they
come from different backgrounds and I
think that's a difference between
Sanders in Corbin Corbin was very
ineffective in responding to his streams
of vilification and denunciation
he's not a fighter I think it's very
decent not a political flavor or the
other issue doesn't arise in United
States it's just everything to decide
and Corbin is a solution on that trust
of them on the other hand they look at
the polls in a minute it seems that the
2017 policies that analogy but not
really the other things does holding
this thing but I think that's kind of a
an uncertain decision about popular
support versus electability emotions as
well
personally I think the Sanders
please but if you want to see the kind
of change that's coming up in steam take
a look at the literature I mean there
was an article in Washington Post
Elizabeth wondered in liberal religious
personal attack them Sanders is
disclosed looks like anything the public
needs it started early the sense of
what's going to happen take a look at
the last president in time the on the
social media it was an outcome of
massive enunciation vilification lies
about the quality of all your children
of them in the safe rules and killed
religion is that the other thing the
ocean gets their information from I'm
sure the Republicans hearing and with
the liberal media I think that's very
fair I guess just to wrap up very
quickly this section on US politics
there's always been this defense in UK
or US politics that a lot of left-wing
politicians are vilified by the media
but don't you think that an effective
media strategy and the ability to talk
to the media to play the media game
whilst not losing the real message isn't
that what a real left-wing politician in
an age of social media needs to be able
to have in order to overcome the part
and parcel of politics in that sense
there's no the best way to respond to
streams of vilification and enunciation
[Music]
to give a simple straight for a response
then ignore them and turns of the major
issues so for example what we were
discussing a moment ago got it ran is
vastly more significant and anything
you're now talking of them let's go back
and think about it for a minute the
greatest but he's a great expression
states you keep the Iranians with your
worthless wears a very simple they
dissolve the government won't do it
who's your freakin you're awesome
that's an extremely important fact well
nobody will talk about prefer to talk
about free but this is only one example
of things that are greatly significant
that the population would care about
that's also a security problem there's
something much more significant the
President Trump in my opinion is the
most outrageous did occur in most games
of pollution human injury
one of the kill I would beg to differ
know and I think Hitler certainly tried
to destroy the organized very basis of
humanity and dignity by his systemic
persecution and killing of Jews whereas
Trump as much as I think he is dangerous
and totalitarian is not necessarily
enacting a genocide or persecution of
people of that scale or to that capacity
or anywhere near that extent greater his
climate policies Arkansas leading the
way to the end of organized human life
in any form Lou you know in the near
future
everyday first of all not only is most
of the countries in the world
we're trying to do is something to deal
with a very severe in attending places
Crump is alone and not only refusing to
anything but welcome to accelerate the
disaster racing towards possessed just
this morning for example once again new
fields were opened you do telecoil
expose his cutback old regulations and
he knows exactly what he's doing he one
of his bureaucracies mass transportation
put out a very interesting document long
detailed environmental assessment for
the coming years they concluded that by
the end of the century temperatures
really risen the four degrees standards
are Celsius over pre-industrial levels
that's absolutely catastrophic taken to
the de scientism
is it's way beyond anything could make
flooded life viable and they draw
conclusions from it they said therefore
you should not impose any regulations on
emissions for drugs
why well we're going over the cliff
anyway so let's have fun and I think
with a document like that in human
history
let's call Trump administration these
are the worst criminals who have ever
existed this is not discussed at all you
take a look at the other major threat
pieces nuclear war a series you've never
seen me do least eight o'clock setting
yeah couple of weeks of those comments
scientist closest we've ever been
midnight since 1947
what is Trump doing tearing to shreds
the remaining arms control agreements
just destroyed the INF agreement
disguises its vastly increasing dangers
even survival nobody talks about
I'm talking about pretty wet Regina fear
that is fair I'm just gonna follow up on
that because I want to ask you for your
thoughts on China's rise because given
America's declining role or rather it's
dangerous behaviors as a global leader
what do you make of China's possible
take over of the USA as maybe a
counterbalancing force to us if not does
it provide an alternative mode of
governance that is worse or better
what do you make of China let's talk
about American decline we just saw a
very dramatic illustration of that the
Trump administration come out but a week
ago with the greatest deal was
essentially plan for Middle East peace
but suppose China had come out with a
plan for at least peace how would you
respond I would anybody who's gone way
beyond the next but when the United
States comes out with it everybody eats
that's the plan
the Lord has spoken we now talk about
how is that defined I mean that's a
recognition on the part of the world
that the u.s. owns and runs the world if
the world is overwhelming and people
concede it takes a again the joint
agreement the United out of agreement
you're theoretically stated in but they
immediately back bowls with drunks so
she has no choice u.s. power is so
overwhelming and us threat to the world
is so extreme that everyone back so
you're infected regions when the US
imposes sanctions on the country and
notice that the u.s. is the only country
can impose sanctions China doesn't
impose sanctions Russia doesn't
determine it does u.s. does all over the
place because there's overwhelming power
next taken for granted Wendy listen
posed sanctions they are not just
channels on the country but on everybody
is anyone I mean that is very fair and I
just want to sort of follow up with a
slightly unrelated question going back
to your theoretical works on anarchism
and anarchy I'm a fan of philosophical
anarchism I subscribe to a lot of the
arguments that Simmons or you provide
concerning it but what do you think are
the preconditions required for an
accused to succeed and do you think
anarchism would ever become the dominant
mode of governance in a world as we see
it today or in a hundred years time if
you would ask the 18th century early
18th century whether political democracy
as possible
what was you saying we don't know I mean
I don't see you search the West s
whatever fusion is route what it is is
the demand that is of higher our
combination justify the existence have
to justify themself self-justifying and
if they catch pesticide association in
Japan they're all over the place so like
for example critical example which wage
labor should huge Labour's even go
hollering cuz what these wage labourers
know is suppose you Jonathan summer
corporation during the tyranny tyranny
of a kind it was way beyond any
totalitarian government in Stalin didn't
try to tell people when you're allowed
to go to the bathroom what clothes you
ask
we thought for a minute to talk to a
friend energy take a job you're
suggesting yourself that clear
justification from them why should
people spend most of their waking lives
as supporters of subordinate creative
dependent on creatures under lawyers as
masters actually for almost all of human
history that's been regarded as an
abomination from Cicero in Rome up to
the mid 19th century pretty long time
that I was regarded as totally
intolerable yet to say Abraham Lincoln
in the mid 19th century
wage labor was equivalent to slavery
except that it was temporary to get out
of the independent person working people
and accepted that from the early
Industrial Revolution working people
fought hard to try to create an
industrial system and hit
slogan was those who work in the mills
alone took a long time for this to be
beaten out of their head and now finally
in 20th century most people's accept
them but they should they should
struggle against that there's no reason
at all to accept that time of priority
though will it end until there are seeds
of ending it all over the place
summoners very substantially longer gone
little smaller can be spread and
developed we can't predict that would be
one Navy step towards freedom and
dignity and control of one's life it
would be a step towards an Enlightenment
ideal ideal but with the with the
advancement of mechanization of labour
do you think this utopian ideal could be
achieved given that workers from
primarily in a sort of anarchist world
of self-organization
the reason why people would come
together and live peacefully is because
of some degree of codependence but if
mechanization and automation can take
over human beings and supplying these
essential goods and services would not
mean that we stray further and further
away from ever attaining that
possibility of egalitarian codependence
because we can instead bank on machines
and capital and that's a massive threat
to communal structures
first let's once again separate
fantasies in effect isn't it a situation
now there's a lot of hype about the
terrors of automation first of all
what's happening is there any detectable
effect of automation so far well there's
an easy way to detect that if automation
was having to create a new impact other
than that's been happening for a century
we would see it in increase in growth of
productivity automatic a fewer workers
have greater productivity is there a
group of productivity well there's a
decline my productivity grows less than
it has been during the years of so often
called the Golden Age of capitalism
fifties and sixties ruby is lower than
that so we're not seeing an effect but
there will be an effect sooner or later
how that effect plays out depends on
these social political conditions under
which it develops so automation could be
used to undermine working people in
their eyes it could be is to free them
from
ownerless dangerous tasks that they
don't want to carry out and if read them
for more creative independent lives
it could be a great boon depends on the
conditions under which it takes place
that is very fair and just to close off
or wrap it our discussion um professor I
want to ask you what would be your
proudest legacy and achievement given
your illustrious records and your your
extensive works what is what is
something you're proudest of I think in
terms of your theory and your research
that you'd like you'd like to highlight
perhaps
well I just want to thank you once again
for your time that was a real pleasure
and a real honor to be able to speak
with you and if you could close with
words or any thoughts on how as
Democrats we can you know not Democrats
in American sense but Democrats at large
how can we make democracy perhaps work
again is it about going back to the
fundamental issues that you said just
then is it about fixing those problems
right at the core of capitalism or is
there even more that we need to start
getting to do in order to make democracy
a politic for policy for all in that
sense I think maybe one thing to keep in
mind is the slogan that the grantee made
famous pessimism of the intellect
optimism of the will there are huge
problems people of your generation are
facing questions would have never losing
a ministry will organize human society
and millions of other species provide
than any before and that questions this
urgent cannot be delayed has to be
answered soon now there are solutions to
every problem you can think though there
were easy solutions I mentioned as much
time that I mention one problem is
around a nuclear weapons trivial series
look at other cases there also answers
you have to have the will criticism I'm
not going if the answers by themselves
requires attention engagement
understanding dedication then the
problems can be solved otherwise you
think great thank you so much for your
time professor it was a real pleasure
and thank you have a have a lovely day
