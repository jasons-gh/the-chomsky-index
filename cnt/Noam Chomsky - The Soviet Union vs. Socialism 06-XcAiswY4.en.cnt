We should recognize, what I think is true, I've written about it plenty myself,
that the so called Bolshevik "revolution", really a coup, was really a counter revolution
which placed state power in the hands of a highly authoritarian, anti-socialist group,
which within a couple of months had destroyed the factory councils, had destroyed the soviets,
had dismissed the constituent assembly because they knew they were going to lose
and had eliminated every popular movement and had done exactly what Trotsky said,
turn the the country into a labor army under the control of the maximal leader.
That was mid 1918. 
Since then there hasn't been a shred of socialism in the Soviet Union.
Now, of course they called it socialism, but they also called it democracy.
They were the peoples democracy, the purest form of democracy and socialism.
The west, the big propaganda system in the world of course laughed at the democracy part,
but it loved the socialism part, because that's a way to defame socialism.
So if you think that the fall of Soviet Union is a blow to socialism,
you ought to also think on the same grounds that it's a blow to democracy.
After all, they called themselves democracies too  so why isn't it a blow to democracy? 
Makes as much sense.
It's only when it gets filtered through the western propaganda system
that it's not a blow to democracy but it is a blow to socialism.
But there is absolute no reason to play that game,
whether you play it in dissent or in the nation or on the right or anywhere else.
Expose it for the fraud that it is.
What ideology? The ideology of totalitarianism? Yeah it's deeply flawed.
I mean they were the initial modern totalitarians.
It has nothing to do with socialism. They destroyed socialism within weeks.
They didn't wait.  By 1918 it was finished.
And they knew it. It was not a secret. They knew it.
In fact Lenin, as soon as got grips of things, he moved to what he called state capitalism.
Which is what it was. Had nothing to do with socialism.
Socialism... I mean you can argue but there is no point arguing what the word means but
what it always meant at the core was that  producers take control over the production. 
Working people take control of production which sometimes is called industrial democracy.
That was the absolute core of it.
Well there was more socialism in Germany, in western Europe, than there was in Russia.
Russia is about the most anti-socialist place you can imagine since 1918.
Had wage labor, had super exploitation,
had no elements of workers control or involvement or participation.
What has that got to do with socialism? It's the exact opposite on every point.
As I say, the west liked to call that socialism
while laughing at fact that they called themselves democrats
but that's for purely propaganda reasons.
I mean, unless you are committed to being part of the western propaganda system
there's nothing to say about that issue of dissent except to laugh.
