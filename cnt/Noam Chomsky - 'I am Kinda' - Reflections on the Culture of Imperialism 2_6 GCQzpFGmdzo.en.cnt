as mentioned before written 20 years
earlier called pirates and emperors the
theme of the book was from a story by
st. Augustine about a pirate who was
captured by Alexander the Great
Alexander the Great asked the pirate how
dare he molest the sea how dare you
molest the whole world the pirate
replied because I do it with a little
ship only I'm called a thief you do it
with a great Navy so you're called an
emperor the answer was elegant and
excellent st. Augustine relates and it's
very pertinent to our times as well the
so-called war on terror for one example
the book discusses one other things
Reagan's bombing of Libya in 1986 and it
includes a letter which reads as follows
dear mr. Reagan why did you kill my only
sister rafa and my friend ruffa she's
only nine and my baby doll strawberry
it's true is it true that you want to
kill us all because my father is
Palestinian and you want to kill Qaddafi
because he wants us to help us go back
to my father's home and land my name is
kinder that's the letter Kenda's family
and her letter were found in the ruins
of their home by ABC Middle East
correspondent Charles glass personal
friend he broke radically from
discipline and he investigated the
effects of Reagan's bombing of civilian
targets in Libya glass submitted the
letter to the US press but it wasn't
considered fit to print nor broadcast by
his own network nor was his interview
with Kenda's parents considered a fit
for a broadcaster publication he sent me
a copy to handwritten copy and I
included it in the book where Hinda had
seen it so when she came up to me and
said quietly I am Kim
I knew who she was thankfully alive
twenty years later a student in Beirut
now it's not that the media are
unconcerned by the killing of little
girls quite the contrary in one of the
New York Times editorials praising the
Emperor's brave terrorist attack on
defenseless Libya the headline reads to
save the next Natasha Simpson the
editors were referring to someone
well-known an 11-year old American girl
who was one of the victims of the
terrorist attacks in Rome and Vienna air
terminals on December 27th 1985 now
unlike Rafa Rafa and kindda Natasha was
very well known her terrible fate
entitles us to bomb Libyan cities to
discourage state supported terrorism the
time's editors solemnly declare it's
only a minor defect that no evidence had
ever been presented or has to this day
to implicate Libya in the room or Vienna
crimes nor is it of any relevance that
the charge was vigorously rejected by
the Italian house and Austrian
government's Libya had been selected as
a punching bag by the Reagan
administration from the moment it took
office when it declared a war against we
called state-directed international
terrorism the plague of the modern age
returned to barbarism and our times to
borrow sample some of the Emperor's
rhetoric back in the early 80s no matter
how ludicrous the tales of Libya's
threat to our existence were taken quite
seriously for example some of you
remember the fevered tales the fevered
reports of Libyan hit men roaming the
streets of Washington to assassinate our
leader white house was surrounded with
protected whatever fable was invented by
state propaganda suffice to say just
ified violence against libya no
questions asked and libya was a perfect
target I was weak it was defenseless its
leader was reviled had no sympathy or
support so a perfect country to bomb and
attack people kill them and so on these
us terrorist crimes have been dispatched
to the usual repository for unwanted
facts but it might be a useful to
extricate a few items from Orwell's
memory hole which is pretty full we help
fill it on April 14th 1986 @ about 630pm
I received the phone call from Charles
glass from Libya he was in Tripoli he
advised me to watch the 7pm news
programmes knows I never watch
television and I did so night in 1986
all the channels TV channels had their
prime news hour at 7pm so he told me I
should watch and I did and exactly at
seven pm to the second agitated news
anchors switched to their facilities in
Libya so they could present live the
bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi it's the
first bombing in history and the only
one in fact that was enacted for
primetime TV there was no slight
logistical accomplishment because the
Bombers were denied the right to cross
over France and so they had to take a
long detour detour through the Atlantic
and had to make sure to arrive just on
time for the television news program the
evening news and they did and
after showing the exciting scenes of the
cities and flames the TV channels
switched to Washington for sober
discussion of how the US was defending
itself from Libyan terror under the
newly devised doctrine of self-defense
against future attack officials informed
the country that they had certain
knowledge that Libya had carried out a
bombing of a disco in Berlin few days
earlier and which a usgi had been killed
the certainty reduced to zero shortly
after as was quietly conceded well after
its purpose had been achieved and it
would have been hard to find even a
raised eyebrow about the idea that the
disco bombing would have justified the
murderers assault on Libyan civilians
even if there were some evidence for it
the media were also polite enough not to
notice the curious timing I haven't
didn't see a word about it then or since
or for that matter the fact that they
had their bureaus and Tripoli just
waiting you know what are they doing
there in fact Charlie glass same guy who
was the ABC correspond told me this is
North Africa but he told me that at that
time ABC had three bureaus in Asia that
one in Tokyo the one in Tel Aviv and one
in Jerusalem but no there was nothing in
Tripoli the commentators were also you
know entranced by the solidity of the
non-existent evidence and also of
Washington's dedication to the law
there's a typical reaction from the new
york times editors explained that even
the most scrupulous citizen can only
approve and applaud the american attacks
on libya the united states has
prosecuted Qaddafi carefully
proportionately and justly the evidence
for Libyan responsibility for the disco
bombing has been now laid out clear
lead to the public and then came the
jury the European governments to which
the United States went out of its way to
send emissaries to share evidence and
urge concerted action against the Libyan
leader entirely irrelevant as usual is
the fact that no evidence was ever laid
out and that the jury was anything but
enthusiastic very skeptical particularly
in Germany itself where there had been
an intensive investigation of course and
they found no evidence at all of any
Libyan involvement which was quite
public it was also irrelevant that the
jury was pleading with the executioner
to refrain from any action but these are
more irrelevance ease at the
left-liberal end of the spectrum which
is always the most interesting part the
neurons legal correspondent Anthony
Lewis was particularly fulsome in his
praise of Reagan for his quoting
reliance on a legal argument that
violence against the perpetrators of
repeated violence is justified as an act
of self-defense recall that the
justification was quite different it was
the legal and ovation of self-defense
against future attack the Lewis did have
a point however in referring to repeated
violence that justified u.s. bombing in
self-defense honesty International had
just come out with a report which
charged that Libya was indeed a
terrorist state having killed 14 of its
own citizens during the years when the
Emperor's terrorist forces had killed
about a hundred thousand in Central
America alone numbers that were soon to
double that was in the course of what
Bishop our Torah Adamas called a war of
extermination and genocide against a
defenseless civilian population
the bishop was referring to El Salvador
in the early days of Reaganite terror
the bishop had become the spokesman for
the church after the assassination of
Archbishop Romero by Reagan's friends
and associates all of this small
fraction of Reaganite terror carried out
under the cover of the war on terror at
two it's the bombing of Libya added a
small footnote only several dozen people
killed apparently including Rafa and
Rafa in other parts of Africa according
to a un estimate 1.5 million were killed
in those years by south african terror
in the neighboring states that was
strongly supported by the reagan
administration it's only in violation of
congressional sanctions but the support
was justified and officially in fact
since it was necessary to protect the
apartheid state from Nelson Mandela's
African National Congress which was one
of the world's more notorious terrorist
groups so Washington determined in 1988
in fairness it should be added that last
year at Congress voted to remove the ANC
from the list of terrorist organizations
so Mandela can now come to the United
States without obtaining a waiver from
Washington the bombing of Libya was
neatly timed for a Congressional vote on
aid to the Contras it's the us-run
terrorist force that was attacking
Nicaragua from its Honduran basis to
ensure that the timing would not be
missed Reagan made the connection
explicit he gave an address the day
after the bombing and he said I would
remind the house the house of
representatives voting this week that
this arch tear
Qaddafi has sent four hundred million
dollars and an arsenal of weapons and
advisors into Nicaragua to bring his war
home to the United States he has bragged
that he's helping the Nicaraguans
because they fight America on its own
ground namely America's own ground and
Nicaragua the idea that the Mad Dog was
bringing his war home to us by providing
arms to a country that we were attacking
with a cia-run terrorist army based in
our on Durand dependency that was a nice
touch and it didn't go unnoticed the
national press explained that the
bombing of Libya should strengthen
President Reagan's hand in dealing with
Congress on issues like the military
budget and aid to the Nicaraguan Contras
now at that time the Palmer Ola air base
in Honduras was called the unsinkable
aircraft carrier for Reagan's terrorist
war against DeGraw gwa and the u.s.
still retains access to it along with
seven new military bases in Colombia
that's the one country in South America
that still grants the United States such
rights kicked out of all the others a
few months ago as you'll recall Obama
broke with the Latin American countries
and most of Europe by recognizing the
elections it conducted in nicaragua in
honduras by the military regime that
overthrew the elected government and
sent the president into exile now having
freed itself from the yoke of democracy
honduras quickly entered into a security
pact with colombia meanwhile obama's
representative at the Organization of
American States lectured silly Latin
Americans to abandon their infatuation
with what he called magic realism and
joined the Godfather
his sober calculations
