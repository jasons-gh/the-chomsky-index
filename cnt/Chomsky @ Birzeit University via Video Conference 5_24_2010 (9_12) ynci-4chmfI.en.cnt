hey I just felt there was a serious
break between your excellent analysis of
the historical evolution of us roll
around the world and throne and its
strategy in the Middle East now and your
proposal for a two-state solution
because I guess I could I could frame it
in in the form of a question do you say
don't you think that the two-state
solution would consolidate his Renslow
role as a major pillar of us strategy in
the region because human painting
solution within their own nationalist
confines or contexts and that would not
allow for any kind of action undermine
us Germany and in the Asian etc exactly
so would a two-state solution contradict
Israel's role in the region is that the
question yeah yeah yes yes of course
back in after the 67 war the 1967 war
there was of course discussion in Israel
about the whether they should try to
expand and become a richer more powerful
state or I should move towards a
situation of reconciliation with the
region and that came to a head in 1971
when so that made his offer and I told
you what they decided and the reasons
were given is there Weitzman who was
then I think still head of the Air Force
later became president he said we could
accept a peaceful settlement return to
our previous position but then we could
not live at the scale level of skit of
the scale the level of power the level
of Wilf well which we is about aspire
like other states given the opportunity
Israel would like to be a richer and
more powerful state and they're
regionally more significant
same through Luxembourg not sure that's
the way states behave so if in fact a
peaceful settlement were reached the
Israel could still become the would
still be by far the wealthiest state in
the region per capita Mountain resources
and the technological center you know
economic center and so on for the region
maybe sort of the way Japan is in the
Asian system but it wouldn't be the
dominant power and is it willing to
accept that well it wouldn't accept it
by choice any more than any other power
would give up its our state when you
feel its power by choice but
circumstances that might lead it to and
the circumstances in this case are very
straightforward will the United States
take that position if the United States
decides to join the rest of the world if
we have proximity talks between the
United States in the world and they lead
to the conclusion that the u.s. joins
the world then Israel simply will have
essentially no choices I mean either
their choice will be to accept it or to
act in some quite irrational fashion
fashion which a state with nuclear
weapons can do in which case it's just
unpredictable but assuming any level of
rationality that Israel would as in the
past accept what the United States tells
us that tells it to do under the
relations of power are so obvious that
there's no furious dispute about this
