do you think that President Obama has
intensified this threat I mean now with
the trillion dollar plan to quote
modernize the nuclear arsenal it's a
very bad step and it's not just
modernizing the Arsenal which ought to
be reduced worth remembering we have
even a legal obligation to cut back and
ultimately eliminate nuclear weapons but
it's also something you mentioned
earlier developing these small nuclear
weapons sounds kind of nice they're
small not big it's the opposite small
nuclear weapons provide a temptation to
use them figuring well it's only a small
weapon so it won't destroy you know a
whole city but the Sooners use a small
nuclear weapon chances of the
retaliation escalate pretty sharply and
that means you could pretty soon be in a
situation where you're having a real
nuclear exchange pretty well-known that
that would lead to a nuclear winter
which would make life essentially
impossible as as President Obama heads
to Hiroshima do you think he should be
apologizing for the only nuclear bombs
atomic bombs dropped in the world the
u.s. dropping them launching the nuclear
age on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and 45 I
thought I mean I'm old enough to
remember it and that day was just the
maybe the grimmest day I can remember
then came something even worse
the bombing of Nagasaki that mainly to
try to test a new weapon design these
are real horror stories the carpet the
bombing fire bombing of Japanese cities
a couple months earlier was not that
much better
Tokyo especially we might even recall
that there was what was called a grand
finale in the Air Force history after
the two atom bombs after Russia had
entered
war which and any Japanese hope for any
kind of and any hope that they had for
any sort of negotiated settlement after
that it was all over after Japan had
officially surrendered though before the
that had been made public after that the
US organized a thousand plane raid which
was a big logistic feat at the bomb
Japanese cities to kind of show the
chaps who was on top and survivors like
Makoto well-known Japanese writer
recently died reported that as a child
in Osaka he remembers bombs falling
along with leaflets saying Japan has
surrendered now that was not a lethal
bombing but it was a verbal one a brutal
sign of brutality all of these events
called for serious rethinking yes
apology but mainly serious rethinking of
just what we're up to in the world and
remember that this goes on those were
small bombs by today's standards if you
look at the record since since 1945 it's
an absolute miracle that we survived new
examples are discovered all the time
just a couple of months ago it was
revealed that in 1979 last Carter year
the u.s. automated detection systems
centum determined that there was a major
Russian missile attack against the
United States protocol is this goes to
the Joint Chiefs of Staff they evaluated
goes to the National Security Adviser
and speak native urgency at that time he
notifies the president Brzezinski was
actually on the phone ready to call
Carter to launch a nuclear attack which
means the Doomsday Clock goes to
midnight on the phone when they received
information saying that it was a false
alarm
another of the hundreds if not thousands
of false alarms on the Russian side
there probably many more because their
equipment as much worse
these things happen constantly and to
play games with escalating the nuclear
arsenal when it should be reduced
sharply reduced I mean even people like
Henry Kissinger George Shultz and so on
are calling for elimination of nuclear
weapons to escalate and modernize at
this point is just really criminal in my
opinion
