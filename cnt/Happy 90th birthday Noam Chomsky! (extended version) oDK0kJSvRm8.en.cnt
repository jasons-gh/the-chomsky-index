[Music]
this is not only a South birthday card
but also a sound thank you card for
being one of our elders and for having
voice of clarity and incisiveness I mean
sometimes a very consuming map of ideas
put by different systems as they crank
their power your writers have been
refreshing uplifting and humanistic
there's helping us in what some call the
cooking of the soul a few more knots
trapped if you like as a very small
dusting of Earth
[Music]
so for me the most important scientific
contribution that noam chomsky is made
over his career is just the idea that
syntax exists that can't be reduced to
probabilities and it can't be reduced
meaning when I was 16 I won some kind of
a prize at school and with the prize
money I bought this very copy of
syntactic structures I didn't really
understand much of it but actually the
basic core idea I just mentioned has
stayed with me and it's formed the
foundation of my intellectual career
ever since so thank you for that idea
Noam and happy birthday
among them see numerable contributions
that would certainly count the fact that
language is a human cognitive capacity
and not just a cultural object
the fact that the organization of syntax
is ironical and not linear if a third
language is fairy but their variation is
much more limited than meets the eye
we're talking quit Nam I always had a
very very special feeling of being able
to look beyond once talking with Maurey
salad
I discovered that I share that very
rewarding to me this is Tom ever there
are three important aspects of found
Noam has made continual revolutionary
contributions to the language and
cognitive sciences contributions that
radiates to many other sciences first he
has a deep analytic capacity to explore
the unconscious sources of what is
conscious knowledge second he doggedly
builds models of the structure of those
processes changing his mind over time
searching for the simplest description
of the essence of language making it
possible to suggest why language is the
way it is finally he has the gift of
clarity of expression making very clear
the structure of complex investigations
and ideas Noam Chomsky will always be
known for his work in linguistics
however Chomsky's most significant
contributions to science include
explaining and exemplifying how science
and philosophy
together science and philosophy are
distinct yet inextricably interconnected
each with characteristic roles questions
and methods this picture is perceivable
in immanuel kant's prolegomena
that is philosophy acts as a rudder that
steers the sciences so is employing one
of the alternatives about the other a
good bet thank you and happy birthday no
best wishes to you for this very special
birthday
and let me add how grateful all of us
are to you for setting for the first
time ever the study of language on a
scientific base bye bye see you language
defines us but we didn't know how much
we know about language until Noam
Chomsky woke us up discovering and
making us discover the beauty of the
little details of how language works
Noam is also a magnificent example that
science and political intervention are
not separate world's healthy democracies
need critical thinking and knowledge
thank you known for all the wake-up
calls
nobody's perfect
and we would like to thank you very much
for all you do
in particular I feel like I want to
thank you for your message about the
responsibility towards the intellectuals
and towards science not just that you
are yourself an intellectual but that
you fight for the freedom in research
and for the freedom of scientists that's
very valuable and we also would like to
thank you for setting a model of
responsibility at the kind of micro
level so not of just being very
courageous in the outside world but also
doing seemingly simple things like
answering emails by whoever is afar you
have answered my emails sometimes if
answers my students
sometimes and I think when I get emails
from people fellow citizens asking me
something many people would say well I'm
not going to answer this again I try to
follow your model but I'm sure you get
100,000 times more emails and questions
and all kinds of requests than me I
don't know how you do it but this is
very inspiring so happy birthday well

felicidades professor Chomsky is a
greeting from Universidad Nacional ,
we're here in Patagonia Argentina we
really want to thank you professor
Chomsky for your contributions and
inspiration in our graduate program in
linguistics so on behalf of all our
colleagues here in Patagonia we really
want to wish you a happy birthday you
professor Chomsky it is my pleasure to
wish you a happy birthday
both your linguistic and political work
have inspired me for years now we have
proven that all human beings share the
most sophisticated way of cognition
language this is the best argument I've
ever heard of for equality you have made
among others my career meaningful I
respect you and I respect your work
deeply thank you know
felicidades not Chomsky's twin greatest
legacies are first he began to explain
to us nature's greatest tool for
connecting the mind with the world that
is
a human language and second he began to
explain to us nature's great tool for
deciphering these systems you know the
guises they take in the natural
languages of the world that is the human
infant and for these two reasons
I take Chomsky as the greatest living
psychologist of language and therefore
the greatest linguist of our era so
happy birthday Noam Chomsky carbonatites

okay Ning and Legolas then cognitively
re ki-moon thank you a massage good
ohana common among there oh thank you
you can go go you own Erica today
can't you stick it up Thibodeaux she's
got a debate about this again what can
old Kentucky I get those like us so
Chomsky's greatest contribution to
science you mean besides inventing
modern linguistics and leading the
charge against behaviorism well-posed
Ides these two small achievements his
greatest contribution in my opinion has
been rejecting methodological dualism
and arguing that empirical and
theoretical work in the mental sciences
should be judged by the very same
criteria as work in the physical
sciences Chomsky has powerfully made
this obvious point for over 60 years
but sadly it is still can they do you
know any games so scared Ganga cool oh
my son Ahmad Shah mosquito is I know to
me the most important contribution of
your work to science is the change that
it made and how we saw language itself
my own background was social
anthropology which long did lie
language is an aspect of culture human
invention like tool-making or
agriculture you along with Lana Berg and
Holly changed all that you brought us to
see language as a part of the natural
world and with that shift everything
shifted with it
language learning became language
ontogeny language typology became
comparative anatomy language history
became language evolution and language
disappearance became language extinction
linguistics lives in a new world now and
we have you to thank for it so happy
birthday and Mazel Tov hi this is Howard
last me know I know how you hate anyone
to make any kind of personal fuss about
you but it's your 90th that's a biggie
you're gonna have to grin and bear at
this done it has to comment on Noam
Chomsky's contributions to science the
biggie is that he contributed the
linguistics to science he showed how
observable phenomena and language are
just a faint hint of what's really going
on beneath the surface the principal
explanatory theories can and must be
developed based on unobservable as in
other Natural Sciences underlying versus
superficial structure mental
computations relating these etc he
taught us to question the obvious and
his famous exchange with Hilary Putnam
at the 1975 Vermont event Putnam
rejected gnomes innate in this argument
based on structure dependence claiming
that no sane person ever has or ever
would put forth an on structure
dependent version of question formation
based just on strings of words rather
than structured strings gnomes response
was that is quite true but exactly what
we want to explain words to live by when
I was a student I told my friends I was
interested in the thought of Noam
Chomsky and I remember that they asked
me which one of the two the linguist or
the activist after I met him I realized
that there was not two Chomsky's but
three and the third Chomsky is the one
who cares for each and every student's
treating them as peers and tried to do
his best for them to reach their goals
and their dreams in the intellectual
words of linguistics

I first met through salvador luria

modern biology at the MIT who was at the
time sharing with known a group of
linguists and biologists I was at the
time and biophysicist and molecular
biologist working at the institut
pasteur under the guidance of another
Nobel Prize Jack Malone
who was a great friend and great admirer
of Laurium so learning from Lorien that
he was a great friend and great admired
of Nam Chomsky I was intrigued
during the Raymond debate that I had the
privilege of organizing the debate
between norm Chomsky and Jean Piaget
I was impressed by the rigor of norms
arguments and I was captured by
generative grammar there and then and
ever since
Lauria wisely said that the best way to
characterize a scientific domain is to
look at the ten top experiments in the
field I think this applies to generative
grammar as well it would be an
interesting challenge for us to isolate
and determine which are the ten
fundamental sentences or sentence pairs
that have shaped generative grammar all
the way from colorless green ideas sleep
furiously
- which of his picture did they persuade
the museum that every painter knives
best finding an agreeing on these ten
sentences would be I think a very good
way to wish know a very happy 90th
birthday no George right here although
you and I have had our differences over
the years I hope you realize there is
nothing compared to the great admiration
I have for your work with scientific and
political your ideas about the structure
of the minds you need the best anyone's
ever had and your political commentaries
are well certainly more serious northern
forum to the standard fair
happy birthday and many happy returns
one outstanding achievement has been the
shift of focus from product of latter's
behavior to the study of a specific
cognitive system underlying their
behavior from the early days of the
jitter of enterprise transformational
rules were viewed as a necessary
complication to enema crystal chills one
important recent result therefore is the
grand unification of decimation of
displacement with three structural
continuity under a single common
attorney operation just summation
features turn out to be the NMR case of
this unification it follows that no
language can be human language that is
not transformation there's a lot of
techno before congratulations and a
happy birthday to you it is true that
the weekend Stein managed to lecture
about what philosophy is in three
minutes but I think that characterizing
norms contributions in a few seconds is
even harder so I will not even try let
me just say that after many many
appointments that I was lucky enough to
have over the years with norm and going
back home full of enthusiasm about the
new ideas that the marriage then that we
had discussed together
my thoughts naturally went to the
contemporaries of the founding father
of modern science and those who have the
opportunity to discuss with Galileo or
with Newton with Darwin and I saw that I
was lucky I thought that my generation
is lucky and many many generations have
are lucky to have the opportunity to
discuss with know about language and
mind so we should all be grateful to
norm for offering us this extraordinary
opportunity of thinking about language
and about mind in a completely new way
so happy birthday norm and thank you
Noam Chomsky has given us a new way of
thinking about language a human mind
language acquisition and so many other
things which are absolutely vital to our
understanding of ourselves as human
beings I believe that he is truly giving
us a novel way of understanding the
nature of human nature the nature of
ourselves
I know happy 90th birthday Wow
what one individual could do in 90 years
really change the course of a discipline
in fact many many disciplines is just
simply amazing
I couldn't resist coming to your old
stomping grounds as you can see behind
me I'm in town as I usually end this
time of year for the BU CLD conference
they asked us to mention your most
important contribution at least in our
view and there are so many to choose
from it's it seems an impossible task to
mention just one so let me be very
abstract about it which is what I want
to thank you for the overarching view
that you've given us a program that
you've given us to think abstract ly
about language to add scientific inquiry
and scientific methodology into language
- to have straightaway at the time or to
rebuked the the then-current idea of
what was taken as a truth about language
about the mind in general
thank you for challenging us to think
abstract ly thank you for challenging us
to move the study of linguistics into
the modern age of science and to in
doing so understand its characteristics
happy birthday
Thanks gnomes important contribution is
science follows from his contribution to
linguistics Noah's major impact in the
field of linguistics came from
championing formal mathematical grammars
as a characterization of a speaker's
unconscious knowledge this approach
spread quickly to other disciplines and
allows possibility of cooperation and
integration between disciplines we're
still seeing this unfold both in
research that takes a critical view of
gnomes work as well as research that
supports particular aspects of his
claims this is no one say is to be
expected he's always claimed that you
need to be wary of your assumptions when
creating a model consider the
mathematical consequences these can
guide you to new observations are
convince you to change course when I
arrived at MIT as a student I was told
if you believe anything we teach you
here it's your own fault Chomsky has
shown us that there's really only one
human language the bewildering
complexity of the wilds of linguistic
riches simply illustrates variation on a
single theme he's used this insight to
cause further light on the nature of the
human mind from modularity to innate
Ness and he's done this while diverting
equal amount of time to relentless
descent providing us with a means of
intellectual self defense against all
forms of authority

emphasized Plato's problem how come we
know so much with so little evidence he
also emphasized Orwell's problem how
come there being so much evidence around
us we have a hard time reaching somewhat
obvious conclusions and to me the
biggest contribution was how he
emphasized the connection between the
two are we going to be able to ever
address Plato's problem if we don't
provide a solution to our walls I don't
know the answer but that's where the
torch is and came from norm we're going
to try to pass it on I submit that dope
Chomsky's greatest contribution to
science is in fact in the making quite
literally
at present he and I and my colleagues
are working to encode the principles and
procedures of generative grammar into an
artificial intelligence so as to create
artificial general intelligence indeed
Chomsky and I argue that human style
general intelligence emerges from
language so if we succeed in creating
artificial general intelligence it would
be the most important event in the
history of the world possibly the
universe duuude professor Chomsky it is
my pleasure to wish you a happy birthday
both your linguistic and political work
have inspired me for years now we have
proven that all human beings share the
most sophisticated way of cognition
language this is the best argument I've
ever heard of for equality you have made
among others my career meaningful I
respect you and I respect your work
Wheatley Thank You Noah
felicidades know what is language how
can it be described how is it possible
to understand this human specific trait
most important contribution
Noam Chomsky to science as in to show
that the syntax of language any language
of the world can be described in term of
a simple binary and recursive operation
that applies to syntactic constituent
combines them and displace them from his
earlier work in material formal grammar
and the autonomy of syntax to his
current work in minimalism Noam Chomsky
has developed a research program on
language science the free search program
enables the discovery of our innate
knowledge of language it enables the
formulation of testable hypothesis and
prediction about the property of human
language it also enabled research on
language acquisition language variation
and also so lead to the understanding of
language as a product of human biology
that is as a product of the human
computational brain happy 90th
