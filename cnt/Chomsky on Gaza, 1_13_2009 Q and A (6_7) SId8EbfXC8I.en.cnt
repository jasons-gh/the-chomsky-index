mentioned one of the one of the reasons
for the strong us support of Israel
being the the military base that they
provide us in the Middle East and it
seems that the more support we give to
Israel the less secure the area really
is a week the less popular America seems
to be in that region and I don't know if
there's a point at which that'll
actually are supportive Israel actually
undermine our security so my real
question is can you shed any more light
on other reasons that America is so
strongly allied with Israel other places
it says strongly aligned no other
reasons that US is so strongly allied
with Israel besides it being just the
best place to park our tanks so
supportive oh I see me yeah well yeah
its causes plenty of anti-american
feeling among the population but yeah
nobody cares about that as long as
they're under control and that goes long
before way way back long before us
support for Israel I mean us support for
Israel as I mentioned it was always
there but it became really strong the
Alliance was really established in 1967
well 10 years before that in 1958 which
happened to be a pretty turbulent period
there President and Eisenhower inquired
with his staff this is a secret and
public for a long time he asked the why
is there such a campaign of hatred
against us in the Arab world among the
people not the government's the
government's mostly go along with but
why is there such a campaign of hatred
against us among the people that's
George Bush's why do they hate us and
there was a response there was an
analysis which has just been produced by
the National Security Council being
highest Planning Council which explained
the reasons it said there is a
perception in the Arab world that the
United States opposes democracy and
development and supports Tara knees
because the United States wants to get
control of our energy sources and it
said basically the perceptions correct
and that's what we ought to be doing
okay because ok so the campaign of
hatred against us but as long as we've
got what we want what are we here you
know I mean back to the Mafia Don I mean
maybe the people on the street hate him
you no longer than the runners affairs
who cares about the two-legged Beast and
that remains true and that Israel was
not an issue at that time but after
after nine eleven one newspaper to its
credit the Wall Street Journal did a
study of opinions and among Muslims not
all Muslims just the ones they cared
about what they called money Muslims
like managers of you know multinational
corporations and lawyers and people like
that just and this is after Bush's why
do they hate a speech and they did an
analysis of what the opinion was and I
found the same answers not opposition to
you know globalization or capitalism
with so called capitalism or you know us
power or anything in fact the right in
the middle of it that said that they
found overwhelmingly pretty much with
the NSC reported in 1958 they oppose the
u.s. support for brutal autocracies its
opposition to democracy and development
because of its interest to gain control
of our resources now by 19 by two
thousand one day added other reasons one
of them was US involvement in a crushing
of the Palestinians and the second
another topic we're not allowed to talk
about here was the sanctions against
Iraq which were genocidal you know I
mean Clinton probably killed more Iraqis
than said I was saying and they
protested against that well it's kind of
like off the agenda here but
the reasons the others well I mentioned
some of the reasons I'll just go over it
again one is it's a major military base
two is what I quoted from US
intelligence back in 58 it's a logical
corollary of us opposition to Arab
nationalism to support Israel as the
only reliable base in the region third
is it's a very closely integrated with
the u.s. high-tech that's big part of
the US economy we got to know that at
MIT when the microsoft and HP and those
guys are in love with israel that has an
effect on policy and of course they are
in love with it as you can just tell by
investment patterns for good reasons you
know it's a nice relationship and same
in other respects it's a there's an
ideological connection especially among
intellectuals since nineteen sixty seven
since israel's victory there are other
reasons that go sort of deep in the
culture what Israel's doing has been
doing resonates pretty well with our own
history I mean the you know forcible and
violent displacement of the two-legged
Beast and settlement by a superior race
that's American history a very explicit
American history back to the 17th
century I'm very explicit and the same
is true of the providential ISM look
back over American history and American
culture a very strong theme all right to
the present and you know including
people who call themselves secular is
that everything that's happening is
fulfilling God's will God has a has a
plan for the universe and we're filling
it we're carrying out the mission by
wiping out the indigenous population by
stealing their lands by conquering half
of Mexico you know evading Vietnam
whatever maybe we're fulfilling the
divine mission it's providential ISM
very strong theme in u.s. culture all
the way back and it's very similar in
Israel if you read them text say the
book that I mentioned the book on the
settlement it's a very valuable book one
of its main a lot of it is concerned
with the thinking of the major groups of
the settlers guichet moneim who are not
marginal in Israel in fact they're
highly honored as capturing the real
essence of Israel and Zionism and what
it is and it's basically providential
asst by settling every inch of the land
we are carrying out God's will we're
bringing the Messiah if you think hamada
nejad is extreme you ought to read
American history and the ideology the
settlers that's I don't know how to
measure it but I suspect that this
resemblance between our own history what
we call our own history and Israel's
settlement or replacement of the
two-legged beasts by a superior race is
probably significant and it since I in
the United States it's not it's not the
right wing you read this in Walt Whitman
for example than Amerson you know people
like that so there are plenty of reasons
and they may not be good reasons but
certainly not insignificant and when
Israel goes against US policy the u.s.
stops them of course the case I
mentioned about attacking Iran is one
but there are many others
dr. Chomsky I'm Jim Schneider i sell the
herald and the globe in front of a donut
shop in Bunker Hill Mall in Charlestown
I was wondering if you had a chance to
notice the october sixth article in the
oil and gas journal which describes the
delineation of some super giant oil
fields off the coast of israel and there
also and i also say that it's an arc
that goes from syria follows the coast
of israel and then goes over to egypt
and what's kind of embarrassing is to
look at this full colored chart on the
first page and there's a nice the
positive higher-quality condensates
under gaza but there's no reference in
the article that the Palestinian
Authority is going to have any access to
whatever monies are derived from what
offshore territorial rights they would
have I guess evidently they don't have
any because the you could if you can
have it the Israeli Navy off the coast
well you probably can't have your own
oil field business but they found 15
billion barrels of oil and a hundred
trillion cubic feet of gas so far but
nobody seems to mention that he knew
it's about well it's about rockets and
it's about who killed whose kids first
it's not about dirty old oil especially
if it's a hell of a lot of it yeah I'm
kind of skeptic I didn't read that
article but there has been reporting and
not reporting but there are plenty of
studies about that and it's been known
for a long time that there are a gas and
oil mostly gas i think i think as you
said mostly guess resources off the
coast of Gaza not much off of Israel or
they would have exploited but I frankly
doubt that there's much to do with
what's going on I mean it suppose that
the United States stopped its rejection
ISM and permitted weak defenseless
unarmed palestinian state to survive and
accord with the national consensus
they'd have no trouble getting that oil
you know thank you sir they don't have
to let Israel conquer it to do the fact
they'd probably get it more easily from
a Palestinian state than from Israel
which is strong enough to have its own
so as I doubt very much that that's a
factor in what's going on
