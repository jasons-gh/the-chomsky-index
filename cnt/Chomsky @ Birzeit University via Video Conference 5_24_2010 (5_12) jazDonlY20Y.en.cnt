there was a going on between secular
nationalism represented by Nasser and
the radical fundamentalism Islamic
fundamentalism represented by Saudi
Arabia then as now and the United States
and Britain have traditionally supported
Islamic fundamentalism and opposed
radical nationalism it was true true to
in many places but it was particularly
true in this case and this was of
enormous significance because the
radical nationalism of Nasr whatever one
thinks of them carried with it the
threat that secular nationalist the
secular nationalist arab forces might
appropriate thing resources their own
resources for their own purposes and
that's impermissible those are our
resources that's official in US policy
leading policymakers describe the
resources of the world is our resources
which by accident happened to be
somewhere else and the people are not
illegitimate Lee allowed to take our
resources which happened to be under
their soil for their ends and that's
what secular nationalism threatened to
do islamic fundamentalism was going to
be susceptible they assumed the u.s.
power as it remains in saudi and saudi
arabian the gulf that one of the charges
against iran is that they're no longer
living by that principle that's another
unacceptable move well in any event in
1967 israel essentially destroyed the
central elements of secular nationalism
and protected saudi arabia from the Nasr
I'd threat and the Gulf generally and
it's that point the US relations with
Israel shifted prior to that they were
friendly but were less normal after that
they became unique there's nothing like
it in the global system and that remains
true today he was 8 Israel shut up
an American public opinion in the media
and the intellectual community a love
affair started with Israel which before
that had not received that much
attention or interest and that persists
to the present that's also a significant
force and policymaking that's why media
coverage is so grossly distorted up till
today in 1970 Israel performed another
service this had to do with Palestinians
and Jordan in 1970 as you remember
Jordanian forces crushed Palestinians
black September and that was again a
major victory for the United States and
Saudi Arabia house the Palestinian
movement was considered to be a threat
to the hashemite kingdom but indirectly
to Saudi Arabia and the United States
was not in Syria it looked for a moment
of the Siri was going to intervene
during Black September to protect the
Palestinians it was certainly didn't
want that but it was completely tied
down in Southeast Asia at that time and
couldn't do anything so it asked Israel
to mobilize its forces and threaten
Saudi Arabia with it syria with attack
if they made a move and Syria backed off
and that everything worked out fine and
the US aid Israel they're practically
quadrupled in 1970 it gained its
position as what the lexan
administration called was empowered then
called a cop on the beat it was the
local policeman the local jean dorm the
picture was that mean what has to be
protected is a gulf oil and that has to
be pretend the ruling powers have to be
protected from their own populations and
that requires a police force and the
police horse was made up of surrounding
non-arab countries that one was Iran
then under the shot so loyal another was
turkey in the Louvre Pakistan and now
Israel joined the group and became a
leading member of
the cops on the beat the local policeman
police headquarters of courses in
Washington and there's a kind of a
branch office in London and that's
roughly the structure of how to control
the energy resources of the region that
more or less remains so slight changes
the meanwhile the Israel was facing
choices it now controlled all of
Palestine and also the Sinai and Israel
made a very fateful decision in 1971
which is kind of disappeared from
history but it's extremely important I
think it's the most important decision
Israel's history and the United States
in the Middle East in 1971 president
Sadat of Egypt who had recently come
into office offered a full peace treaty
to Israel for peace treaty there's
nothing for the Palestinians this is
before Palestine nationalism had entered
the international arena so nothing for
the Palestinians full peace treaty with
in the mage any security problems for
Israel with Egypt out of the picture and
no Palestinians that was in return
Israel was to withdraw to its borders
now actually so that didn't care much
about the West Bank put in the words but
he didn't care we care about was the
Sinai so he wanted Israel to withdraw
from the Sinai not at that time Israel
was initiating major settlement programs
in the northeastern Sinai they were
planning to build a huge city the city
via meet on the Mediterranean in the
Sinai and a lot of settlements keep it
seemed and Israel had to decide but we
want security where do we want expansion
it's a crucial decision they could have
had complete security and nothing for
the Palestinians or they could expand
that that time mainly into the Sinai the
settlement in the West Bank was also
beginning
decision to prefer expansion well the
crucial question is always is how would
the United States respond that's the
Godfather so what's he going to do and
if you look back there was a conflict
within the US government between
essentially the State Department which
wanted to accept Sadat's of offer which
was pretty much in line with official US
policy and the Henry Kissinger who was
the national security adviser and his
main goal in life at that time was to
take over the State Department his main
enemy in the world was William Rogers
Secretary of State the Russians were
much lower in the priority list not so
if Rogers said the training Kissinger
would say the sun shining well Rogers
was in favor of Sadat's offer and the
Kissinger explained in his memoirs that
he was in favor of what he called
stalemate with no negotiations just
force and Kissinger one out in the
internal debate value as fact Israel's
choice of expansion over security now
with various changes that pretty much
remains true until today right through
this period Israel and the United States
could have had the choice of security as
they can now I have preferred expansion
and that's the live issue right at this
moment this is the thing which persists
with various changes I won't go through
the full details but what happened as
you know is that I sadat made further
offers see more through the Russian
advisers he made all sorts of appeals to
the United States but he was just
dismissed with contempt was a period of
extreme arrogance both in Israel in the
United States they thought Arabs don't
know which end of a gun hold them can
dismiss them very racist in fact if you
look back I
this literature on it they like and then
said I kept saying his phrase was yummy
close war if Israel continues to expand
into the Sinai there'll be a war nobody
took him seriously and then came the
1973 war which was a very close thing
for Israel and both Israel and the
United States recognized that they could
not just dismiss you and then you begin
the Kissinger's shuttle diplomacy it
ends up in Camp David and finally at
Camp David in 1978-79 the u.s.
essentially accepted Sadat's 1971 offer
that's considered in the US sort of
picture of affairs is a great diplomatic
triumph actually was a diplomatic
disaster they rejected an offer in 1971
they accepted it after a major war and
suffering and destruction and so on and
finally they accepted it that's a
diplomatic disaster but in writing
history you don't say that you're your
Lords it had a right a mistake that's
not done so it's a triumph
