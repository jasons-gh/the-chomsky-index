thank you I tried to put two questions
to you which come from about sunny
this is a paper a lot of questions came
in concerning the structure of the
movements that you graphs in the
beginning and dog parts I read them out
how can I leave centralized disorganized
movement right successfully against
centralized and organized capitalist
institutions if this not an illusion
this is another question its various
forms of social activism do not don't
need single agenda in which sense
can you talk about them being together
is this struggle against control only
that unites the movements or nothing
else any issues that unites movements
question from data for cash optic
Hungary a colleague of yours
it's MIT Lesley fellow said that
everybody knows that capitalism has to
be brought down and the only ways that
it can be brought down is through
economic crash world crash or public
revolution do you see any chances of any
oh please in the coming five ten years
or any other way of bringing the system
down that should be
any constraints on you but we let six
rows we're in the same university but
this they were colleagues is a little
misleading he was the director of the
School of Management
so he's training people to become
managers of major corporations he
doesn't think that the system should be
broken down a Community Survey he might
have said that you know maybe a crisis
will come and will break down but the
main question is first of all what's
shared by the social movements well you
know if you take them all together
they're probably not much but if you
think very large components of them
quite a lot of things this year like
attitudes on sexism racism aggression
militarism the existence of corporations
basic structures of capitalism you know
human rights I mean on those issues a
lot of things are shared often down to
considerable details like how a post
capitalist economy or a run you know
there are many interesting questions
about how you would run a society
without the managerial control or
private ownership or state ownership and
so on all of these all of these issues
you can find a fair measure of agreement
I mean if you go into real details you
know you'll get disagreement but then
there ought to be disagreement does
anybody know the right answer to these
questions no these are they don't really
understand that much about human society
and human life for human beings I'm
gonna have to figure these things out of
Sarah mentally so it's right to have
general guiding sort of visions you know
some idea where you're trying to go but
to be exploratory an experiment
they get there those things that have to
be discovered so I don't really see that
as a weakness in fact if you look at the
history of what's called the ideological
list sake the Marxist movements they
never had anything to say about a future
Society take a look at Marx and once was
a theorist of capitalism if you take a
look at the whole Marx corpus you know
huge collection of volumes there's about
five sentences on what a post-capitalist
society could be like I mean sentences
you all memorized for the right age you
know you're gonna be a fisherman in the
morning that sort of thing there's a
couple of sentences like that scattered
around but the rest there's no picture
of the future society in fact Marx's
actual proposals Marx and Engels there
were legal requirements if you read the
communist manifesto
you know this said yeah there'll be some
future Society but what exactly but
they're actually calling for our social
reforms social democratic reforms and
many of which have been instituted over
the years but there was no no there was
no guiding ideology it was supposed to
be the iron laws of history which was
going to make certain things happen and
then workers take over and something
happens but we don't know what if you
look at Leninist ideology yeah that was
very clear very simple follow me that's
a simple ideology but between those two
there's almost nothing on the
traditional list and the anarchists had
a different point of view they develop
conceptions of how a society ought to be
organizing what you ought to do to build
pieces of it
Society and so on but that's very
characteristic of the contemporary
movements let me know they didn't read I
don't know the Incas literature they're
sort of following this impact you build
pieces of the future societies within
the current one and you try to the road
it's a belief system is added to
structures of control and so on and
gradually I develop the more free
democratic society I think it makes
perfect sense
so Canada's organized movement to
overcome centralized control usually
happens right through history in fact
every bit of progress you can think of
it's been like that I'm going to come if
there is a crash that's suppose of some
disaster takes place which could happen
no I forgot what it's quite likely you
can make a probability but it's not
likely at all that there'll be some
massive terrorist attack in the West
pneumonitis rate involving weapons of
mass destruction
maybe nuclear weapons and it's really
not that hard to sneak the parts of a
small nuclear bomb into New York we
could probably do it for their limited
talents it really doesn't take much
there's tens of thousands of components
of nuclear weapons all over the world
uncontrolled small nuclear weapons are
really small but 15 kilotons or
something anybody can sneak anything
they like over the Canadian border you
don't have to go through the airport
there's most of the world's shipping
almost all of it is in containers
containers are not inspected and they
can't be inspected under in some studies
of what it would take to monitor the
containers leading Rotterdam and going
to the United States
turns out if you try to just inspect
those containers all of New York would
be tire
traffic jam and we so we could move this
plane gridlock because of the amount of
you know the side effects of trying to
inspect the containers there's no
conceivable way in inspectors and you
can't tell what's inside them may be
pieces of nuclear weapons so the idea
that there will be a say a major
terrorist act in one of the Western
countries it's unlikely
what would the effects be well you know
they could be the political effect so
aside from killing everything else I'm
the political effects will be
catastrophic
you can imagine anything or suppose
let's take another possibility fix that
the world is very much energy oil based
hydrocarbon based know and that's
increasing everyone knows the things
that in the longer term is devastating
probably destroy the environment but the
shorter current problem it's gonna run
out you don't know exactly when but
nobody doubts that it's it's a dynamic
resource and at some point it will just
become too expensive to abstract at that
point may not be very far away there
aren't new discoveries being made most
of the oil snow and where it is and
nobody expects much to be discovered so
in fact the trip you know discovery is
has peaked and it's probably leveling
which means that and usage is going up
constantly because the very few attempts
of serious observation so there is a
potential crisis brewing and if it turns
out in a short period that oil is not
actually available at a sufficient rate
they could again the devastating effects
there are no plans serious plans for how
to shift to a non-oil based economy
quite the contrary I mean planners are
acting as if we don't have to worry
it's not happened in five years from now
well we have to do is make profit
tomorrow and that actually is built into
the sort of state capitalist systems you
know so push the plan you're supposed to
maximize straightener and product so
this is kind of a built-in catastrophe
the supposed takes place and is that
going to be good for the left any of
these catastrophes are much more likely
to lead to some kind of fascism that's
not the way to bring about social change
the wait for a catastrophe what you want
to do is deal with these problems right
now and they're not a bad way to deal
with them I think is through what are
called disorganized movements that means
movements that have a lot of spontaneity
an initiative pursuing their own
objectives and keep their mind on what
other people are doing but they're not
necessarily feeling they have some
ideology that they can follow I mean if
you look over the past there never have
been ideologies this idea that there
were left movements with ideologies that
told you what to do is just a myth just
take a look at the ideologies nothing
Leninism had no ideology and Marx didn't
even talk about the doctor so these are
all mythologies designed to kind of
Brandeis a centralized movements
controlled by leadership groups right at
the top by making it appear that there's
some ideology that says if you follow me
if we just want to work out but that's
about the linens of the ideology never
system
