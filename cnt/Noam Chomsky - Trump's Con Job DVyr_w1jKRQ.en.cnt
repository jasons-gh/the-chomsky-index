a lot of his political support comes
from people who he is kicking in the
face literally the part of his support
that comes from the disillusion angry
desperate white working-class and they
have a lot to be angry about that is
based on a con a con game he's their
worst enemy just take a look at the
legislations that's passing through
Congress under the facade step after
step that worse is going to come the
Trump the Supreme Court with corsets
they are soon going to address a very
important case of labor rights the
Friedreich's case and they'll almost
certainly vote to destroy public sector
unions it's a terrible attack on the
working class the regulations that are
being dismantled right now defend
working people sooner or later
I think the con is going to collapse and
much more important than trying to talk
about impeaching Trump is trying to
develop programs that will be meaningful
and constructive for the people who are
deceived into supporting their class
enemy now the Democrats have completely
failed to do this they abandoned the
working class forty years ago Bernie
Sanders is an option and that's what
ought to be pursued I think not worrying
about impeachment actually if he was
impeach the result might be worse Mike
Pence is probably worse
