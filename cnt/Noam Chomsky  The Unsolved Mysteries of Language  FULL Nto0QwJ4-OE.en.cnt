give you with some toppings of your ear
political position if you want I I can
this is coming and the first question is
here and which is your energy for form
which is a conception of 1518 is in the
disabilities of young also the
connection of this with the rationalism
well I don't see innate isn't an issue I
mean everybody except some form of an
atheism I mean everyone agrees that
humans aren't Birds let's say when
they're not rocks and as soon as you
agree with that then you've accepted in
80s and the Buster you know you believe
in angels or something we have some
special innate structure that makes us
humans that's not even a doubt there is
you could conceivably argue that we
don't have any Nate structure for
language but that's almost unimaginable
I mean it's impossible to with the most
extensive effort to teach even the
tiniest rudiments of language to even
higher Apes their closest relatives and
humans learn it without any evidence at
all virtually just minimal stimulation
so it must follow that they have
extremely rich structure for language
again somebody might believe and it's
been argued that it's just our general
intelligence applied to this material
but in order to make that a serious
proposal you'd have to say okay what are
the mechanisms of general intelligence
and how are they different from those of
say Apes and nobody can even begin to
answer that question so the question
that we have a specific capacity for
language which in fact is highly
restricted to question to that that is
just mysticism at this point now people
want to question it okay but it's like
saying I don't believe that the law of
gravity works or if somebody said that I
don't believe that in eight structure
makes make some cells become chickens
and other ones become humans
again are you with them exactly it's
just these are things that are obvious
the only interesting question is what's
the innate structure well there you know
there are substantive issues lots of
work and so on my own feeling is it so
restricted that virtually all of
language is innate and about the only
differences between languages are in
parts of the lexicon you know choice of
words some grammatical developments and
so on very peripheral things that can't
really established yet but i think
there's reasonable evidence word as to
the connection with rationalism there
this is a serious question of
interpretation I mean there is a
tradition going from Plato in to say
Cartesian rationalism and there are
continuities but there are also
differences one of the continuities has
to do with an eight ism plato was
concerned with very much the same
problem how how can it be that we know
so much when we have so little evidence
and for example in me know the Socratic
dialogue is essentially a way of teasing
out from the slave boy his innate
knowledge of geometry that's kind of
like a thought experiment trying to
demonstrate that the slave boy who had
never heard of geometry actually knew it
all and you know the experiment is more
or less accurate I mean that's what
would happen under those conditions
Plato then want an answer and his answer
was that it's in our souls and we
remember it from an earlier existence
okay that's that's not entirely false
it's in our genes actually and it comes
from previous existence in a sense that
answer and this problem then goes right
into the 17th century and for example
live nents argues that Plato's Furies
much must be correct there's no other
way to account for knowledge but as he
put it his theory has to be purged of
the air
reminiscence so somehow that was wrong
but he didn't have anything else to make
right it Cartesian rationalism is when
they pretty much the same I mean it's
basically in a you know the Cartesian
rationalists tried to for example the
ones who worked on language stay the
people in the universal grammar
tradition that in part grew out of this
tried their concept of universal grammar
is basically that which is in our souls
that which is there doesn't change and
so on and they develop you know not by
our standards but by the standards of
the time fairly rich theories of
universal grammar well this tradition
then continues through German
Romanticism them through the
Enlightenment that takes various forms
and then it sort of dies out in the
middle of the 19th century and really
wasn't picked up again until the middle
of 20th century with some scattered
exceptions well that's rash it wasn't
what about in under that interpretation
of rationalism this is a renewal of
rationalism however there are other
interpretations of rationalism you can
you know you can decide what you want to
look for in this tradition had a lot of
things in it one of the things that was
in it was an attempt to deduce all the
facts of the world from first principles
I mean Cartesian rationalism as well you
know you start with the Kobe toe and
then you keep going and end up with all
the facts about the world well obviously
this isn't rationalism in that sense so
it's a question which out of this rich
complex tradition which strands do you
pick out some strands that you can pick
out carry from Plato right through
classical rationalism into the
Enlightenment
then on to the modern period other ones
have been abandoned which were quite
central to them if you look in contrast
that the alternative major true to say
the empiricist tradition at least the
classical Imperial empiricist tradition
say Hume also was an ADA stood in
question that there was an awful lot of
innate structure just they thought it
was a different in eight structure so
human actually specified what he thought
it was it was principals Association and
similarity and an innate concept of
induction and remember after all Hume is
everybody knows you know he's remembered
for his paradoxes of induction but of
course he also gave an answer his answer
was that it's just animal instinct which
is what we would call in 8 so in human
psychology which comes modern psychology
in many ways the principles of
association by similarity and conduct
contiguity and so on and the principle
of simple induction are the innate
structure well that's just hopelessly
inadequate in fact if you look at the
contrast between Descartes and Hume were
maybe the two leading figures in these
to go manana century part but two
leading figures in this tradition
actually looked at some of the same
examples and drew opposite conclusions
and crucial examples so for example
Descartes asks the question rather like
play-doh he says suppose you presented a
forget the figure trying some
geometrical figures a triangle to a
child in infancy before the infant had
any experience he says the child would
perceive it as it as a triangle which of
course it isn't physically it's always
going to have a curve in the line and
only some distortion of a triangle but
the child will perceive it as a
distorted dry ankle not as a an exact
image of what it is I mean it's some
strange and describable figure if I draw
something in the blackboard it'll never
be a triangle but he says the the child
will perceive it as a triangle not which
which it isn't it's just resembles one
and he will not perceive it as what
is because that's too complex Hume
looked at the same example and concluded
that he mentioned it for him it was a
straight line but it's the same question
and he simply concluded reasonably from
his point of view that people have no
concept of a straight line and the
reason is because you can't tell the
difference between a line with a slight
curve and in a straight line so
therefore by his principles it follows
that you can't have a concept in a
straight line there's a direct
difference in predictions for Descartes
you have you have a concept of
geometrical figures because that's the
way your brain is your mind for him is
designed therefore a person will see
things in the world as modifications of
geometrical figures Hume on the other
hand even his principles of you need
structure has to conclude and is honest
enough to conclude that you just don't
have a concept of a straight line well
we know who was right about that in fact
even without the experiments was obvious
at the time that human psychology was
refuted by this fact whereas Cartesian
psychology was if not proven at least
vindicated by it unfortunately history
took the opp the other turn it was
assumed that Hume was right and the car
was wrong it's obviously the opposite
and it really wasn't until the modern
period that this that it's become
obvious to any perceptual psychologist
at least that of course the guard is
right I mean not that anybody thinks
about they card anymore but if you the
conclusion that is standard today is
that yes obviously the brain no longer
mine the brain is designed so as to
identify certain kinds of figures and
not others and in fact they're simple
ones like lines and angles and so on and
that's how we construct their picture of
the world but basically the Cartesian
its conception with without Cartesian
physiology and metaphysics and nobody
would take seriously humans proposal
that we don't have a concept of a
straight line of course we have a
concept of the straight line everybody
does well in this if through this strain
of the history
the modern work is rationalist but as I
say there are other ways of looking at
the history you can think other things
in it are important you can think for
proof of the existence of God is
important in that case this obviously
isn't rationals let's see there what do
you say I think the question is very
well responsibilities declination will
be between the inlet easement the
conception of the rational yeah okay
also in the sense of the rationalist in
the cartesian sending the risk of
another assume from the from the
beginning that the common sense
direction is the in general equality
with equal industry modular well that is
a point of view certainly in this domain
is true I mean you have to go to really
exotic levels of pathology before you
find deficiencies in the language
faculty for example if you take
something as some soup as severe as the
down that down syndrome mongoloid that a
yes okay which is pretty severe
disability genetic disability and the
act the achievements of the child get
there but they're not very great but the
language ability apparently develops
normally except some more slowly it's
going to slow down so they never get
them as any point and in fact there are
cases of children people with actually
they're not intelligent so low that it's
unmeasurable they can't do anything but
who have perfect language capacity so
that doesn't seem to be a significant
there are certainly differences in
people's ability to learn a second
language isn't that sort of thing but
these are minor phenomena for initial
language learning the thing that
everybody does naturally the differences
are you know more significant than the
difference is in how fast you grow some
children differ a little and
whether growth spurts are but they
basically grow the same way and that's
true here and that's essentially what
they cart is saying of course he's
saying it much more broadly he's saying
it for thinking generally and that seems
to be pretty plausible but you know when
you move away from areas that are well
understood you can only speculate like
it's not true that everybody's you know
equally confident to become a quantum
physicist but that's at the outer
fringes of human intelligence I mean
most of the problems to which human
intelligence is it that that don't as
far as I'm I those don't differ the
capacities don't differ in any
significant way across a very broad
spectrum so that picture seems
reasonable at least as a pretty good
first approximation in fact the card
itself pointed out that it's only first
approximation he says you can find
people who are incapable of doing things
the second question is that relation
you are contrary to a computational
system and there with negation are also
from the conception of the man as an
automaton that begins also in the 72
yeah that's it's the the debate in the
17th century has been started up again
in the 20th century without any you know
any memory of it the 17th century was in
fact from in part for the same reason I
mean in 17th century the automata you
know complicating clocks and things
we're getting to such a degree of
complexity that they people began to
wonder are humans more complex automata
and in in part Descartes thinking was
motivated by that not question and he
wanted to argue for both problem may be
partly for religious reasons but
certainly partly on scientific grounds
that it wasn't true and his if you look
at the carts actual philosophy not what
studied these two what study today is
usually some peripheral part of his
philosophy but for him what was
important was the physics and the
physiology and you know the theory of
vision and all this sort of thing and
the other stuff that we study is kind of
around the periphery where you argue
with other philosophers about it but he
argued that in fact most of the world
was an automaton as the notion was
understood and went on all the way
through the animal world they're all
in many interpretations assume that the
cut I think that the animals were I
thought then that's not a question I
mean it became a scandal at the court
because the you know the Cartesian would
go around taking some court ladies
favorite the dog you know stepping on it
because he can't hurt it I mean they
cart proved that just incompetent that
was one of the courts candles and the
period so yeah that's was they thought
this was demonstrated animals are
automata and then there comes a big
debate for hundreds of years about
whether animals are automata but they
cart argued that most almost everything
about humans is automata as well all the
way up the sensation I mean through
certainly human physiology but up to the
point where you get to sensation in fact
it wasn't it to it you get to higher
mental processes like language that he
thought he could prove that it wasn't
automata and what it ultimately comes
down to his various manifestations of
freedom of will which he said are
inconsistent with the notion of on
automata it's kind of uncaused behavior
but not random behavior language was his
major example and the descriptive
comments are correct it's as far as we
know so he then invokes mine second
substance Reese kogi thoughts to account
for this all of this is sort of normal
science so it's sketchy science we
didn't really feel anything in but it's
an outline of scientific reasoning large
parts of which remain quite viable in
fact so then the conclusion is well it
man's not an automaton because of these
probably these phenomena such as ability
to choose what you do you and quote in
girona some of these famous statements
of the minor cartesian who developed all
of this i mean their position was that
machines are compelled to act in a
certain way but humans are only incited
or inclined to act in a certain way and
they may act contrary to their
inclinations maybe choose to do so like
you can choose to put your hand in the
fire let's say
you're not going to do it whereas an
automatic can't if it's designed in a
certain way it has to do what it's
structured to do well then you know
comes Newton who showed that the world
is not an automaton which really shocked
people including Newton and after that
you get a big debate I mean the sort of
reasonable response to that is the idea
that mental phenomena including language
capacity are just some properties of
complex organized matter just as
attraction and repulsion are none of it
fits into Cartesian automatism I mean
Newton's major discovery in many ways
the one that disturbed him most was the
proof that Cartesian physics won't work
for terrestrial or planetary motion that
the world and planets and so on are not
on automata as the as the notion was
understood then or for that matter now
it's it required mystical properties
occult properties as he called them such
as universal gravitation I mean Newton
you know his letters he writes that
anybody has any understanding and
philosophical matters realizes that I
can't you can't influence something
without contacting like I can't raise my
hand and you know make that coffee move
I have to contact is that's obvious any
person was with a brain understands that
it just happens to be false he proved
that it was false and he was very
disturbed by it naturally well at this
point the men you know the automaton the
mine machine problem disappears the
world isn't a machine so obviously the
mind isn't a machine because even the
rest of the world and since you have
properties like action to distant and as
you go on through the sciences you just
have more and more exotic properties in
magnetic fields
quantum effects and curved space-time
and so on and so forth that was big
crisis period and how he going to react
to Newton's demonstration that what was
called the mechanical philosophy you
know the common sense understanding of
how things work in mechanical ways was
just not true and in fact physicists
didn't really give it up until into this
century there were always attempts to
find some mechanical explanation of
gravity I mean either or something
rather as to the the mind this this
conception that was enunciated but by
people like lemon tree for example but
the mind is just the structure of
organized matter it's the right idea but
it also lasts I mean it sort of
disappeared until was picked up again in
the 20th century well in the mid 20th
century people were again excited by
automata now it's computers and the same
debate started over again in different
terms of course but in fact the
Cartesian conclusions are not
unreasonable i mean if even if you take
contemporary computers instead of
complex clocks and so on it seems to me
the argument still hold this there's no
way in which complex computers can
manifest properties such as the ability
to choose would say the distinction
between computers are just as much
compelled as old-fashioned clocks were
and humans aren't apparently they're
only incited inclined so that gap
remains nobody wants to look at it but
the gap remains I think please I don't
think that computer the ad the coming of
computers hasn't really changed the
terms of this problem very much and in
fact the kinds of things that people try
to get computers to do are the
mechanical aspects of human behavior you
know like compute them say your play
chess let's say well played playing
chess can be reduced to a mechanism
and when a computer plays chess it
doesn't do it the way human does it
doesn't work out strategies and make
choices and so on it simply runs through
a mechanical procedure of trying out
tentative moves it uses its vast memory
and speed to explore in depth what would
happen if you made this move that moving
the other move and then it evaluates the
outcome by some measure that the
programmer through in and then it
automatically selects a move that's
nothing like what a human does even in a
what is intellectually speaking you know
Trivial Pursuit like chess trivial not
only do it easily but it's a very
trivial game you can describe it in pen
sentences you know so the problem
remains where it was that's I think it's
much bigger problem than others think it
is and i think that the cartesian all of
the basis for the cartesian argument
collapsed because the mechanical
philosophy collapsed the conclude the
essential logic still applies and modern
computer doesn't change things much the
debate that has now come along as
usually pursued in quite different terms
so the debate is over things like
whether a computer could really would
really be understanding language if it
duplicated human performance in response
to language well know that that's it I
don't even think that's an interesting
question because of course the computer
wouldn't understand language any more
than an airplane you can fly like an
eagle understanding language and the
rest of the intentional discourse about
thinking feeling and so on missus these
parents applied to humans nothing else
can do human brain can't understand
language doesn't make sense to say the
brain understands language anymore than
it makes sense to say the wings of an
eagle fly flying something the animal
does because the word mean but on the
other hand if the topic that's debated
say but you know sir all the rest of
them is actually has to do with what
could turn out to me mechanical
procedure it would be quite consistent
with Cartesian belief if there was an
algorithm that went from
hearing is hidden to giving an
appropriate response that may not
involve free choice so that asked so
they're really studying what could turn
out to be an automatism without even
touching Cartesian argument notice
nobody talks about the problem of the
speaker who produces new utterances
fitting to the occasion nobody tries to
duplicate that because would be probably
hopeless it's not even a conceivable
task what they study is the problem of
giving an appropriate response to a
certain input that's an input-output
problem which in theory could be could
be lock automatic whereas the problem of
action which has no input you don't even
know how to formulate that was exactly
the carts point so in many ways I don't
even think the discussion about machines
and automata is even reaching to the
levels of sophistication of the 17th
century debate hey just make a
confirmation yeah work thanks
working okay yes can't tell you how many
interviews I've had we're after three
hours the interview just forgot realize
the end push the button and have to be
once on the BBC I think this question is
disconnected with an a concept that you
use in a sense very different of the
common sense and the nation I remember
our discussion with football between a
new one of the topics workplaces the use
of the mode well the activity I think
you use creativity in a sense very
different from there are formal well I
but I made that very clear I mean
there's no real issue I what I said is
the these aspects of choice of
appropriate action I said its creativity
in a certain sense of course it's not
creativity with aesthetic value that's a
different sense of creativity so these
are just dermatological points actually
put the foot they first were discussing
this in any depth as far as i know was a
spanish philosopher in the 16th century
pre Cartesian one who are they what we
say yeah I don't know how much people
studying but he had very interesting
things to say about said the levels of
intelligent action they had three levels
and the second level of his is what I'm
talking about then he said it's the
third level which is true creativity in
platonic tradition he said that's when
you have an element of madness that's
the artist no but there's also in the
partying system there's a level of
creative action which is just normal
human behavior and that's beyond animals
and this is the what the cartesian are
talking about not aesthetic creativity
actually this all of these ideas enter
into aesthetic theory I mean if you look
into the aesthetic theory of the
Romantic period with a very much
influenced by
asian philosophy and people like
Schlegel Coleridge and so on the similar
ideas are quite you know consciously
they know the source are consciously
developed into an adapted to poetic
creation or musical creation and so on
how successfully one could argue but
anyway there is an attempt to develop
and the general concession before even
as the world phase one and form or to
approach them is also won the sciences
but it all right that's not clear what
it means I mean that in the Natural
Sciences one sort of works by a kind of
a hope that things will become unified
but they never have been I mean up to
the present day there are aspects even a
physical theory that are not unified I'm
gonna take gravity no still not unified
with weak forces people hope that
there'll be a unified theory of nature
but of course when they talk about
nature they're talking about a very
special part of it there's no there's no
rational reason to believe that things
like human thought and action belong to
the kind of nature that physicists are
talking about that's the Cartesian
problem again so sure everyone you know
kind of hopes somehow but there'll be a
more unified way of explaining things
the reason for that hope is just that
your hope for deeper understanding and
if the word the universe turns out to be
divided the separate realms you won't
have understanding of why those realms
differ or what their relation is so
naturally one hopes that there are no
limits to understanding or you know
actually some people might hope there
are limits an understanding and I can
see reasons for that too but within
science you kind of act on the working
hypothesis that you can always
understand more and say that you can
always understand more as to say that
you expect
a kind of unity of nature but every time
you link things up like you link biology
and chemistry you understand a little
more you understand things about them
biology you can understand before but
whether there are limits to this process
whether the world is in fact designed so
that this there is a unified account of
everything it's an open question and the
fact the idea that humans might be
capable of finding it even if it's there
is not at all obvious he says which are
there any connection between your
political beliefs and a new obsession of
mine well you know their various kinds
of possible connection as the logical
connection of course not I mean one
could have any political beliefs and you
need to be beliefs about language it
would be perfectly consistent as for a
sort of accidental historical connection
like my own personal case there's no
connection my political attitudes and
beliefs were formed long before I ever
heard linguistics when I was a young
teenager in fact you know changed since
but not gross greatly as for conceptual
connection it could be I mean there
might in fact if you go back to say the
Enlightenment
really yeah if you go back to the
Enlightenment period there was there
were attempts to drug the connections
between these fuses so in the case of
villa on humboldt who was bought both a
leading linguist and philosopher and
founder of the modern classical liberal
tradition libertarian thinker that he
did try to find connections he argued
that the at the heart of his political
conceptions is the desire to the need
and the the human need to inquire and
create free of external authority that
leads to libertarian thought and he at
the heart of his linguistic conceptions
was basically the Cartesian idea that
there's something about humans that
makes them part of their nature is to be
creative in this second level since that
is do new things for him even the higher
sense of ascetic creativity so his
argument was well they come from the
same source whatever it is that makes us
that makes us capable of indeterminent
human action appropriate indeterminate
human action also gives us the moral
right to be free of any external
Authority that's the connection and it's
not an unreasonable connection I don't
think that people have tried to Russo
has the same picture at about the same
time a similar picture you know and
after I haven't been able to find that
isn't there something like that in can't
you know of course can't what an
interesting language so couldn't show up
there but and after that I can't find
any further traces of it but it seems to
me a witch made just my lack of
knowledge of parts of the traditional
probably is but I in doesn't come back
again till the modern period and then
and I think you can raise the same
speculations it's not a proof of
anything
to its a conceptual similarity which may
imply an actual link or may not your
conception of the law of the resistance
against the law or the mini Stang off
the bow you need to use an access to
consciousness of tomorrow consciousness
it is the normal access to because I
think there is a connection between the
medium of information to normal which is
a manipulated by the right by the
location so what's the connection
between your moral consciousness and
your obedience to the law how is the way
how do we get more of consciousness
tomorrow consciousness nobody had any
idea I mean somehow we get it through a
combination of experience and intuition
and you know thinking about the problems
of others and so on in fact there's a
there's a definite broadening of moral
consciousness over the ages the things
that were considered entirely legitimate
you know 200 years ago or considered
Nazi like today for example if some
third-world country today were to
produce something like the US
Constitution which was a revolutionary
document at the time highly libertarian
if say you know some third-world country
today were to producing we call it a
reversion of Nazism I'm after you take a
look at the US Constitution and there's
a category of people who were kept and
described as three-fifths human no it's
like if you're a slave owner you get an
extra three-fifths of a vote for every
slave you have well I mean that's beyond
discussion today but it was quite at
keeping with the the attitudes at the
time in fact not like slavery but
genocide was considered perfectly
legitimate where I live and in
Massachusetts was you know no Indians
around because the Puritans just carried
on genocide and they considered that not
only moral but they thought it wasn't
there falling aware of God
and basically they were right I mean
they appeal to the Old Testament which
is probably the most genocide old book
in the whole literary canon and said
look we're doing what the Hebrews did
too i'm awake when we wipe out the
Pequots down to the last child you know
and disperse them to make sure that they
don't reproduce and so on so that that
was considered highly moral now genocide
was considered highly moral not just
tolerable and it's would be you have to
go pretty far to the limits to find
somebody saying that today well though
you call that for but the pretty for the
and then the same comes right up to the
present I mean questions about women's
rights for example we're not taking any
one year seriously 30 years ago as they
are today that's an expansion of moral
consciousness questions about animal
rights were unimaginable 20 years ago
but they're taken fairly seriously today
so for example there are now even laws
for treatment of laboratory animals
which were unheard of 20 years ago and
there are many people who think that you
shouldn't even at I mean vegetarianism
is an expansion of the moral
consciousness you know what are the
right expansions when to debate but that
the moral sphere has been expanded is
undoubted undoubtable and that's doable
and that means that we met the only
reasonable interpretation of that is
that over time this is over historical
period so it's not our personal
experience but over historical
experience and accumulated historical
experience and lots of struggle and
conflict the mount the era we get a kind
of access to our moral consciousness
that one didn't have in an earlier
period and there's no reason to think
that that process it's insane it's not a
process of linear marching forward by
any means so if you go back a hundred
years ago somebody like say Andrew
Carnegie the
the world's first billion-dollar
corporation at least publicly stated
that he believed that things like wage
labor room in human that's nice had
regarded socialism as the such an
obviously true ideal that if we ever
reach it with achieve the millennium
well you know his counterpart wouldn't
say that today the idea that wage
slavery is and it was quite common on
working people the many people who
fought in the Civil War you know sort of
ordinary working people the thought that
they were fighting to eliminate slavery
then became industrial workers in the
growing industrial system of the
post-civil war period it's quite common
at that time to say look we fought to
eliminate slavery we're just being made
slaves again by becoming tools of
production in the new industrial system
in which we have to follow the orders of
the Masters that's what we fought
against in the Civil War well that's I
think in here you know made different
interpretation but Mum in my opinion
that was a level of insight into our
moral nature that's been largely lost
the idea that renting yourself to others
in order to survive as an infringement
on your nature is something that was
commonly understood a century ago and is
barely in the sphere of cultured
awareness today he's weak
you're four different dimensions I have
the impression that you are absolutely
optimist about the future and the
sciences and you are very pessimistic
about evolution of the social life ah
well you know whether people feel
optimistic or not as a matter of their
personality it's me much you do the same
things whether you're optimistic or
pessimistic whether you think things are
going to work or it I've always regarded
as kind of a Pascal's wager if you don't
try to change things you can be sure
they're going to get worse if you do try
to change things maybe there's some
chance they'll be better maybe a small
chance so given those alternatives
there's no question what you do and how
optimistic or pessimistic yours
something you see I mean very often I've
been very I happen to be rather
pessimistic and often I've been wrong so
for example let's say and in the end of
China Vietnam War when I got started
really seriously active in trying to do
something I was absolutely certain that
there could never be in any war movement
I mean it this was in the early nineteen
sixty-three 1964 they're all you know
the u.s. edori been bombing South
Vietnam for a year or two there were
American troops there by then they're
probably about 150,000 people been
slaughtered in Vietnam nobody cared you
know nobody cared that the American Air
Force was going out on bombing missions
every day just blasting villages and
people wouldn't talk about it you know
you couldn't get them interested you
could get anybody a sign a petition I
mean it's a it was on a few people
didn't get started trying to do
something was with a sense of total
hopelessness and in fact it was quite a
few years before a substantial adding
were movement developed in places like
Boston for example which is you know one
of the more maybe the most liberal city
in the United States certainly one of
them we couldn't even have public
demonstrations against the war
until well into 1966 because they
typically be broken up by violence with
the support of the press radio and so on
and it certainly didn't seem at that
time that it was ever going to be in any
war movement but in fact I was totally
wrong they're not on he was in anti-war
movement but a you know kind of Cultural
Revolution which has lasting impact or
to take it contemporary well take that
when we mentioned a case that just
happened I've been working I guess
around 50 years or so now on the on the
issue of the Indonesian invasion of
these teamwork which is you know the
worst act of genocide since the
Holocaust and very significant for us
because the United States gave the
primary diplomatic and about ninety
percent of the military support for it
right through the Carter period while
Carter was spouting off about human
rights he was increasing the flow of
arms to Indonesia while they were
slaughtering theories and Europe the
only reason Europe didn't do more of it
is because they couldn't break the US
monopoly or ministers they were able to
they try every every country in Europe
that I know I was selling arms Indonesia
and contributing to the slaughtering of
the theories because they can make money
on it well you know you can't imagine
less popular topic than this nobody even
heard of it press refused to report it
refuse to report not didn't but refused
in fact it's not because they know about
it they knew but they didn't want it to
be known and so trying to get people
interested in this topic you know 10,000
miles away I mean no American troops was
did really seemed hopeless and there
were actually only about half a dozen
people working on a few of them
full-time I'm there several there's one
person in particular who just dropped
out of graduate school he was a
Southeast Asian specialist and has spent
his entire life since the mid-70s
working on this topic working with
churches and kicking people in Congress
and also you know and so on others like
me have been writing and speaking well
you know it finally got to the point
that to my I mean never imagined there'd
be any hope for this but to my amazement
just a couple of months ago there was
the US Congress cancelled a to Indonesia
on these groups military aid well it's a
symbolic act because you know Britain
and how long there may also be happy to
rush in and provide the military aid but
it's an important symbolic act for the
Indonesians it's a warning you know they
may not get away with this forever and
if something similar could happen and
say France or hollander you know any
other big military suppliers it would
make a big difference not you know
here's a case where maybe half a dozen
people at most ultimately succeeded in
doing something which you know could
save Lee could save hundreds of
thousands of lives not to speak of
allowing people freedom so you never
know do what you can last question he's
a personal question what do you study
why would not be studying all I didn't
stop actually I didn't as any of the
linguists around here I'll tell you I
have no professional qualifications in
the field first why don't know any
languages I mean I had the least
linguistic capacity of any human being I
ever saw which is why I can kill speak a
word of spanish also I never really
studied linguistics I mean the reason
there's a reason I'm teaching at MIT
which is a science and engineering
university when I got my PhD I didn't
have any qualifications in linguistics
no no university with a you know decent
self-respect with a fired me and
linguistic and in fact I didn't really
have any intention of staying in the
academic world but when the at MIT
because the scientific university
they're willing to play around with
strange ideas
head the head of electronics lab
happened to be intrigued so I went to an
electronics lab where I still am
actually I mean I don't know what tape
recorder from a telephone you know but
I've been in electronics lab for almost
40 years ago because I'm in fact
linguistics developed out of that but my
own background was extremely exotic it
was a little bit of this a little bit of
that mostly self-taught you know so it's
not a model for anything how many up to
today you know my students like he was a
student in ten times as much about
linguistics as I did and my students
always do nothing of literature I never
heard of all sorts of things oh I was
very glad you could kill her right there
thank you
puzzle
cool things Katya assets under this is
possible to it the D'Amico just a little
photos prefer read-only oh yes yes oh my
god of you know the sauce I want them to
know really what you think used to be
published I'm s really trivial one yeah
sure
okay yeah okay let me hold it so it
doesn't drink you'll be the first
question it would be what led you to
devote your life or parts of your life
to linguistics mostly accident like most
things that happen in life actually I
had more or less dropped out of college
by the time I was about 17 it was
terribly boring I didn't want to go on
and I was interested mostly politics and
I happened through political connections
to meet someone who was a acting rather
important sort of left a Batarian
thinker and he happens to be the
professor of linguistics at University
of Pennsylvania where I was nominally a
student like sort of I got friendly with
him and no through one thing led to
another I started taking courses I just
sort of got it but you know what
accident basically mm-hmm Haven is it
increasingly be what are the distinctive
features of the Chum scan way of doing
linguistics or what would you like non
linguist to know about linguistics as
you understand it well you know you
study what you can hope to understand
there are things you might like to
understand that you can't really study
so one of the most obvious fact about
language the fact it's immediately
obvious to us if we look at it is that
and has people have noticed through the
ages is that somehow people can
continually say new things but they've
never heard before maybe
never been said before they do it
effortless effortlessly they do it in
ways that are appropriate in the
situations where they are other people
hear them understand them immediately
and human interaction continues that way
so there are a lot of questions that can
be asked about that one question you can
ask about it is what are the mechanisms
that make it possible and a further
question you can ask is how do we
achieve this how do we gain those
mechanisms how do they develop in our
minds and with regard to the mechanisms
there's two choices I'm one is sort of
the technical mechanisms what are today
called the computational mechanisms and
the other is the question of how we use
these computational mechanisms to speak
appropriately and in novel ways and so
on and so forth only some of those
questions have been subject to a serious
inquiry the question of what the
computational mechanisms is is a lot
understood about that and it's given a
tremendous amount of insight into some
of the aspects it's one of the few areas
of higher human mental function where
there's some real understanding of how
the thing works as to the second
question how do these mechanisms develop
which is much more interesting one still
there there are also with pretty good
answers by now and they seem to be
demonstrating more and more that it
isn't learned it's just there it's part
of human nature as to the third question
of how we put these mechanisms to use in
human interchange how we do what you
would I are doing now let's say there's
I'm essentially nothing them and we
don't know how to study so the
ruff roughly speaking I think this the
let it delimits thee there are other
questions that one could ask for example
how are these mechanisms realized in the
brain that's a problem that could maybe
we'll come to be understood someday
right now it's not there are questions
about how this these capacities
developed in species nothing is known
about that and maybe nothing ever will
it's not even clear how to study sure
questions that have this capacity to the
species
ok now you often compare in your work
linguistics to physics or the chemistry
I would ask you how is linguistics
related to science well these aspects of
linguistics are just part of science and
by comparing them to chemistry and
physics I don't mean to suggest that
they either that they've achieved that
level of sophistication or that there
are direct connections just that it's a
methodological point we should study
these questions the way we study the
rest of the natural world and physics
chemistry and biology show how you
should study the natural world and in my
opinion when should study these
questions the same way whether all of
the study if there are many parts of the
study of language don't fall under the
sciences in any sense at all I mean a
part of cultural anthropology or some
other field as to these questions that
are always lurking on the horizon and
that we can't seem to approach like the
questions of language use it's not clear
whether they can be studied by the
methods of science which is after all
human science special human capacity
maybe some other intelligence organized
in a different way from ours could study
these problems I had another question
related to this as you do relate
linguistics to science
well the relation is really just
inclusion part of suds okay why don't
scientific journals include articles on
linguistics well depends what do you
mean by scientific journals I mean yeah
yeah if if you mean say nature the
reason is that the kind of there's also
you know there are lots and lots of
kinds of work that are never included in
those journals they they usually run
short articles reporting experimental
results and so on and so forth that's
not the nature of this field there are
many scientific fields that don't
publish in those journals because it's
not the nature of the field also that
there are other reasons I mean it's more
or less you know the the chances that
the contemporary results in physics or
biology will impinge on the work of
linguists is very small and conversely I
mean if some new discovery and
linguistics it's nothing much the
chemists can do with it so it doesn't
make much sense to use the same organs
publication though one might another
question is non generative linguists and
non linguistic very open
transformational grammar because it
changes so rapidly now could you explain
the reasons for these changes and do you
think non-jew notice where the reasons
and the changes well this is an
indication of the sharp break between
the sciences and the humanities all the
sciences change rapidly every time you
read a new issue of Physical Review
physical read the letters column it has
no indications of changes that are
happening any field that's alive is
changing this field is a young field so
it's just barely beginning to find its
way around if it stopped changing it
would I would advise everybody to drop
out of the field any field that stops
changing dead probably wasn't worth
studying in the first place now in the
humanities this is not understood they
it's regarded as important to keep
saying the same thing on your life that
you said when you were in graduate
school but in the science that such a
joke if you're teaching the same thing
you thought when you were in graduate
school you wasting your time you're in
the wrong field so and the reason why
things changes you learn more you know
you learn new things I mean new
phenomena come along that weren't
noticed before people have new ideas as
to how to improve the theory they they
think of reasons why the theories that
had been proposed in works modify them
that's scientific inquiry the changes
take place
well I mean the early work in generative
grammar I mean it tried it had two
different goals which were in conflict
one goal was to try to describe the
facts of each language accurately and in
order to do that and it apparently had
to write extremely complex systems of
rules because the phenomena of language
seemed very intricate and very and you
know every language looks different from
every other one and every part of each
language looks different from other
parts and so on this wasn't really
understood in traditional grammar but
that's because it never got to the stage
of writing rules they didn't not not an
ascent in the sense in which that's now
understood they only gave hints that
could be used by a person already new
language to make its own moves but when
you tried to spell out what it is that
people actually know it turned into
extraordinarily intricate rule systems
well the second question but the
question trying to explain how people
get this into their how they acquire
this knowledge that that the answer to
that question must be that most of it is
already there because it's impossible to
have enough experience to even pick up
at a fraction of these rules so it can't
be that the languages are as complex and
different different as they appear to be
and the effort to answer the question of
acquisition of language of the growth of
language in the mind had to lead you to
the belief that there's basically
there's very few options available
they're very few possibilities for
language and the child must settle on
those choices with very little evidence
because we know that that's all that
happened there is that's leading in
another direction try to claim that
things are very simple now that
resolving that tension over the years
has led to lots and lots of changes to
the point where today we're beginning to
understand how fixed principles that
don't change at all can yield a wide
variety of the phenomena of language
just by interacting slightly different
ways so it's as if you have a very
complex system and you change little
pieces of it here and there you may get
and it may do something quite different
change the way the wires are hooked up
in a few places the system may behave
quite differently radically different
and the task is to try to find that
initial wiring that and the points at
which the changes can be made and then
to demonstrate that the apparent
complexity and variety of language is
just an illusion due to our the
inability of a previous failure to
understand the simplicity of the
underlying structure and the ways in
which the few changes can be made and
there's been a lot of progress on that
every single one of those progresses is
changing steps as a change in theory
sometimes a radical change another
question is that people usually it is a
popular belief that the existence of
language is essentially for
communication
would see if you agree with that it's
hard to I don't agree or disagree I
don't know what it means biological
systems aren't for anything they're just
there I mean if a child grows an image
at the Embera for birth child grows arms
and legs it's not doing it because it
wants to walk in fact even if we look at
the evolutionary process it's extremely
hard to say what functions things were
for so the the wing of an insect let's
say developed as a device for
distributing heat from the insects body
turned out you can distribute heat
better if you had a little thing
sticking out that turned into a wing I'm
a human certainly use language is
language to communicate they use it for
a million other purposes they use it to
tell jokes they use it to establish
friendly relations with people when they
don't care about communication they
these are just to express their thoughts
you know there are all kinds of reasons
for using language and who knows what
what doesn't make any sense to ask what
the purpose is biological systems don't
come along with a purpose you know they
just grow and develop for some reason no
you just move your theory is just any
knowledge of language not know I would
like to be able to study use it just
doesn't seem to be within the realm of
study well if it nobody nobody knows how
i'm there a lot of interesting things
you can say about language juice but you
know a lot of interesting things you can
say about history or you know social
structure or something lots of
interesting things but nothing in the
level there's no theoretical
understanding in fact in general most of
the questions of real human significance
are out of the range of scientific
understanding at least for now maybe
forever and this use of knowledge that
well I just well you know I'm when
doesn't have to use it if they don't
want it doesn't matter but the point is
we have acquired a certain capacity of
capacity certain mental capacity that's
what people call knowledge we know a lot
I think a good deal of what is called
knowledge is just the change of parts of
the brain to particular states in which
information is stored so you know
knowledge of how to get from here to
girona it's probably stored somewhere in
your brain knowledge of what sentences
mean is stored somewhere in your brain
everyone agrees that you know children
or adults know that's it and so and so
means such and such and I want to know
how that knowledge is stored well seems
to be stored in a generative grammar and
then you want to find out what that is
so to emphasize knowledge of language is
to say I'm interested in topic I mean if
one is not interested in why this
sentence means such and such the next
one means so-and-so study something else
this is Gigi grandma didn't have
anything to do with a pie
mystics beautiful for
yeah well that's for people who you'd
make the applications to decide I mean
it's you know for throughout most of
modern history the sciences haven't been
useful for anything it wasn't really
until the 19th century that it became
important for an engineer to know
something about physics because physics
just didn't tell them very much they
knew the craftsmen craftsmen knew more
about how to do things than the
scientists do and it's really only
better you know last 150 years maybe
that you could find ways of using even
the advanced sciences for applications
in fields like and there's no you know
the theoreticians have nothing to say
about this topic you know if if people
who are applied were studying a
real-world topics like problems of
national language let's say our second
language teaching and so on if such
people find these ideas of value and use
than use them actually they all usually
do but that's a matter of trial and
error there's nothing that's nothing
principled about it I mean the problems
have applied anything are usually so
complex involve so many factors that you
don't know how much theoretical
understanding would contribute even had
it since
will be what how does the notion of
dialect into your theory is it to
distinguish it's not it doesn't have
anything to do with this theory I'm in
the decision about dialects and
languages is it a decision it's like it
if you had a group of people in a room
and you tried to decide which ones look
alike you could do that a lot of
different I mean you know they're there
might be able you might agree that they
in lining them up so that this one looks
most like this one and that one looks
most like this one and you get to the
end and someone at least look at least
like that one but if he started to try
to draw a boundary among the look-alikes
you could do in a lot of different ways
dialects or languages that look more or
less alike languages or groupings of
individual language that look less alike
than dialects but more alike than what
we call different languages I mean you
can take the whole romance area say you
know spanish catalan portuguese on and
in a sense they're all the same language
with just a little differences in fact
what's called chinese is a bunch of
languages which aren't even mutually
comprehensible it's different structural
properties in common these aren't very
meaningful questions actually I'm
they're very meaningful for human life I
just they're not scientifically
meaningful like who looks alike might be
important for human life to it's just
there's never going to be a science and
path it's mostly a matter of decision
can the knowledge of two languages as
inviting
which is something that we have we're
very open here required two languages in
parallel in tyrell you could let me
explained with a model of knowledge of
one language well if it can first of all
I mean again that's a more whether a
person is vile is multilingual or not as
more a matter of decision than of fact
in fact every child who grows up has
many different languages stored in their
head I mean because you hear people
speak differently in the your parents
speak differently from a teacher speak
differently from children the streets
and you go to the other side of town and
they speak still differently there those
differences are usually so small that we
don't call them differences but they're
there and if you look closely you find
that if you travel one or two blocks
away find people talk differently from
you dude I mean my brother and I for
example don't talk the same way because
we had slightly different influences in
our life and but I have no problem with
understanding him which means I must
have at least those two systems in the
head and in fact dozens or thousands who
knows how many we call it
multilingualism when the systems that
you have in your head are far enough
apart so that we're struck by the
differences we have to make some effort
to move up and back between them if
there's in many you know at least
certainly in pre-modern societies it was
absolutely standard for people to know
many such languages say go to West
Africa today and a child may grow up
knowing half a dozen different languages
which are really mutually unintelligible
because that's the way the society sars
it is very mixed and such children pick
up a whole bunch of different languages
in most modern societies differences
among people have been leveled either by
force and conquest or by you know
expansion of a national culture and by
these days even by state television you
know so that you get an illusion of
homogeneity of language which wasn't
true in an earlier period I'm needed in
Europe you don't have to go back very
far wouldn't you go back to the
beginning of the century let's say
people couldn't understand someone from
the next village because they were
talking some it's probably still true in
places like you know italy pleased i
don't know if it isn't Spain but you get
that kind of linguistic diversity you
get that kind of linguistic diversity in
Spain that you haven't say in Italy of
real mutual unintelligible ya know yes
but in LA but in face of France let's
say you would at the beginning of this
century you could find people in nearby
villages who are speaking weather for
all practical purposes different
languages now all of that stuff has been
leveled largely leveled definitely at
least in this generation it's mostly
leveled in Europe although still you
know a person from North Germany and
from South Germany may have very hard
time understanding each other if there's
ever going to be any understand any
comprehension of how multum you know the
assimilation of many languages develops
in the brain it will doubtless be
through some further application of the
understanding of how a single language
might what we'll need to know is in
addition to the question how single
language develops we'll have to know how
interactions are constructed between
these single languages and developed so
that's just a further complication of
the problem of acquisition a single
language with other factors through
teaching elementary high school so that
it's their obvious things to go over
ready to language like Lotus will arrive
wait and maybe fine language that one
would expect that
the same way that it's interesting that
people know things about the world
physics biology that the things about
language should also be talking that
yeah down yeah I mean you know after all
language is a very important fact about
our lives what about our nature and if
it's important to understand something
about how birds behave or how rocks
behave or how planets behave it ought to
be an important to understand how humans
behave and this is one of the few areas
where we have at least some insight into
what are distinctively human capacities
aren't many such cases so but that
that's men are studying about what's
understood about language different from
studying language itself definition that
I would ask you or to make things clear
for some people the definition grammar
grammar prescriptive grandma how does it
doesn't you I mean prescriptive grammar
is just a formal Authority it's like
etiquette you know you tell people that
they should put their fork on the left
or they should wear a tie when they give
a talk or something like that I mean
it's basically nothing you know it's a
matter of how to zazz no theoretical
interest again it may have human
interest like maybe you want to try
maybe you should even teach it I mean
maybe it's worth teaching children some
kind of usually artificial literary
standard for whatever reasons I'm
practical reason but this nothing of any
theoretical interest to say about it any
more than there is about styles of dress
now you probably want to teach children
styles of dress to the belief is that
when someone knows a language
norms of the language well that's what
people tend to think because people well
I mean but they should understand they
should understand that every person has
a perfect knowledge of their own
language by definition now whether you
decide to follow norms that someone in
authority tells you to follow our up to
you to decide but there's there's no
abstract right or wrong about it's a
matter of whether you want to choose to
defer to authority sometimes it's worth
deferring to authority like it makes
more sense to drive on the right than on
the left because you'll survive that's
deferring to authority and sometimes it
may be useful to follow some rule that
some somebody made up for some arbitrary
reason that's followed informal and then
the you know literary canon okay maybe
it is maybe it isn't but it's basically
a quest it's the same kind of question
it's a question of whether to accept
usually artificial norms that have been
designed for whatever purpose they have
no status other than the status that
people agree to give to them there's
nothing right or wrong about driving on
the right okay it's just you know
there's a law that says drive on the
right and life is better in that case of
everybody follows the law so you follow
it in other cases like norms of grammar
it's almost totally arbitrary it's like
what you should wear a tie you know you
can decide to do it because it's easier
to get by in the world or whatever but
there's nothing of any significance
about it
thank you
