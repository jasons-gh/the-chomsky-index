some changes were made in the
legislature to legislation to make
stutter penalties for things like
distribution of hate literature in
response to an increased perception of
groups like the Aryan Nation and the and
the Heritage front and well it's it's
definitely important to preserve free
speech freedom of speech it is also
clear that the increased activity of
such groups also needs to be addressed
as well
and I'm wondering what thoughts you
might have about what means could be
done so apart from trying to make
stricter penalties for distribution of
hate literature well I'm against it I
don't think the state should have the
power to decide what people think and
say I don't want this paper that's that
power and I think it's bad to have
people running around with hate
literature but the way to do it is not
to give power to some more dangerous
entity like the state the what you have
to do is meet them on you don't get to
the people that they're reaching right
they are reaching people who are
susceptible to this literature why well
for reasons the kind I mentioned let's
take the people who have been subjected
for the social policies that we all know
in which we just alluded to yeah they're
going to be frightened angry they're
going to search for somebody to blame it
on they're gonna be easy targets for
hate literature just as they were under
the Nazis well the way to deal with that
was not to outlaw a mine comp that
wouldn't change the thing it was to deal
with the sources in the Society for what
Hitler was appealing to and the same is
true here incidentally if you're worried
about talks that harms people picking
out hate literature is a very odd choice
yes that harms people but free-market
ideology harms them way more
if you think if you want know people who
are really suffering you know let's
who's really suffering from the kind of
IMF fundamentalism which is mostly phony
but it's true that it's a dominant
ideology at least among a please well
you know go to you know Africa or Latin
America of course lumps in the United
States and you'll find people suffering
mostly women incidentally and suffering
miserably like mortality rates for women
and infants have gone way up
okay hate literature hasn't done that if
you're worried about harming people
there are much more of these candidates
and the answer to this is not to have
the state powerful enough to stop people
from talking about this stuff that's not
the answer
