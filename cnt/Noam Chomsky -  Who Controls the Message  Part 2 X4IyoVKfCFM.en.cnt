here at link have a great holiday season
thank you what do you make of the fact
that the debate in officialdom over
Afghanistan now seems to be either let's
turn it into another Vietnam let's keep
pouring troops in for one strategic goal
or another or let's pull back to the Joe
Biden solution which is basically
airborne death squads sending the
Predators will find out where they are
maybe we'll know maybe we won't there'll
be a lot of collateral damage but at
least our boys and girls won't be in
danger and those seem to be the
permissible contours in Washington of
the debate massive military intervention
with consequent great loss of life or
surgical as they say military
intervention with less loss of life on
the side of the intervenors but probably
equal or greater loss of life on the
part of the subject population again
that's that's correct but I'm not
suggesting that there has been a shift
in elite attitudes there's been a shift
in popular attitudes so and when they
talk about massive intervention
if I didn't begin to compare with
Vietnam I'm they're talking about maybe
a hundred thousand people by 1965 when
protests started they were talking about
hundreds of thousands at plus you know
fifty seventy thousand mercenaries and
so on so yes those are the parameters of
debate and it's our fault that those are
the parameters for example we ought to
be pointing out that there's a
fundamental problem in the debate in
Washington the relevant voices aren't
even being heard I mean these decisions
should be made by Afghans we don't any
right to make a decision is between the
Biden and McChrystal it sir and this
interesting oddly Sunday's New York
Times had a full page of what should we
do about Afghanistan ten different
opinions not a single one of which was
by an Afghani person yeah and they you
know they have voices and for example is
an Afghan peace movement pretty
significant one you can find out about
it but you're not going to read about it
here they have spokespersons quite
eloquent ones some of them pretty
impressive the most impressive that I
know is a woman named Malalai Joya who's
a remarkable woman she's survived
somehow miraculously struggling against
the Russians against the Reagan's favor
at the murderers warlords who took over
and we're so outrageous that the
population welcomed the Taliban she
struggled against them struggling
against the return of the Warlord's
which is essentially the current
government got elected parliament with a
lot of support I was quickly thrown out
because she denounced the warlords who
dominate the government living
underground protected but she speaks
written a book on this interesting she
gives talks and her proposal which is
that of the Afghan peace movement and
maybe that of for all we know the large
majority of Afghans
nobody looks it's kind of supported more
or less by the polls that are taken but
her position is Afghanistan needs an
invasion an invasion of schools
hospitals roads not an invasion of guns
and tanks Afghans will if given a chance
will work at the problems we don't want
we're subject to an assault from the
Taliban from the Warlord's and from the
occupying army and we want to get out of
that attack and we've have to work it
out ourselves so help us but not this
way but that voice is not part of the
debate to take some of our questions
from the audience here at the
commonwealth club tonight question asks
can movements like the green alternative
energy movement make a true difference
in the world if population continues to
grow and how can we globally ever come
to an agreement to stop population
growth if that's deemed necessary
there's a lot understood I mentioned
before not too much is known about human
affairs but something is understood
about population growth there are
basically two ways to retard it one way
is the Chinese way by force you know and
it's because I'm plenty of problems
quite apart from the brutality of it the
other way to solve it is educate women
there's very good evidence that as
education of women increases a
population declines fertility declines
and levels and sometimes even literally
declines there's some remarkable
examples so it takes a India they're one
of the poorer provinces in india kerala
in the south it happens who have a very
enlightened government since
independence we're not allowed to say it
here but it was a communist led
government so forget that you're allowed
here it's not well but it was pretty
enlighten government in fact when
Congress came in that the fella pretty
much the same policies
literacy is extremely high there's
education of women and fertility has
leveled and declined unlike the rest of
India and it's happening in Europe
what's happening in Japan it's happening
everywhere if women have options and
choices I wish they don't have in most
of the world then yes population levels
in fact in Europe and Japan is even
declining the so there are two methods
to deal with the populate with excessive
population growth and I think it's
pretty obvious which one we should
pursuing so I don't see that as the
major problem the ecological /
environmental problems are enormous
grotesque in fact if the species
succeeds in destroying itself as it may
it will be either from nuclear weapons
or from destruction of the environment
and in both cases in the case of the
environmental threats again there are
two tendencies in opposite directions so
compare it again with the 60s virtually
no concern there was environmental
movement almost nothing now it's a very
substantial movement it's a substantial
popular movement pressing pretty hard on
green alternatives cutting down energy
waste and so on but this counter
tendency as there always is the business
world so just recently within the last
few weeks the American Petroleum
Institute and the Chamber of Commerce
the biggest business lobby and others
Anna announced you can read in the press
that they're inspired by the example of
the health insurers who months ago knew
that they had one
frontpage cover business week in August
health insurers of one we got it they
had a terrific technique which
essentially killed the possibility of
desperately needed health reform they
know it's going to tank the economy but
that's somewhere in the future the
personal consequences they don't care
about you know that ever again not not
that the bad people desert it's this way
the institution's work well the
Petroleum Institute Chamber of Commerce
say we're going to follow that model and
try to make sure that no serious energy
environmental bills are passed by
Congress now there was an interesting
split in the chamber of commerce some
energy corporations pulled out and say
we're not going to cooperate with this
you look at who they were they're the
ones who produce nuclear energy so
they'd like to have you no tax on fossil
fuel use then they can make more money
they'll kill us some other way you know
but and again let me it's important to
stress that this these are not bad
people they're perfectly good people
just like anyone else but they are
working within an institutional
framework which requires certain choices
if you don't make those choices you're
out so the institutions require
infecting the law requires it you have
to be committed to maximizing profit and
growth in the short term that's
amplified by perverse incentives like
the too-big-to-fail government insurance
policy which is now even bigger than it
was before thanks to the bank bailout
and the way the money was distributed
and other perversions like you know
incentives like tying CEO pay to
short-term gain and other structures
like that let me ask you about another
incentive the peak oil incentive you're
certainly familiar with that theory if
it happens and you can tell us if you
believe it's happening or is going to
happen
do you believe that it fatally in
dangers democracy and would move us
inevitably towards nationalist or
fascist policies this is a question from
the audience well you know my own
feeling I'm a peak oil will come sooner
or later of course finite resource but
it's a complex notion I mean the real
question is not how much oil is
underground but how much can be
extracted at a economically feasible
price now it's it's pushing the limits
now oil extraction is more and more
costly and more and more environmentally
dangerous because you're going after
sources that are harder to use at some
point it will become impossible to
continue but nobody knows how far that
point is however from another point of
view it's we're probably better off if
peak oil comes sooner because that will
reduce the use of fossil fuels and help
preserve environment for our
grandchildren to live in so and business
knows this I mean takes a The Wall
Street Journal they've been the leading
deniers of global warming you read the
editorial pages it's makes Rush Limbaugh
look like a moderate but a couple of a
couple of weeks ago they ran a
supplement on the environment which took
a very strong stand on the need for
radical measures to try to sustain the
environment if I could even call for geo
engineering they said that the measures
being considered in Washington aren't
enough well you know that's a reason for
that I mean these are after all the
people who own the world they don't want
their possession destroyed so they have
mixed motives too but it's the
populations gonna have to drive this and
in that respect there has been a pretty
substantial progress in the last 30 40
years speaking of something the
population is going to have to drive I'm
going to
change topics with another question from
the audience here this question from the
audience Noam Chomsky is do you think
that taking money out of politics fair
election clean money campaigns is first
of all possible in this country and
second of all would it be effective in
solving many of our political problems
in the United States I think it wouldn't
be easy because there are a lot of ways
to get around any regulations but it
would be possible however and it would
certainly have a good effect I mean the
campaign funding is a remarkably good
predictor of election and also of policy
in pretty well predict policies by
looking at where the campaign funding
comes from there's good political
science work on this Thomas Ferguson
very fine political economist has done
extremely good work on this and it's
convincing and in fact we see it right
in front of us all the time so the rate
of election of incumbents is
overwhelming it's like 98 99 percent
this is happening at the same time that
public attitudes towards approval of
Congress is in the low teens but they
are out spending their opponents so okay
they get elected you know if people
don't like him or just take the last
election 2008 I'm at the core of Obama's
funding was financial institutions they
preferred him to McCain they thought
he'd serve them better and it's turning
out it's probably true you can almost
read off the policies of the
administration from looking at the
concentrated campaign funding financial
institutions are doing marvelously so
yes taking money out of politics would
be a good idea very good it's not going
to solve all our problems that much
deeper than that but it would be
substantial would be hard because
they're all kind of ways to get around
it but it's an important topic and here
tendencies are going in the wrong
direction right now the Supreme Court is
considering a suit which
not what it amounts to is eat allow if
they if they approve if they change the
laws early will it means that
corporations can buy elections directly
instead of indirectly so that they don't
put it that way but you think through it
that's what it amounts to so that's what
the Supreme Court is doing and there's
something kind of surreal going on
because at the very same time at the
logic of this for the Supreme Court is
that corporations are persons they have
personal rights so therefore the right
of free speech that was in fact a gift
to the corporate world by the courts
about a century ago conservatives who
used to exist the name does not the
category bitterly condemned it they
called it a form of communism a return
to feudalism and so on but they got it
and by now they have rights way beyond
persons so because they have rights of
persons they have the right of free
speech so therefore they can buy
elections directly at the same time
Congress is there's a competition going
on in Congress between the Democrats and
Republicans to see who can be more
brutal in denying health care to
undocumented aliens and there's a legal
argument behind that too they're not
persons under the law the courts have
shaped American law so that if you're an
undocumented alien you're not a person
you don't have personal rights so on the
one hand the corporate entities are have
rights of persons and have to be allowed
to buy elections directly on the other
hand undocumented aliens on whose backs
a lot of the economy rides they're not
persons and therefore we the Democrats
and Republicans have to show that we're
more savage than the opposition in
denying them health care we shouldn't be
allowing this to happen before our eyes
I mean the facts are there but they're
not being discussed there's no they're
not being addressed and that's another
serious
lack of people who care about living in
a civilized community well we've reached
the point in our program where we have
time for only one last question from our
audience will kind of come back to where
we were at the beginning of this
discussion with noam chomsky what answer
would you give to the frustrated
hard-working people as you describe them
attracted by the narrative of the right
that you listened to brave you on am
talk radio well take the fact that their
incomes have stagnated for 30 years
their benefits decline work hours are
going up and so on then well supposedly
say that's because the government's
giving all it's not so we should be
giving the right answer immigrants the
right answer is that has to do with the
reconstruction of the economy that took
place in the 1970s which shifted us from
a high-growth relatively egalitarian
economy the 50s and 60s to a financial
up to and what's called a neoliberal
economy with a vast growth of financial
institutions evisceration of productive
capacity shifting it abroad works more
profitable and yeah this has lots of
predictable effects one of them is the
financial crisis crises that happen
periodically the growth of the financial
institutions is phenomenal and that
doesn't help people it's say in 1970 was
maybe three percent of gross domestic
product and now it's well over thirty
percent well you know that it's great
for Goldman Sachs and so on it's not
great for these people who are concerned
that their lives are falling apart which
tell them that we should tell them that
the heroes that there is a massive
business run corporate program its scale
is astonishing it's been pretty well
studied goes back to the 1950s it was
designed as I said before to make people
hate and fear government banana there's
a little secret behind it the people are
running the campaign will love
government
and they want it to be powerful and
interventionist but in their interest
but what people are told is supposed to
hate government so take for example
April fifteenth okay when April
fifteenth comes along in the comparable
date and a functioning democracy people
would be applauding I say okay this is
the day in which we get together and
provide the resources for the programs
that we have decided on what could be
better than that in the United States
thanks to massive propaganda you're
supposed to hate April fifteenth because
that's the day when some alien force you
know like from Mars is coming down here
and stealing your hard-earned money well
that's a real triumph in undermining and
destroying the fundamental basis of
democracy and for elite opinion for
business yeah that makes sense they
don't like democracy elites never do
well that's our failure to have
permitted this to happen well let me
also put in a word for media literacy
here because along with the developments
you're talking about came deregulation
of ownership so radio and television
stations and abolition of the Fairness
Doctrine so that radio and television no
longer added to override any balance in
their discussion of public issues and
the rise of the talk radio fanatics that
have distorted public debate in this
country and television of course an
entire network you're right you're right
i think it's very important but I again
I think we should be asking questions
about ourselves why don't we exploit
this situation make use of it reach
these people with you know a sensible
message that can lead them in us to
better lives and a more democratic
society well got to do that this trend
amount of activism in the country I
suspect that if you can't know to count
noses more than in the 60s but it's a
very atomized isolated society people in
one corner of town don't know what's
happening in the other corner of town
they're separate agendas the
sectarianism you know we got a verra way
you can
your way the success in atomizing the
society has been enormous this winter
net played into that the internet and I
think has a complicated effect and it
does separate people because you're not
we're one thing about human beings is
face-to-face communication means
something communicating through you know
a text message doesn't have that meaning
so it does separate people and in fact
it contributes to the ideal of the
business world which is a society in
which the elementary the the atoms are a
dyad you and the tube but no
communication other than that that's
tremendous technique of control so it
has that effect on the other hand it's
the you know it is the tool for all the
organizing and activists to act the
efforts that go on and also for
education so it's you know the internet
really is like a lot of Technology it's
fundamentally neutral depends who's
using it and for what purpose and how
class stratified do you think it will
continue to be do you see any tendencies
towards greater participation people
having more access to that technology no
there's more access but more access
alone doesn't help you if the access
that you have leads to you no more to a
huge range of choices where you have no
framework or structure to decide what
makes sense then it's negative if
there's more access that's guided and
directed by the kind of understanding
and comprehension that can really only
come out of cooperative efforts and
education which is a cooperative effort
if it's serious yeah that kind of access
makes sense that's very much like the
sciences I suppose you're say abay
ologist say the women have just won the
Nobel Prize she didn't become a great
biologist by reading everything in the
biology journalist
or to cut randomly picking out things
that appeared in the biology journals
and that's it will destroy it as she
became a good biologist by having an
understanding of what to look for having
a framework of comprehension and insight
that comes out of cooperative activities
science is a cooperative activity but
you know this occasional people work in
their own but mostly it's highly
interactive and Italy at best not always
it does lead to understanding
interchange communication improvement of
your thinking directing it better and
you out of that comes a way to kind of
wade through the huge mass of
information there and find out what's
significant but if all you are trained
to care about is your belief system
uninstructed by anything other than
tradition you're in a different
framework that's very bad and if what
you're trained for from childhood is to
pass the next test it's worse destroys
your thinking there's a name for that
it's called No Child Left Behind and
then a little truth which really means
every child left behind if that's every
one of us is you know we mostly go into
good schools and so on I'm sure you have
the same experience I've had you you had
to pass an exam maybe the SATs or
whatever it is so you studied like a
maniac you pass the exam you forget
everything the next day because that's
not the way to learn anything I was
talking to a teacher the other day
actually while I was here who were like
most teachers very much opposed to all
of this she was describing she has
daughter in the schools I forget what
grade but she was telling me that her
daughter is in a class where they were
studying the Constitution and the
teacher said meant told the class or
maybe the book told them that Georgia
didn't participate in the Constitutional
Convention and her daughter came home
and told her said you know I was curious
I want to know why so I asked the
teacher why didn't George a joint and
the teachers answered
we North time for that we've got to get
to the next point so we will pass the
test speaking of not having time are
thanks very much to dr. Noam Chomsky

on link TV you've got an economy now
where people are working two jobs there
can be home to just barely have enough
time to kiss their kids put their feet
up and what's on television is Bill
O'Reilly it's upon any of us and
particularly our administration and the
media to to force each other into a
higher responsibility amakhosi is no
democracy without participation I think
we're on the wrong track and I think
unless we rethink this very very
carefully we could raise the stakes
investor Marc OHS reputation in a
greater way as well as our treasure and
wind up pursuing a policy that is
frankly unperson unachievable any more
troops to afghanistan unfortunate only
resulted in more dead American soldiers
and more debt Afghans you need to learn

could not contain the Afghan resistance

we found at people's grocery in 2002
what we understood was that food is a
critical component to everyone's life it
is both simultaneously intimate and
universal to everyone initially our goal
is to create a grocery store for the
community of west oakland
it's a community of approximately 30,000
residents there's no grocery store at
this time for this community in contrast
there's about fifty three liquor stores
where many residents do the bulk of
their food by our fundamental mission is
to create a local food system that
supports the health and the economy of
the west oakland community and benefit
those who have often been left out of it
mainly low-income people people of color
who are faced with some of the most
severe conditions around chronic disease
related to diet so people's grocery is
really an effort to ensure that a
perspective of social justice of social
equity is really at the forefront what
we call food justice which is really the
principle that all people regardless of
economic and social constraints I should
have access to the best foods available
in our society today in 2008 we have the
highest level of hunger that the United
States has experienced approximately 35
million people are vulnerable to hunger
every single day in this country that is
largely consequence of economic
disparities both in terms of income but
also in terms of how the food system has
been structured to become a a mechanism
for wealth creation for those who
control the means of production
what we're seeing now is incredible
detriments to local economies throughout
this country in which large chain
big-box stores and come in and
practically destroyed what we call the
Old Main Street and one of the most of
your consequences as bad as communities
like what so clean that do not have big
boxes and and in which historically the
mom-and-pop businesses were out competed
by big boxes and had to close their
doors is that we don't have food retail
here anymore with the exception of
liquor stores and fast-food restaurants
yet we believe that through food through
the culture and the connection that food
can bring to land to traditions of
Agriculture to sustainable organic
methods of growing in particular there
is an opportunity to begin to regenerate
those relationships to nature so that
urban consumers can again become
connected with the environment and be a
part of the solution for creating a more
sustainable world it's not just the food
it's actually improving the health and
economic of West Oakland you know and
having more jobs more market really well
paying jobs more businesses local
businesses that sort of things are that
big the wealth stays within the
communities in it doesn't just go out
into the corporations you know that
maybe are there the businesses that are
there that don't keep the money
circulated within the community people's
your shoes organized sort of into three
spheres of activities and programs that
interrelates with each other to begin to
form a local food system some of these
basic programs include our our adult
cooking class for example in which we
bring adults from the west oakland
community together for six weeks at a
time to focus on unhealthy cooking to to
kind of break some of the the barriers
of knowledge or meth around how to
prepare healthy foods how to prepare
fresh foods and it's it's an astounding
experience where people are coming
together not only to learn about how to
cook healthy foods order Whole Foods
winter fresh foods but to really come
together in terms of community to jabon
to celebrate to build relationships
through this way of sharing and talking
about food
another sphere of our organization is
our urban agriculture program it's a
it's a mix of gardens and a farm we have
three community gardens here in West
Oakland and a farm in sunol which is in
the south part of Alameda County so I'm
so come and sign up so you what's going
on this garden is part of a larger
project to educate the community about
using our resources here in the urban
areas local researchers at local
resources that we have to meet our needs
are fuuny so it really brings in just
issues of food security and having
access to food and really reducing our
footprint by by being able to grow this
food locally and I really feel like food
security and having access to food is
our basic me for everybody
this is a the sonomak park is what it's
being called we have two acres that
we're leasing and the idea is that we
want to reconnect people with with where
their food comes from and so local dude
is part of that less fossil fuels are
being used to get the food to the people
and a lot of the farms that are within a
hundred fifty miles that are brought
into a local food system are organic so
we don't use pesticides you know with we
we really are trying to take care of the
earth take care of the plan so the farm
produces a variety of produce seasonal
produce that is distributed to the to
the community are here in West Oakland
primarily through a program a produce
box distribution program which is
happening here behind me which is a way
of bringing fresh foods to residents who
traditions don't have access to them
because fundamental to this community is
finding a way to increase consumption of
frets fruits and vegetables many
residents are relying on heavily
processed foods and packaged foods and
have very little fresh fruit in their
diets
I'm also very excited about the notion
of sort of creating new models for our
future worlds the opportunity to sort of
change the direction of the chorus of
what we have assumed to be given to us
meaning that these economic constructs
are these market assumptions or what is
celebrated or prioritized in our society
can actually be redefined and what we've
found in just a few years of doing the
work is that even people like us who are
just regular residents you don't have
power we don't have wealth you don't
have a great degree of sophistication we
can make really meaningful change to
ignite and inspire a vision of what is
possible in a different way and you
never know where those seeds really are
that will in 50 or 100 years from now
I'll become the way of life

industrial progress and economic growth
was fired by what money seemed to look
on as endless energy oil is finite
natural gas is finite coal uranium so
there's going to be a peak for all of
these and peak oil is just the beginning
right now we're consuming about five
barrels of oil for every one that we
discover I don't see that countries who
depend largely on imported oil are
thinking about alternative sources of
energy we're flying blind and so we need
examples so what's the best way to do it
what's what's not so good and Cuba has
already undergone a kind of energy
famine from America's tiny neighbor to
the south get a revolutionising look and
like with less oil don't miss the power
of community how Cuba survive peak oil
