I mean the US is one of the leading
terrorist states in the world the guys
who were in charge right now we're all
condemned for terrorism by the World
Court would have been condemned by the
Security Council except that they vetoed
the resolution with Britain abstaining
of course so you know these guys can't
be conducting war on terror that's just
out of the question and we know what
they did during the first phase they did
declare a war on terror 20 years ago and
we know if they did they'd destroyed
Central America they killed a man and a
half people in southern Africa they you
know go through the list okay so there's
no war on terror there's there was a
terrorist act number 11 you know very
unusual I mean real historic event first
time in history that the West was
attacked
received the kind of attack that it
carries out routinely in the rest of the
world which is a historical event and
you know naturally the West is upset
it's only we're supposed to do it to
others then I'm supposed to do it the
eyes and it was September 11th was a did
change policy undoubtedly not just for
the US across the board on every
government in the world saw it as an
opportunity to intensify their own
repression atrocities of whatever level
they were you know ranging from Russia
and Chechnya to in the West imposing
more discipline on their populations and
so on every every choice in between and
it had big effect so for example takes
Iraq going to that prior to September
11th there's a long-standing concern of
the US and I'll skip it's kind of a
pillar of the u.s. to on Iraq and that
is got the second largest oil reserves
in the world so one way or another
they're gonna do something to get it
back that's clear September 11th gave
the pretext so there's an Aeschylus
change in the rhetoric concerning Iraq
after September 11th it we now have an
excuse to go ahead
do what we're planning and it kind of
stayed like that up until September of
this year
in September of this year Iraq suddenly
shifted from something we're going to
take care of to an imminent threat to
our existence okay so September is early
September Condoleezza Rice came out with
her warning about the next evidence
about a nuclear weapon will be a
mushroom cloud and presumably in New
York and a big media campaign and five
political figures about destroy set out
very quickly this winter you know
because otherwise we'll all be dead and
it takes a lot of discipline you got to
kind of admire the intellectual classes
not to notice that the only people in
the world who are afraid of Saddam
Hussein or Americans I mean everybody
hates him you know and and Iraqis are
undoubtedly afraid of them but outside
of Iraq in the United States know he's
afraid of like not quakes not Iran you
know not Israel
nobody Europe and Hayden but they're not
afraid of the United States people are
very much afraid there's no question
about it
and the support that you see in polls
about the war is very thin it's based on
fear and it's an old story in the United
States I mean when my kids were in
elementary school of 40 years ago they
were literally this is not an
exaggeration they were taught to hide
under desks in case of an atom bomb
attack that's I'm not kidding and the
country is always in fear of everything
that's good crime for example I mean
crime in the United States is roughly
like other industrial societies kind of
little toward the high end of the
spectrum but not often on the other hand
fear of crime is way beyond the other
industrial
societies that's why I have 10 times as
many people in jail as comparable
countries and it's engendered you know
it's very consciously engendered there's
good academic studies of it by
politicians by in media and so on the
country is in constant fear role of time
these guys now in office remember
they're often almost entirely from the
1980s they've been through it already
and they know exactly how to play the
game right through the 1980s they
periodically had a campaign to terrify
the population twenty years ago it was
Libyan hitmen you know running roaming
the streets of Washington killing our
leader and stuff then it was a grenade a
Russian Air Base happen to be built by
the British but that was not noticed you
know Russians are putting up an airbase
and they're gonna bomb Thomas from
Grenada Sandinistas or two days marching
time from Harley and Texas probably
remember that national emergency called
the tourism industry and Europe
collapsed every couple of years because
Americans were afraid to travel to Paris
because might be an Arab hiding behind a
telephone booth or something other and
it just went on like that and the
country's in constant fear
so to arouse fear is not that hard the
timing was so obviously for the
congressional campaign that even
political commentators couldn't miss it
and yeah and they're gonna need to do it
now because they're gonna fdle for
domestic political reasons I mean
they've got it the presidential campaign
is gonna be starting and not that far
away you know it starts the middle of
next year early next year and they gotta
have victory under their belt and on to
the next the next adventure otherwise
population is going to pay attention to
what's happening to him you know which
is a big assault a major assault on the
population just as they did in the 1980s
there they they replaying the record
almost exactly first thing they did in
the nineteen
1981 was drive the country into a big
deficit now this time they did it with a
tax cut for the rich and the biggest
increase in federal spending in 20 years
you know you combine those two you go
from a budget surplus to a budget
deficit if you have a deficit you have
to have Alan Greenspan showing up for
the long face talking about fiscal
responsibility which means cutting
already low level of benefits for people
lack of job security it happens to be an
unusually corrupt administration so it's
it's kind of like at Enron
administration so there's a tremendous
amount of profit going into the hands of
an unusually corrupt group of gangsters
and you can't really have all the stuff
on the front pages so you got to push it
off the front pages you have to keep
people from thinking about it and
there's only one way that anybody ever
figured out frighten them and and
they're good at it that they did it that
their that's their experience and
they'll keep for me so there's domestic
political factors have to do with timing
September 11th gave the pretext and
there's a long term interest serious
interest so they've got to go to war the
only question is how they'll work it out
