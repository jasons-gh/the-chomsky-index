the reason it was young was to protect
Europe against the Iranian our missiles
sleep problem isn't like this another
problem is that inconceivable if they
had them that Iran would ever use them
unless the ruling Moto's had a kind of a
death wish I mean if Iran even tried to
arm a missile country be vaporized aside
from that the defense system of checks
Lockean Poland is not the place that
block Iranian missiles but you put it to
the south this effect that we've been
suggested and was dismissed the only
possible interpretation of the missile
system is a threat against the Russian
to turn which means its first strike
with and in fact it's understood on all
sides that that's what missile defense
is that ever works which is unlikely
that what it might conceivably is reduce
the building to contain a retaliatory
start never contain first row and as I
say this recognize on both sides and
it's described in the strategic analysis
literature and buy focus congressman and
others as just a first strike one it's a
weapon that says we can strike you with
impunity because you won't be able to
strike back and the Russians don't have
to read us own
but strategic harms journals to
understand that they can if they want it
can read major arms journals and read
analysis by top American analyst
strategic analyst saying the only
possible function of the system is as a
threat to the Russian deterrent and so
first strike went through the reasons
that the understanding well Clinton said
the main his top East European advisors
rope elbow to the secretary Under
Secretary of State for East European
affairs he justified the expansion I'm
this pointed out and of course by
extensive he justified it as saying that
it is part of expanding the European
Union to these but this is nothing to do
with the European Union none of their
states that are members of the European
Union that aren't members of native
Sweden Finland the Austria NATO's and
military alliances money do it European
Union this is a simple expansion of what
will what is intended to become vaidya
the us-run global intervention force
that's the last things the world needs
other countries are part of this too so
for example Israel one of Israel's roles
as to services to the united states on
the recently give us blocks political
settlement there
is to be a military base for us
aggression became dramatically obvious
it would have been if it had been
reported during the attack on Gaza
written though the attack on Gaza of the
Pentagon announced that its ascending
big shipment of arms to Israel what I
can know the attack not many people seem
to care but there were a couple of
questions the Pentagon and but that
pending on answer some sugar correctly
that these arms aren't intended for
these early attack on Gaza there to be
pre-positioned in Israel so that makes
them okay that's a good question that it
be pre-positioned for anticipated the US
aggression in the region that's fun so
that we reject that since we on the
world would bomb wherever we want to do
question presupposition incidentally
they have to go probably noticed a movie
yesterday that it was announced that
Israel had bombed the stand during the
Gaza war because they claimed that they
detected and killing a lot of the Union
they claimed that the intelligence that
detected that weapons are being sent
directly from Iran to Gaza for the
population to use a defensive is really
fact now that justification for the
bombing was considered quite legitimate
mr. commentaries they ok that's
understandable natural ticket is that
but for us to send arms to Israel right
in the middle of the attack how can they
would question that the standard supply
well that's part of the aspect native
story more puppet offers a lot of work
to do this point educational work if
people understand something else
happening in the world but what about
the other two major Middle East problems
that the US has to confront a bit of us
already talked about the one is brand
the others Israel Palestine well these
now have been linked John Kerry at the
center part Relations Committee senator
made a speech gave speech to the
Brookings Institute couple of days ago
in which he explained that we have a new
possibility for solving the digital
Palestine problem name which has been
such a hard task for us to solve despite
all our efforts the
the new approach she said would be to
Rican sexualize it so that is a knot and
Israel Palestine is your home but a
regional issue okay that eliminates the
need to set up a problem it's a regional
issue how was it a regional issue well
our goal should be to join with the Arab
states but he means the dictators who
rule them by violence and her with
natural friends and associates so join
with the Arab states to alliance with
Israel to confront the real enemy namely
Quran so we have to reconsider its now a
past of getting regional alliance which
will confront Iran and he says goes on
say that up until now the Arab states
were wedded to the famous of three nodes
of cartoon M&P 67 know that piece node
any dealings with Israel and so on does
the finally breaking out of that and now
they have a new three knows noted Iran
noted or any influence aggression and so
on so a framework for approaching both
problems line up theme our big Gators
jump in with Israel alliance against the
real people being here and he went on to
say how this would how this happy for
the other developments in need our world
he said now make this may make them
israel-palestine agreement feasible
framework that one of them is that he
said by now the Arab states have gone
away from the three nodes and a few
years ago the Arab League produced a
proposal they are lead proposal
originally initiated by Saudi Arabia
which offers as he put it a commitment
to normalize relations with Israel okay
they can normalize relations with Israel
and then we'll finally Israel which is
been desperately seeking a partner peace
has made found one that's the Arab
states are saying cable normal isolation
suit that will it's not the Arab League
proposal said and then something and a
lot has happened between 1967 and the
now which wouldn't want to talk about it
even those about and isn't notice
banning commentators either because it's
out of history it reflects too badly on
their role in the region so long one of
the tasks of activists is to bring a
little history back so in between
nineteen sixty seven and two thousand
nine dozen six when terribly proposal
was made there has been a lot of that
I've been major efforts to carry forward
when in fact is the Arab League proposal
mainly a two-stage settlement on the
national border to the minor mutual
modifications as the official US
terminology of until nineteen seventy
one when the u.s. departed from the
world
