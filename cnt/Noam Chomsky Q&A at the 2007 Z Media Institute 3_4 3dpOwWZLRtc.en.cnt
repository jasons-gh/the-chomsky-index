the United States they claimed was
holding secretly in various prisons
around the world I mean you have debate
like the CIA says what we're following
us Laurel and besides they've been
released and so on and so forth what are
we talking about how can you know
suppose with iran says we picked up 39
Americans we're hiding in somewhere I
mean do we then have a debate about
whether it follows or any in the law I
mean the discussions that go on our
lunatic also that exception unless you
accept the fundamental Imperial premise
you know we on the world so anything we
do is okay maybe we should you know keep
more or less to the letter of what we
say is the law but can't be wrong so
yeah I agree with you it's unacceptable
and there are much worse things that are
much more unacceptable long as you'll be
doing about good reasons that remain
sane there's been a lot of progress I
mean it's worth looking at how different
the world was not many years ago okay
that makes a difference and it's so
reason for hope together they're hideous
things going on always have been you
know going on now we design them and the
people are ready for it tested we're
willing to step up and do something like
they have done in the past often and
we're doing right now now if you
couldn't do anything at all it would be
hard to remain saying about but you can
do a lot that doesn't do any good to
agonize about it you're not helping
anybody
collect if your civil rights work okay
that's doing something about it if you
just SAT alongside I do anything i'm
going to agonize at home you're not
helping anybody changes which i
completely acknowledge forget but if I
won't feel like the stranglehold of
corporation is that it in the government
it's worse than it was having a hold
another battle for us to try to break
through even though there has been great
presentation see I think your perception
is understandable but it's
understandable because not long ago
nobody even raised the question of
corporate control of the government
taking for granted that now it's a
question so we perceive it in fact there
are anti-corporate movements for the
first time not the first time you know
like you go back to the American labor
history they not a strong strand of
American labor history is that the
people who work in the mills along with
this should be workers self-management
should be an corporations were bitterly
condemned when they were created by the
state of that a century to go there in
them by conservatives literally who
regarded them as a return to feudalism
and a form of communism which is not on
inaccurate that were in fact the return
to feudal guilt and they were bitterly
attacked but for a long time that hasn't
happened or supported by progressives
incidentally I thought it's good idea
you may have big corporate entities kind
of like winners doctor and so on but now
there are any corporate movements in
fact dinner there are other calls for
states to withdraw a corporate charters
in fact I'm going to come remarkably
close to success they surprised me
there's one case in California but the
Center for Constitutional Rights was
working on actually my sister-in-law was
working on it so it kept me up to date
they were calling on the Attorney
General of California to remove
the corporate charter of the unica for
crimes it committed in California and in
Burma slave labor in Burma and pollution
environmental destruction in California
oh and no II thought that the Attorney
General no I has the right to do they as
legal obligation to do it okay and
nobody thought that case was going to
get anywhere it's got through the courts
got through the appeals court it was a
strong enough case so that the
corporation settled out of court because
they were afraid to let go to the next
level well when you settle out of court
it's a secret agreement so you know
exactly what they settled for but to
know about it included a lot of
compensation to burmese slave laborers
okay that's getting pretty close you're
calling on the state attorney general to
perform his legal duty to eliminate the
corporate charter the criminal
organization and things like that are
happening elsewhere there parts of you
know right wing rural Pennsylvania with
it and corporation and in fact our mash
of the small you know but their national
movements now which is new so your
perception is correct we now perceive
that problem and that's step towards
doing something about it talk about
immigration and
or FDA to eliminate Canadian social
programs and take control not only these
wasn't especially a boil and why you
know a large part of the point of these
mislabeled free trade agreements they're
not free trade agreements but we're call
free trader brands is to simply
indicates of Canada to revive us
corporations with access to Canadian
resources now there's no objection to
this on the part of the US the Canadian
clipper they believe because they're the
same interest I don't care it very much
you know so they'll shift around the
board of directors will still make the
same profit that makes a difference
Canadians because the one goal of it
would be to eliminate Canadian social
systems which is happening already
anybody this Canadian can spell out the
details so part of the the goal of the
agreements is already being achieved and
it's kinda interesting look at the
details of these agreements if there's
obviously a tremendous disparity of
course between Canada and the United
States well you know it has happened
that there Canada has brought disputes
to the agreement system has a judicata
ng board and Canada has brought
complaints against the United States and
Canada one and the United States don't
get lost you know yeah of course that's
when it is primitive going to Canadians
made some noises about it I think the
Canadian Minister of Interior said okay
if you're not going to live up the
agreement we're going to start exporting
our royal to China yeah just try it
tomorrow then again if you want to
pursue that there's an interesting
studies of the effective especially
NAFTA of my free trade agreement that
again words are ridiculously what's
keeping the effects on working people in
all three countries study it came out
about a year ago buddy
policy institute main economic analysis
institute and it turns out that this is
one of those remarkable agreements which
harmed working people in all three
countries back in Canada the United
States and Mexico of course it on the
most in Mexico the weakest country but
in Canada too so it's reaching its goals
and also undermining Canadian social
programs which is happening before our
eyes met worse in Mexico actually wire
you know white their discussion of that
an immigration bill walker why are
people fleeing from Mexico the United
States not from the United States to
Mexico why are they fleeing from North
Africa that Europe instead the other way
around I mean you know we know why part
of the whole history of imperialism the
reason why and NAFTA is having the
predictable effect I mean to take a
narrower point she follow Mexico you
actually if you live a supermarket in
the United States you'll notice the
prices of commodities are going up you
know bread meat and so on are you at
Mexico they're going up even higher
tortillas for example which is the
staple for poor Mexicans are
unaffordable now for many Mexicans over
30 of riots makes little while ago why
is this happening one of the narrow
reason is the ethanol craze ethanol
which is you can't produce ethanol in
the United States except by massive
state intervention there's a huge
subsidy to the corn growers and you have
got very high tariffs to keep out
cheaper Brazilian ethanol cheaper and
more efficient so I develop an ethanol
industry in the United States you have
to do what was done all through economic
history have massive state intervention
and you can develop an industry but if
corn agricultural agribusiness is
induced by federal subsidy to shift
crops from
corn for people to corn for ethanol
