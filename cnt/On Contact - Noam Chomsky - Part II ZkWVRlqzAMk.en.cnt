welcome to on contact we came to
Cambridge Massachusetts to meet with
professor Noam Chomsky arguably
America's greatest intellectual I wanted
to ask you about the ten principles that
are laid out in the book and the first
one you talked about is reducing
democracy
your second point shaping the ideology
principle number three redesign the
economy let me move on to shifting the
burden on contact with Chris Hedges
this is the second part of our
conversation at his office at MIT
focusing on his latest book requiem for
the American dream our contact with
Chris Hedges so principle number five
attack solidarity and you bring up
social security what we're watching this
happen as we speak well what is this
about
so their immense concern for the fate of
others so I don't have children or
grandchildren and elementary school so
why should I pay taxes why do I have to
care that the kid across the street goes
to school
well solidarity means you do peer social
security is based on the concept of
solidarity you care that the widow
across town has enough food be the
institution that was built on solidarity
or is the labor movement so there is its
slogan we're all in it together we work
together to try to achieve common goals
that's the ideal at least and a
functioning society of as any a healthy
society will be built on the I why is it
important so it's important for people
to defend themselves to protect
themselves oh if you're alone standing
against concentrated power you don't
have a chance if you're working with
others you do have a chance you can you
have the power of the majority in fact
to defend your right to defend the
rights of others but there's also a
simple ethical principle do we care
about others it's kind of interesting
that if you go back to the icons of
neoliberalism like Adam Smith he
regarded sympathy as the most
fundamental human emotion in fact it's
kind of interesting to look at his
notion of invisible hand which everyone
talks about take a look at what he
actually meant by it they barely used
the term so it's easy to find out what
he he argued for example that suppose
that it's an agricultural society
suppose that some landlord accumulated
most of the land and other people didn't
have any said it wouldn't matter much
because of the natural sympathy of the
landowner for the fate of others he
would make sure that there's a
relatively egalitarian distribution of
resources so as if by an invisible hand
we would be saved from the destruction
of concentration of power that's Adam
Smith compare it with what's now called
libertarianism which means we take what
we want the Haeckel everybody without
solidarity or society disintegrates in
essence done and that's the point
remember Margaret Thatcher there's no
society which was an ideal not a
description in fact unwittingly she was
paraphrasing Marx who would condemned
the French aristocracy after the
repression because they were turning
society into a sack of potatoes an
amorphous mass and in which individuals
would not participate in function that's
the neoliberal ideal which Thatcher
stated quite accurately let's talk about
run the regulator's and this has been
the capture of regulatory agencies by
the very industries that are supposed to
be regulated so regulatory capture goes
way back very commonly the business
world has actually
suited regulation supported it to
protect themselves from the highly
destructive effects of an unregulated
market which can be extremely
destructive and the business world
doesn't want to be destroyed so they
kind of either tacitly supported or
sometimes even initiated regulation on
the assumption that they would be able
to take it over and regulate it in their
interests and to a very large extent
this happens so you find that the
regulators for a particular industry are
often very closely linked to the
industries that they are regularly while
we're watching that with the UK with
Pruit right now well that's that's a
dramatic case where the EPA is actually
being virtually dismantled but you find
it in the SEC the railroad regulation
SEC yeah it's been very very very why is
that but I think you make an interesting
point at that kind of revolving door
where people's that's one of the
techniques as to those who have the who
Adam Smith called the Masters of mankind
to have the resources and are being
regulated can offer all sorts of
inducements like when you leave will
give you a cushy job holds for Congress
Robert Rubin yeah that's one of the many
devices by which wealth and power can
ensure that the kind of regulation that
takes places in their interest doesn't
work a hundred percent of course but
it's very important and I think you
would say that after the 1960s in the
early 1970s under the Nick of all things
the Nixon presidency we had suit we had
the consumer safety legislation the
safety and health regulations the
workplace OSHA we had the EPA clean
water act to mine and Safety Act but
these came out of movements they came
out of the pressure of popular movement
just like the New Deal if it hadn't been
for you know CIO organizing sit-down
strikes of labor militant so you
a political activism the New Deal
policies wouldn't have been enacted
there never gifts from there happened to
be a reasonably sympathetic
administration in the 30s but as
Roosevelt himself pointed out you better
pressure me otherwise I can't do it
that's one of the part of the
significance of solidarity you talk
about the nanny state what do you mean
with the nanny state what do you mean by
that the not a state is a state that
gives gifts to the privat to sectors
that have the power to demand it which
typically means the rich and the
powerful I mean there are you know
there's so is this like subsidies to the
fossil fuel industry with this hundreds
of billions of dollar get something like
500 billion a year to the fossil fuel
industry you talk about government
subsidies playing government subsidies
@xa of the financial industries which
the ones that exploded during the
neoliberal period it was an interesting
IMF study that came out of International
Monetary Fund a couple years ago which
tried to determine the source of the
profits of the six largest American
banks turned out it's almost entirely
public subsidy through the indirect
effects of the implicit government
guarantee it's called form informally
too-big-to-fail it means that there's an
implicit guarantee that they're not
going to fail which means you get access
to cheap credit inflated credit ratings
incentive to carry out risky
hence generally profitable transactions
sanity goes wrong public will get out
that amounts to the business press
estimated that at about eighty billion
dollars a year just straight subsidy in
fact everywhere you look there's massive
subsidy that's more than that I mean the
take say the high-tech economy the
computers internet satellites micro
electronics
the components of your iPhone whatever
it may be almost invariably they trace
back to public subsidy in the state
sector of the economy either actual
state sector like places like this which
are fundamentally part of the state
sector or or subsidy to IBM or something
like that
and in fact what typically happens
computers are striking case for decades
the risky and creative work
it's basically funded by the public
finally it's handed over to private
corporations for marketing and profit
and they indeed are protected by
monopoly pricing rights you you had an
interesting figure here
you said corporations spend about 2.6
billion a year on lobbying expenditures
that's more than the two billion we
spend to fund the house at one point one
eight billion and the senate at 860
million what does that say about our
democracy well actually the huge
increase in lobbying also took place at
this transition point between the
regulated capitalism and the neoliberal
capitalism early 70s you start getting a
very sharp increase in the number of
lobbyists in fact probably more along
while writing the legislation that
they're basically writing the
legislation I mean a congress person
usually relies on a staff to write the
legislation which maybe he or she tweaks
and signs who was a staff to they
consult with lobbyists who are often
experts in the area
where they're writing the legislation so
they produce suggestions sometimes
actual texts of legislation which then
go to the Congress personal that's how
we got Obamacare that we wrote it
literal so a lot of it came straight are
these trades let me ask about
engineering elections citizens united of
course
which creates this kind of legal fiction
that this is the right to petition the
government and free speech the Democrats
spent 1 billion dollars on their
election and lost we just saw the most
expensive house race in US history and
Georgia which the Democrats also lost we
said what is this process what have they
done gerrymandering I think we could
argue that the Democratic Party is not
by the definition of a party even a
party what's happened well first of all
we should recognize this goes very far
back back in 1895 the great campaign
manager Mark Hanna it was asked how do
you what does take to run a campaign he
said there's two things the first thing
is money and the second one I forgotten
and there's been very good research into
this Thomas Ferguson's done a lot of it
and some others and turns out that
simply campaign spending is a very good
predictor of electability one of
Ferguson's really recent studies is a
detailed study of congressional
elections from about 1980 to the present
and just take a look at that one
variable campaign funding you got almost
perfect prediction of who's going to be
elected that of course means what
policies are going to be instituted
citizens united of course opened the
doors even wider but the idea that the
corporate entities of the rights of
persons that goes back really to the
early court decisions the early 20th
century right and then it's been
expanded and now by now the Buckley v
Valeo uses United have just basically
opened the doors so now it's out of
sight but it's striking that it can be
overcome the most dramatic feature of
the last election 2016 was not the
victory of a
there with plenty of funding and plenty
media support that's a little off the
norm but not much
it was the Senators we'll talk about
that when we come back when we come back
we'll continue our conversation with
Professor Noam Chomsky
move on to your eighth principle keep
the rabble in wine which may be the
seminal point of that is the break in
the labor movement breaking labor was
critical the US has a very violent labor
history much more so than comparable
societies in all kinds of reasons but
the labor movement is for example
hundreds of workers were literally being
murdered in labor actions at a time when
that was unheard of in Europe Australia
elsewhere in fact repeatedly the labor
movement has just been smashed by the
1920s a very vibrant Rashed flavour
movement was just essentially wiped out
there's a book by one of the leading
labor historians and David Montgomery
called the Fall of the House of labor
about the twenties it did revive in the
1930s how we say with the breakdown of
capitalism with the after the Great
Depression really serious worse than the
2007-8 crash which was bad enough the
labor movement did reconstitute itself
and the CIO organizing was critical and
pretty soon you had a powerful labor
movement with many constructive effects
on the society things were put on hold
during the war immediately after the war
of the attack on labor we tapped Hartley
taft-hartley in 1947 car theism car
theism massive programs by capital to
control the schools sports clubs almost
anything and think that you point out
that with this attack on labor came the
ideology one demonizing government and
two you say politicians always talk
about jobs but they never talk about
profits that's an unpronounceable
obscene word when a politician says I
want to defend jobs he
I want to defend profits I don't care
about jobs that goes right to the
present to our current official leader
but you're not allowed to pronounce the
word profits that's an obscene word so
it's pronounced jobs that's one of the
devices like free trade and others that
are used to mask policies that are in
fact directed and oriented towards the
masters of mankind and their welfare the
and this is all that the attacks on
labor are very significant because the
labor movement is the one major
organization in which the general much
of the public the general working public
can organize get together to make
decisions to even have educational
programs make that point that it's more
than just organizing oh yeah it was
about consciousness it was about
building community was awareness and of
course now what are we down in the
public sectors below ten percent in
terms of people who belong to unions and
there's a coming attack on the last bass
heaters the public's and that's probably
we're going to have it pretty soon in
the Supreme Court when a couple of cases
are coming up which could justify what's
called right-to-work legislation which
is another or will ISM the right to work
means right to scrounge it means the
right to be recognized and defended by a
union but not to pay for it right and of
course that has obvious consequences I
want to talk about principle number nine
manufacturing consent which comes out of
your great book a manufacturing consent
with Edward Harmon a phrase taken from
walter Lippmann and and and that's
that's extremely important because it's
been very successful the public
relations industry working on behalf of
corporations and government has very
effectively if we want to go back to the
word in indoctrinated
the public speak a little bit about that
you know what they've done to our
consciousness well the public relations
industry which is a huge industry of
course is developed in the freest
societies in the world and Britain in
the United States out of a recognition
that enough freedom had been won that
people can't be controlled by violence
easily so therefore you have to control
their opinions and attitudes and this
was quite explicit early 20th century I
have to control make Lippmann who's a
striking example because he's kind of a
wilson roosevelt kennedy liberal
regarded as one of the great defenders
of democracy but his view was that the
public had really no role in public
affairs public opinion as they should be
spectators not participants and the what
he called the responsible men series
guys like us we should really run things
in the interests of the general public
who are stupid and ignorant and
understand what's good for them that's a
essential feature of liberal democratic
theory see it all over the place goes
way back that's one aspect of it the
other aspect is simply driving people
towards what the business press called
the fashionable things these super
superficial things of life like
fashionable consumption if you can
direct people to spend their time buying
the latest gadget that they don't want
you call them uninformed consumers who
will make irrational choices which is an
interesting concept because if you ever
took an economics course you know that
markets are based on informed consumers
making rational choices and it's somehow
overlooked that we have a huge industry
a hundreds of billions of dollars a year
trying to undermine markets by creating
uninformed consumers who will make
irrational choices that's what every
advert and you carry this through to
elections you say what they also create
is an uninformed electorate that will
make irrational choices against their
own interests let's take the last
election as an example particularly
striking feature of it was that issues
were ignored in favor of personalities
so it's not been true for a long time
though and true for a very long time but
here it was really dramatic after all we
are facing two existential crises new in
human history one which has been going
on for a while as the threat of nuclear
war which is in fact increasing the
other is the threat of environmental
catastrophe I take a look at how much
coverage there was of that in the last
two elections just these two things well
even on the meat the media it's not just
coverage the media doesn't all they talk
about is Russia not an issue you talk
about marginal issues and factors there
is a media principle which you know
better than I do that is called
objectivity which means pay attention to
what's happening within the beltway if
you can report accurately what's
happening there your objective talk
about something else here bias gossip
also viscosity by us sentence within the
Beltway they're talking about what's
important to power you keep to that let
me the last point
marginalize the population what do you
mean by that it means make sure that the
public is what Marx called sack of
potatoes an amorphous mass what Thatcher
called eliminates society just have
individuals when just have scattered
atomized individuals not linked to one
another not connected by active
functioning organizations they're going
to be victim and you say you raise this
point you say that what did
does is it creates an unfocused anger
that supports political figures whose
goal is to harm them the population as
much as possible that's exactly what we
see dramatically not just in the United
States but all over the industrial world
there's a tremendous amount of anger
hatred of institutions collapse of
centrist political organizations it's a
lot of it's some of its organized and
effective like for example the Sanders
campaign or the Corbin phenomenon in
England or podemos in Spain it's there
but a lot of it is is just basically
anger we're being badly treated which is
correct
nobody's paying attention to us which is
correct nobody's defending our interests
correct that's a perfect situation for a
demagogue to appear and say I'm the guy
who's going to protect you so just
believe what I say I'm going to bring
jobs I'm going to make the country great
I'm going to do all these wonderful
things meanwhile well the focus of
television attention in the background
my associates are busy passing
legislation issuing directives which are
undermining and destroying you we see it
very clearly in the current so-called
health plan yeah which has nothing to do
with health it's a it's a program of tax
reduction for the very well may
Obamacare was already a core Obamacare
was a bit of an improvement on what
existed nowhere near what should have
been you talk about values you say that
in a society based on control by private
wealth the society reflects those values
which are greed and the desire to
maximize personal gain and the expense
of the other now a small society based
on that principle is ugly but it can
survive a global society based on that
principle is headed for massive
destruction
very lost yes--that's and there's very
simple reasons take the environmental
crisis which is very real and it's not
centuries away it's imminent next couple
of decades if individuals are geared to
maximizing their own individual gain you
know let's get the fastest car that I
can use as much fossil fuels as I can
forget whether my grandchildren will
have a place to live it's not my
business
forget the tens of millions of people in
Bangladesh who are going to be inundated
by sea-level rise not my business then
we're heading to the precipice and we
won't escape
we won't escape but it will be not far
down the road so yes that's inherent in
market societies based on with a public
consciousness based on individual gain
and greed and lack of concern for others
great thank you that was professor Noam
Chomsky thank you for watching for more
of our conversation with Professor Noam
Chomsky go to rt.com
slash unconfident I'll see you next week
