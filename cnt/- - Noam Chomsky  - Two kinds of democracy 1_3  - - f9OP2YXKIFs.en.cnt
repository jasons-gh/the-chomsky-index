let me begin by counter posing to
different conceptions of democracy one
conception of democracy has it that a
democratic society is one in which the
public has the means to participate in
some meaningful way in management of
their own affairs and the means of
information are in fact open and free if
you look up democracy in the dictionary
you'll get a definition something like
that
an alternative conception of democracy
is that the public must be barred from
management of their own affairs and the
means of information must be kept
narrowly and rigidly controlled now that
may sound like an odd conception of
democracy but it's important to
understand that it is the prevailing
conception and in fact that long has
been not just in operation but even in
theory there's a long history that goes
back to the earliest modern democratic
revolutions in 17th century England
which largely expresses this point of
view I'm just going to keep to the
modern period and say a few words about
how that notion of democracy develops
and why and how the problem of media and
this information enters within that
context let's begin with the first
modern government propaganda operation
that was under the Woodrow Wilson
Administration Woodrow Wilson was
elected president in 1916 on the
platform peace without victory that was
right in the middle of the first world
war the population was extremely
pacifistic had no saw no reason to
become involved in a European war the
Wilson administration was committed to
war and had to do something about it
they established the government
propaganda commission called the creel
Commission which succeeded within six
months in turning a pacifistic
population into a hysterical war
mongering population which wanted to
destroy everything German Terra the
Germans limb from limb go to war and
save the world that was a major
achievement and it led to a further
achievement right after right at that
time and after the war the same
techniques were used to whip up a
hysterical Red Scare it was called which
succeeded in pretty much destroying
unions eliminating such dangerous
problems as freedom of the press and
freedom of political thought there was
very strong support from the media from
the business establishment which in fact
pushed most much of this work and it was
in general a great success and among the
those who participated and participated
actively and enthusiastically were the
progressive intellectuals people of the
John Dewey circle who took great pride
in as you can see from their own
writings at the time as they take pride
in having shown that what they called
the more intelligent members of the
community namely them were able to to
drive a reluctant population into a war
which that population didn't want by
terrifying them and eliciting jingoist
fanaticism and so on the means that were
used were extensive for example there
was a good deal of fabrication of
atrocities by the Huns Belgian babies
with their arms torn off all sorts of
awful things that you still read in
history books they were all invented by
the British propaganda ministries whose
own commitment at the time as they put
it in their secret deliberations was to
control the thought of all the world but
crucially they wanted to control the
thought of the more intelligent members
of the community in the United States
who would then disseminate the
propaganda that they were concocting and
convert the pacifistic country to
wartime hysteria and that worked worked
very well and it taught a lesson the
lesson that it
was that propaganda state propaganda
when supported by the educated classes
and when no deviation is permitted from
it can have a big effect it was a lesson
learned by Hitler it's learned by many
others and it has been pursued to this
day one of the one of the groups that
learned the lesson naturally was the
business community there had already
been a public relations industry in the
United States United States pioneered in
the public relations industry its
commitment was to control the public
mind as its leaders put it they learned
a lot from the successes of the creel
Commission and the successes in creating
the Red Scare and its aftermath and in
fact the public relations industry
underwent a huge expansion at that time
it did succeed for some time in creating
almost total subordination of the public
to the business rule through the 1920s
this was extreme so extreme that
congressional committees will fall out
committee began to investigate it as and
as we moved into the 1930s where a lot
of our information about it comes from
now another group that was impressed by
these successes was Liberal Democratic
theorists and leading media figures like
for example walter Lippmann who was the
Dean of American journalists major
foreign policy and domestic critic and
also a major theorist of of liberal
democracy if you take a look at his
collected essays you'll see that they're
subtitled something like you know a
theory of progressive theory of liberal
democratic thought or something like
that
Lippmann was involved in these
propaganda commissions and recognized
their achievements he argued that what
was happening was that there was what he
called a revolution in the art of
democracy namely it was now possible to
manufacture consent
is to bring about agreement on the part
of the public to things that they didn't
want by the new techniques of propaganda
and he thought also that this was a good
idea in fact necessary it was necessary
because as he put it the common
interests elude public opinion entirely
and they can only be understood and
managed by a specialized class of
responsible men who are smart enough to
figure things out so a small relatively
small elite the most intelligent men of
the community that the duets we're
talking about
they can understand the common interests
what all of us care about but these
things eluded the general public this is
a view that goes way back hundreds of
years it's also a typical Leninist view
in fact it has very close resemblance to
the Leninist conception that a vanguard
of revolutionary intellectuals should
take state power using popular
revolutions as the force that brings
them the state power and then drive the
stupid masses towards a future that
they're too dumb an incompetent to
envision for themselves the Liberal
Democratic theory and Marxism Leninism
are very close in their common
ideological assumptions I think that's
one reason why people have found it so
easy over the years to shift from one
position to another without any
particular sense of change it's just a
matter of assessing where power is you
know maybe there'll be a popular
revolution and that'll put us into state
power or maybe there won't be in which
case we'll just work for the people with
real power the business community but
we'll do the same thing will drive the
stupid masses towards a world that
they're too dumb to understand for
themselves
well Lippmann backed this up by a pretty
elaborated theory of progressive
democracy he argued that in a democracy
there are two class in a properly
functioning democracy there's two
classes of citizens there is first of
all the class of citizens who have to
take some active role in running the
affairs of the general affairs that's
the specialized class there are the
people who
analyze who execute make decisions sort
of run things in the political system in
the economic system and in the
ideological system then there's that's a
small percentage of the population
anyone who puts these ideas forth is
always part of that small group
naturally and they're talking about you
know what we do about those others the
others who are out of this small group
the big majority of the population there
what Lippmann called the bewildered herd
and we have to we have to protect
ourselves from the trampling and the
rage of the bewildered
