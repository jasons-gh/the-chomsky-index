well the fact of the matter is we can do
just about anything I mean with
you know people like us let's say we
wouldn't be here otherwise our pretty
privileged and we have the kind of
privilege that few people have ever had
in history or have now and if you have
privilege you have opportunities and the
opportunities are almost boundless I
mean thanks to the struggles of the past
it hasn't always been like this but
thanks to the struggles in the past
there's a tremendous amount of freedom I
mean the state may try to repress you
but they can't do a lot now they can
pass the NDAA let's say but they can't
really implement it against the will of
the population
I mean look there there's a lot of I
think there's a lot of excessive concern
in activist groups about state
repression oh it's not that it's not
there you know sure they'd like to do it
but first of all always been there and
it's just kind of inherent the states
none of their power systems and it's
much weaker than it used to be so it
takes a you'd be there's this paranoia
about concentration camps you know
they're gonna lock us up NDAA says they
can detain us indefinitely concentration
camps have been there since the 50s back
in the 1950s the Liberal Democrats
Humphrey and layman introduced
legislation to set up the internment
camps in case people got out of control
I never followed to see what happened
but no the legislation was passed but
they can't do anything about it I mean
doesn't take say the surveillance
systems okay they shouldn't have systems
we shouldn't tolerate systems where
everything you say gets sent to a
central computer massive supercomputer
in Utah and they do this and that but
even if they have that data where
they're gonna do it I mean you know
nothing effect they give you experiences
with the FBI from resistance days you
can't do anything with it and if they
try though arouse a popular reaction so
power really is in the hands of
governed if they're willing to use it
and so what can we do given that we're
people with privilege we have an
enormous number of things we can do
there may be efforts to shut you up or
something but you're not going to be
sent to it you know have your brains
blown out it's not like El Salvador
