let's take visual perception which is
relatively uncontroversial and take the
one example that I gave the rigidity
principle okay when when you're looking
at the sequence of the Kista scopic
presentations you perceive a rigid
object in motion in motion you can't
prevent yourself from perceiving that
that's what you perceive period which
are actually the stimuli that are
actually reaching your your your eyes
your retina are just a series of as few
as three or four presentations on
atticus to scope you know screen with
lights of each of which has several dots
on it well you have no way of
introspecting into them your phenomenal
experience is the rigid object in motion
but the stimuli that are hitting the
retina are a very small number of
presentations of a few dots
you can't introspect into that the in
fact it's a that's why it's a discovery
you know it's kind of like the discovery
of the chemical structure of you know
coal coal or something you can't
introspect into it so the phenomenal
descriptions you know they're useful but
they're useful as data they tell you
very little about what's going on so
it's kind of like everything else in the
world where you have data but it doesn't
a nice well what's going on
that requires that's why you have to
take courses in physics and chemistry
and so on you know because the data
isn't transparent
isn't transparent and it's hard for
people to deal with but the same is true
of error conscious lives
Kamui tend to take for granted kind of
like just
but that we can understand everything
about our ourselves fact we don't
understand anything about our so it's
just it's even harder than understanding
how chemistry works because it's so much
more complex yet that's that's the
crucial step that the human sciences
really have not taken taken yet for the
most part that was taken in the Natural
Sciences around the 17th century just
just the willingness to be puzzled about
things that look obvious like what could
be more obvious than if I in fact it if
I let go of a cup it goes down instead
of up well you know Galileo was willing
to be puzzled about that that's why you
take physics courses before that all you
had to be told as things are going to
their natural place and it's a big
psychological step even in studying the
external world even greater in studying
ourselves because there we sort of feel
that we know everything what's conscious
must be what there is and in the in
philosophy of modern philosophy it's
it's kind of a principle it happened to
be John Searle who I was quoting but
it's a widely accepted principle that
nothing can be a mental process unless
it's accessible to consciousness and as
I mentioned if you look over the
intellectual history it's very hard to
find anyone who departed from this view
ok well um
take time for one more question because
it's getting late and something over
here I'd be saying it yes professor um
you mentioned the the problems behind
the referential dogma would you say that
we are in a if we reject that are we in
a situation that that Quine maybe puts
us in with the sorry are we in a
situation similar to coins indeterminacy
of translation would you would you say
that's where we're left well Quine
accepted the dogma but that's not
surprising because almost everybody
today - yeah his his idea his doctrine
of indeterminacy was in fact based on
assuming this so if you take his
framework that there's nothing but
Association and conditioning howdy how
do you know to take his example when you
hear a word let's say rabbit case when a
child hears the word rabbit how does it
know that the word is referring to the
that animal running around sorry and not
to some part of the animal because if
you see the animal running around its
leg is also running around so how does
the child know that it's not the leg and
how does it not know in fact that the
word doesn't refer to some disconnected
object like the leg of this one that's a
standard problem of induction it's
humans problem of induction and as Hugh
Munder stood but his successors don't
seem to understand
there's no way to solve that problem
Hume himself contrary to what you may
learn in a philosophy of course it was a
rationalist not an empiricist he took
for granted and says that the only way
you can solve the problem of induction
is quite what he calls an animal
instinct means there must be some
internal structure in your mind that
leads you to a particular answer because
there's no way to get it by induction
and that I think is correct and I think
the same would be true about the coins
that I've got I got you know rabbit the
child gets the right right answer
because they're built to get the right
answer and the right answer is not a in
the case of say rabbit you can easily
show that what a child understands to be
a rabbit is not something physically
identifiable
kind of guessing your ages but say my
grandchildren probably about you read
when they were kids
the story that they liked about a baby
donkey main Sylvester and social media
no the baby donkey somehow has turned
into a rock and for the rest of the
story it's trying to convince convince
its parents that it's not a rock it's
their baby donkey and since children's
stories always end happily something
happens and it it ends up then it's a
baby donkey again and everybody's happy
but the interesting fact is that every
child understands that that thing that
has all the physical properties of a
rock is in fact Sylvester and the reason
is and this was in fact noticed by John
Locke that people in effect animals or
individuated by properties like psychic
psychic continuity okay you're the same
if used there's some psychic continuity
no matter how you change physically I
mean that's the standard fairy tale you
know you know the evil which turns the
handsome prince into a frog and has all
the properties of a frog until till the
beautiful princess comes and kisses the
frog neighs Ansem which forensic again
well again every kid knows that it's
always the prince because it has the
property of psychic continuity actually
a lot of science fiction is based on
this but it's even through of the
children's stories well that alone tells
you right away that what individuals
objects is not a collection of physical
properties but some complex mental
structure that we impose on them look
likes I could come to it and
Hume didn't think about that the walk in
fact did but I should say Hume
recognized that was true we don't
identify words by physical properties
but it runs across the whole collection
of words you can't find a word so simple
that it doesn't have those properties
actually in the Natural Sciences what
you try to do is to concoct you invent
concepts which do have those properties
so when you invent the concept say no
electron or something you intend it to
be physically identifiable you don't
want it to have its meaning changed by
what's in your head that's the whole
point so it's a kind of a norm for the
sciences but it's not true of human
language and that goes back to Quinn's
example the solution to his problem is
essentially essentially Humes Humes
solution to the problem of induction no
solution except you're built to pick
things up to structure the world in a
certain way so that's the way to do it
