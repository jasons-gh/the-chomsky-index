you just need an idea to change the world 
and 
our project is called ideas world-changing ideas do not come to everyone's mind far 
not everyone here we just flew a statue 
freedom seems to me that in order for you to be visited by a great idea you need to have 
a very free mind not burdened with political and religious prohibitions and 
even moral ideas create and destroy the idea does not always change the world to 
the best they can ruin can enrich but in order to change the world 
all you need is ideas and it's true, in my opinion, this is how our journey began 
in America they say today the most intellectually developed country is the most 
ingenious economy on the planet with this you can argue of course but you can 
still count on Boolean laureates and the number of patented inventions and 
change your mind to argue anyway, our task is completely different 
show a world without borders and science without borders and the triumph of human thought 
which borders are also useless and why did we start from America 
well, why not 
the speed of thought is said to be equal to the speed of light and of course we have no possibility 
to reliably depict the flight of human thought 
but if you think about it, why shouldn't he be so so beautiful so 
exciting so uneven and thrilling 
our heroes are people who change the world to the best of their strength and capabilities not a child

us government was born in 1928 in philadelphia since 1945 studied philosophy 
and linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania for 61 years has been teaching at 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in his doctoral dissertation hamske 
began to develop linguistic ideas which he then revealed in more detail 
in 1957 in the book Syntactic Structures 
his works on generative grammars contributed significantly to the decline 
behaviorism and promoted the development of cognitive sciences 
but Chomsky agrees with you, modern linguistics cannot yet offer 
the world of explanation of the phenomenon of appearance on earth 
different languages   and therefore passes through the centuries without losing meaning and relevance 
legends about the tower of Babel, the punishment for pride became for people

dispersed across the land without leaving others Babylonian ambitions Babylonian tradition 
almost every nation in Burma and Mexico has a tower 
among the Tlingit tribe in Alaska and in ancient Greece, scientists are especially surprised 
the fact that this is the legend of the tower to the sky appears among isolated peoples 
from a friend and no longer intersecting in historical and cultural planes and 
everyone has their own idea of   how the Babylonian 
the tower, in our opinion, it could well come out and such as this building 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology Teaches Noam Chomsky here 
the most famous linguist of our time, he made a real revolution in 
linguistics including when he said that language is an innate mechanism of communication 
and explained why exactly a person is able to master this talent to speak 
albeit in different languages, but in the end it is no longer a complaint to a linguist 
okay virone tower 
behind the skin

hello, thank you for agreeing to this interview and taking the time for us 
today I am pleased to be strongly suppose that we have this property 
speaking properties to use language has been given since 
from the very beginning, but why did we so relatively recently learned this 
we cannot say exactly when we 
received this gift well, definitely during evolution 
a person over the past hundred thousand years, in fact, this determines our race 
it was during this period that human homo sapiens mastered speech and we can 
trace the emergence of languages, it seems to me that this property appeared in 
for a very short time compared to the entire period of evolution with 
since this human ability appeared, it has been used constantly for 
it is a short time in this instant in terms of evolution 
there was a development of man of the industrial revolution, so on but 
no significant changes in brain function occurred 
human cognitive abilities have changed little in this sense we are identical 
Aboriginal tribes and how if the ability to language 
this is an innate mechanism, but let's say if we consider this knowledge as a kind of key 
what kind of door does he open with regard to scientists 
they need to determine which properties of the language are innate which 
acquired the next question is what are the variations as far as possible changes in 
language system, you can artificially create linguistic systems that 
nevertheless will not become a language because they will not meet the requirements 
human language laws of my development 
however, we cannot study the properties of language on other kinds of creatures except 
human since animals have no language but even with humans and such experiments 
it is very difficult to carry out it is necessary to use some indirect methods 
learning the language system does not exactly lead to very interest 
the result of how scientists can use this information further 
resulted in we want to know how it developed 
language systems are what fundamentally distinguishes us not only from other living 
creatures but also from other primates we all 
human beings come from a small group of people who lived in africa and we 
we can trace our origins from there are archaeological 
evidence confirming that the person appeared approximately 100 150 thousand 
years ago, there are also archaeological facts related to the development of the language 
therefore, it is safe to say that over the past 50 thousand years, an explicit 
evolution did not happen so this is the window in which this amazing 
property of a person properties of language it is rather narrow in this new 
Chomsky was called a revolutionary of linguistics, the idea of   changing the world turned out to be 
simple and ingenious why does a child start talking in the first two years 
life in the native language because Chomsky answers that there are 7 and language containing 
all possible principles of all languages   of the world are an innate mechanism of mastering 
language which will choose the required algorithm 
depending on which language the child should speak this mechanism 
works until about 12 years old, by the way, he explains her childish ease in learning 
foreign languages   that are becoming difficult to access in 
later age, Chomsky's main argument is 
parents do not tell the child which language constructions are impossible, however 
the child very quickly understands what is what 
and I'm sure Chomsky has some pre-set information for the kid for this 
that you can't figure out what and in what sequence you speak science 
we can say with confidence that a person has very serious 
innate properties we know about it thanks to observations 
reborn babies are surrounded by a complex environment love he hears sounds 
the child sees objects instantly reflexively 
selects language-related information from this environment and is pretty good 
I understand what is happening absorbing this information it passes 
through several stages at the age of six months 10 months two years and so on 
and gradually he acquires what we have with you the language before our eyes 
something magical happens thanks to which a person can learn a language 
but scientists want to know how a newborn baby of one day about labor 
determines in which language howl amongst he lives this is a non-trivial task at the very 
in fact, we now know that a person acquires some abilities even before 
birth being in the womb research 
show that the child can distinguish the speech of the mother whose voice he never 
heard another woman speak means something is happening before birth 
the child somehow tunes in to a particular system on this topic was carried out 
many studies have studied languages   of different categories and it turned out that before 
gaining speech and language no matter what language surrounds the child so that 
the adopted child begins to speak the language of the parents as easily as 
biological this suggests that the mechanism of acquisition and cognition is the same 
for all languages   even if the child was born in the Amazon forest in brazil 
then he has the universal ability to speak any language 
if he gets into a certain environment, then he can learn, let's say Russian and 
then studies at the university in Moscow 
generative universal grammar conceived by boorish for half a century determined 
the development of linguistics, the task of scientists of the next generations is to confirm or 
refute the new chomsky then and neil and believe to travel missionary and 
targets in South America discovered the Piraha people speaking their 
Piraha language, which does not fit into the theory of universal 
grammar but so far this is only an exception confirming the rule 
how language is evolving today to what is humanity moving 
there is a lot of talk about language evolution however languages   do not evolve language is 
programmed properties are a pretty tough system this ability 
creates a certain area of   our brain and this ability has not changed since 
the moment of its origin for the reasons that I have already spoken about but the languages   themselves 
changing constantly when the Normans conquered Britain it changed 
English my grandchildren do not speak as I spoke at their age but slang 
teenagers generally change the language in one generation 
however, all these are only superficial changes within a given structure 
we want to understand what kind of structure it is, what is this rigid form that is not 
allows the language to change dramatically if you ask 
the question of how a negative sentence is constructed in English or 
some other language, then as a rule there is an element 
meaning negation in English is the word not which is in the middle 
sentences can be invented pseudo language in which this element 
not appears in third place in sentences this is a very simple rule with 
the point of view of mathematics, however, there is no such language and people could not 
to learn it 
language has two aspects, sound and meaning, but how the combination of sounds is associated with 
understanding of these meanings why it is believed that the name given to the child from birth 
determines his fate and character and can this be shifted to the scale of whole 
peoples speak differently how language develops national character 
can tell about my experience my parents gave me a name but this is a Hebrew word 
which has never been used as a name for me to say, but it 
means pleasure pleasure in the bible there is 
expression 10 however the name itself but not when I 
grew up with this strange name people most often called me Norman just wrong 
heard when I introduced myself, I said okay, I'll live as a Norman sometimes at 
I have problems at the airport but in fact 
the name does not play a big role, but there is another hypothesis that is being discussed already 
a couple of hundred years how does the language you speak affect the perception of the world 
there are many attempts at how you interpret the social environment 
demonstrate such a connection but they are not very convincing rather there is 
evidence that language has little effect on the perception of the world may be small 
differences but they are not dominant but 
it's amazing that you think so and that the emotional is rich emotionally 
colored language does not affect our thoughts in any way does not affect our character and 
our fate, I now propose to recall the work of George Orwell 1984 
remember there was a new language invented newspeak and it was scary don't forget 
that at the snouts he thought mostly aban 
and what could happen to her in the future, and Newspeak was an illustration of that 
what could have happened there well this is not a new language this is new 
using language when fame starts to mean the opposite of their meaning 
the very concept of Newspeak is precisely related to the concept of double thinking double 
standards when there are two opposite concepts in the brain, that's for 
to reconcile them and a new one was created, it exists in any 
society and we have newspeak and we will take the term aggression from you 
international law, it has a certain meaning, however 
in the English-speaking world, this word is used only when aggression is directed 
against us when we carry out the aggression ourselves 
we call it trying or something, it's not just us 
this is a universal thing you can swagger Hitler's invasion of Poland 
it was not aggression but defense and defense against the wild terror of the Poles. 
the Nazis practically destroyed northern China 
40 years ago I saw interesting documents and there is completely noble 
rhetoric to save poor Chinese from bandits 
give them a Japanese paradise and Hitler captured Czechoslovakia from the purest 
incentives to end ethnic cleansing and establish German civilization 
the same thing when America pokes its nose into other countries and when Russia invades 
to other countries always the same any of us telling another's crime 
exaggerates a person he adds his attitude shows how much it is 
awful this is newspeak double thinking double standards they are everywhere and in 
culture and in the system of power, you said about the inventions of language, I remembered 
an attempt by people to invent the language of international communication, Esperanto, and this 
the language did not develop and did not become popular in your opinion why is it 
a kind of parasite language those who speak it subconsciously 
use knowledge of their own language to speak from 
the first why this language did not take root for this are social and cultural 
reasons it could be used as an international language there were attempts to 
done but failed because the language of international communication 
the truly international language has become the English language of the most powerful 
states view scientific international 
symposia from austria to thailand mainly in english 1 
in the morning listened to the BBC broadcast of the conference in singapore delegate 
from china speaks english this is the power of british feathers american 
empire if so you can dream up 
assume that humanity will sooner or later come to the need to speak 
in one language was view mens nike will they speak the same language 
I hope not, it would be a very boring language and so it disappears very quickly 
usually refer to Aboriginal languages, but in reality languages   are rapidly disappearing and 
in the center of europe, say in italy, there are many people who cannot 
talk to their grandmothers because they speak a different language and what 
today it is called Italian in fact it is a collection of different languages 
whose speakers often do not understand each other and disappear in Germany 
a few years ago I had a doctoral student who studied 
German grammar after graduation he got a job in Germany to teach 
German student German they speak a dialect 
they need to learn correct German in general, now many Germans speak 
in English and with another country in the United States themselves there are areas where in 
colleges teach standard English because the language in which 
students say this is a kind of English 
comes a very rapid decline of languages, many disappear under the pressure of powerful 
powers imposing their language according to unesco experts in the world exist 
about 6,700 languages   but half of them will soon disappear on average every 15 
days at least one language ceases to be used moreover specialists 
believe that 96 percent of languages   are spoken by only 4 percent of the population 
planets and 150 teeth of Russia have died in the last century 2 but now it is next in line 
dozens are bad news for a dying language before and for scientists 
linguists in this course of life itself 
but there is a reverse process, the revival of languages   in Europe, for example, in Spain this 
Basque country and Catalonia or Welsh in the UK is sometimes associated 
with the need for national self and identification 
sometimes it is a means of resisting pressure and sometimes these languages   are used 
for music of songs and other similar things, it all started recently and revival 
languages   is much slower than their decline and disappearance is obvious 
the number of languages   has decreased in the last adieus me the most recent 
question our world is constantly changing and in words declarations of international laws 
it seems to be getting better but is there a change for the better in 
in fact and in your opinion, what idea in the near future could change this 
world for the better and phil, I think that if you look at a long stretch of history 
we will see steps forward for example we have abolished slavery and even until recently 
time women and this is half of the population 
considered property under British law, for example, a woman was simply 
considered the property of a father or husband it was very recently 
but this changed minority rights to a certain extent began to be respected 
a lot of things have happened there is opposition to violence these are all steps forward but on the other 
side of the human race is now threatened 
destruction of the environment of its existence, the first is a catastrophic change 
the climate is very serious and very gloomy 
perspective and not so distant future it seems to me that we are marching towards 
this cliff is pretty fast and the second is a war, I think it's just a miracle 
that during the last 60 years we have avoided a nuclear war that could 
destroy the whole world much can be done to overcome this 
threat however not much is done here are two 
vectors in which the development of civilization is going on; change on the one hand 
positive and, on the other hand, destructive and it depends on us which of these directions 
to win believe it does not depend on God from people 
we made sure that noam chomsky despite the biblical name 
not at all religious this wonderful admitted absolutely 
scientifically by the majority of an intellectual and an enthusiastic attitude towards their 
subject but he is Finnish they say that neither he nor 
other linguists, together with neuroscientists, cannot say how our brain has changed and 
what made different groups of people associate with certain concepts 
different sounds is unclear why almost all languages   are based on 
these are the rules, by the way, and Chomsky and other scientists in the study of these 
universal rules go backwards looking for diversity 
variants of verbal constructions and some universal restrictions then 
there is as it is impossible to say in any language the topic is not yet fully disclosed 
therefore the Bible remains the best explanation for the uninitiated 
let's mix their language there so that one does not understand the speech of the other
