yeah I didn't know it namely there were
enough development had taken place so
that the Rangers and the Panthers were
integrated they were working together
you know and they had broken down these
barriers and therefore they knew at once
that it was a police fake so nothing
happened and then the FBI had to
mobilize another colonial force namely
Chicago police and bring them in and
they did the job they assassinated you
know straight to stop a style
assassination I mean nothing covered up
about it except by the press but the and
it's very clear what happened isn't that
okay that's the kind of thing that
happens in small detail but it also
happens in you know big much bigger
frame and that's the kind of thing you
have to overcome recognizing and Humes
point exactly if you can control opinion
you know if you can get people to think
for themselves and the work together
it's gonna be very hard to do these
things so that's the method it's always
been the method for getting anywhere
it's been that was the method for
getting rid of slavery for you know for
getting rid of feudalism for feminism in
the last 3040 years for the achievements
of liberation theology and Latin America
until they were destroyed by violence in
that case because they couldn't compete
with us violence but you know that it's
just a matter of event that's our fault
you know the fact that it was destroyed
is our fault we couldn't control our own
criminals and they were able to destroy
it but that that I think if these things
all tell you exactly what you have to do
and there's plenty of opportunities I'm
a we don't face death squads like they
do in the in Central America see
oh gee I'm sorry I'm talking too much as
usual yeah yeah sure directors right
yeah you are a director first of all I
don't I don't think it's got to do
anything with modern America I'm it's
always been the case and it's perfectly
good reasons for it and the reasons go
back to humans inside
I mean you tell people the truth that's
you're in trouble why should you do it
so therefore you try to control their
opinion that means mostly lie or mislead
or distort and so on what's the method
for overcoming it I mean we all know
that that's point of asking we all know
exactly what the method is try to find a
be honest be honest try to find figure
out the truth for yourself work with
others to try to figure it out try to
disseminate it it's not a big trick I
mean like if any of you take science
courses like this take biology now what
do you try to do in a biology course
well you try to find out the truth if it
happens to undermine what somebody else
believed well fine it undermines it
that's the way the games played in the
net and there's a little certain tiny
sector of academic life namely the
Natural Sciences in which this is just
taken for granted and the reason it's
taken for granted is if you don't do it
you get nowhere you know and you get and
somebody else does it and you're out of
business but in most fields the
humanities and Social Sciences and so on
you don't have that kind of external
discipline you know mother nature isn't
standing there forcing you to be honest
and therefore there's a lot of
opportunity for a lot of latitude for
distortion and deceit but the same
techniques that are used in the sciences
ought to be used here and there's
nothing there's no big secret about them
it doesn't you know everybody knows how
to be honest you know everybody knows
how to try to find out what's actually
going on
I mean you have to have experience you
know I have to see what kind of deceit
there's been in the past and you have to
know what to look for and so on but you
know these aren't esoteric skills you
know this isn't quantum food I mean this
kind of stuff is available to everybody
that's why peasants and illiterate
peasants in Latin America were able to
do it very easily or workers in you know
Lowell Massachusetts under 50 years ago
it's because it's obvious this I mean
the skills are deceit there's not a much
skill involved in being honest in fact a
lot of your University in the school in
the university training is teaching you
how to carry out the skills of
distortion and deceit that's hard it's
much harder to tell lies and tell the
truth I mean everybody knows that from
their own lives no you want to tell the
truth about something you did it's
usually pretty easy if you want to try
to justify some rotten thing you did by
making up lies it's usually pretty hard
and that's true whether it's that you
know you stole a toy from your
three-year-old brother or anything else
telling the truth is always very easy
except for the personal cost that may be
associated but there's no skills
yeah
take any days paper and you're just a
huge dwith it you have to ask what's the
relationship between what's being
described and what in fact is happening
okay so it's just looking at the New
York Times boys eating breakfast and
it's full of examples you can start with
page one and run right through so for
example is there's a lot of discussion
about aunty politics you know this is
great move any politics in the country
well interestingly they actually quote
somebody who tells the truth some
working-class person who says yeah
Congress is rotten and the reason is
Congress is big business okay that's
true the reason why Congress is rotten
is because Congress is big business and
big business runs the country and that's
right but try to find that discussed
somewhere so it means that the problem
isn't any politics you know it's not
opposition to government it's not the
stuff that's in all the headlines and
any politics the problem is the
authoritarian control that happens to
use politics as its medium so you're
supposed to see the politics and you
know but not see the control that's
hidden behind well you know that's
actually if it's obvious to this guy
they quoted but that's hidden you know
alright there's one example or take the
article on Haiti actually actually a
good reporter down there john Kipner of
the new york times is quite he's
actually the guy who exposed the police
raid against the police assassination of
Hampton he was never able to publish a
much about it like The Times magazine
wouldn't run a story that he wrote about
it he was a young reporter then and he
exposed the lies the Chicago press was
simply reporting the police lies but he
actually went to the room and noticed
that the gunshots were all inside not
outside and exposed he's a pretty good
reporter I suspect that's one reason he
never gets anywhere on the New York
Times like he's the one older reporter
has never been
Oh chief or anything like that anyhow
he's an honest reporter and when he goes
somewhere usually tells the truth okay
so he's in Haiti now and he's telling
truth I mean the truth is that the
American forces there the Haitians have
been told you're not supposed to take
revenge you know in other words impunity
rains those were our killers and you're
not allowed to go after them no justice
that's the rule but so the Haitians are
doing it you know like they're finding
these @ caches these murderers you know
the paramilitaries are the security
forces used to do most of their dirty
work and they're handing them over to
the American army because that's what
they're told to do by RSD than others
just don't kill them you know hand them
over to the American army so what's the
American army doing well it's handing
them over to the Haitian police you know
that is the guys they always worked with
and worked for I mean it's like you know
taking some Nazi killer and handing them
over to Gestapo to take care of it
that's exactly what happens is a Haitian
police release them and in fact the
chief nerd points out there that you
know they're supposed to have gone to
the National penitentiary but then he
checked the National penitentiary and
they're not there you know well what
happened to be a big genius to figure it
out all right if you read through this
you begin to understand exactly what the
US invasion is about I mean it's about
maintaining the traditional power
structure including its military
apparatus which we set up in the first
place now that's not what the headline
says you know you have to sort of read
it with minimal intelligence to figure
out that that's what it means and if you
ghost or take this a big story on North
Korea
you know Clinton huge foreign policy
triumphs Clinton succeeded in getting
North Korea to shift its nuclear weapons
production over to some other form of
production a minor footnote that's
exactly what Korea's been North Korea's
been asking for for the last couple of
years you know and in fact you don't
have to go very far to find that out
here you can go down the street to
Northwestern University where they have
the we have the meat of it breakfast
this morning there's a friend of mine
named Bruce Cummings who is the world's
you know the leading expert on Korea and
the United State has been pointing this
out for years but he can
get into the press even though he's the
major he's the major American specialist
on Korea you know the guy who wrote the
big fat thousand page books and so on
but he can't get interviewed can't get
in the press why well because he's been
saying exactly what's been obvious and
which is now presented as a great
triumph of American diplomacy because we
you know ultimately after having waved
fists around you know gotten your war
and had military maneuvers we finally
finally turned out to be politically
expedient to do it okay that's another
story and we can just go on from there
you know you ask how it's done take a
look at any column in the newspaper
you'll figure out how it's done
and in fact read your textbooks and
you'll find out the same thing because
they're not very different I don't know
who's calling on people are you yeah
okay
well I don't know the answer to that but
I think there's one thing that we can
predict with fair certainty if the US
public remains marginalized there isn't
going to be much history to worry about
because the you know we're not living in
the 18th century the problems may be
sort of similar but they're quite
different in scale and the problems that
are not very far away have to do with
human survival and hence if the public
in the most powerful country in the
world remains marginalized we don't have
to worry much about history because
there is no BNE so like takes a Central
America which is the region that we've
been most we have most control we've
controlled it for a hundred years so
that tells us really what we are it's
quite possible that much of Central
America will be uninhabitable in another
couple of decades like Nicaragua for
example which is one of the main targets
of our attack actually we attacked
Nicaragua first in 1854 that's when the
u.s. Navy first shelled a Nicaragua and
it's been that way since then so we have
a lot of influence there it's losing its
water supply it's not it's the reason is
that people are so desperate after these
the American attacks which intensified
in the 80s that they're starving and
they're going up they're doing the only
thing they can you know you go up the
hills to cut wood and try to find some
land to work and so on that eliminates
the forest cover streams start drying up
the land can't absorb water lakes are
drying up there there's on top it
happens to be a drought but the water
supply may disappear and as the
pressures continue it may become a
desert that could be true of Haiti Haiti
in fact is kind of like a almost a
parable of Western savagery I mean when
when Columbus landed I was the first
place Haiti at Columbus landed Haiti and
he thought it was a paradise you know it
was the richest place in the world also
probably the most dense
populated place in the world and in fact
it remained that way I mean France is a
rich country because in large measure
because they stole Haiti's resources
Haiti was the richest colony in the
world right through the 18th century in
fact early in this century right before
Woodrow Wilson invaded Haiti you look at
the American government studies and
Solan scholarship they were still
describing Haiti as a major resource
center is if it happened to be an
extremely rich place well when you fly
into Haiti today you know you as you fly
in you see that the island the island
that is Haiti and Dominican Republic
Dominican Republic we've also brutalized
but Haiti much more so when you fly over
the border you see it on one side it's
brown on the other side it's sort of
semi green the brown side is hated the
richest place in the world no it may not
last another decade or more and it
literally may become totally uninhabited
and that's extending elsewhere and it's
involves us too you know like the rich
and the powerful they're going to
survive longer but these effects are
very real and they're getting worse you
know they're getting worse as more and
more people are getting marginalized I
mean the percentage of the world's
population that has no role in
profit-making is increasing and if
profit-making is the only human value
that part of the population bigger and
bigger here too is going to be come
destructive because there's nothing else
for them to do and when your destructive
these days it's not like being
destructive 200 years ago the techniques
of destruction are vastly escalated the
environmental problems for example are
much more significant in scale I mean
there nobody really understands much
about complicated things like you know
the weather and so on but there's a fair
possibility I mean a possibility high
enough so that no rational person would
exclude it that within a couple hundred
years the water level
old water level will have risen high
enough so that most of human life will
have been destroyed well you know we
don't do anything about that that's it's
not impossible that'll happen in fact
it's even likely so the answer is if you
remain marginalized there's not gonna be
much history to worry about and whether
people will react or not who knows
that's free you know everyone's got
design
I don't think so in fact American
history has been rather different I mean
look there's a lot of problems with the
political system was in fact set up as
as a very anti-democratic you have to
remember all the founding fathers
dislocated democracy Jefferson was a
partial exception but only partial but
for the most part they hated democracy
and the u.s. didn't even become formally
democratic until about the mid 19th
century the original idea was that the
I'm quoting now the people who own the
country ought a government that was the
favorite maxim of John Jay the first
chief you know heaven recalling chiefly
chief just as the Supreme Court head of
the Constitutional Convention and so on
the people who own the country ought to
govern it that was the principle on
which the country was founded but if you
look at the way it worked over the years
it turned out very often that
concentration of power in Washington
empowered people as distinct from
concentration of power and States and
there were reasons for that businesses
in power the people on the country are
they're everywhere but in states locally
they're often more and more powerful
they can often concentrate more power in
the States than they can in the federal
government where let's a national
popular movements were able to influence
it so if you look at some of the things
that really improved the country like
you know in the say the New Deal
measures which sort of brought the
United States into the partially at
least into the main framework of
industrial society most of that was
coming from Washington and against the
states and in fact it was come if you
really look at who was behind that it
was often big business as opposed to
small business like big corporations
like say General Electric who were had
small labor forces and they were very
capital-intensive and had international
orientations they were supporting New
Deal measures the mainstream business
was
it was labor intensive and it wasn't
internationalized and for corporation
like GE it was better to have an
organized workforce that didn't carry
out wildcat strikes and that you know
you could be sure it was gonna work
pretty regularly even if you paid him a
little more money because they weren't
labor intensive anyway and the
combination of centralized big business
and powerful popular movements operating
through Washington was able to overcome
the more distributed power of private
power that was in the state well you
know those are things that happen in
societies based on power you know power
structures so I don't think it's true
that centralization is centralization is
a bad thing in principle but not when
you have private power when you have
private power centralization can
sometimes be a good thing although
ultimately it's a bad thing and you want
to decentralize but only after other
structures of power are dismantled and
you can see it from American history you
know you really look at the details of
American history you see that's working
out quite commonly the central power of
the power of the central government has
been able to overcome the private power
which is more decentralized in the
interests of the population not always
but sometimes so I don't think they're
any simple formulas about that the real
problem is the private power
in my ignorance I believe that that
perception of world event was the real
world
now I find out that it's not and that
there are many other hidden things going
on my question I put you today is how to
identify the real sources and because
you would obviously have access
I just went through I don't have access
to anything you don't there's no secrets
in this game and furthermore there is no
method other than the method that you
would pursue if you were taking a
biology class or a chemistry class you
have to try to figure out how to
evaluate evidence and that's just the
skill that you learn I mean when you're
doing the Natural Sciences that's what
it's about you know it's like
apprenticeship you pick up the skill of
trying to figure out how to evaluate
evidence and test theories and see what
makes sense and so on you do the same
thing in ordinary life you can't there
is no source you can go to that's going
to tell you the truth ultimately you
rely on your own critical faculties
period there's nothing more to say about
I mean you should take for granted
that any powerful institution like say
the New York Times of the six o'clock
news is obviously going to try to
mislead and control you I mean that
should be a truism what are they in
business for you know
