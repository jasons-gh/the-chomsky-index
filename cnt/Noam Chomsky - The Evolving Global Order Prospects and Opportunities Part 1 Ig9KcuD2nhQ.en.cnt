you
thank you
there have been clearly quite
significant changes in global order
they're underway right now but before
turning to them i like to say just a
word about the fact that they may not
continue for very long there's an
unfortunate reason the reason you all
know i'm sure is that for the first time
in human history we are facing realistic
questions of species survival at least
in any decent form that concern is not
new but unfortunately nothing much has
been done about it
over half a century ago in July 1955 two
of the greatest figures of the 20th
century Bertrand Russell and Albert
Einstein issued an extraordinary appeal
to the people of the world to face a
choice that in their words is stark and
dreadful and inescapable shall we put an
end to the human race or shall mankind
renounce war Russell and Einstein were
of course thinking of nuclear war there
have been many very close calls since
it's kind of a miracle but speeches have
survived this far and they continue in
fact even in recent weeks there's time I
may say something about them and there's
a companion threat which they didn't
realize at the time but it's now
understood that's environmental disaster
meeting in bond right now that almost
certainly will have no outcome that is
supposed to deal with it the threat of
environmental disaster was highlighted
a report last week from the
International Energy Agency a report was
that the greenhouse gas emissions had
increased by a record amount last year
despite the recession and that the
chances are now quite slim for holding
global warming 22 degree Celsius level
that's considered to be the threshold
for really dangerous climate change and
we may have passed it I'll return
briefly to both of these matters merely
noting that they cast a dark shadow over
any discussion of global order well
let's put those grim prospects to the
side and consider the evolving global
order one major theme widely discussed
is what's called American decline it's
real but i think it's sometimes
misinterpreted it's commonly described
as another stage in a long term shift of
global hegemony from east to west
crossing the atlantic and now moving
across the Pacific to the rising powers
and China and India and their recent
growth is indeed spectacular but I think
this is an error interpretation
though there is a significant global
shift I think it may be different than
this one well proceeding to approach
that let's look back briefly to the
evolution of the contemporary global
order beginning with World War two and
it made a huge change the changes in
continuities since that time are
significant they're very real and
they're quite instructive it's worth
thinking about them from the outset of
the war in 1939 Washington anticipated
that the war would end in with the
United States in a position of
overwhelming power there were high level
meetings right through the war 1939-1945
high-level government officials and
non-governmental foreign policy
specialists they meant to lay out plans
for the post-war world they delineate
'add what they called a grand area that
the u.s. was going to dominate and it
included the entire western hemisphere
the entire Far East and the former
British Empire which the US would take
over including crucially its Middle East
energy reserves as Russia began to
grind down the Nazi Army's after
Stalingrad a grand area planning changed
the goals expanded to include as much of
Eurasia as possible at least its
economic war in Western Europe and
within the grand area there were certain
policies which still hold I simply read
them within the grand area of the United
States would maintain unquestioned power
with military and economic supremacy and
it would ensure the limitation of any
exercise of sovereignty by states that
might interfere with its global designs
these are doctrines that still prevail
though the ability to impose them has
declined it's very clear from the
documentary record that President
Roosevelt was aiming at United States
hegemony in the postwar world I'm
quoting the accurate assessment by one
of the leading diplomatic historians
British historian Jeffrey Warner one of
the major specialists on the topic and
much more significant the careful
wartime plans were very soon implemented
in thoughtfully and in great detail and
it's not surprising that the u.s. had
those plans at that time the United
States was in a position of historically
unprecedented power it had literally
fifty percent of the world's wealth
incomparable security control the
Western Hemisphere control both oceans
that controlled the opposite sides of
both oceans State Department planning
which was largely in the hands of George
Kennan the head of the State Department
planning staff it assigned to each
region of the world what they called its
function in Latin America the function
was to fulfill the monroe doctrine of
1823 the doctrine announced that the US
would dominate the hemisphere but
couldn't be implemented at the time the
British were much too powerful but after
the Second World War you could implement
the monroe doctrine that was our little
region over here that is the Secretary
of War Henry Stimson explained while
demanding that all regional alliances be
dismantled except for our own which
would be expanded the function of
Southeast Asia was to provide resources
and raw materials to the former colonial
masters the United States had little
interest in Africa at the time so cannon
assigned Africa to Europe to exploit his
word for Europe to exploit for its
reconstruction could imagine a different
relation between you
in Africa in the light of history but
that wasn't considered as for Europe
itself it was to be reconstituted but in
a very specific way it was to be
reconstituted only after labor and the
left were suppressed that's the core of
the anti-fascist resistance of course
they had to be suppressed and the
traditional order had to be
reestablished including fascist
collaborators that sometimes recovery
required considerable violence and
large-scale subversion continued for
many years Italy into nude well into the
1970s for Germany it was necessary I'm
quoting to veto the major Union
constitutions to forcefully terminate
social experiments to bar early
co-determination efforts and more
generally to wall off the Western Zone
from the east that was cannons
interesting phrase planners were
concerned that they would not be able to
compete with social and economic
pressures coming from the east so
therefore the western Germany had to be
walled off that meant left labour
influences and they were very explicit
about it then later came the Marshall
Plan which
doubtless aided European reconstruction
but it had other goals as well in
reality the Marshall Plan if you look at
what happened it was very largely a
taxpayer subsidy US taxpayer subsidy the
US businesses most of the money never
left the United States and that's
appreciated by the beneficiaries in the
United States the domestic beneficiaries
so Ronald Reagan's Commerce Department
pointed out that their words the
Marshall Plan set the stage for large
amounts of private US direct investment
in Europe laying the groundwork for the
rise of the multinational corporations
that time almost all American Business
Week the main business journal described
multinational corporations as the
economic expression of the political
framework expressed by established by
post-war policymakers in which American
business prospered and expanded on
overseas orders fueled initially by the
dollars of the Marshall Plan and
protected from negative developments by
the umbrella of American power that's
1975 it was always recognized
you're might choose to follow an
independent course perhaps along
goalless lines and NATO was partially
intended to counter that threat and that
was seen very clearly in when the in
1989 1990 when the official pretext for
NATO dissolve official pretext natives
there to protect Western Europe from the
Russian awards no more Russian hordes
anyone who believed the propaganda of
the preceding years should have expected
that tomato would dissolve on the
contrary it was expanded to the east in
violation of very explicit pledges but
only verbal pledges to Gorbachev who was
pretty upset when they were violated but
the Washington pointed out to him that
the pledges weren't on paper and if he
was stupid enough to accept the
gentlemen's agreement that's his problem
so in violation of the pledges expanded
to the east and since then it's been
expanded well beyond it's now a
officially us-run global intervention
force it's official
is controlling the crucial
infrastructure of the global energy
system pipeline sea lanes and so on
nevertheless what's called American
decline ism set in very quickly the
grand area began to unravel very
seriously by 1947 with what's called the
loss of China which is an interesting
terms the term constantly used debates
about who's responsible for the loss of
China and the phrases were thinking
about that you can only lose what you
possess and legitimate ownership of the
world has just taken for granted it's
not surprisingly given given the scale
of us power Southeast Asia began to go
the same way first in Indochina but much
more seriously in Indonesia much more
valuable prize in 1958 President
Eisenhower carried out the largest
intervention in post since World War two
the goal was to support a military
revolt overthrowing the government the
idea was to split off the outer island
that's where most of the rich resources
are that failed but in 1965 there was a
us back to military coup in Indonesia
which installed the dictatorship of
general suharto carried it out with
staggering bloodbath that was a gleam of
light in Asia in the words of the New
York Times hundreds of thousands of
people were slaughtered mostly landless
peasants and the country was thrown open
to Western exploitation euphoria and the
West was virtually unconstrained years
later the McGeorge Bundy who was the
national security adviser for presidents
Kennedy and Johnson he reflected in
retrospect that the United States should
probably have called off the Vietnam War
in 1965 since the major objective had
energy the major objective we know from
declassified documents was to prevent
what's called the virus of independent
nationalism from spreading contagion to
the rest of the region possibly even
Japan is called the super domino by the
eminent Asia historian John dower the
fear of contagion from
the virus of independent nationalism
that's the terminology later Henry
Kissinger Nixon administration that's a
leading theme of post-war history one of
the major themes in fact well our little
region over here Latin America that
posed similar dangers early on in 1954
the United States overthrew the first
democratic government in Guatemala
installed a brutal dictatorship that
carried out horrendous crimes and
ultimately a virtual genocide of the
Mayans and the Highlands still fleeing
to the United States all with the strong
support of the Reagan administration but
the contagion nevertheless spread in
1962 President Kennedy shifted the
mission of the Latin American military
which of course the United States can do
it shifted the mission from hemispheric
defense which was a kind of a holdover
from World War two to internal security
internal security has a very definite
meaning means war against the population
brutal war and the consequences are
described by Charles mate sling he's the
man who led counterinsurgency and
internal defense planning in the Kennedy
and Johnson administration's he
described Kennedy's 1962 decision quote
him as a shift from toleration
the opacity and cruelty of the Latin
American military to direct complicity
in their crimes to us support for the
methods of Heinrich Himmler's
extermination squads just recently
Cambridge University Press published the
academic history the Cold War Latin
American one of the contributions is by
Latin American scholar John John
coatsworth and he wrote writes that from
that time the early 60s to the Soviet
collapse in 1990 quoting the numbers of
political prisoners torture victims
executions of non-violent political
dissenters in Latin America vastly
exceeded those of the Soviet Union and
its east european satellites all
supported sometimes instituted by
washington that included a long series
of religious martyrs and mass slaughter
as well the last major violent act was
the week after the Berlin Wall fell and
brutal assassination of six leading
Latin American intellectuals Jesuit
priests the perpetrators were an elite
Salvadoran battalion which already had
left a trail of thousands of brutally
murdered victims
had just come from renewed training at
the John F Kennedy School of Special
Warfare and they were acting on direct
we now know on direct orders of the high
command of the US client state which was
in always close contact with Washington
well the consequences of this
hemispheric plague still of course
reverberate from the wartime years in
fact since the dawn of the oil age back
during the First World War control of
the Middle East was regarded as a very
high priority in President Eisenhower's
judgment the Middle East was the most
strategically important area of the
world it was a stupendous source of
strategic power probably the richest
economic prize in the world in the field
of foreign investment that's the
judgment of the State Department in the
1940s and that was a prize that the
United States intended to keep for
itself and its allies in the unfolding
new world order of that day well
problems also arose there very early in
the oil-producing regions in 1953 the
United States and Britain overthrew the
parliamentary regime of prime minister
Massa dev and Iran installed the data
dictatorship of the Shah and the general
reaction of liberal intellectual elites
was expressed very clearly by the new
york times editors
underdeveloped countries with rich
resources and now have an object lesson
in the heavy cost that must be paid by
one of their number which goes for circa
with fanatical nationalism it's too much
to hope that Iran's experience will
prevent the rise of masa dicks in other
countries but that experience may at
least strengthen the hands of more
reasonable and more far-seeing leaders
who will have a clear-eyed understanding
of the principles of decent behavior
decent behavior means you follow us
orders and you don't try to take over
your own resources that's liberal
progressive end of the spectrum go to
the right it's harsh consequences of
that are too well-known the review well
that's the mirrors sketch of
implementation of grand area policies in
what's called the global south the
preferred version of the post-war area
here is quite different SEC expressed
quite well by the lead article in the
current issue of Britain's Prime foreign
policy journal international affairs it
discusses his own quoted the visionary
international order of the second half
of the 20th century marked by the
universalization of an American vision
commercial prosperity well there's
something to that account but it does
not quite convey the perception of those
who are at the wrong end to the guns and
that's typical of Western ideological
pronouncements gold scholarship and
journalism and so on grand area doctrine
restricts the sovereignty of others but
it grants the United States unrestricted
rights among these is the right to carry
out unilateral military intervention at
will and that doctrine has repeatedly
been articulated for example by the
Clinton administration it explained that
the US has the right to use military
force unilaterally to ensure quoting
uninhibited access to key markets energy
supplies and strategic resources and the
US must maintain military forces forward
deployed in Europe and Asia in order to
shape people's opinions about us not by
handing out chocolate bars and to shape
events that will affect their livelihood
and our security then notice that that
the Clinton doctrine was considerably
more extreme than the Bush Doctrine the
Bush Doctrine received a lot of
criticism but more because of the style
and the content that Clinton presented
it politely Pleasant words and so on the
Bush administration presented with
extreme arrogance and European leaders
don't like to be insulted
the doctor in fact they accept it but
presented to us politely please the same
principles govern the invasion of Iraq
after a few years was becoming quite
clear that the United States was unable
to impose its will in Iraq and at that
point the actual goals of the invasion
that couldn't be concealed any longer
behind the usual pretty rhetoric in
november two thousand seven the white
house issued they called a declaration
of principles which insisted that US
forces must remain indefinitely in iraq
free to carry out combat operations and
that iraq must privilege American
investors two months later January 2008
the President Bush informed Congress
that he would reject legislation that
might limit the permanent stationing of
US armed forces in Iraq or us control of
the oil resources of Iraq very explicit
all of this of course had been concealed
before you know nice rhetoric about
democracy the usual these were demands
that the United States had to abandon in
the face of Iraqi resistance that was
another step in a major defeat it's
quite unlike Vietnam where the US did
achieve its major Ames that as was
recognized by McGeorge Bundy for example
well throughout these years despite the
many successes American decline ISM
continued by
nineteen seventy the u.s. share of
global wealth had declined to about
twenty-five percent still enormous but
much less than the post-war height of
fifty percent the other industrial
powers had recovered with considerable
assistance from us of islands so the
Korean War was a major stimulus to
Japan's recovery and the Vietnam War
gave it another significant boost it
also helped to spark South Korea's
remarkable development from the level of
a poor African state to a leading
industrial power substantial share of
some of Korea South Korea's foreign
exchange in the 1960s came from
mercenaries dishes were little
mercenaries that they were supplying
providing for the American war in
Vietnam hundreds of thousands of
decolonisation was proceeding following
it's agonizing course by 1970 the
industrial world was described as bipole
tri-polar all three North America and
Western Europe and East Asia at that
time japan-based and already beginning
to become the most dynamic industrial
region of the world well one revealing
index of the decline of us power is
vetoes at the United Nations until
nineteen sixty-five there were
the world was under control and the UN
in fact could be used as a weapon
against the Soviet Union since nineteen
sixty-five the United States is far in
the lead in vetoes on a very wide range
of issues in Britain a second and no one
else is even close in the 1970s there
were also quite radical changes in the
entire state capitalist system with the
twin processes of financialization of
the economy and for the u.s. the
offshoring of production that these
effects have been substantial and
they've contributed to a self-inflicted
acceleration of American decline return
to that decline has continued in the new
millennium very dramatic developments
have taken place in our little region
over here in the past decade for the
first time in 500 years since the days
of the European conquerors the countries
of South America have begun to deal with
their terrible internal problems rule by
a small Europeanized often white Hayley
with enormous wealth these are just
little islands and sea of miserable
poverty they've begun to deal with it
and they've also begun to move towards
integration that's a prerequisite for
independence the US has been expelled
from all of its military bases in South
America one symbol of the current
developments is the formation of an
organization select which includes all
states of the Western Hemisphere apart
from the US and canada that would have
been unthinkable before its first
meeting is scheduled in a few weeks and
if it becomes operational that'll be
another step in undoing them under a
doctrine well control of Latin America
was always considered a cornerstone of
global dominance one dramatic moment was
under the Nixon administration when it's
preparing for the overthrow of Chilean
democracy the National Security Council
Planning Board observed that if the
United States could not control Latin
America it could not expect to achieve a
successful order elsewhere in the world
that is to control the rest of the world
Washington's credibility would be
undermined Henry Kissinger put it was
planning the overthrow of the Democrat
this concern as Kissinger explained was
that others too might separate
themselves from us control if the
Chilean virus was not destroyed before
it could spread contagion his freight he
was actually concerned with southern
Europe he thought that was the period of
what was called euro communism kind of
Social Democratic movements and Spain
and Italy and Kissinger was concerned
that the Chilean virus might spread
contagion there he didn't expect chilean
army to land and rome but he was afraid
that the model might inspire others
actually Brezhnev shared that concern at
the time for other reasons therefor
parliamentary democracy and Chile had to
go that actually happened on what in
Latin America is often called the first
911 September 11th 1973 let's go on from
history in the West now though in terms
of the consequences for chili and the
whole region that far outweighs the
terrible crimes of what we call 911
September 11 2001 well important as
Latin America was for world control it
paled
alongside the Middle East already
mentioned some assessments of its
significance at the dawn of the post-war
age despite all the changes since it's
is every reason to suppose that today's
policymakers and basically adhere to the
judgment of very influential Roosevelt
advisor aberle who observed that control
of the incomparable energy reserves of
the Middle East would yield substantial
control of the world and correspondingly
notice that that doesn't mean access to
the resources in fact they didn't much
care about that it's control or a
different matter correspondingly the
loss of that control would threaten the
project of global dominance that was
very clearly articulated during World
War two and has been sustained in the
face of major changes in World Order
ever since that day but that's being
threatened to right now us dominance and
in that region is under severe threat
that's the Arab Spring the Arab world is
beginning to move in the same direction
as Latin America in the past decade
that's the democratic uprising of the
Arab Spring and the US and its Western
Allies are sure to do whatever they can
to prevent an authentic democracy in the
Arab world it's very important to
understand
and to understand why it's sufficient to
take a look at the studies of our public
opinion these are conducted by the most
respected us polling agencies in the
United States that not reported all
barely mentioned elsewhere you can tell
me whether they reported here but
they're certainly known to planners they
reveal that by overwhelming majorities
Arabs regard the United States and
Israel as the major threats they face
ninety percent in Egypt most important
country in the region there are some in
the Arab world and think of Iran as a
threat ten percent opposition to US
policy is so strong that a majority in
the Arab world believe that security
would be improved if Iran had nuclear
weapons to deter the United States in
Egypt that's eighty percent of the
population and other figures are pretty
much similar well the conclusion is that
if public opinion were to influence
policy as would happen if there's any
serious move towards democracy then the
United States would not only can not
control the region but it would be
expelled from along with its allies that
would undermine fundamental principles
of global domination the contempt of a
lead opinion for democracy was revealed
very dramatically in the reaction to the
WikiLeaks exposures the ones that
received the most attention euphoric
commentary that were cables reporting
that Arab support the US stand on Iran
the reference was to the ruling
dictators the attitudes of the public
were unmentioned so it's enough if the
dictator support us doesn't matter
public is radically opposed and there's
a guiding principle that was articulated
pretty clearly by the Middle East
specialists of the Carnegie Endowment
Marwan Roger is formally a high official
of the Jordanian dictatorship the
principle is there's nothing wrong
everything's under control in short if
the dictators support us and they
control the population nothing else
could matter that's the Western
conception of democracy very clearly
exhibit the washer doctrine is rational
and very venerable not to mention just
one case that's highly relevant today
and ought to be taught to everyone in
schools in the West there was internal
discussion in 1958 there's an Eisenhower
and Eisenhower expressed concern about
what he called the campaign of hatred
against us in the Arab world not by
governments but by the people and the
National Security Council issued a
memorandum explaining it they say they
said that there's a perception in the
Arab world that the United States
supports dictatorships and blocks
democracy and development and we do it
in order to ensure control over their
resources and furthermore they said the
perception is basically accurate and
that's
actually what we should be doing relying
on the washer doctrine long as the
dictators can keep the population their
control that matter what they think this
campaign of hatred who cares after 911
there were you may recall that George
Bush president plaintively pleaded that
they hate our freedom echoed by many
intellectuals the government actually
carried out a study and it confirmed
that they do not hate our freedom they
hate our policies and with good reason
namely the ones that the National
Security Council described in 1958 the
truth of the matter is we hate their
freedom and with very good reason we
being the governments of the West and a
lead opinion in the West well in Egypt
though the old regime still remains
pretty much in place there have been
important victories the press is far
more free labor organizing which was
brutally crushed under the
western-backed dictatorships it now
proceeds effectively and the struggle
for democracy is unabated is going on
constantly now opposes serious threats
to the United States and Israeli client
for the first time in 30 years Egypt has
allowed Iranian ships to transit the
Suez Canal into the Mediterranean which
is supposed to be an American Lake
actually just yesterday you
was reported that the Iranian submarines
were allowed the transit into the
Mediterranean Egypt is also planning to
exchange ambassadors with Iran for the
first time Egypt has partially opened
the Gaza border if it proceeds it breaks
the us-israeli siege which is designed
to keep the people of Gaza the barest
level of survival Egypt has also
brokered an agreement between Hamas and
Fatah two major Palestinian factions
that interferes with us Israeli policies
that go back 20 years to separate Gaza
and the West Bank it's an explicit
violation of the Oslo Accords but the
purpose is to undermine the prospects
for a viable Palestinian state well
there's something more threatening in
the background the Egyptian public is
strongly opposed to the way the 1979
Egypt Israel treaty has been interpreted
by the us-backed dictators articulating
the Western interpretation of the treaty
the New York Times describes it as a
cornerstone of the region's stability
that's true only if we understand the
term stability in the technical sense of
foreign policy discourse it means
conformity to us demands it's a standard
usage in reality it's a cornerstone of
the region's instability it was
understood at once
by that the effect of the Egyptian
defection as it was called would be to
free Israel to sustain military
operations against the Palestinian
organizations in Lebanon as well as
settlement activity in the West Bank I'm
quoting one of Israel's leading
strategic analysts of Marion eve and
it's obvious you remove the Egyptian
deterrent the only major deterrent in
the Arab world can proceed to do with
July and in fact Israel at once prepared
to invade Lebanon as it did in nineteen
eighty two strong support from the
Reagan administration killed maybe
20,000 people destroyed much of the
country it sought to establish a puppet
regime didn't quite succeed and the
purpose was to consolidate control over
the West Bank and that was frankly
admitted it was no security concern also
a settlement in the occupied territories
all illegal proceeded very rapidly and
problem is that further progress in
toward democracy in Egypt might
seriously threaten the form of so-called
stability that the US seeks to impose
well as I mentioned our public opinion
strongly supports an Iranian nuclear
weapons program but that doesn't mean
that we should do so could be extremely
dangerous and if you read the foreign
policy literature even the press it's
full of proposals as to how to deal with
this potential threat one proposal
studiously ignored the one that's very
strongly favored by most of the world
namely established a nuclear weapons
free zone in the Middle East now that
issue regularly arises at the regular
meetings the conferences of the
non-proliferation treaty conference
every five years last one was at the UN
headquarters in New York last year at
that point Egypt was the chair of the
hundred and eighteen nations of the
non-aligned movement it's most of the
world they proposed that the conference
call for negotiations on a Middle East
nuclear weapons free zone that had been
formally agreed by the West including
the United States at the 1995 review
conference but didn't do anything about
it well international support last year
was so overwhelming that the Obama
administration formerly had to agree
while saying fine idea but not now
furthermore they insisted that Israel be
exempted and of course the u.s. is self
exempted from international obligations
and quite interesting ways which are not
well understood Washington informed the
conference that no proposal quoting it
now no proposal can call for Israel's
nuclear program to be placed under the
auspices of the International Atomic
Energy Agency and no proposal can call
for release of information about Israeli
nuclear facilities and activities
including information pertaining to
previous nuclear transfers to Israel
well so much for nuclear weapons free
zone
that's one of the many ways in which the
threat of nuclear war is being advanced
right now it's worth bearing in mind how
isolated the United States and its
allies are on Iran the non-aligned
countries again most of the world for
years they've been vigorously endorsing
Iran's right to pursue the uranium
enrichment the Arab world as I mentioned
even wants them to go on to nuclear
weapons the most important country in
the region turkey is improving
commercial relations with Iran a very
natural trading partner and it's a noun
announced plans to triple its relations
at the most respected country of the
global south Brazil has also strongly
supported Iran's position that's most of
the world well the United States can
tolerate a Turkish and Brazilian
disobedience though with dismay but
China is harder to ignore the press
warns I'm quoting the New York Times
that China's investors and traders are
now filling a vacuum in Iran as
businesses from other countries
especially in Europe pull out the Europe
is obedient to us orders but China is
these sanctions have absolutely no
status those are unilateral US sanctions
China does observe the UN sanctions but
that's because their toothless the issue
has to do with the unilateral US
sanctions in particular China is
expanding its dominant role in Iran's
energy industry well Washington is
set and they're reacting with a touch of
desperation the State Department issued
a warning to China that if it wants to
be accepted in the international
community that's another technical term
like stability the international
community means the United States and
anybody who happens to be going along
with it at the moment so if they want to
be accepted in the international
community then China must not skirt and
evade international responsibilities
which are clear namely follow us orders
as I said China does accept the
relatively toothless UN sanctions but it
ignores unilateral US sanctions it's
there for undermining stability and the
technical sense it's an illegitimate
exercise of sovereignty in violation of
grand area principles that need not say
that china is quite unimpressed by the
stern warning their picture is we've
been around for 3,000 years disregarding
the barbarians and we'll continue
and that's very disturbing to the United
States will the hegemonic doctrines that
were formulated during World War two
they still prevail but the cap tragedy
to implement them is declining as the
world is becoming more diverse more
independent but they're also as I
mentioned there are domestic factors
contributing to America's decline the
society is being quite consciously
undermined at home by the people who
Adam Smith that called the Masters of
mankind those who control the economic
system the time to go into the details
but since the sharp economic shift
towards financialization and offshoring
of production in the 1970s a variety of
factors have converged to create a
vicious cycle of a radical concentration
of wealth mostly in the top 1% one-tenth
of one percent actually of the
population such as small groups I picked
up by census figures that's where the
heavy any call extreme inequality is
coming from that means CEOs you know
directors corporations and hedge fund
managers and so on their activities are
little if any benefit to the economy
probably harmful to it but that's where
the economic power is concentrated and
concentration of economic power
translates at once to concentration of
political power it's another point
emphasized by the dangerous radical Adam
Smith who wished with the worship but

electoral campaigns have skyrocketed

both political parties deeper into the
pockets of concentrated capital
increasingly financial capital and for
the Republicans this is reflexive the
Democrats are not far behind where's a
lot of commentary about the
disappearance of moderate moderate
Republicans that's not quite accurate
they're still there they're now called
Democrats everything
shifted so far to the right that old
fashioned moderate Republicans are now
the leading Democrats and
