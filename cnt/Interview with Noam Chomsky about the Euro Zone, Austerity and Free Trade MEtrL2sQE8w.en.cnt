click on my context defaults welcome to
context TV our guest is today and mighty
linguist us critic dissident an activist
Noam Chomsky Chomsky is supporter of
context TV three years after the last
interview with context TV we again get
the chance to talk to him no I'm Tom
Scavo to meet scientists Noam Chomsky
has become world famous with his
research on a universal grammar on which
all languages are based today he's seen
as the father of modern linguistics and
the sixties Chomsky opposed the US war
in Vietnam Cambodia and Laos since then
he has published dozens of books about
u.s. foreign policy with emphasis on
Latin America Southeast Asia and Middle
East about state-based capitalism and
the mass media ina sana populist
enthusiast manufacturing consent the
political one of his most popular books
is manufacturing constant the political
economy of the mass media written in
1988 in which Chomsky and the political
scientist at waderman
developed a model on how propaganda
works in modern and free societies at
the books by Chomsky our hegemony or
survival profit over people 9/11 and
occupy ethnic to shift occupy at the age
of 85 Chomsky keeps giving interviews
comments the politics of the day is
holding talks around the world and
supports movements and activists however
he almost never appears on US mainstream
media we said together with Noam Chomsky
in his office at their Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in Cambridge
welcome to context Divya Noam Chomsky
thank you I want to talk about the euro
crisis austerity measures have been
applied to several countries like Greece
Portugal Spain the German government is
in the lead of this policy to cut wages
to cut Social Security to privatize
state-owned companies what is your
assessment of this policy and what is
the future of the eurozone any of you if
your future of the eurozone looks pretty
dim unless
primarily Germany changes its stance
Germany has also been in the lead in
trying to impose austerity on the
peripheral countries the south and
Ireland which is kind of ironic if you
look back at recent history after the
Second World War Germany had a huge debt
it was forgiven that's how Germany was
able to recover Europe essentially
forgave the debt in 1953 the Federal
Republic was practically collapsing and
it appealed for debt relief essentially
from Europe and was given considerable
assistance at restructuring and cutting
its debt well you know after that
Germany was able to grow its way out of
the crisis became the industrial center
of of Europe major industrial center of
Europe and now Germany's in the lead and
trying to prevent similar policies in
the countries that have been pretty much
harmed by the way the specific way the
eurozone developed including by German
banks so that the problem in the south
is mostly a banking crisis in Spain for
example the budget was in good shape in
2007 the collapse was a basically a
banking scandal same in Ireland and it's
a two-way thing the banking scandal it's
the Spanish and Irish banks but also the
lenders like the Bundesbank and deutsche
bank and so on so it's a two-way affair
and it's essentially a banking crisis
not a government crisis and the
consequences are just what you described
in Germany in fact the Mario Draghi head
of the ECB stated it pretty frankly in
an interview to The Wall Street Journal
he said the social contract is dead yeah
well you know that's the consequence of
austerity just on pure economic grounds
austerity is no way to grow up get out
of a crisis it just makes it worse and
you can see it the last few years in
fact the ECB sort of pulled back from it
the IMF has pulled back from it you've
probably saw the a recent slight
somewhat hushed up scandal here about
the famous Rothstein Rogoff article
which was used as the intellectual
foundation of the austerity programs it
turns out they made some arithmetic
errors and when you correct them shows
as well if a student found it and then a
couple of faculty members joined in
published a paper about it but the
general reaction is well it's still true
that that harms growth which it does in
the long run but as cain said the
long-run world did it doesn't in the
short run in fact it's probably a good
thing it's one of the ways to encourage
the man deficit that is as a way to
encourage demand at a time when nothing
else is doing it like in the United
States the banks and the corporations
the real perpetrators of the crisis and
they're bigger and richer than ever they
had so much cash they don't what to do
with it but they're not investing and
they're not investing for a number of
reasons for one thing because there's
enough demand so why bother others so
who's going to create consumers can't
create the man they're still struggling
with a household debt that accumulated
during the crisis created by the banks
but it's got to be the government and no
deficits do in fact provide stimulate
demand there are better ways but it does
but it's a coming deficit is not a
problem it's a problem for the banks and
therefore it's the center of
political debate because of their
political power but for the population
that's pulls through very clearly the
there's a much more realistic picture
problem is jobs lack of jobs is that's
destroying a whole generation with all
kind of consequences of the future
you're even worse and it's also harming
the economy huge amount of potential
growth is being destroyed because we
have to worry about the non-existent
threat of inflation goes banks might not
like that if it ever happened so if we
have a sequester now in the United
States but about the deficit not about
jobs another indication of the
fragmentation of democracy under the
neoliberal programs been going on for
some time public just has less and less
say and never had a lot of say but now
it has less and less say over policy and
this pretty well studied in the United
States about 70 percent of the
population
lower 70 percent on the income scale
essentially have no influence on policy
nobody pays attention to them influence
goes up as you move higher at the very
top you run the show pretty much as Adam
Smith described the long time ago but
that's what we see happening before our
eyes it's not irreversible and plenty of
protest might crystallize into popular
movements which will compel serious
changes but a long way to go than
Germany's in the center of it because of
its power Obama also wants to cut Social
Security like Medicare against
overwhelming popular opposition but
that's true on everything and it takes a
different different issue gun control I
mean 90% of the population wanted it
shut down by Congress you know that's
soon but yes the the standard line elite
line is we have to cut benefits
they don't call it entitlements they're
called and that's not a problem a social
security is not a fiscal problem a small
fiscal problem can pretty easily be
patched up over time
health care is a problem Medicare
expenditures are going up and will harm
the economy but for a reason that you're
not supposed to discuss it's because of
dysfunctional privatized system the
privatized system just virtually
unregulated is highly dysfunctional it
has maybe twice the per capita costs of
osed countries and relatively poor
outcomes and in fact you see it on the
front pages every day except with very
little comment so one of the elements of
so-called Obamacare was to encourage
local organizations to provide aid for
disabled adults but it's the United
States so was handed over to private
corporations so they're doing what every
business tries to do make money so it's
a big scandal you know there's all kind
of people what they say is they're
people going in it's the people you know
people are perfectly well going in and
using the equipment and so on
it's these bad people it's not these bad
people it's what you happen happens when
you put things in private hands that's
their job it's not that they're bad
people either the job of a CEO is to
increase profits you can do it by
ripping off the government so much the
better
but until that's handled and in fact the
pretty good studies by Khan is showing
that if we could simply get health care
expenditures to the level of say
European countries not utopian goal we
would have no debt no deficit problem I
probably have a surplus before to noon
it seems that free trade negotiations
between the United States and Europe
could start by June this year it would
be the largest
have a free trade deal in the u.s. you
already have NAFTA and several other
free trade agreements there's also talk
about the u.s. middle-east free trade
area the EU has recently signed free
trade agreements with Peru and Colombia
among others and pushes economic
partnership agreements with countries of
the African Caribbean and also the
Pacific Group of State what is the
strategy behind free trade and forced by
the United States and European countries
but the first thing to say about it
they're not free trade agreement you
take a look at the rules of the
agreements which are like the World
Trade Organization rules are highly
protectionist of their elements of
liberalisation there are elements of
extreme protectionism the like the
extraordinary patent regime which never
existed in the past and others some of
it don't even have to do with trade has
to do with privileges for investors
there is some liberalisation but you
know a tariffs in and among these
countries are not a big issue
they're pretty slight and don't have
much effect so it's it's primarily an
investor rights agreements and has all
kinds of effects like you can see them
every if if you couldn't figure them out
in advance you can see them like
austerity so they take the North
American Free Trade Agreement well one
of the consequences which was obvious at
once is it's going to destroy Mexican
agriculture Mexican campesinos are quite
efficient but don't were able to compete
with highly subsidized highly subsidized
the US agribusiness so that means I will
get crushed and small business will be
crushed can't compete with US
multinationals obvious consequence
you're going to have people fleeing
across the border so now we have an
immigration crisis well yeah it's called
an immigration crisis I don't think it
is but how much of it is just due to the
fact that we purposely unconsciously
created a crisis in Mexico from which
people can escape just by flee in fact
one person will understood it was Bill
Clinton when NAFTA was passed 1994 he
immediately started militarizing the
border I made sent you know we're
creating a refugee flow we better stop
them and this is simply not free trade
agreements so whatever we can talk about
them but not in those terms
