either there will be a world without war
or there won't be a world to the words
of the political scientist and
philosopher Noam Chomsky but was there
are a plenty from Ukraine to the Middle
East to the West self-styled war on
terror so how is this world to survive
Noam Chomsky joins us now from Boston
Noam Chomsky thanks for joining us
Ukraine a possible ceasefire on Sunday
how worried are you about Putin and
about the West's reaction to him and to
Ukraine it's no doubt a
serious and threatening situation the
ceasefire is welcome but it's glimmer of
hope as was pointed out we'll have to
wait and see but the but the
confrontation is quite serious the
Europeans are making an effort to try to
reach a peaceful accommodation but it's
not going to be easy there are serious
issues involved well do you believe that
we acted rightly over Crimea do you
think that in fact the West have dealt
with the antecedents of this problem
intelligently well the antecedents of
the problem go back to the fall of the
Berlin Wall
immediately afterwards Gorbachev made a
remarkable proposal he offered to allow
a unified Germany to join NATO a hostile
military alliance looking at the history
of the century that's quite a concession
there was a quid pro quo the term that
was borrowed take the term that was used
there was a promise a verbal promise by
the United States that NATO would not
expend one inch to the east
meaning East Germany would say at once
expanded NATO DS Germany when Gorbachev
he was informed correctly that it was
only a verbal agreement there was
nothing on paper Clinton and expanded
NATO even further all the way to the
border of Russia those may be our our
mistakes but what about Putin I mean
surely this is a man who is beginning to
take the world backwards well depends
what you mean by backwards I mean I I
don't admire Putin but if we have to
recognize what's happening the new
government of Ukraine has recently
announced its plans to join NATO
just imagine say that in the 1980s of
the Warsaw Pact had expanded through
much of Latin America Mexico announced
its plans to join the Warsaw Pact how
would the United States have reacted
well of course it's academic because
long before that eventualities air would
have been extreme violence that's not a
bad analogy that does not justify
putin's reactions but we have to
understand the situation that russia
faces with expansion of a hostile
military alliance correct right to its
strategic can i take you to the can i
take you to the other faith theater of
terrible insecurity the Middle East
dominated suddenly by this war with Isis
is that something that we can win is it
is there going to be a Caliphate for all
time
do you see Isis is defeated should it be
defeated well Isis is an utter
monstrosity it's an outgrowth of
essentially two factors at first the
u.s. British invasion of Iraq which
incited sectarian conflicts which are
now tearing the country and in fact but
now the region apart and secondly the
extremist fundamentalist
doctrines along with funding coming from
wahabis Saudi Arabia those have
converged and created the major
monstrosity
unfortunately Isis the Islamic caliphate
is now almost a representative of Sunni
a large part of Sunni Islam that's and
sadly we've run completely out of time
but I hope you'll come on again tuned
and we'll continue thank you very much
indeed for joining us
you
