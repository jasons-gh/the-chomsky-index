mark Sanks good morning everybody
rainy day known thanks for joining us
who gave a great talk yesterday now he
is a strange thing
you are very well known yet I think we
were underestimated now what is
underestimated is your sense of humor
I'll give you a quote the political
spectrum in the United States always
very narrow has been reduced to near
invisibility here's another one American
policies with regard to Brazil in the
1950s a quote we find it hard to induce
people to accept our doctrine that the
rich should plunder the poor a public
relations problem that had not yet been
solved that's not my quote that's John
Foster Dulles the last the last sentence
about the public relations problem was
mine but his comment Dulles was we find
the Communists have an advantage over us
we find it hard to if they think that
the poor should plunder the rich that
was his comment and I say we find it
hard to convince people that the rich
should wonder the poor that's it do you
think this public relations issue has
now been solved if it was we wouldn't
have a global of terrorism campaigns
like Obama's drone campaign a thousand
military bases around the world
overthrowing governments of course not
it's the same no tomorrow there's a
party for the 1% here in the
neighborhood
we're in an era in which Hollywood
celebrates idiots as culture heroes
Great Gatsby wolf Wall Street is there
good news for the 99% and what kind of
news would you be looking for well the
good news is people like you people were
interested in overcoming the extreme
narrowness of the spectrum of political
discussion that you talked about the
enormous inequities and oppression than
the Society the last night the people
who are engaged and trying to end the
extremely ominous threat of nuclear war
and environmental catastrophe that's the
good news but that's always been the
good news
I mean class war goes on all the time
it's usually one-sided the business
classes are very dedicated to class war
they never relent constantly fighting it
and the question is whether there'll be
an opposition if there isn't
of course they move forward and you get
periods like the last generation of
vicious class war with no response
that's the general neoliberal assault on
the population around the world and you
see rising opposition that's the good
news
others are entering into the class war
the counterpart to the plutocracy the
super-rich the 1% is the precariat
working in very precarious conditions
including those on part-time contracts
short-term contracts migrants unemployed
youth seniors without a pension
do you see institutional improvements
for them
Rison well it's it's certainly true I
mean from the point of view of those
conducting the class war on the part of
the business classes and the government
closely linked to them the best thing
would be to have a population which is
living a precarious existence and this
is not a secret incidentally it's very
well understood by those waging war so
far one of the clearest statements of it
was by a man who used to be called Saint
Alan before 2007 when the system he
carefully constructed crashed totally
Alan Greenspan the former head of the
Federal Reserve when he was testifying
before Congress late eighties at the
time and he was late 90s he was
testifying about the marvels of the
terrific economy that he was running he
explained frankly that it was based on
what he called a growing worker
insecurity now from the point of
economists that's a very healthy thing
because if workers are insecure they're
not going to ask for benefits they're
not going to strike they're not going to
call for an increase in wages and you
get a more healthy economy now that is
an economy which is geared to what's
called efficiency it's an ideological
not an economic term and concentration
of wealth and concentration of power and
marginalization of the population so yes
a growing worker insecurity is very
healthy for the state of the economy but
also for the society in general if you
have a global for carriers as you say
then then it's possible for the other
actually there's another term that
corresponds to precariat which should be
brought in that's blue
Donna me back around 2005 I think
Citibank produced a manual for investors
good advice for investors and it
described the way the world scene is
changing it said the world is being
divided into a plutonomy and everyone
else everyone else's that precariat
plutonomy is a small sector concentrated
in the united states but plenty of other
places England by now China you know the
India so that even the poorest countries
in the world there are people who are
rich to the point of you know just
beyond extraordinary so there is a
global plutonomy with course heavily
concentrated then there's the precariat
who live under conditions of insecurity
like say adjuncts and universities or
where the temps of the university system
they're very useful for the for those
who run the university whether it's the
legislature or the trustees or whatever
happens to be if you have a large number
of temps doing the work very low
salaries no hope of advancement no
possibility more limited possibility of
organizing there is actually some but
not much then it sees they're easy to
control and you get a higher efficiency
and the ideological sense so a world
that's divided into economy and the
precariat would be a kind of a perfect
world well if the precariat is willing
to tolerated as always yeah last night
Aidan you talk you use the word of
course and that word implies that is
pattern and we are to recognize that
pattern and in your work on language you
are interested in deep
Universal grammar and you work on
politics likewise you're interested in
patterns kind of a grammar of politics
which you serve up or describe in very
plain language as power profit and
doublespeak
now in sense that this is how hegemon
states corporations and media behave
of course now in politics and economics
are there also questions that perplex
you that personal you that fall outside
the pattern or for which you have not
yet found to place in the pattern or a
name to give it plenty of factor I just
gave a series of lectures at Columbia on
philosophy department and one of them
was on the theme of something I called
40 years ago problems and mysteries
problems meaning by that a distinction
between matters that we are in principle
capable of understanding we may not
understand them but they fall within our
cognitive reach it's you can imagine how
we might understand that those are
problems mysteries simply fall behind
our cognitive reach and those are quite
deep-seated the right in the physicals
and sciences they're not recognized
enough but if you look over the history
of the physical sciences and then when
you get to the Social Sciences this
magnifies beyond the discussion but at
the core of the physical sciences the
hard physical sciences there are
mysteries for humans which are tacitly
understood to be beyond the level of
understanding human understanding
there's classic moments of this
you take the early modern science
revolution my scientific revolution
which began basically with Galileo and
his contemporaries young early 17th
century they wanted to overcome neo
scholastic mysticism going back to you
know with its Aristotelian origins
though they were confronting a
scientific world in which explanations
were given in terms of what were called
occult forces the sympathies and Tippa
these things fall to the ground because
that that's their natural place so on
and so forth they wanted to give real
Galileo and others wanted to give real
explanations and they had a concept of
explanation of intelligibility namely
had to be a mechanical explanation of
the world had to be accounted for as a
machine and by machine they meant
something very concrete some things that
an artisan could build somebody with
gears and levers and so on and so forth
and in fact it was supposed to have been
built by a super skilled artisan so the
next an intelligible account for say
Galileo that would be an account in
terms of mechanical principles was
called the mechanical philosophy the
philosophy just meant science in those
days so mechanical science the world is
a machine and Galileo recognized that he
was an incapable he lamented at the end
of his life he'd been incapable of
accounting for the motions of the
planets of the tides and so on and
mechanical terms so this was not yet
understood but the concept of
intelligibility was clear this goes
through the next century the great
scientists Huygens Descartes Leibniz
Newton all believed in the mechanical
philosophy and then a problem happened
then Newton discovered that it's false
the famous body mind probe
is based on the assumption that body is
inexplicable in mechanical terms mind
descartes recognized that there are
things that aren't explicable in
mechanical terms actually the main one
was normal use of language for good
reasons in fact but so that was the
basis of mind you had these two
substances Newton showed there are no
bodies
he showed that nothing is explicable in
mechanical terms there are no machines
this is totally misunderstood especially
in the social sciences where it's
assumed the mechanicals that Newton
showed that the world operates by
mechanical principles it's a big machine
he showed the opposite be sure that you
cannot account for it in mechanical
terms Newton regarded this is a complete
absurdity he said no person with any
scientific in intelligence could accept
this and he spent the rest of his life
trying to overcome it yeah at various
the problem was how can you account for
action at a distance interaction without
contact so how can it be if I move my
hands I move the moon you know there's
no contact
that's the mystical force but and he was
correct it was an absurdity but it was
true and it points to something that
goes beyond the level of human
intelligence how can we deal with the
world that's based on occult forces that
we cannot comprehend we have to accept
them because they're true but we can't
comprehend them well what happened
this was well understood by his
contemporaries by John Locke
later David Hume right through the 18th
century since then has been forgotten
the concept a science simply limited its
goals sciences since Newton have not
attempted to develop
an intelligible account of the universe
they have lowered the goals to try to
develop theories that are intelligible
that's a much lower goal but to
understand the theory is one thing to
understand that what it's talking about
is another thing but that goal has been
abandoned well there's a dramatic
example of something beyond the level of
human intelligence and it goes on from
there when you go into more complicated
things than basic physics it expands all
over the place so for example a human
choice or animal choice it's completely
unintelligible to us I mean you can't
deny that it happens we all know
perfectly well that we make choices and
we make decisions but it's completely
it's not right beyond the range of
existing science no one has a coherent
idea of how you could explain it
probably because it lies beyond the
bounds of the human cognitive capacities
I'm if you think of the things we can
understand they pretty much reduced to
determinism and randomness so we
understand things being determined like
a machine you know you turn a lever and
something else turns that are a
thermostat I mean that kind of thing we
understand the concept of random
behavior that was understood in the 17th
century you know some things just happen
randomly but suppose something falls
beyond the bounds of determinacy and
randomness well it's beyond our
cognitive capacities and that's what
we'll enjoy seem to be like so it's not
hard to find things of the time you're
talking about maybe it's a good idea to
talk about something simpler like
neoliberalism
that's much simpler well that's easy
that's easy to understand it's miss
names it's a very idea of a struggle
that is fought on only one side is
interesting here's a question on when we
criticize neoliberalism we must show its
contradictions and its limitations
because otherwise we do ourselves a
disservice and we play for the wrong
team the outside of neoliberalism as I
see it includes Nordic capitalism my old
neighborhood and I know it well
and part of emerging economies emerging
societies elements of it not in the
sense that these are rose gardens but in
the sense that they are different and
the differences are robust do you share
that view partly but I think we ought to
take a closer look at the concept the
new liberalism first of all is not new
and it's not liberal and so the term
neoliberalism already is propaganda it's
very old
old-fashioned class war old-fashioned
imperialism neoliberalism is basically
the programs that were imposed on what
became the third world you go back to
the 18th century actually the 17th
century the main industrial and
commercial centers of the world were
India and China and the difference
between the very rich and the very poor
was not very great maybe you know three
to one and but from the countries but
something happened then the main thing
that happened is that was called then
liberalism was imposed on the colonial
that colonized regions they were
compelled to follow market principles
the rich never did the rich do not
tolerate markets for themselves for very
good reasons they're too destructive so
this angle at first England and the
United States and Germany France you
know the rest of the developed countries
Japan imposed highly state-directed
forms of development the United States
was quite striking you probably all know
this history but it's worth bearing in
mind the when the colonies were
liberated they got advice on sound
economics from the greatest economists
of the day like Adam Smith and the
advice was follow the principles of
sound economics what we call
neoliberalism don't have tariffs no
protection because that you can prove
interferes with maximal efficiency for
the colonies that meant use British
manufactured goods which are much better
than yours concentrate on what you're
good at and what later came to be called
comparative advantage so produce
agricultural product ariel's
agricultural products fish fur and so on
and it takes a superior British
manufactured goods and crucially don't
try to monopolize the commodities for
which you have a natural advantage and
the important most important one in
those days of course was cotton the
cotton was kind of like the oil of the
early Industrial Revolution what did the
colonies do exactly the opposite in
every respect very high tariffs Vlach
superior British manufacturers develop
your own textile industry later in the
century the steel industry blocking
superior British products and so on all
the way across the line
massive state intervention in the
economy the railroads you know the
conquest of the territory extermination
of the population conquest of half of
Mexico slavery you know which is the
most extreme interference with market
principle you can think of monopoly
efforts strong efforts to monopolize
cotton the Mexican War was fought
largely to try to end the annexation of
Texas to try to obtain a monopoly of
cotton after the presidents were
explicit about this the Jacksonian
presidents Tyler Pope he said yes if we
can gain a monopoly of cotton we could
bring England to our feet
remember England was the beginning me
that was the powerful military state it
was blocking us expansion the u.s.
couldn't conquer Canada couldn't conquer
Cuba the British were just too strong
but we could bring Britain to our feet
if we could nice cotton and came pretty
close and of course over the century the
relations of power shifted that's how
the United States developed the right to
the present if you have a computer or
use the internet to fly an airplane you
know you use the pharmaceuticals you're
using the products substantially created
in the dynamic state sector of the
economy right to the present well that's
how the United States developed its the
way England developed before it it stole
technology from the Low Countries which
were more advanced from Ireland from
India of course and used methods that
are now blocked by the World Trade
Organization and cold piracy to develop
and it became now became the most
powerful industrial state and in fact
essentially without exception in this
city states like Hong Kong or minor
exceptions but this is the pattern of
development of the rich societies the in
oil market systems were forced down the
throat
the poor and they became the third world
neoliberalism it is an hour ever so how
is it applying to the Nordic capitalism
same way Europe right now is in the
midst of a extremely interesting process
by which the Europe was becoming
extremely undemocratic I mean the wall
street journal' for example not the
great radical parallel pointed out
recently that was something which is
correct if you take a look at European
countries no matter what government is
in power they follow exactly the same
policies it could be a communist run
government to the government the left
governor to the right they follow pretty
much the same policies because the
policies are dictated from Brussels the
policies are determined by Brussels
bureaucrats and windus Punk and so on
the Nordic countries are resisting a
little but it's being imposed by force
on the south well that's the and what
it's what it's doing is that take onto
this policy of austerity during
recession I mean even the IMF by now
recognizes that it's ludicrous from an
economic point of view IMF economists
have been publishing papers recently
saying this is crazy it's a way to
destroy an economy they understand that
but destroying the economy is not a bad
objective because the gold remember is
to establish a plutonomy
or precariat the goal is class war and
that means undermine and dismantle the
welfare state that then does and the
Nordic countries are partially bending
to this Sweden Norway and so on they're
holding back but it's the old policy of
the it's basically a policy of class war
which is constantly fought China Brazil
Taiwan well that's an interesting story
over the last generation
the neoliberal program some high school
the Washington Consensus have been
imposed on large parts of the world but
there has been resistance one region of
resistance was East Asia most of East
Asia East and Southeast Asia have
somewhat resisted this that's why you
get the great growth period they did not
accept the rules of the Washington
Consensus neoliberal rules so for
example take say South Korea had a
remarkable Industrial Development and
Taiwan - by completely rejecting the
rules the very much the way the American
colonies at Britain had before it or
Japan after the Meiji Restoration just
violate the rules radically I mean so
radically that in South Korea for
example the export of capital was not
only blocked but you could get the death
penalty for it now they weren't fooling
around
and yes they develop although it's
backing off now in many ways the other
region that's extremely significant I
think is South America and that's the
last decade I'm in South America was a
loyal follower of the rules and it had
two devastating decades of falling to
pieces under neoliberal rules the usual
result but in the early run mm that's
began to move in a separate direction
and by now South America is
substantially independent that's I think
a change of really historical
significance that's the first time in
500 years since the conquistadors
arrived that South America has largely
freed itself from imperial domination
last century so that's meant u.s.
domination and it's it's pretty
remarkable the way it's it's it's in
economic terms it's correct but in other
terms - so for example there was a
and it's a striking illustration of this
was a couple of months ago there was a
study by the Open Society forum of a
participation in rendition the rendition
is the most extreme form of torture
that's the form and witness the US
policy in which instead of torturing
people yourself you send them to your
favorite dictator Assad Mubarak and
they'll torture them for you and get out
the information you want or whatever you
want to get from them that's rendition
this is the most extreme form of torture
that anybody's ever devised this was a
study of which countries participated in
and it was the results were quite
interesting most of you participated
including the Nordic countries like
Sweden they participated actively in
ultra the torture of the Middle East of
course because that's resent people to
be tortured mostly kind of the United
States obviously one region of the world
bid refused to participate South America
which is doubly remarkable for one thing
it used to just follow us orders and
secondly while it did it was the center
of world torture that's a very striking
result and it's show showing up in other
ways too if you take a look at
hemispheric conferences in the Western
Hemisphere by now of the United States
and Canada are almost totally isolated
the last hemispheric conference and it
was in Cartagena Colombia the they could
never reach a consensus on anything
because there was a split between the
United States and Canada on the one side
the rest of the hemisphere and the other
on the two major issues one major issue
was admission of Cuba into the Western
Hemisphere
south of the border almost unanimous
that in favor of it u.s. and Canada
refused the other major issue was drugs
south of the border they want to move
towards decriminalization some are going
even farther the United States and
Canada refused for the US and Canada the
drug war is a very essential that's a
basically a race war and it's you know
the consequences and do they want to
hang on to it well you know I probably
by now the US and Canada are almost
excluded from the hemisphere and this is
interested romantic change if you think
about the recent history that's a reason
history of hundreds of years so yes
there is resistance actually going back
to South East East and Southeast Asia if
you'll notice there's one country of the
region that has not participated in the
great growth period of the Philippines
the one country that has been under US
control for a century is not one of the
Asian Tigers must be the Haiti of Asia
no shall we go to questions from the
floor
hello what are your thoughts on the
ongoing talks between John Kerry and
Sergey Lavrov on on the so-called Syrian
civil war sure in civil war well that's
a really tragic situation I mean Syria
is simply plunging into suicide and it's
not easy to think of anything to do
about it at least I haven't heard
anything sensible the country is moving
towards seem to be moving towards
partition of the Kurdish areas have
become pretty much autonomous Assad has
left them alone of there's battles going
on between the Kurds and the wide array
of rebel forces they aren't
and the Kurds have gradually established
a region where they pretty much control
it not totally in fact they didn't
declare the autonomy they'll probably
try to link themselves up with Iraqi
Kurdistan which is pretty near
autonomous but that's tricky because of
Barzani the head of Iraqi Kurdistan as
opposed to the Syrian Kurds he's trying
to make a deal with Turkey for all kind
of economic reasons and a deal with
Turkey means suppressing the curves of
the Kurds like most verbs have plenty of
internal battles and how that will work
out is not so obvious but that's one
part of Syria the rest of Syria is
simply being partitioned there's a park
tattles being increasingly controlled by
the Assad forces backed by Iran Russia
and Hezbollah the other part is under
the control of myriad rebel groups which
are fighting among themselves I mean
while the Syrian people are being
decimated it's just devastating a huge
number of refugees the refugees are
being the refugees issue is a very
striking issue it's interesting to see
the way it's discussed in the United
States I mean here we have what's called
a huge immigration problem you know
we've got these people coming in that
why are they coming so for example why
where I live in around Boston there's a
big Mayan community these are people
coming from Guatemala the Mayan
highlands the why are they coming to the
fleeing well you know the country was
the region was subjected to a genocidal
war which the u.s. supported Reagan was
a strong supporter of it places
destroyed and people flee come to the
rich country so it's illegal refugees we
have to deport them others are coming
from Mexico largely as a result of NAFTA
predictable effect of NAFTA was wiped
out Mexican agriculture so what happens
next okay so we have these illegal
immigrants
Obama has broken all records he's
deported almost 2 million of them that's
the u.s. there are other countries like
say Lebanon and Jordan and Syria and
Iran where they absorb refugees huge
numbers of them in Lebanon for example
is a country of 4 million people
it has about 700,000 Palestinians and by
now about a million Syrians ok for the
poorer countries they're supposed to
absorb refugees actually absorbed the
refugees that we generate so the attack
on Iraq created nobody knows maybe begin
1/2 2 million refugees ok they're
absorbed in the neighboring countries
like then in Syria and Jordan Iran
Lebanon that's their job their job is to
absorb the refugees that we generate our
job is to drive out the refugees who we
generate and this is discussed is it's
not the enormity of this it doesn't even
begin to be discussed I mean maybe you
can't do much for Syria I don't know of
a good proposal but at least we could be
taking care of the refugees I mean this
you know it's about a million of them in
Lebanon why should live in and support
them we should support them but in fact
the battle in Syria is become a part of
the growing Sunni Shia war around the
whole region that was inflamed by the
United States I mean in Iraq you know
there'd been simmering conflicts but
there was never a sharp sunni-shia
conflict until after the US invasion
which created it now it's spread over
the region it's devastating large parts
of the region we have a large share of
responsibility for it we're the ones who
should be supporting well that's these
are things you could do but apart from
that if anybody has a suggestion I
haven't heard it in fact about the only
proposal that makes any sense is the
luckner Brahimi
initiative through the United Nations
which Russia has supported and coming
back to carry has a mildly supported
it's a thin read you know if not easy to
see how it could work but like there's
no other proposal that I know of
hello in Europe do you see a way out of
the spiral of austerity and do you think
it could come from democratizing the EU
processes in you democratize the
democratizing do you sure
I mean Europeans don't have to accept
this policy they have pretty much
there's plenty of resistance like in
Spain and Greece there's other parts of
Europe there's substantial resistance it
has not yet been enough to abort it's
been enough to somewhat restrict the
policy so the policy the harshest
policies of imposing austerity have been
somewhat softened by now the you know
the European Bank is a little more
progressive in its reaction to this and
I'm it's kind of hard to realize but the
United States has been more progressive
than Europe since 2008 and the European
Bank is kind of backing off a little bit
from its harsh policies because of the
resistance so sure it can be overcome
Greece it's significantly their
significant movements against it Greece
of course is being punished worse than
most the same with Spain but it's well
within the capacity of the Europeans to
protect the achievements of the past
generation
I mean if earlier pin welfare state is
not not a trivial contribution to
Western civilization and it's being
dismantled consciously and it could be
protected of course you can go beyond
that that's not the limit by any means
so yes it's a I don't you know it's
really a limit
will and commitment same here
I mean we don't have to tolerate what's
going on here we will keep this 40
minutes we are a few minutes overtime no
more it's done okay sure please ask you
a question last night and let me ask a
more critical question but that they
start making a statement I believe I
have a solution to the question that you
asked do we have any problem in a
solution for Syria yes I think we do
honey bunny please yes but as long as in
this country we have ninety four
senators 219 congressmen that received
money from agency that was recognized in
1963 as a tool of the Israeli government
I a PAC we are not going anywhere we
have surrendered or falling policy
entirely that's it's a very convenient
view in the United States convenient
because it directs attention away from
the centers of power in the United
States and anything that directs
attention away from the centers of power
is almost guaranteed to be popular this
is a common view it's an it's
understandable there are leading
scholars who've advocated it John
Mearsheimer and Stephen Walter the main
ones it just doesn't make any sense
I mean the Israeli I mean you're right
that many of the people in Congress get
benefits from APEC but practically a
hundred percent of them are in the
pockets of the funders the corporate
sector that's how they got elected yeah
there's a very close correlation between
campaign funding and electoral victory
very close the effect in the House of
Representatives it's almost a straight
line few deviants here in there like
sandurz but it's you know it's almost
uniform and these are this is big money
it's not a peck a peck so ethnic lobby
you know it's of some significance but
it doesn't begin to compare with the
major lobbies I mean the military lobby
itself could put a PAC out of business
in two minutes if they wanted it's way
more powerful why don't they do it they
don't want to they support effects
policies they benefit from it it takes a
Lockheed Martin when the United States
is three billion dollars of aid to
Israel it's called aid for purchase of
military equipment a lot of that goes
right back to Lockheed Martin in two
ways first of all they get paid for
developing you know this one thirty five
and so on they get paid by the US
taxpayer via Israel secondly when we
give a couple of billion dollars of
military aid to Israel Saudi Arabia
comes along and says we want 10 times as
much for ourselves and Lockheed Martin
isn't very happy to provide Saudi Arabia
with second-rate equipment which they
don't know how to operate anyhow and
they're getting a sixty billion dollar
aid grant that's compared with Israel's
thirty billion three billion dollars all
terrific for the military directly for
the millet for military industry
furthermore there are much there are
extremely close interactions you move
some of you may have seen one of the
most important leaks from WikiLeaks
didn't get much publicity but was quite
important it was a list of a pentagon
list of strategic sights high super high
value strategic sites around the world
that have to be protected you know above
all else one of them was Raphael
military industries right outside the
five major military complex closely
integrated with you
military it's one of the places where
drone technology was developed for
example it's so closely integrated that
Raphael that transferred its management
offices to Washington it's an Israeli
industry its offices are in Washington
because that's where the money is
that's just symptomatic of extremely
close relations high-tech industry in
the United States like say IBM and so on
they're increasing their investments in
Israel then not course they love Jews
it's just a good place for them to
invest if you Warren Buffett just spent
a couple of billion dollars picking up
some industry there and then said it's
the best place to invest outside the
United States and it's close
intelligence connections and so on so
why doesn't the military lobby stand
against APEC which they support the
policy if they do the same is true of
other sectors and in fact when the u.s.
opposes Israeli policy which happens
regularly APEC disappears in fact it's
happening right now in front of our eyes
apex leading goal was to try to peck at
the Senate to pass legislation that
would essentially block the Iran us
negotiations I mean it's in this
particular case AIPAC backed off but
it's happened over and over I mean even
george w bush very pro-israel there was
one point at which there was a real
conflict with israel israel is a
military based economy high-tech
military production they want export
markets the big export market of course
is china so they've been dying to get
into the china market u.s. won't let
them
the most recent occasion was 2005 under
when Israel was trying to upgrade the
missiles for China and the US Bush
administration said he can't do it they
said they were gonna do it anyway at
which point the u.s. came down on them
like a ton of bricks it insisted blocked
visits from high-level Israeli officials
they were not allowed to visit the
United States they were compelled to
issue a formal apology for having tried
to do this and to pass legislation
blocking it a real humiliation you
didn't hear a peep from AIPAC out of
this the reason is they're not idiots
they know they cannot confront us power
and when there is a conflict they back
down this happens
time after time like it before time I
could give you a long list so there's
good reasons for but I think we should
be cautious about initially about any
proposal that directs attention away
from the Centers of American power it's
always going to be convenient to accept
the proposal like that doesn't prove
that it's wrong but it's an initial
reason for skepticism I think I thank
you professor Chomsky um in terms of
reigniting the democratic processes here
at home what role do you think
whistleblowing has to play with what we
saw blowing what role do you think
reigniting the democratic process here
also do you think whistleblowing will
ever be institutionalized so that people
like Snowden or journalists like Glenn
Greenwald don't have to run away for
their lives we should try to democratize
the society it's not impossible after
all I mean it used to be there used to
be equip I think maybe it went back to
see Wright mills and I recall that the
United States is a one-party state
business party with two factions
the democrats and the republicans which
are different it's not entirely true
anymore it's now it's still a one-party
state to business party but there's only
one faction and it's not democrats it's
moderate republicans the people who are
the Democratic party today
is overwhelmingly what used to be called
moderate Republicans but meanwhile the
Republican Party so-called has just
drifted totally off the spectrum they're
not part of the parliamentary system
anymore and that's actually recognized
by the most prestigious conservative
commentators so for example Norman
Ornstein famous conservative political
analyst very just American Enterprise
Institute you know right wing he simply
describes the Republican Party today as
a radical insurgency which is abandoned
parliamentary principles and you can see
it in the last eight years their only
policies have been of course to enrich
the super-rich and to block anything
that's done in Washington period that's
been very successful remarkably
successful just report came out I think
yesterday in the New York Times of the
looking at recent polls on this and
they're very interesting turns out they
don't know about the midterm elections
that are coming up a lot of polls about
it
the public largely supports the policies
of the Democrats which the Democrats
themselves don't support but the
supposed part you know like higher taxes
on the rich and you know medical care
and so on public supports those at the
same time the public prefers the
Republicans and when you looked at the
reasons it's because the public is
infuriated about what's called
dysfunctional Washington the press is
always talking about this gridlock in
Washington dysfunctional washing
dysfunctional Washington means the
Republicans are committed to block
anything
okay so it's dysfunctional Washington
blamed on Democrats public prefers the
Republicans but opposes their policies
okay this is really clever politics
it makes people believe there's a
political system the people are driven
into acting and extremely irrational
ways it's not the first time I saw for
example in 2012 there were 2012
elections there were polls
you know ton of polls go on a very
interesting they on attitude you know
attitudes towards policy issues and
towards political preferences and
they're striking to see how they'd
separate so for example one major study
of southern southern Tea Party people
you know that that category people
identified themselves that way but most
of them are Social Democrats they
support higher spending on a health on
education on aid that the poor not
welfare request Reagan demonized that
but aid to the poor you know things like
that but higher taxes on the rich but at
the same time they we support Republican
the Republican Party which is exactly
the opposite it's take the place like
Active Calif there was a study of
California recently which investigated
attitudes towards the big what they call
big government you know taxes and stuff
there was a very close correlation
between the amount of aid that people
got from the federal government and
their opposition to the federal
government and so when you get to the
you know you know rural poor areas of
getting an awful lot of aid from the
federal government and they want to get
the government off our backs you know I
mean to try to instill these kinds of
attitudes into people is a real
achievement and that's the opening to
get back to your first point to the 99%
you can overcome this you know this is
not like fighting the secret police you
know you know you don't get thrown into
prisons for getting people to understand
these things this is an opportunity for
real organizing work which can be done
no I noticed today and in the past days
people cherish you for your
contributions people love you for your
work thank you very much thank you
