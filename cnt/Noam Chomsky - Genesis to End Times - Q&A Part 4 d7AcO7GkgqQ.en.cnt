is that we are the participants
themselves like try out ideas get
reactions to them that are a reasonable
dialogue good try to reach out to others
get their ideas that's just poor part of
any step toward the future any decent
step for the future so is it true isms
embarrassing Lee this morning we think
we would get through all the questions
that we did just now and we seem to have
covered everything that's because
everything's out these you want to take
the question how do you want to serve
okay i'll i'll pick people out and then
we can just go from there we are going
to end this at three thirty sharp so we
can get back on board first my question
was there but my question is what's
going on in india which is right now a
huge attack on the mar with people's
movements by the state by the leftist
party and which has also skilled
individual against anything that are
inferior it says right now people's
movements make my life by state as well
as the left parties as being mouse
movements and kind of raising a fog and
stuff to increase it at state of state
violence in a corporate violence so do
you have a sense
our entire body Roy had just published
some important articles and outlook I
think you can probably find him on the
internet porn their onion yeah she spent
a couple of weeks I think in the in the
tribal areas in the midst of what's
called a Maoist revolution this been
going on for a long time taking
different forms in fact india-west
liberation India has had an extremely
violent history of internally more all
kinds and this is a main part of it it's
soon India's a my parents stratified
society the caste system works people up
into various strata you know Brown the
problems of the highest da let's suppose
such both of those then there's a tribal
people who aren't even in the caste
system they're so low they don't even
fit into it and they're the most
repressed people the indigenous people
like the indigenous populations usually
the most repressed population so it in
the other hole tribal people and they
live in the forests and and which is a
large part of indy I'm going to take a
look at the map of India large part of
its flames and the areas where they live
happen to be pretty rich in resources
and the Indian government left to right
I want the resources and there there is
a conflict of interest and it should you
use the resources or should you allow
the tribal peoples to have their
traditional way of life actually that
happens happening all over the place not
just there it's happening in the United
States
the Amazon all over the place that India
is taking a particularly brutal and
violent form the India is an extremely
violent Society you're in the United
suppose if you visit India's read the
newspapers you know the newspapers are
full of you know the police killed five
people in this village somewhere so on
and so forth Cicely going on all the
time that the this particular popular
movement the one that aren't daddy Roy
described is led by people who call
themselves maoists they're not tribal
people I'm they're outsiders who were
driven out of other areas where they had
carried tried to carry out what they
call now its revolution as they sort of
work their way into the tribal societies
and are now kind of a leadership group
hidden somewhere they in the forest
somewhere I think they're pretty vicious
group frankly my feeling is that our
body was a little tended to romanticize
it a bit like just living with the
people themselves it's quite different
from trying to figure out what the
leadership is and they've done some
pretty awful things wouldn't trust them
as far as you get thrown but the tribal
people are caught they are the ones who
are helping the tribal people defend
themselves and as a major attack on them
but the Indian military and paramilitary
is called the green men and at the core
of it is who's going to get control of
the resources and the way of life with
these huge areas and it's not going to
be simple to I think aren't daddy's
accounted very moving but I think
there's a lot of critical accounts to
the puritan same journal that your mon
he's a close friend of our body since
the series select is critically very
critical and said yes right about the
tribe of people but she's overlooking
the the memos leadership which is for
Jim plausibly I think just a bunch of
gangsters and criminals so it's it's
it's not common for popular groups to be
trapped into efforts to defend
themselves and that but but led by
elements that are pretty vicious the
first time in history I think that's
what's happening has happened over a
large part of India I'm in India we
everything would read about India's you
know fantastic birth and developments
gonna overtake the United States so on
and so forth shining India it's cool
well you know it's that's true for what
maybe fifteen percent of the population
roughly like that which is not a small
number of people that's a couple hundred
thousand people you know so come on
Romanian people about the wrong I'm
particular so that's a big number who
have in fact been lifted out of poverty
by the neoliberal programs although it
actually went before them however
there's another 800 million or so who
are not a not part of this that are
probably declining so the rate of food
the level of food consumption in India
average food consumption is actually
declined notably during the program the
neoliberal programs and it's the same
policies on the same policies that build
the straight IT centers and laboratories
in hyderabad the same policies are
taking away rural credit and related
centers and they were
developments on from the poor farmers
right nearby in fact the rate of the
peasant suicides have been rising about
as fast as the number of billionaires
those are two sides of the program for
the first time in Indian history there
are permanent migrations from the rural
areas to the cities they're always were
temporary migrations you know depending
on though assume the harvest and so on
and so forth but now they're permanent
migrations so you go into the big cities
like Mumbai kind of most hitting slums
you can even imagine if you look in and
that's all another driven in there from
the rural areas by the same programs
that are creating the great IT programs
just the other face of it if you look at
take a look at India and the value and
human development report there's an
annual study of kind of tries to rank
countries in terms of various pretty
sensible measures of human development
the last time I looked into it was about
a hundred thirty fifth i think i'm not
exactly taking over the world it says i
think with lower in laos and touchy be
stung way down there and that's very
misleading because in these highly any
gala tearing so that means that maybe
like a billion people or way lower even
than that and there's a sector of the
time we know in kind of we see you were
very rich and very reactionary
incidentally and closely linked to the
u.s. at all silicon valley and so on
okay that's another part of indy and the
attack on the indigenous people in the
tribal area it just fits into this whole
quality and it's something similar cuz
you said about China so it's they got
plenty of internal problem this is even
overlooking the huge problem catch
we're Indian repression is horrendous
Pakistani terrorists is that so there's
no nice guys in the Northeast in the
city I mean to be there what the suburb
Mao's revolution comes out of those well
the Naxalite movement as I don't know if
it's been studied very well maybe it has
been but like I've seen little pieces of
myself I once went through West Bengal
which was among the centers of it with a
friend who's a agricultural economist to
BK very much under kind of a left-wing
agricultural economist at works in his
area and we also went with a government
representative who happen to be Minister
of Finance I think his PhD from MIT who
and ran into in the seventies economics
PhD but we just went around visited the
villages country out self-governing
villages and then pretty interesting and
we visited them unheralded they know we
were coming so we just kind of walked in
and one village as we walked in there
having a very poor villages objectively
but they apparently are really
self-managed as far as I could tell and
so we walked into this village and it
happened that there was a there was a
village council meeting going on there's
a kind of a council that's making plans
and so on and it was drawn from people
of all in all classes there was an
submitting cast so one of the people in
the council was a tribal woman for
example which is kind of unheard of
another one was a poor fisherman there
were others and there was a lively
discussion was translated for me and
then afterwards a couple of them just
took us on a walk through the village
and some pretty interesting things for
example we passed by a building and I
asked what it was and the guy from the
village didn't know it was when we
looked into it it turns out it was a
cooperative run by women of milk
cooperative apparently you know they
brought together their family cows or
other works and they had set up a milk
cooperative which was providing good
with a little trail if you got a lead
through the village you go to a place
where people are living there's turned
out that every few several families had
gotten together with government aid its
Natalie to build wells there's no water
in the village of course but they had
gotten fairly primitive technology from
with government assistance communist
government so that the women who do most
of the things we're able to get together
and say three or four families and dig a
well and they showed us very proudly how
do you do it people were unwell so on so
forth so the couple of families had
water and went to school correctly
nothing except kids were sitting there
learning but then just to get back to
the anak selects as we were walking
through there was a kind of a big
mansion that was sort of burned down and
I asked what's that and there was a
little shuffling of feet and discomfort
and finally they said well that's where
the landlord lived and we killed him
burn down this
that's that's the next alleged evolution
I'm sure this is it one experience roll
out front but I think that's probably
true right through the region and it led
to substantial and reform one good
config changes its now reversing the
part it's reversing because of the
efforts of the so-called communist
government which is selling a super
Stalinist unbelievably stones to to take
over to drive out to rule people and
take over resources and bring in for
investment foreign here until I mean to
Indian investment like a Tata automobile
plant and things like that and it's a
complicated country I don't think it's
easy to capture was some interesting
very interesting said if there's one
interesting study of West Bengal by very
good economists the British economist
Barbara Harris right is her name who's
worked extensively in west bank owned
forget what her book is called but her
estimate is that about eighty percent of
the economy is black meaning undock
informal economy that's a huge amount
and that very who figures about poverty
so what you just can't miss an Indian I
mean it's so I've never seen a place of
in a lot of horrible places but I've
never seen a place where poverty is both
so some horrible to look at but so
ubiquitous when you take a city like
Delhi which is a modern city you can't
directly decision without seen
things all over except another person
experiencing eye stone is there a i was
going to demonstration a demonstration
will forget what or afghanistan or
something but i was being driven there
and i was with a woman a runner Roy to
number and this is a fantastic moment
she was sassy ologist that there were
university but she left the university
and she went to registan very poor area
and for 17 years she'd been living in an
extremely poor village and registan
working on women's issues really
dedicated person living in horrible
conditions and so on anyhow she was
sitting next to me in the car and if the
car stops a corner you're immediately
surrounded especially if they see some
in a white person in there you're
immediately surrounded by beggars no
gypsy woman holding a starving child of
an all kind of horrible scenes and I was
trying to give her give Biggers that you
know a rupee or something just like a
penny and she told me not to she said
you can't do it because if you do can
just bring in full mass of people but I
noticed as we were driving she never
looked she couldn't look out the window
to see the misery doubt side I asked her
about it he said look you can't survive
if you look you have to be able to steal
yourself not to see what's right outside
the window otherwise you can't survive
in the society and this is a woman who
is really dedicated and i think that's
that's true of india don't know if you
that's an impression mobile country does
enormous problems for any questions on
the Middies please keep in mind that you
know will be talking about that tonight
extensive thanks for talking back and
then there and in there uh you that's
looking back those good so there's
obviously a million things going wrong
in the world and at certain times
strategy works best working around
issues of race or women's issues or
ecology you see a strategic on what do
you see is this master teaches focus for
radicalizing um people any west don't
think there's a simple answer to that I
mean let's go back to this group and
Southwest and that I learned about vida
Urbana for them the serious issues to
work on or having a traffic light on a
corner or having some way for kids to
stay in school and have a reasonable
experience or some way to get jobs for
people to break through the racial
barriers and so on ok that's the
immediate problems for them for people
living in the Rust Belt of the United
States and Upper Midwest where that
industrial systems being closed down the
immediate problem is to find it decent
existence probably by taking over the
factories and running them themselves
and carrying out a real industrial
revolution with green technology and so
on for other people it's somehow dealing
with the fact that we're facing an
environmental crisis that could
drogheda species a picture it's just too
many examples depends who you are where
you're working what you can do with your
talents are what your commitments or no
shortage of I don't think you can rent
lease it and there's a I can't imagine
there's one answer and they all kind of
they're all in parallel and interact
them each one strengthens the others I
know you usually quick out if the
ability of the peace between the haves
and have-nots and of corporations if the
corporations are the problem top down
and so the way you have suggested to fix
the situation which i find interesting
exciting usually not discuss is you
point out that the corporations are
granted by the public public charter and
that if the public gets together and
what do they could pull the charter of
Exxon or bowling or whoever so tell us
should we should we make up a list of
the most exploitive corporations and
should we then organize to pull their
their corporate charters I mean that's
exciting it's a technical possibilities
you take a look at the corporations
let's say you can Exxon you know
everyone is something like Standard Oil
of California or New Jersey or something
else and the reasons what they have
state charters but that's the way a
corporation's established corporation is
an entity established by state power
primarily federal power but within the
jurisdiction of a state where they're
given a charter and if you look the
history of corporations say through the
nineteen to go back to say nineteen
hundred thousand to 1800 a corporation
was just a group of people who got
together and say a municipality that got
together and decided we wanted
build a bridge over this river or
something and they incorporate it and
were given a charter by the state to
build a bridge over the river and once
they built the Ricci was ended that was
what a corporation was through the 19th
century these mostly the courts it
wasn't really legislation the courts
gradually extended the rights and
privileges of corporations finally by
about a century ago we were given
extraordinary privileges mostly by by
lawyers legal authorities Court
decisions and so on but the still
chartered by States I'm the reason that
there are so many that are incorporated
in New Jersey and Delaware is that F
divided by the late 19th century the
courts have decided that you a
corporation's didn't have to have a
fixed purpose and they could buy into
other corporations and they were given
all sorts of other so right the affair
sins yeah all kind of let him later that
was the early 19th century they got the
rights of persons that beyond the rights
of persons and so on but as all of this
took place some states like New Jersey
and Delaware in particular realized that
they could make a killing just in
corporate taxes by getting the
corporation's to move their offices
there so move mount of New York across
the river and you get a lot of expert
efforts sitting at Standard Oil of New
Jersey corporations and Bill are the
kind of a race to the bottom the fact
that there were States competing to get
tax product profits and other artists
employment and so on that led to a kind
of race to the bottom which is still
going on incidentally so it takes a
Massachusetts one of the big employers
here is fidelity the financial
institution the state gives them all
kind of gifts but Rhode Island's now
give me a bigger gift or move over the
border to Rhode Island which means
losing tens of thousands of jobs here
other corporations or at the name of it
but one green technology corporation was
just given a very substantial tax payer
gifts and Massachusetts but they decided
to pack up and go to China l it's
cheaper and workers to be gotten
evergreen solar what was it evergreens
alarm yeah ever drink right so that's
because now it's international so it
used to be mistakes but they still have
state charter which means that in
principle the citizens of the state can
take away the Charter but they're
they're even less radical moves that can
be made which are could be significant
you can take a look at standard
economics textbooks the kind that you
read in graduate courses and economics
on corporations which point out that
it's just as it's just a court decision
which isn't written in stone that
corporation corporation management has
to be answerable to stockholders on a
part of anglo-american and corporate law
just established by the courts no
legislation is that the managers of
corporation must dedicate themselves to
shareholder profit that's a lethal
principle that's the kind of principle
that's going to destroy the environment
allows for a PI no reason so they're
really lethal principle but it's just a
court decision you know can be a return
and as the textbooks point out you know
you could change corporate law so that
corporations are responsible to what are
called stakeholders stakeholders means
the workforce in the community that that
there are legal responsibility is for
the benefit of the work of the workforce
in the community it's nothing an
economic principle that Kelsey you can't
do that you know it's just a court
decision that you can't do it well you
know that's pretty straightforward move
and you probably have enormous popular
support and it's even short of taking
away the Charter and which is another
step so this this plenty of
anti-corporate moves that could be made
and they're kind of right on the surface
like most things about human affairs
it's just it's a matter of getting over
this kind of barrier of not seeing
what's around us like the Galilean
revolution you got to see what's around
you before you when you do you find lots
of steps will be taken there are there
aren't small efforts to do that some of
the national scale there's one
organization called what it stands for
polk la pocl ad remember you can find it
the internal POC la
a couple it's not a lot of people but
small number of hit it that's
organized by God Richard gruesome if I
remember which is which is it has a lot
of publications which are pretty
sensible ones on the questions of this
kind does some organizing of their
actual parts of the country like this
some area rural Pennsylvania I think
which is just rejected little
corporations as you can't come in
democracy and all the democracy school
democracy democracy schools the bunker
they call it democracy schools the
people in Pennsylvania they call them
democracy schools there Gavin to the
community schools and they organized on
a local level and an hour corporate
charters you're just not applicable in
yeah yeah it's kind of like sure areas
of the country like Cape Cod for example
which parts of cape cod which don't
allow and international enterprises in
mcdonalds dunkun go hawks and so on so
plenty of things like this can be done
at a local level and beyond they're well
within the range of popular organizing
an easier than revoking trying to above
the charm revoking the Charter would
require a significant educational
campaign which at least statewide and it
would of course come up against
fantastic business opposition I might
try to make any slight change you
immediately get caught up with massive
business propaganda that's you don't
lose your job it's where the economy and
so on so you got to be prepared for that
takes riedl in a real popular
the organization before you can try to
do that sound simple but you know when
you think about the power structures
it's not simple you had a question then
it's somebody yeah I think you then you
in the back and then how do you see
climate change refugees and other
climate change refugees on from like
rising waters and other displaced people
because of natural disasters affecting
the US climate issue r us migration
issues and there are sooner or later
going to be large-scale population
movements caused by climate change some
of them will be massive what takes it in
Bangladesh large parts upon the day
should just be inundated if the oceans
rise a little bit and that's hundreds of
millions of people but even short of
that you know Islands are getting
inundated coastlines are disappearing
and there's this drought some takes a
Africa with droughts all over the place
those are effects substantially climate
change actually a lot of what's going on
in Darfur is the result of climate
change which is taking away the natural
environment of nomadic groups so they're
increasing in agricultural areas because
the can survive otherwise and that's
leading to conflict
so it's happening right in front of our
eyes and it's going to get much worse
nobody knows how much but it could be
really pretty bad you've got to do
something it's the sensible attitude is
stripe prevent it but if it happens it
pretty constructs I'm in the dark where
is an example receiving significant
water so do you see that affecting
Americans migration is probably not
because of just you graphical reasons
I'm the only way to get to the United
States is from from the south and it's
if you look at places like say Guatemala
which I mentioned I mean there aren't
climate areas there which are driving
people to the north but it's going to be
there's no way to get from Africa to the
United States and any large-scale manner
I'm gonna go to Europe the United States
not probably the United say the wall
street journal their line is well you
know global warming's big deal will not
be pretty good for the United States
maybe if Tom trees in the Chicago
doesn't seem very great idea that it's
possible that the temperate regions may
not themselves suffer too much and for
Greenland vacation resort of course on
the other hand as soon as the permafrost
starts to melt in large areas of Siberia
and elsewhere the predictions are you
going to get a very quick release of
methane methane is far more destructive
confirmed by oxide so we may just kiss
each other goodbye you mentioned earlier
to remind you to discuss the history of
green after Mexico well that's scratchy
an interesting that's pretty revealing
story and go back a little bit in the
1970s the World Bank and the US Treasury
Department the IMF which is all kind of
a complex there the theory that they
were working with was that a third world
countries which means third-world
dictators should take on huge debts and
US banks and other banks should blend
them huge amounts of money because some
crazed economic theory said yeah it's a
great thing to do so that was the policy
and they list
no third-world dictators are happy to
take on big bits and spent the money on
whether they spend it on and for the
fruit of the population but they did it
it finally around nineteen eighty the US
was an inflationary period and first
Carter and then Reagan they picked Paul
Volcker his now-famous in the regular 30
debates to become Secretary of Treasury
and he sharply raised interest rates to
try to wipe deflation inflation out of
the economy well that caused here the
worst recession since the 1930s but in
the third world it was just like a
devastating I would say take Mexico they
had floating interest rates so that
their debts were indexed to us interest
rates so when you as interest rates shot
up their dead payments shot up and they
couldn't pay so Mexico by nineteen
eighty-two or so it was facing default
economy was they couldn't pay their
debts well you know nobody cares that
much about Mexico but he care a lot
about US banks for a clinically what is
now Citigroup at that time the city by
ninety no major US bank that goes way
back they were today their debt
obligations were greater than that
capital I'm they were in real trouble
well when a capitalist institution a
private institution gets in trouble you
call upon the state to bail you out
getting the citizens that's the way the
system works but it's not a capitalist
system you rely on the state to bail you
out if you're in trouble so the state
agency that was
use to take care of this is called the
IMF which is basically a branch of the
u.s. treasury department so the IMF
imposed on Mexico very harsh structural
adjustment programs without going into
details what a structural adjustment
program means is that the poor people in
the country pay off the debts incurred
by the rich people in the country I mean
it's radically atty capitalist like for
example if I lend you money right and I
know it's a risky loan so I get very
high end you've got high interest and I
get plenty of profit and then at some
point you can't pay the loan it's my
problem in a capitalist economy but not
in our economy and our economy the way
it's done is that your neighbors pay off
the loan and the IMF make sure that they
do that's called structural adjustment
okay radically attic capitalist but the
way power works so Mexico the poor in
Mexico were forced to pay off the loans
taken by the dictators and same
throughout much of the world well
citibank was saved thanks to massive
state intervention the director of
citibank Walter Wriston was a passionate
advocate of the free market as well as
the Treasury Secretary William silent a
lot of elevated rhetoric about free
markets but not when it comes to saving
the rich so as it comes from saving the
rich forget about free markets the
taxpayer moves in and paid them off in
the north end the poor were in the South
beowulf so citibank was rescued went on
to new atrocities like its major role in
financial crisis for which he cut bill
that again of course with real really
existing capitalism works okay Mexico
and had a decade of severe decline
mostly the poor also plenty of atrocity
is a stolen election you know state
violence on all kind of Horrors around
nineteen ninety in nineteen ninety there
was a strategy conference called in
Washington it was a school Latin
American strategy conference a lot of
experts and political figures and
businessmen and so unmet to review
relationships with Latin America well
with regard to Mexico they said
relationships are just fine everything's
great stolen election for people
starving to death state atrocity so
everything's just great but they said
there's one cloud on the horizon a
possible democracy opening that's what
they call that there might be a
democracy opening in Mexico which would
threaten the reforms the reforms are the
neoliberal programs that were destroying
the economy so that's a problem it's
hard to overestimate the extent to which
democracy is feared and hated by elites
I mean it's overwhelming and for good
reasons if you're in a position of power
there's nothing at eight more democracy
let me talk about how wonderful it is
but it is really passionate fear and
hatred understandably so there might be
a democracy opening in Mexico which
would threaten the reforms so what's the
natural thing to do well the natural
thing to do when you can read about in
the business press is to lock Mexico
into
reforms by treating treaties are hard to
break so let's have a treaty which will
lock Mexico into the reforms perfectly
public you read in the business press
and that was done let's go NAFTA ok so
the NAFTA was an effort to lock Mexico
into the reforms which had devastated
the economy for the public but was
really good for the rich I'm in comic
india number of billionaires shooting up
very fast like one of them carlos slim
one of the biggest crooks in the world
is another richest person in the world
this year he passed bill gate so that's
the reforms that we had the lock makes
go into by treaty and NAFTA and as I
said before the consequences blocking
Mexico into the reforms as the economy
will be even further devastated I know
that goldman sachs Gordon that's how
they bail that goldman sachs yeah
goldman sachs and but it's just bad but
said the citigroup is a particularly
interesting example because it goes way
back but so now we get the you know you
get the war when you get the immigration
crisis and so on I'm it all ties
together you know that ought to be the
kind of thing that people should study
but sixth grade it's pretty obvious I
mean there's nothing very profound about
this and the histories are straight very
logical and it's the natural way in
which a state capitalist economy would
function we're going to have to wrap it
up next scheduled workshops being at
four and then and so that's all for now
please give
twice and they have a really smart
organizer there c THM and I interviewed
now precisely because he's doing this
work that people are a lot of questions
here what we're asking about how to do
what's a strategy for how to do
revolutionary work in the current
context so I just agreed you look it up
if you want more detail on that model
with the model you can replicate
anywhere yeah you say the name against
city life together sir jhuka is a
youtube video to own this degree Chris
come up on you see there's no fooling
you from the sea
