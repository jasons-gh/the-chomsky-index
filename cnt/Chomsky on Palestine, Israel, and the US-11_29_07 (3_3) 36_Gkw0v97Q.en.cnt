recognize borders and so on the
resolution adopted two over the wording
of whatever one agrees the basic
international incident un 242 adding to
the diversity of Palestinians this 1976
resolution effectively essentially took
un 232 and extended it into a call for
Palestinian state in the territories
Israel refused to attend session instead
on Lebanon killing people scarcely even
offering pretext supported here of
agreeing on the United States Vita
resolution bear in mind the u.s. veto is
a double eagle the one whatever he took
diplomatic and secondly its veto from
history as
has been also 1980 well with the
security council banned calls for
diplomatic settlement in the General
Assembly where their annual votes with
numbers like 150 22 because Israel
somehow three dominica somebody decided
to join rarely if ever reported to worry
the most striking incident was in 1988
1990 88 1989 that's when the Palestinian
National Council normally accepted at
260 and Israel did respond that was
coalition government human Paris and
described tremere they responded with
the declaration that there can be no
additional Palestinian state between
Israel Jordan additional because George
Murray is a Palestinian state
government paris peace me furthermore of
the Declaration stated that the fate of
the territories will be settled
according the guidelines in the State of
Israel the United States immediately
full back to this proposal it's the
paper plan James Baker of December 1989
he added only that thank God sentenza
permitted take part in negotiations will
have to accept this framework the
recorded this is the bush one
administration that is the one that's
condemned as being any Israel let's
taking the most extreme position that
supported his ability expansion
criminality and territories and it's
pulsating rights was extreme bidding
officially taken well as i wrote the
time myself
it's as if someone were to argue that
Jews don't married a second home
Israel because they already had New York
well I should mention that the extreme
racism Okla Paris from here Baker wish
stand has been recognized Ranger Burton
Harvard Law School buy from professor
Messer Alan Dershowitz in this book the
case for Israel there's chapter for all
the case study in hate and intimidation
which is intended to demonstrate the
power of anti-semitism and hatred of
Israel and Judah virtual reversion to
the Nazis the chapter heading is the
statement my statement that is as if
someone were to argue that Jews don't
not merit a second homeland in Israel
because they already have New York only
one change in the statement the words is
as if are deleted
permitted so therefore a critique of the
us-israel proposal is converted into a
vicious and a Semitic assault on Israel
well they deceived is commonplace and
uninteresting but what is interesting is
his implicit recognition of the extreme
races stand of Washington and integrals
literally food relations I won't run
through the rest of the dismal record it
reveals exactly one departure from
us-israeli projection an important one
and we can taba egypt in january two
thousand one
the two thousand tempted proposal
the meetings collapse Clinton recognized
that his proposals and David were
unacceptable things I was thinning and
he came out with recalled his parameters
in december two thousand which were paid
with coming even stated us and squirt
negotiations within the parameters and
reported that both sides had accepted
the parameters of both sides and
reservations they dealt with the
reservations for weekend khabar Egypt
and according the negotiators they were
coming extremely close to settle their
last press conference at everything
however the kava means been terminated
abruptly the Israeli Prime Minister
Barack so in that in 2002 went on the
slow move Virg accommodation the Arab
League went beyond its previous
acceptance of the international
consensus and that go for full
normalization of relations to this year
the international consensus Iran's
supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei that
formally announced that Iran voting
shares a common view with Arab countries
on the issue of Palestine means that
you're an accepts the arab league
position full normalization of relations
with israel in terms of the
international consensus the washington
post Hamas Prime Minister no idea called
for his word statehood for the West Bank
and Gaza who said so and there are
animals there are innumerable other
examples perhaps most important among
them is the statement of the most
militant hamas leader killeen shelves in
exile and damascus new quote foreigner
presco for the establishment of truly
sovereign and independent Palestinian
state on the territories occupied by his
religion in 1967 mistralla has
repeatedly stated that as a Lebanese
organization because God will not
disrupt anything agreed to buy the cow
stands another very large majority of
Americans also outcome so in brief the
rejection ISM of the us-israeli alliance
is not only consistent for the past 35
years but it's also close to
unilaterally as the record shows there's
a good reason why facts are on it in the
presentation
annapolis or in fact most commentary the
official story that sampled before is
the exact opposite of the truth as a
look at the actual record will show and
actually the basic contours of the
settlement are well understood they were
approached cover and if the annapolis
conference were at all serious it would
take off from there and it would
complete the negotiations that were
coming very close to a successful
resolution when it's really look roughly
terminated there are barriers to
implementing the international consensus
the primary barriers have been right
here which is the very optimistic
conclusion i think because it means that
the possibility of serious moves towards
accommodation live in their hands
