actually there are two as far as I can
see there are two forces in the world
that are attempting to carry out the in
my view quite ludicrous attempt to
identify the Soviet Union with communism
one is the Soviet leadership itself
which is trying to exploit the the
positive image of the of the egalitarian
communist tradition for their own
benefit and the other is the United
States the American propaganda system
which is which also would like to
undermine that egalitarian vision by
associating it with Russian
totalitarianism but I don't think that
we should and you're right I mean this
leads to a situation in which the values
of the egalitarian socialist tradition
the libertarian egalitarian socialist
tradition are associated in the American
mind with the brutal and repressive
Soviet state which in my view has
nothing whatsoever to do with communism
or anything no connection with it and
these things I think very much should be
dissociated so I wouldn't think that I
don't freaking Apple I think the
American people are very good reasons
everyone has good reason to fear the
Russian state which is a violent and
repressive and brutal autocracy on the
one hand there's the question of what
kind of society the Soviet Union is and
I think we would I doubt if either of us
would disagree in any serious way with
what Marshall just said you know it's a
highly repressive Society which has a
kind of social contract that puts a
floor under certain kinds of suffering
okay that's the kind of society it is
separate question is what kind of a
threat it poses those are separate
entirely separate questions I mean you
could have most brutal murderous Society
internally which just wouldn't happen to
be a threat out outside you have the
freest it's in fact it through history
there has been no correlation between
what I can detect between the internal
freedom of the society and its violence
and aggression abroad for example
England was the freest country in the
world in the 19th century and in India
it acted like the Nazis didn't you know
the United States is the in my view the
most open politically speaking
forgetting social issues and so on it's
the most open man free of society in the
world and it also has the most brutal
record of violence and aggression in the
world now these things are just
uncorrelated not if you look at the
Soviet Union
seems to me yes it is a repressive and
you know the scent is suppressed and
it's there my view to dungeon it's kind
of a dungeon with a certain degree of
social services not and it is also a
threat it's a threat to it to the
government it's a threat through its own
population it's a threat to in fact
anyone within its reach but its reach
doesn't happen to be very long I mean
its reaches far shorter than we claim it
to be so for the population of the
Soviet Union for Eastern Europe for
Afghanistan the Soviet Union is a real
threat and I don't see how anybody can
question that now the other hand the
United States has created the image of a
Soviet threat just for the same reason
that they create an image of an American
threat as a way for us to justify
intervention and aggression in our own
domains and in fact if you look over the
history of the Cold War I think this is
transparent take any incident of the
Cold War you know from the American
intervention in Greece in 1947 up to
today in the choreography and you will
find that every single time a Soviet
threat has been created and usually
fabricated to justify American
intervention and incidentally they play
precisely the same game we started off
though talking about the internal system
in the Soviet Union the degree to which
it's a repressive society because that's
certainly the perception of most
Americans but in what sense if any does
that is that related to its behavior
these are the other nations as well as
its own people because for example I
think many people believe you can't
trust the Russians they never they never
abide by treaties they never keep their
promises they're really not a nation
like other nations they're not part of
the community of nations they're their
ass about trying this the Russians don't
keep their promises because they are a
nation like other nations in fact the
fact is anyone who believes the promises
of any nation state is out of their
minds or just doesn't know anything
about history and that includes us and
every other one things I mean you know
States follow their promises if it's in
their interest to do so but if you look
at the history of the arms race there's
just no doubt that the United States had
the initiative but I don't but the
reason for that I think is very simple
we're more
powerful and more technologically
advanced country so of course we're
going to always have the more advanced
military technology I think that the the
main thrust the main pressure for
militarization and the arms race in the
Soviet Union comes from the internal
dynamics of the society and I think once
we dissociate our discussion from what
in my view are kind of irrelevant
considerations like whether nations
abide by their states abide by their
treaties and so on no of course they
don't and we ask ourselves what are the
concrete situate what is the concrete
situation today I think what we see is
that the United States is deeply
committed to a massive program of
domestic militarization for the same
kinds of reasons that drove it in 1961
on the drove it in 1950 and that have
nothing to do with any perceived
international threat we ought to
understand that if we want to know I
mean I think it's very clear I think
it's the Reagan administration came is
the programs that the Reagan
administration is following were in fact
proposed in late 1978 but they couldn't
be pushed through Congress at that time
Reagan extended them and accelerated in
any modern industrial society it Reckitt
has recognized since the 1940s that the
way to deal with internal economic
problems is through state intervention I
mean the institutional structures of
American society happened to be such
that there is no coordinated state
planning we don't have the system that
they have in Japan where there's a
government ministry which deals with you
know with highly centralized foci of
Industry and brings them together and
makes a long-term economic plan we don't
we don't have the institutional
structure for that we have a different
institutional structure our
institutional structure as its developed
since the Second World War is that the
technique by which the government
stimulates production is by creating a
state guaranteed market I mean the fact
of the matter is that the Russians and
their international behavior behaved
very much like of any other power
including us I mean every Power greater
small tries to extend the influence of
its the extent of its degree to coerce
and control and penetrate markets and so
on and so forth get resources we happen
to be the world's most powerful force in
the early post-war period we were
overwhelmingly the world's most powerful
force and therefore the United States
being in fact we can easily document
this both in the documentary record in
the historical record the United States
did in fact set forth on a policy of
global domination and it succeeded to a
surprising extent since that period the
and the Russians did so also in their
much smaller sphere now since that
period this bipolar system has in fact
eroded I mean other powers have
developed Europe Japan element to the
third world and in fact the degree of
the two superpowers to coerce and
control us in our huge domains and them
and they are smaller domains that has
declined every society perceives itself
or tries to make its public perceive
itself as benevolent I mean the British
we're carrying the white man's burden
and the French had a civilizing mission
and the Russians are doing their
internationalist duty when they entered
when they invade Afghanistan and the
United States is preserving democracy
and all of this and we're as much
interested in democracy as the Russians
are interested in socialism in fact we
you know over and over again have
overthrown democratic regimes if they
didn't do the kind of thing we wanted
them to do I mean there has study after
study has revealed the obvious namely
that American support and aid correlates
with essentially with improvement of the
investment klein if a country is willing
to open itself to air penetration and
control our access to resources allow
our corporations to repatriate profits
and so on we will support them doesn't
matter what kind of regime they have how
do you how do you respond to the
situation in Central America in terms of
Soviet either influence or Soviet active
involvement you know this discussion
reminds me of you know the standard joke
about have you stop feeding your wife I
mean there's a presupposition here which
is so grotesquely false but even the
answer your question is impossible I
mean it's as if there was a discussion
going on in the Soviet Union where they
asked what's the extent of American
intervention in Eastern Europe well okay
maybe they have discussions about that
and if we looked at them we would laugh
I mean okay maybe there's some
intervention in Eastern Europe but
that's not the problem in Eastern Europe
and the problem in Eastern Europe is
Russian dominate
now take a look at Latin America I mean
Latin America has been subjected to
American supported us supported
terrorism and violence to a degree that
is I mean unspeakable you know I mean in
in 1960 forget about history in 1961 the
Kennedy administration made one of the
most important decisions in modern
history which almost nobody in the
United States knows about namely they
changed the mission of the Latin
American military from hemispheric
defense presumably against the Martians
the Internal Security meaning war
against their own populations and that
decision led to a spread of a plague of
bloodshed and repression and torture and
violence over Latin America that has no
no precedent in the whole bloody history
of the continent as country after
country was turned over to national
security faced with a kind of a Nazi
model and I mean that quite literally
under with constant American
intervention and support and that we
look at that history and then we ask
what is the extent of Russian
intervention in Latin America we should
tell the truth about the Russians we
should understand how repressive they
are we should understand how brutal they
are and how aggressive they would be if
they could get away with it which they
can't in most places but if you look at
the Russian military system the fact is
that it's it's it's character is wildly
exaggerated American propaganda and in
fact all of this has been exposed it's
been exposed over and over again and has
any exposure has no effect so for
example take the way in which take the
way for one thing take take the way in
which the the United States determines
the the character of the Soviet military
system this is this is such a you know
this is so farcical that people will
know about it just laugh I mean what we
do is the CIA calculates what's called
the dollar equivalent of the Russian
military expenditures that means we ask
how much would it cost us to produce the
Russian military system and the answer
is some huge number the reason that some
huge number is that they are so
hopelessly inefficient I mean that's a
labor-intensive system backward
labor-intensive system and for us to
create a backward labor-intensive system
would be extremely expensive I mean for
example if you ask the question what
would it cost the dollar equivalent of
Russian agricultural system suppose
somebody asked that what would it cost
us to duplicate the Russian agricultural
system well the answer is it would
bankrupt us you know if we had that if
we had to pay you know 100 million
peasants to the farm and efficiently
it would just be bankrupt but we don't
excuse me we don't conclude from that
that the Russians are more better are
ahead of us in agriculture not the fact
is suppose you were to ask what is the
ruble equivalent of the American
military so we do just but you know what
the answer is the answer is that it's
infinite yes yeah because the Russian
simply cannot duplicate our military
system if they could spend every cent
every ruble they have in Russia and they
can't duplicate our military system is
just too advanced for them we can't
create we cannot create initiatives in
the Soviet Union so it's pointless to
discuss it we can ask what can we do
here now what we do here if we want to
be logical about it has to be directed
at two ends at cutting down the American
commitment to the arms race and cutting
down the Russian commitment for the arms
race and fortunately the very same
actions contribute to both of those and
not just consider for a minute the
dynamics of this system we know that
every time the Russians do something
aggressive it supports the Hawks on our
side
and every time they back off somewhere
it hurts the Hawks on our side and the
system is usually symmetrical so the
fact of the matter is that the best way
in which we can contribute to the
reduction of aggression and militarism
in the Soviet Union is by constraining
our own militarism and aggression which
their Hawks use just as errors do as a
way of mobilizing their own population
and in fact in my view is that's why the
Cold War persists in fact it is highly
functional for the more brutal and North
aristocrats in both society
