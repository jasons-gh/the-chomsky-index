hello and welcome to the broken rails
new social environment I'm Sophia and I
have the pleasure and privilege of being
your emcee today a few quick notes
before we get to started on today's very
exciting talk we'll be recording this
meeting for the rail archive if you
would prefer not to be seen you can
disable your camera by pressing the stop
video button in the bottom left corner
of your screen will keep the audience on
you into a question time which I will
kick off about halfway through the talk
the rail team will be helping out with
tech if you have questions and our
production assistants Malvika and miko
will be typing closed captions to make
our talk accessible you will close with
a poem as is traditional at the rail and
now it's no further ado I introduce Tom
attic our politics editor in the field
notes sections of the rail hi Thank You
Sofia and could you still get rid of
that little waiting room sign it's
looking like you Thanks I'm very excited
today to welcome an old friend teacher
and inspiration don't chance key to
these discussions I can't think of a
more interesting and important person to
discuss the ongoing events with and
rather than waste a lot of time telling
you all who he is because you all know
he's probably the world's most important
and well-known linguist and probably at
the moment the world's most important
and well known left-wing political
commentator so that said I welcome you
new and I'm going to start by asking you
a question you when I first contacted
you you said I've never been so busy
this isn't an amazing moment but there
is a constant stream of things to talk
about and people who want to talk what
are the special challenges of the
current situation why is this moment so
particularly important
well this moment is particularly
important for reasons that are not being
discussed of course
naturally properly everyone is consumed
by the immediate crisis the corona vote
because it nothing
everyone shut down the people are losing
the jobs were dying the economy is
collapsing people who are paying
attention or sequestered of course
they're paying attention today but we're
going to recover from this crisis
somehow after lots of pain cost deaths
be a miserable time but we will recover
we're not going to recover from other
things that are happening right now like
the melting of the polar ice caps or the
opening the opening of the ending of the
regime that has somewhat protected us
from terminal nuclear war it's being
dismantled before our eyes by the White
House that's these are things we're not
going to recover from
in fact we'll be lucky if we survive as
the year and those who are simply there
there is there are we're all told that
we should just pay attention to the
immediate crisis not think about the
future there are those who are thinking
about the future
for example the fossil fuel companies
and their agents and the White House
they're thinking about the future they
are planning to create a world which is
harsher and more brutal than the one
that we are now that has brought us the
current crisis so they don't relent they
keep at it all the time and if we let
them forge the future world will be in
even deeper trouble
so take the president's budget for the
next year which symbolised very well
what the ruling classes have in mind
take a look at the President's budget
mid-february pandemic is raging and what
does it call for cutback in funding for
the Center for Disease Control
throughout Trump's term he's been
cutting it every year also destroying
programs that could have protected for
the u.s. from the crisis leaving us
uniquely vulnerable so the first point
in the budget is let's make it worse
let's defund the things that might
protect the population from a health
crisis and a future pandemic we deserve
likely however the budget did is call
for increased expenses in some areas one
increased subsidies to fossil fuel
corporations okay so on the one hand
let's continue to reduce any protections
for the population on the other hand
let's continue to accelerate the race to
the abyss which global warming but
that'll be profitable for the fuel
companies and it will help my electoral
chances more funding for the bloated
military which already spends
practically the entire world now of
course more funding for his famous wool
why because yeah that raisin votes among
deluded people who think that the
miserable refugees fleeing from our
atrocities in Central America are a
danger to them so that's the mentality
of the those who are trying to shape the
world in the interests of profit power
and corporate power and so on they don't
relent they keep going okay now if you
ask what we should be we should be
asking the urgent question we should be
asking the immediate one is why did this
pandemic come in the first place we
be asking them scientists are well aware
that if we don't deal with those causes
another one is going to come which will
be even worse because it will be
intensified by the global warming that's
proceeding we're talking so what are the
roots of this crisis they're not very
subtle but to deal with it won't be
simple but they're pretty obvious on the
surface it begins with a crisis of a
crisis of the and of the inherent logic
of capitalism ok
it was none right after the Czar's
crisis it's 2003 which fortunately was
contained a scientists were personally
well aware were openly saying there's
another one coming
probably another coronavirus unless we
plan for it well who can plan for it the
obvious answer is the drug corporations
overwhelmed the funds like given huge
gifts and the World Trade Organization
ludicrously called free trade agreements
fighting protectionist investor rights
agreements she gave them just pour money
into the pockets overflowing with money
they have all the resources so why don't
they do it because there's something
called capitalism you're supposed to
make profits if you're a corporation the
one job is to increase profit and market
share and of course I salaries to the
CEO or merit in fact akin to break back
to suffering through for 40 years since
we almost the corporation is green
maximize profit for the shareholders
wealthy
anything else you do shakes the
foundations of civilization so they
can't do it well you make more money on
things with himself tomorrow than I'm
planning for a severe crisis of my
common of Secutor so they're out well is
another possible agent we could become
involved the government the most basic
research the main research in almost all
areas including the technology you know
using Thomson public funding national
institutes of research universities and
so on so the government could do it but
there's an impediment
it's called neoliberalism particularly
savage forms Calvinism wrong with Athens
inaugural speech which is something
smile that's that government is the
problem solution to translate that into
English it means we should take
decisions away from the government which
has a floor that's partially accountable
to either now we should place decisions
in the hands of private tyrannies which
are totally unaccountable that's wrong
Reagan read the script handed to him by
his master so the government that's the
second blow then comes it's then come to
third I should say every country was
suffering from the first two but then
comes then comes the third how different
countries react to it they did you act
differently mentioned help from react
mainly through this four years when
information was funny all the time to
cut funding for the Center for Disease
Control to cancel programs including
programs of scientists in China they
were preparing for this
total that okay then comes with crisis
misplaced through it because there's a
tremendous amount of wine actually not
contradiction on December 31st that
China informed the world that they were
beginning to see pneumonia liked
symptoms when unusual kind with an
unknown he do it about a week later very
property the Chinese scientists have
identified sorts that identified the
virus by January tense they had
sequenced provided information about the
genome to the entire world then comes
the question of countries react some
reacted very quickly and effectively the
countries in me East agent for free
instead of Taiwan after the New Zealand
spending all reacted quite quickly when
they have the disease pretty much under
control Europe at first day much
attention to me finally started in there
anyways Britain at first following of
course there was suicidal but they
quickly reversed origin now I'm moving
in the same direction then comes the
bottom of the barrel the United States
Donald Trump and his administration they
did nothing
well it's not that they didn't know they
were getting constant consistent
briefings in fact we know I've learned
alien points from the intelligence
agencies saying there's a serious crisis
situations but
Trump was busy looking at his TV it's
just as it was just a call
tens of thousands died right now the
United States is the epicenter of the
crisis mr. Roy but finally in March
something got through through the trunk
my suspicion is proved that it was the
decline sharp decline and stop something
yes I think that's correct
that's what you do anyway he noticed but
then we hear a different thing no I was
the first person in the world who
discovered to recognize that there was a
pandemic it's my super genius turn on
Fox News that evening Sean Hannity or
Twiggy it's the most brilliant decision
history remembers and then we go onto
the next week's we're just trying to
find scapegoats let's try to find some
way over the road from the crimes you
committed my first it's China China is
responsible no look at the newspapers
it's morning Trump is fuming
it says he's trying to figure out ways
much China particularly their sovereign
immunity so everybody country consider
them sue them for millions of dollars
for things he didn't next was the world
it's China centric
we should be provided with ten times the
funds of China but China so powerful as
they control them so it's the world vote
for the position
I won't even bother looking at the
argument but the effect is not physical
Trump defunded the World Health
Organization what and he is known as we
know know this administration was moving
to destroy it what does that mean
that means that unknown numbers of poor
suffering people in Africa are going to
die they're reliant on World Health
Organization expertise of doctors and
treatments not for the corona voyage
that's still coming but for many other
diseases
so let's kill lots of black Africans but
it might improve my likeable standing
okay that's the next and it goes on from
there we didn't continue a couple of
days ago from fired the head the
scientist was in the head of heads
vaccine development in the United States
he had a reason the scientists dared to
make some critical comments about the
quack medicine since trying to I mean
that's what we're living it so three
telling to you know I went with three
major problems the logic of capitalism
the particularly savage form of
capitalism called neoliberalism the
criminals and the white house is an
unusual sort and given these three
closeted factors to pretty close of that
or three different sort of levels of
agency the system as a whole it's
particularly virulent contemporary form
and the particularly horrible bunch of
people that are running it in the United
States what do you see as the openings
for people to react and to deal with the
situation with which the Earth's
population is now being faced by this
development what should we do in a
minute
thing is to get rid of the malignancy in
the white house that's poisoning us and
will continue to in works ways the
second thing is to join those two
masters who are working to create the
future of society in their interest join
them and work against them work to
photos these courses they can be done
domestically can be done internationally
so just to give at home that means
continuing the activism that has been
going on that was kind of coalesced in
the Sanders campaign kinds of activism
little bit underway and very successful
Sanders campaigns in contrary with
people say has been surprising success
it's it's first of all initiated
programs that are enormously significant
so we're going to have to have some form
of green new deal if we want to survive
a couple of years ago this was all from
the whale from the distance if mentioned
it was rid of you and now it's in the
center of the legislative agenda
what happened when young active a group
of young activists sunrise movement
crest forward with their campaign for
occupy janitorial offices congressional
offices well they got some support from
the young congressional representatives
who were swept into office on the
Sanders way especially Alexandria
testing of Cortez a senator senator from
Massachusetts said mark you've been
interested in climate issues joined and
now it's on the agenda that's a big
change that kind of act ISM has to
continue and it has had an effect
Oh Joe Biden is not my favorite first to
put it mildly
but if you look at his program it's well
to the left of any program as a
proceeding the Democratic candidate not
because it was the choice of the DNC but
because they're forced to it by the
shift of the popular base to an activist
left that has to continue there is a
traditional left position on elections
which seems to have faded into the
woodwork but we should realize that the
traditional position is they don't
matter that much and what matters is
your ongoing activist work which would
be just as relentless as the work of the
masters if it isn't we're in trouble
to be more diligent every once in a
while an event occurs called an election
which you should spend many maybe 15
minutes on when you take a look at the
electoral choices handed to you would
say past good is there a significant
difference if there is I'll take off a
couple of minutes and push a lever and
then voting booth go back to my work if
there isn't I'll ignore I didn't vote
for a party to do something else and
that's what it should be doing I had an
effect we know it can have an effect
public action and initiatives and
activism has had effect some Richard
Nixon on Ronald Reagan any half-human
president it won't have an effect on
Donald Trump he's going to be rocks he
and the people around and will be rock
solid and offices I'm referring to
people after unit who care for the
country to some extent not just for
themselves so that's the kind of thing
we should be doing thinking about the
looming crisis that are not far
there are much more serious than the and
even this pandemic again the grim
effects of ongoing global warming the
terrible threat of nuclear war which is
being raised by the destruction of the
launch control regime by provocative
military operations on the Russian
border by these in the Middle East we
should talk about this - crumbs
cribes has been to dismantle the Iran
agreement that's very serious the whole
world is against it and he had to do it
because it was Obama's agreement and
therefore he has to do the opposite it's
one of those two principles of the Trump
administration extremely dangerous it's
raising in the prospects of it first of
all it's extremely harmful to the people
which would say that tightening the
sanctions against Iran which are
illegitimate in the first place tighten
them in the midst of the pandemic
is just savagery beyond words but it's
also raising seriously the threat of war
there are simple ways around to discuss
them not being discussed those are the
kinds of things like I wanted to say
just to follow up on this that this is
in many ways an unprecedented situation
will excitement catastrophe on the way
and then the shutdown of the world
economy in response to a pandemic this
is something that's never happened
before but as you said the more serious
danger that lies behind it there's also
a nest Oracle novelty but one of the
important things that I see you as
bringing to this moment is an enormous
historical knowledge and in a long
personal knowledge of activism and
political activity
what would you say that
young people need to keep it moving as
resources to draw on in meeting these
challenges in confronting trouble and
confronting neoliberalism and in
confronting the dangers of climate
change where should people look you know
what are the tools that are available
insofar as you can draw on your
experience and knowledge of the past to
suggest what pants that people need to
take in the future just take these
things we've just been talking about the
activity is a small group of young
people in the sunrise moves me to place
on the agenda something that's essential
for survival it's not a small move take
the climate strike last October tourism
isn't my key for educational purposes
one thing that should be shown in every
classroom in the country and every
public meeting I think is one of the
most dramatic events that I can recall
in my lifetime it was a meeting of the
diverse conference in January every
January
rich and powerful people call themselves
the masters of the universe get together
see the corporation if you go skiing and
Davos Switzerland and talk to each other
about my wonderful they are and so on
it's that kind of important meeting this
last January the meeting opened with two
talks two keynote addresses the first
one of course was a Donald Trump well
it's worth listening to ranting and
raving about how brilliant he is and how
wonderfully visit my office everyone
else was and so I almost kind of
embarrassing the people of Davis don't
really like him he spoils there is
vulgarity spoils their image
dedicated humanists who want to help the
world but they they don't like him they
gave him rousing applause because he
understands something that they know is
crucial whose pockets to fill with
dollars he understands that so he can be
a voltage thug but as long as he devotes
himself full time to enriching the very
rich and corporate power no accepted so
rousing applause for Donald Trump then
came the second talk seventeen-year-old
girl
Greta Sundberg gave a quiet series
factual talked accurate ending by
talking to the people there and saying
you are betraying us polite applause I
don't run the head nice little girl go
back to school we've got it in hand
don't worry
that should be shown everywhere very
striking and it's the kind of answer to
the question you raised read-a-thon bird
representing the people of the world
especially the young people on this
malignancy being cheered by people like
him who want to increase their wealth
and power and control and that's the
world there's an old phrase for cold
clasp on that no one used that phrase
called something else but that's where
we stand and which one is gonna prevail
but one of them has old the wealth and
the power the other has all the people
if
they do something not if they don't mean
that that's what significant I should
say this is also happening quietly
though it should be upfront on the
international scale
you take the Trump administration was
the chaotic it's hard to detect some
kind of thinking behind it other than me
but there is some geo strategic planning
it's the basic idea is to construct a
reactionary international an
international of the most reactionary
States led by the White House of course
Italy include Brazil under Wilson our
own it's a small clone of Trump
include the family dictatorship Cindy in
the Gulf region Saudi Arabia a
dictatorship and looking Egypt under the
worst harshest dictatorship it's and its
history but also some dictatorships
they're like a great friend of include
Israel moving so far to the right that
you need to tell us but to see it at
this point
making by now making public the classic
links inside for many meetings with you
both dictatorship going a little to the
east and including India under Modi
who's trying to dismantle much less than
ending in secular democracy again
introduce a Hindu a solicited between
nice people like or bond and Hungary
turning what was a democracy into
dictatorship Mario Sylvania in Italy's
gets escapes out of helping refugees
from Africa drown in the Mediterranean
another ring names of such states once
the reactionary information that's being
formed before the rise as I said they're
relentless
they don't stop the meanwhile is another
one being formed of getting for Blizzard
but it's important that reverse of
gender - I mean it's opening meeting the
couple weeks I think it was initiated by
Bernie Sanders and Jana so our fathers
we've founded a group called the m25
which is a europe-wide fine to salvage
what's worth saving in the European
Union and get rid of the robbed so these
stupid to get him whether they want to
bring in the local self in fact most of
the world so we have two internationals
for me and one of them our will states
that the other people Watson
international analogue domestic concert
at home so these things are continuing
and plenty of opportunities we're not
living in totalitarian states they have
a lot of freedom it's refreshing
compared to what other people say
invisible so we can do lots of things
just do them and that means even doing
things like brushing believers so why
isn't Trump why isn't like Sanders the
Democratic nominee then what happened
during the primaries one thing that
happened we should pay attention to is
Sanders was hoping for a surge of young
people who are you
as I said it's a minor interruption of
activist activities what is an important
you don't you've said those 15 minutes
you're getting you're changing what
happens if a listen to you so one I'm
one thing that you haven't mentioned is
with something which has struck me and
that present is the upsurge of speaking
of people the absurd effect activism
among rank-and-file workers all over the
United States as well as other countries
morning tomorrow there's a major general
strike tomorrow with lots of groups will
steadily I mean the labor movement was
one of the first priorities of the
neoliberal capitalism bistec destroyed
the labor movement because that's theme
has always been the main force that
brings people together the women's in
the forefront of social progressive
social change so he had to get rid of
them and they understood Reagan in the
United States Thatcher in England the
first move would undermine the Lakers
Reagan went as far as to moving scabs
unheard of South African the United
States of young tolerated so bring in
Scots five corporations quickly once
they said the door was open encounter 14
others joined in which strikes with
slabs and intimidation then Clinton
comes along with his own techniques in
Australia later than thought labour was
seriously beaten back but it's coming
back I'm talking very interesting ways
started with non-union activities in the
red states dreamer feature strikes
features like these are not for labor
states now it spread to the majors
industrial unions and others and my old
friends the IWW it's Friday tomorrow
there's supposed to be a day laborer
some of them in very significant so
Amazon workers
wasn't carrying out labor actions for
some time there's been just B's US
dollars which I names for me life
significant legislative actions against
a little warming and to face determines
Amazon into a carbon-free they made over
some period is a changes that came from
with militancy of Amazon workers by
their continuing like they're central to
tomorrow's
happen so yes that's restoring and
reviving revitalizing Abram essential
importance momentum get back to my own
childhood in the 1930s in 1920s labor
had been crushed by Woodrow Wilson
amused that bridge but it revived and
that's what led to the New Deal my early
memories I've seen workers on strike
that that's a textile but even
done by the mid thirties to sit down to
us just don't strike so very frightening
to the owner because a sit-down strike
is just one step before saying we don't
need the bosses we can take it over and
run it ourselves it's a fragile system
of domination and control when it could
collapse well when you get to the point
of sit-down strikes then you start
getting measures or the measures were
significant very significant change life
enormously made major effects that
lasted until really until the late
seventies and Ronald Reagan very sure
that's what should be done but
nevertheless I think this might be a
good time to ask for a few questions
there's so many people are watching and
listening in that obviously very few
people are going to be able to speak but
this might be a moment to ask our guests
to propose questions which address
wonderful thank you both so much I will
be moderating technically the Q&A
portion and I'm first going to call upon
Jeremy Ziller to ask a question Jeremy
you can unmute yourself Thank You Sofia
and Thank You Noam and Paul I had a
question so from my perspective the
rising complexity of technology and the
systems that are coming about and the
lack of visibility into the decisions
that the technology in these systems are
now making it on our behalf
from my perspective is one of the
biggest rising problems that's not being
talked about and one of my assumptions
in doing and I do a lot of this work
myself
my assumptions is that the the language
and greater transparency has a
significant role to play in making
digital services more inclusive and more
equitable and more accessible so do you
have any advice for individuals on how
they can bring about change to write to
counter rising complexity
well the complexity is real but it is
not out of the range of the general
public to sufficiently understand not
the details but to get the basic idea so
there are two things to do one is to
impose to gather that you're part of the
technology culture so inside of compel
the industries to become transparent
like the Amazon workers forced changes
in the Amazon system again nowhere near
enough significant ones about people
working for Google Microsoft Apple and
others won't be doing the same kinds of
things from the inside for the gym for
the everyone else forced them by public
pressure public activism banging on the
doors the traditional image peasants
with pitchforks forced them to respond
when they do the hafta respond to public
pressure and so for example there was a
leaked memo from a JP Morgan Chase
recently biggest bank in the United
States very interesting memo said of
course we're following it's going to and
place it risk the survival of humanity
and the bank has to think about changing
its policies as funding fossil fuels
because we are under reputational risk
what is
me those are the peasants with the
pitchforks and we have to maintain some
sort of image to them if we want to keep
control otherwise they're going to get
rid of us why should we have facts like
this why not of public banks in which
the public runs you know so we have to
be concerned about reputational risks so
from the outside there's plenty of
pressures when the inside does work to
be done maybe these huge monopolies
should just be broken up maybe they
should even be placed under public
control maybe they should have workers
on their board all sorts of things that
can be done but you're right these are
serious problems technology's complex
you don't expect everyone in the world
to understand the intricacies let's say
it's like even the technologists don't
understand until opaque but you can
understand enough so as to carry out
meaningful activities to deal with the
problem and you're right it's a serious
problem
I'm the degree of control over us that a
couple of corporations had faced for
astonishing there's one of the things
that's been undergoing on now it's just
I don't want to take too much time so
I'll just mention it as what's called
surveillance capitalism massive
surveillance of every person everything
- do you have a cell phone
there's information pouring out every
minute whether you want to do it or not
to the central corporations which have
come from Assam if you drive a car the
electronics in the car is sending out
information to the car manufacturers of
course it's all getting time to Big
Brother on top as well this is when you
get to the internet of things so cold
you know your refrigerator has
electronics on everything around you
collecting information and that
information is for domination control so
it's something very much to be concerned
about
yeah and that information that's coming
in those devices is going to multiple
parties that are making helping to make
decision so it's no longer you can call
an organization and refute a claim it's
now you're announced ten steps removed
from the entity which in some ways in a
lot of ways removes the need for
reputation option on
there's even experiments beginning that
you began in Sweden but it's moving here
to place chips and workers the
inducement is if you have a chip you can
get a coat get the machine or something
but of course what the chip does is give
information to the bosses this is an
advanced form was what used to be both
Taylorism control every action that
every worker makes so that you get
maximum profit maximum control go back
to the 19th century a business
enterprise had a guy sitting in the
chair watching the detective sewing
machines making sure they were working
but now it's advanced way beyond chips
and workers day this is a big step
towards a real dystopia but all of these
things are around on there they're
monopolized in various commands powerful
ones do we have
the question oh yes we have many
questions a lot of excited guests here
ready to speak with you
next I'm going to go to Miko Miko you
are now unmuted sorry I know them thank
you and Paul thanks everybody
like my question is um it has to do with
funding let me just find it so with so
many anti climate change movements and
conservative sociopaths getting mass
corporate funding how do you think it
will be possible if it's possible to
fuel democracy essentially how can we
get funding for democracy do we even
need funding there's something called
people actually one of the major
contributions of the Sanders campaign
was to break with over a century of
American political history in which
elections are pretty much bought times
there's very good working academic
political science and Thomas Ferguson's
pain which means done it took of his
work which is quite effectively
that you can predict the outcomes of
election and pretty much just by looking
at campaign funding goes back to the
19th century it's really taken off in
recent years
Sanders broke was that is the first
person to come very close to winning the
nomination and possibly the election
didn't quite happen but it came
remarkably close with no funding from
the corporate sector no funding from
private wealth no support from the media
aided him just
from people okay shows it can be done
it's not the first time as a labor
movement didn't get for attending hidden
rights movement didn't get to court for
chiming with freedom riders were being
killed in the South the women's movement
didn't get for Sunday and people can do
things man I have to understand that
that's how positive change has always
taken place doesn't can't take place
because some rich guy decides let's make
the world better that comes from that
kind of relentless pressure that we've
been talking about we've seen that it
works Sanders made it very clear that it
can even work in the political system so
Jane before on one side you will silence
on the other side people thank you very
much thank you
next we will head over to Raymond Feuer
Raymond I'm unmuting you now mr. Chomsky
is it time to read Thomas mouth loose
again does he have anything to say about
this present moment overpopulation yes
that's a problem serious problem but
like every other problem that exists we
know how to solve it there's a very
simple solution to the problem of
overpopulation it's called education of
women it has been remarkably effective
from rich countries to poor countries
from Germany and Japan to Kerala and
India one of the poorest parts of India
but which happens to have been wrong I
hesitate to say the words in the United
States should say it in other countries
it's been run by the Communist Party of
India for a long time which is
introduced as legislation
one of them is education so that the
population is decline in fact in the
wealthy countries the population is
declining so fast
there's becoming a problem my latest
Reuters it's not a panacea but it's a
very essential and simple
I move to deal with the mosses problem
mouths words the other things like to
providing them basic assembly assistance
programs health care information about
family planning all of those things that
has a big estate but notices that's
being killed not only by the Trump
administration but by the holy far-right
in the United States it's kind of
striking to see people militantly
opposing any any possible rate of
abortion at the same time actively
increasing the worst kinds of abortions
illegal abortions you don't have some
that claiming he's gonna have illegal
abortions dangers here and then you go
to a place of asafetida members so we
expand expand population we expand
illegal abortions in order to win some
points for elections here I should say
there's an interesting fact about the
Republicans the factory sixties and
early seventies the leading figures in
the Republican Party that Ronald Reagan
George HW Bush were all what we now call
her choice strong Reagan when it was
governor of California in the 60s
passed one of the most advanced
legislations to
in the mid-70s a Republican strategist
full of ivory not an idea he realized
that if the Republican Party protect
pretend I stress pretends to be opposed
to abortion they can pick up the ginger
evangelicals and without of northern
castles so on a dime everybody switched
milling Maddie the boy that's the way
politics but there are things do real
problem right there are solutions thank
you very much and thank you for joining
us again Raymond so next we will go over
to Joan ki Joan I'm going to unmute you
so you can ask your question thank you
so much for sharing with us your time
and for insights
I just wanted also asking on behalf of
my nine-year-old father who was part of
the movement that led to democracy in
South Korea in 1987 what explains the
inability of the left wing to unseat
Trump Johnson and so many others the
counter humans like them because despite
we have such a collective pool of
brilliance of such great minds but there
hasn't been really any sort of massive
persistent or coordinated action that
would overturn this near alike regime
and I'm sorry I've been getting a little
bit emotional but this what you've said
is really struck a chord first of all
partly it's what I said before it they
notice incidentally that in the 2016
election as you know Trump lost the
popular vote by quite a lot not to
several men the right-wing Republicans
these days
we'll aware that there are minority
party now that's why they're turning
over heaven on earth to keep people from
voting like in Georgia the Stasi agent
probably would have won the last
election but the guy in charge of the
election commits to mission happened to
be her opponent and he just blocked huge
numbers of african-american votes
there's efforts to destroy the Mitch
McConnell and his accomplices with doing
everything they can to cut back on
voting rights to make it harder for the
wrong kind of people the year
I should mention something something is
the other factor that I just mentioned
about how elections generally are fought
we know there's another general point
that isn't discussed very much
it's not even research very much it
should be some years ago a very good
political scientist who works on
elections and so on Walter Dean burned
them made a very interesting cut very
carried out a very interesting study he
take a look we took a look at modern
voters in the United States but half the
population doesn't bother vote and both
of your elections many more he looked at
their socio-economic profiles and he
compared them with Europe turns out but
it's very similar to the socio-economic
profiles of Europeans vote forth Social
Democratic and Labour Party's same kind
of people here don't vote why one
thought comes to mind because there's
nobody for them to vote for okay try to
create the kinds of so
from democratic parties that exist also
in the world for me that's terrific Paul
obviously that's nowhere near enough but
at least it's something that the United
States take a look at the United States
think of it for a minute
it's off the spectrum and then all sorts
of weights take a look at Sanders is
main programs
well universal health care free higher
education can you think of any other
country that has universal health care
can you think of any country that
doesn't have it left of the cart almost
everybody has it rich countries poor
countries the same with universal health
care you know for free higher education
none of the other wealthy countries most
of you have it at poor countries like
Mexico about it
so what Sanders is saying is let's see
if we can rise to the level of other
countries in the United States that's
considered revolutionary to reticles of
Americans to accept what does that tell
you about the reigning culture we're
very much a business run society we have
two business parties one more dedicated
to business one a little more to the
public we're very much unlike other
countries that's an opening for
activists let's do something about it
starting with your neighbors and your
community your state's on and on change
it into a modern country well it can
have the things that other countries
have and then go on now there are
advantages here in many ways this is
enough this is an unusually free country
there's limitations but comparatively
speaking it's very free even it's
compared with the other advanced
countries okay that offers plenty of
options it's got a long history of
really
serious activism seems like the civil
rights movement the women's movement
anti-war movement the Central America
solidarity movements are something that
has never happened in the history of
imperialism it has never been a time in
the whole history of imperialism when
people from the mainstream churches in
Kansas elsewhere went to countries that
we were attacking to try to help the
victims that has never happened in the
entire history of imperialism it
happened here so there's plenty of good
things here to build on plenty of bad
things to overcome that gives you the
opportunities to do something they're
there but you have to pick them up and
take us thank you very much next we will
head over to mark mark I'm going to and
meet you I thank you for taking time for
us today this is a tremendous
opportunity for all of us I wanted to
talk about something more specific what
should we have done to prevent the
Merrick garland disaster the failed
garland nomination to the Supreme Court
um in my opinion this was you know it
had ramifications way beyond its
immediate circumstance and I asked this
because because this happened it can
happen again and you know it has it has
a ripple a a very scary ripple effect um
what can we do to prevent this from
happening again or better yet to correct
this well there's one immediate thing
and that is to vote the Republicans out
of office on the Republican Party used
to be a political party I mean I go back
to the 60s
I voted for Republican congressman
because they happened to be the ones
most amenable to work on the anti-war
movement in the civil rights movement
they used to be a political party that
changed my starting with they started
with Reagan to an extent but then
particularly with Newt Gingrich Dennis
Hastert my particularly Mitch McConnell
it was the real evil genius of this
administration the Republicans just went
off the rails they're no longer a normal
parliamentary party I gave an example
with them it just gives you an example
and climate change you go back to 2008
well McCain was running for president
yeah mild global warming the planks in
his flat for the Republicans in Congress
were beginning to slowly towards some
attention to global what happened when
they cook brothers huge monstrous energy
corporation had been working for years
to try to prevent through this heresy
from developing and recover employee
they came in like a juggernaut bribing
senators intimidating other senators
threats of them chosen candidates huge
lobbying campaign a strip tariff they
did everything well the party collapsed
climate change that's pressure from the
right and what you pointed to do
something extremely important one of
their efforts to try to hold on to power
even though there are minority
organization and they're going to become
more than one of the ways is to stuff
the Kois all the way up not just the
Supreme Court all the way through the
judiciary with young ultra-right lawyers
be sitting there for a generation I was
able to be able to block any model the
implementation of any mildly progressive
legislation less when the darlin case
was striking exams Mitch McConnell as of
course you know simply would not let it
come to a confirmation yes he said no
when I finally Obama appointed me it was
not just Berlin lots of other cases I
think he controls the Senate this party
was just abandoned parliamentary
politics but he was able to stop most of
Obama's appointments now evolved was not
appointing less liberal justices he was
appointing centrist moderates
but they don't want that they don't want
people on the far right all the way up
and down the line and one of the results
of another four years of Trump will be
the pillow succeeded so much under
control but no matter what people want
they'll be bucked but the governmental
whether that's part of the effort to
maintain control for concentrated
private power cord with power private
wealth even though they're losing the
population so yes was appointed to these
very submissive it's a crucial incident
than a major movement is going on and
will continue if they can hold on to
power
that's one of the reasons they're trying
so desperately to cut black voting now
making the onerous restrictions that you
have to pass to get registered when I
couldn't pass we don't remember that
section of the Constitution you have to
say no it's that kind of thing even
voting day what why is living on Tuesday
so why hasn't he been spun bits on
Tuesday because of working days working
people have a hard time why can't people
register on Sunday boy because a lot of
the black population goes to church and
Sunday morning and they could be all
together in church they could go out to
get registered afterwards we don't want
to love that I'm there step after they
work very hard they're relentless yeah
there's a serious class war you don't
stop you look at everything you can do
to make sure you can win okay all the
way across the board doesn't have to
happen why try to destroy the postal
service what Trump is trying to do which
is a lot of reasons but one of them is
you could have voted by mail get rid of
a lot of these efforts to control things
actually it's a much deeper reason for
trying to get rid of the postal service
it might occur to people to ask what the
framers had in mind when they placed the
Postal Service in the Constitution we're
supposed to revere the framers we're
supposed to Revere one part of the
Constitution the Second Amendment just
totally falsified oh forget that
so we're supposed to love the
Constitution carried it under arms why
did the framers what opposed to the
circles well there's a reason they
wanted a free press they wanted a free
independent press that's the way they
interpreted the First Amendment
so they wanted to subsidize the press
why do you subsidize the press personal
service very low rates for a
distribution of the village journals and
newspapers but most of what the postal
service did in the early years you don't
want people to know that then they might
start asking questions and maybe there's
something we can do through governmental
structures which will open up the
country to somebody besides the rich and
powerful why is it that the United
States is one of the very rare countries
that doesn't have public broadcaster
there's no BBC in the United States
not that the BBC is perfect by any means
plenty of flaws but it's much more
independent in corporate media why
doesn't the United States have why
doesn't have radio
why didn't have television programs in
which you have serious discussions and
debates let's say this way other
countries very reasons there were big
battles about its major struggles about
it when radio came online in Berlin
television came online the public lost
private power one but just as in the
Garmon case it could change there have
been plenty of cases what can you do
when the public in that case remove
major changes so the opportunities are
there just the gospel especially you
have to know these things
cashman's
not gonna know these things unless
activists work done and once across the
board everything we've been talking
about smoke they look like small things
maybe
if they had up that's why the Masters
are constantly they've worked trying to
control everything that's I don't know
if you know the organization Alec the
American Legislative Exchange Council
one of the most important organizations
in the country let's say it's a kind of
a lobbying group for big business major
corporations across the board and
members of it they carry out very smart
strategy they lobby States they try to
pressure states to put in very
reactionary legislation most states are
state legislators are pretty much
amenable to pressure and it doesn't take
much money to you know Jennifer the
state played for surfer in fact most
people don't even know who their
representative is do you know so they
operate kind of in secret they're easily
susceptible to pressure I don't have to
make money for their next election
campaign Alec is pushing through amazing
legislation at the state level and if
you do that enough it finally becomes
overwhelming one of the things they're
trying to do was destroy public
education let's do it at the state level
do it step by step one of the things
they some of the things they're doing
our mind boggling so there's a
phenomenon in the United States that's
both wage theft employers just refused
to pay wages they refuse to pay overtime
it's illegal unless it's enforced do
anything about it so one of the Allied
efforts is to try to make it
unenforceable so no way to enforce
stopping wage stuff this runs the
billions of dollars a year
Rafi's of Norfolk and there is literally
no stone left unturned by the masters
they're constantly
that one of the most insidious efforts
are getting pretty close for you is to
try to get a congressional amendment
that will impose the budget constraint
constraints on the government which says
you can't you have to keep the budgetary
constraints okay what does that mean it
doesn't mean you're gonna stop funding
the military it means you're gonna stop
funding all social program balance
budget now in many states you have that
at the federal level that's the end of
if you get enough states to ratify it
you could get it through and they're
getting pretty close all in secret I
mean not literally and see it's
available to the public
look you don't know about it unless
somebody tells you about it you're not
gonna see a headline in the New York
Times about Fox News nothing said you
hated trying to take away all you know
your social benefits but activists
renters we could go on which is for a
long time as I say its class war the
guys who have the wealth and power are
working constantly everywhere to try to
ensure that they can keep it and
magnified it that's the rest of us let
them do it do it wonderful
this is a great moment to segue to our
publisher Fung I would like to ask you a
question thank you you brought up the
Great Depression with brought to my when
at the time you were growing up in
Philadelphia from a poor family but you
say your parents was very educated they
read many books they went to poor dude
reading plays and public debate and so
on
and it was
the time when the emphasis on the arts
and culture was the prevailing energy of
humanistic tradition of inquiry that
provided the people real comfort to ease
the suffering of their poverty and
whatnot
I just wonder it now because when you
brought up the late 61 came together and
protest against the Vietnam War and you
know civil rights movement woman rights
movement and so on and I remember
reading which road is blue after
September 11 even though is written in
the late 90s
it's called achieving our country and he
one of the few people we know because
you also mentioned John Dewey in several
of your last interview and I'm just
rereading Louie right now on his book
particularly his perspective of how to
advocate vocational education and an
academic education being equally valued
what happened in the book Richard Rory's
book where the radical life became coach
Oh laughs they were sent to the Academy
and then there was a difference between
Coachella and reform and reform is
laughs so my question to you is that in
which way weakens again and this is why
we admire so much about Bernie Sanders
doing to advocate for education being
free what you know if we don't achieve
that goal how can we inspire um academic
friends and Kali to write for you know
working-class American to begin having a
real genuine conversation with them so
they don't feel neglected like the way
it has been for so long with proper to
this point start with tomorrow one of
the leading forces in the strike
tomorrow our teachers as I mentioned
teachers from poorer States
who are educational systems if I happen
to live in our zone which has the second
lowest funding for education in the
country plenty of rich people in Arizona
go to Phoenix
havens a rich people coming from the
Midwest and one of the in the Sun for
the retirement very reactionary
but it's like the immigration that's
harming Arizona is not from the south
it's from the north anyway teachers went
on strike for here in Arizona a red
state the slogan is invest for edy
invest for education they're not just
going on salaries are ridiculously low
but they're not just going for wages
they're calling for decent schools fund
the schools make it possible for
children to be able to learn that's the
main thrust of the teacher strike had
some effect it's got a lot of popular
support I should say pretty much across
a pretty broad spectrum they've got a
lot of fun funding from people and so I
see their signs are up all over the
place they get something out of the
legislature and the governor not enough
but that's the kind of thing that mess
the way you get good schools okay
could be done from kindergarten to
university
here happens a lot of the state
legislature dennings you as your BC
colleges just trained people in business
schools or jobs and what do you need all
this crazy humanities philosophy all
that kind of nonsense and it just is
subversion and we don't want that I
think probably the one thing that the
state runs is probably the Freedom
Center established by the Koch brothers
to teach right-wing propaganda with the
rest of the university military business
but it can be changed and people live in
the state if they want their children to
have a decent education they can work
for it and something to do it and in
fact it's changing in interesting ways
so but similar things are true around
the country so I think the answer to
your question is the same as the answer
all Christians do you think now that we
being forced down because of the
pandemic
in other words from greatest ability is
to mobilize speed as his power something
he learned from Mussolini but now we are
being forced to slow down become nature
need to help heal her body wouldn't this
be a good opportunity for to mobilize
advocate for slowness which is the
overwrought of a patient respectful time
Corinne everything has been so
detrimental to the position of humanist
inquiry so this is a time which we can
write a poem make a painting
conversation like this is the on a
solution that we can really use as an
agent against from exactly and we happen
to be in forced isolation but in the
modern world
plenty of people have ways to
communicate and almost everybody has a
smartphone or something well so there's
lots of ways of interacting and it can
be used for educational purposes and for
organization you can organize through
social media being a workout planning we
can start pressing for them in fact we
can do it right now even in the
electoral arena and one of the things
that Sanders is doing right now
apparently is trying to impress the
party leadership for more progressive
programs and the formal program of the
party well you can say those are just
words who cares I think they don't have
to be just words you can keep their feet
to the fire is that are likely with
constant protest and activism kind of
thing the sundries movement did the
amazon workers do don't always do that
lots of opportunities were always I mean
part of the propaganda that were said is
your hook you're helpless you can't do
anything
that's what Sacher
with a famous statement saying there's
no society you're just individuals
crossed into the marketplace helping try
to protect yourself we're gonna have the
copy of Ayn Rand and say on prior to
beat everyone else up and get rich okay
but you know a lot to work together it's
not true I thought we see it very
dramatically right in front of our eyes
just take a look at what doctors and
nurses are doing
I mean heroism working day in my very
dangerous conditions they don't have
equipment because of the malevolence of
the government but they're doing it you
take a look around at communities around
the country and around the world
a lot of them are self organizing the
community groups are forming to you know
help out some disabled guy first one
being about civilian civilian culture in
other words we too can mobilize and we
to technology in our advantage if we
know how to support it and that's what
we're trying to do in the social
environment yes I think more to learn
how is not difficult we can start with
simple things one of some of the best
mobilizing I've ever seen really
effective ISM I lived in Boston most my
life is in a core area of Boston area
few organizer started to try to bring
people together who feel helpless can't
do anything I tried to convince mothers
of mothers
let's see if we can get it if we can
convince the City Council to put up a
try
think like in a place where kids have to
walk to school so they got together they
finally got a traffic-free teaches you
something forget together you can do
things under the next one okay that's
the civil rights movement damn Lex
didn't save enough lunch counter II get
arrested
would've ended he didn't came back the
next day some white students for you to
get seated where I was going to you
South China yep very dangerous
thank you thank you very much we have
time for about two more questions is
that good with you mr. Chomsky yes
great so next we will go over to Justin
who had a question about parliamentary
system I'm going to unmute you Justin
that's well I will go to the next
question while I wait to figure out this
next we have John John Sullivan I'm
going to unmute you hi uh thank you uh
known for the great talk
my question was just about sign sign of
American relations the president has
been using increasingly hostile rhetoric
against China during this pandemic and I
just like to know how concerned do you
think we should be about deteriorating
relations between the United States and
China in the coming decades
well let's notice that the
deteriorations are one-sided we're the
US government not you and me but the
guys around Trump inner circles are
desperately seeking to try to blame
China for their own crimes take a look
at the press this morning
big articles on how the White House is
planning all sorts of attacks on China
and mobilized the population so that
everybody's gonna rise up against China
because look what they did to us we're
all locked up with China's for was it
China's role it's not by January 10th
with extreme rapidity China had tiny
scientists had found the source of the
pandemic and given the information to
the entire world
many countries reacted okay are in
pretty good shape this one this country
betrayed its own population more than
anyone else now they're trying to cover
up for does that mean China was perfect
no a lot wrong with China but that's not
why they're going after China they're
going as for trying to enforce it was
successful what you just take a look at
the programs the Trump programs - the
tariffs and the rest of it they have to
say what they're doing it's not secret
we have to prevent China's technological
development okay the United States
happens to be quite backward in Internet
facility where I live have to be a
couple of miles out of town so there's
very weak signals well there's a country
physik company in the world called
hallway which has top-flight cheap
equipment well they're going all over
the world installing it but we've got to
prevent them from developing I mean
obviously you can't let people here use
it but we've also got a hamper their
development
oh he's got China is way in the lead in
producing sophisticated solar panels and
wind turbines on electrification of
vehicles way ahead of the rest of the
world we've got a stop that we don't
want them to succeed in doing that
because it might just help people but it
might harm the us power and corporate
profits
so let's prevent them from developing
look I'm not extolling China we could
spend two hours talking about hideous
things that are going on in China you
could but that's not what all this is
about it's about preventing the
successes take a look right now there's
two countries in the world which are
acting the sector's need to help others
Germany's a rich country and they've got
the situation pretty much under control
and a couple of miles from Germany in
northern Italy was a raging pandemic was
China is Germany helping them there's
something called the European Union is
Germany helping no but they are getting
help from Cuba Cuba sending doctors the
way it's done for many years the Cuba's
under the heels of the United States
will try to crush it for 60 years ever
since candid crushing sanctions
terrorism somebody survived one model of
genuine internationalism in the world so
they're sending doctors to northern
Italy with Chinese help - providing also
doctors with lots of equipment this is
happening all over the world do you see
any other countries doing does that tell
you something something to think about
in fact the United one of the arguments
today if you look at the price
against trying to punish China is that
we need them if they're sending us
materials of meaning to try to control
the pandemic that raged out of control
because of our crimes
now we have 2x China for help right
equipment so we got to be careful about
punishing them but you should remember
that in the United States there's
something called the Yellow Peril
goes way back to the 19th century the
Chinese are going to come over here and
destroy us and we have to wipe them out
with bacteriological boards this keeps
being revived the nineteen fifties I was
really the Chinese are planning to
destroy the American the Red China
that's easy to arouse this among the
American population deep-seated racist
fear of those Chinese horrible trainings
now it's being revived again to improve
Trump's electoral prospects
that's the only reason doesn't even help
corporations arms their supply tonight
of course they're willing to tolerate it
because the guy in the White House the
whores wealth into their pockets
tolerate these antics too but they don't
like it they don't want it is enough the
gangsters reelected they'll do anything
for that kill a lot of black Africans
sort of children the concentration can
say whatever they kill a lot of
Americans or whatever you think anything
to get really in fact we see it so
obviously in front of us it takes genius
to miss it they take Trump's latest
tactic that's all the problem of the
government we can't do anything federal
government happens have all the
resources all the wealth but we can't do
it but you do it the government you
don't have the resources you don't have
the opportunities you can't make using
South Corea you can use your probe what
lies behind that tactic pure sadism what
lies behind it a pretty healthy
if anything goes wrong which it will
since we're making it harder if anything
goes wrong we can blame it on the duck
governors Mitch McConnell can come and
say it's all the blue states that's
because they waste money on pensions for
firefighters and teachers and all that
kind of nonsense now it's there from
Mitch McConnell okay so if anything goes
wrong with the virus the governor's for
especially the group state if anything
happens to work by accident the trunk
and say look what a genius I am Sean
Hannity they'll say you know greatest
figure in human history you can't lose
as long as the population stays
subordinate and doesn't see what is
right before their eyes
which is not easy nobody's telling it to
you think the little work to notice it
that's what I couldn't so forth people
like you lift the veil get people to see
what before their eyes make it
understandable if they don't have to
affect it making change powers in their
hands no that's back to one of the first
books of modern political science by the
great philosopher David Hume first
principles of government open it up
first paragraph power is in the hands of
the governed those who are governing
power and maintain itself only by
forcing consent okay important words
power is in the hands of the people they
have to consent to submit themselves the
knights and princes and corporate
managers and so on and it's a thin
system of control it's very fragile you
expose it to sunlight it evaporates
that's the job of activists and there's
plenty of opportunity I think that's the
thing to keep in mind
have to keep in mind another appointment
if you'd like we can transition to the
poem now you've been very generous with
your time and we appreciate it very much
I'm sorry to all the questions we
weren't able to get you today hopefully
in the future there will be more
opportunities and so without further ado
I would like to introduce Zoe hit sig
