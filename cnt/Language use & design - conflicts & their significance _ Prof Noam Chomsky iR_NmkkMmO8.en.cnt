I don't need that okay thanks
well I'd like to discuss some questions
about a topic that goes back to
classical antiquity has remains quite
obscure in many ways and has many
significant implications I think we
shall try to bring out or at least
indicate the question is what is the
fundamental nature of language what's it
for what is it designed for there's a
simple classical formula goes back to
Aristotle that language is sound with
meaning that raises three questions at
once what is sound what is meaning and
what is with the the most neglected and
most crucial question there's been a
good deal of discussion of sound and now
over the past several millennia
could--but has known a lot of
consideration of questions of meaning
how much is understood one good debate
but virtually nothing about with
presumably because it was the same to be
trivial simply by association so a child
sees a cow and somebody says cow an
association is set up between that thing
over there and the word and out of that
spins the meaning that doesn't survive
much examination but even if it did it
wouldn't begin to touch the real
question which has to do with it which
has to do with the fact that the number
of associations of that kind if you want
to call them associations is
unbounded so it can't be set up by
experience that's the width problem it's
very rarely been noticed in the whole
history of thinking about language
occasionally it has Galileo was maybe
the first to point out for the obvious
fact that the language we our language
capacity has infinite scope
he described the alphabet as the
greatest invention that had ever been
made because it enables us with 25
letters to express any thought that
might come to our minds notice that he's
not accepting Aristotle's dictum exactly
that's a description of languages
meaning with sound which is not quite
the same as sound with meaning fact
differs in interesting ways this is
picked up not long after by Descartes
and in fact for Descartes it's the
foundation one of the foundations of his
dualistic science interesting and long
story also mostly ignored in the history
of philosophy but I think quite crucial
after that a kind of languages it picks
up again in the 20th century partly
because the concept with came to be
understood in few I well in the 1930s
and 40s was the development of the
theories of computability touring girl
lien--a others the notion of a finite
characterization of an infinite class
became well understood and that makes it
possible to ask ourselves what would be
the nature of the sound meaning
relationship whatever it is well the
basic answer has to be that there's some
kind of what's called Jenner's procedure
or finite computational procedure
that determines the structures and the
interpretations for an infinite range of
categories of expressions and the
interpretations have to be dual one for
sound one for meaning apart from that
for anyone who is not a mystic this
capacity is internal to us it's
generally denied but a lot of mystics
around but clearly it's something
internal to us mostly our brains which
means it's effectively the capacity is
effectively an organ of the body in the
rather loose sense of organ that's used
conventionally in biology some subsystem
of the organism that has enough internal
integrity so it can be studied on its
own and interacts with other such
modules system subsystems and the
functioning of the in the life of the
organism so that should be
uncontroversial and fortunately it isn't
at all with those controversies aside
well we've learned in recent years that
the concept sound is to narrow the
externalization of language the form in
which it reaches the outside seems to be
modality independent so it can be a
visual it could be signed can be touch a
lot of interesting work on that and so
on there seems to be some internal
analytic capacity that's common to any
form of external expression now that
already suggests to us that maybe
Aristotle's dictum should be inverted
just as Galileo's observation does maybe
it should be meaning with not sound but
some form of externalization will keep
the sound here just for simplicity but I
mean any form of externalization well if
it turns it turns out that this
distinction between
whether languages sound with meaning or
meaning with sound it bears on many
other questions the there is debate over
the what's sometimes called the
essential function of language come back
to that notion in a minute there's a
traditional view which in fact is
Galileo's that language is primarily an
instrument of thought the great 19th
century linguist William Dwight Whitney
expressed the traditional conception
this way he said language is audible
thinking the spoken instrumentality of
thought which indicate means that speech
sound any other externalization is kind
of a secondary property of language the
fundamental property is the internal
construction of indefinitely many
thoughts by this generative procedure
we'd now say that's different from a
contemporary view which is so widespread
as to be virtually a dogma namely that
this function of language is
communication and that grew out of the
evolved out of communication systems as
a matter hasn't been studied but I
suspect that this modern view which is
in fact a Dogma just can't question it
is in philosophy psychology linguistics
is probably a reflection of the grip of
associationism and behaviorism
it's a 20th century doctrines which have
a very tight grip even those who reject
them fundamentally accept them I think
it also relates to a highly
oversimplified view of the modern
evolutionary biology which is totally
different from what evolutionary
biologists believe but it's also a
widespread an interesting topic another
one will put aside looking at the
general question
the question of what an organ is for
what's its function is a very far from
is far from clear I so take any anything
system you like say take the spine
what's its function well function is to
hold the body up to protect the nerves
to produce blood cells to store calcium
that's what does so which one is its
function maybe all of them are you pick
one somehow well the weight one one is
usually picked is by evolutionary
considerations which which of those
various uses is how it is the way it
evolved you can give arguments like that
about the spine but you can't really do
it about language there's a huge
literature growing all the time on
what's called evolution of language as
libraries full of it now last twenty or
thirty years mainly which is very
curious in something number of ways
that's one reason it's curious because
the topic doesn't exist the languages
don't evolve they change but they don't
evolve that's quite different evolution
means change in the genetic basis for
language what's called the universal
grammar ug and contemporary terminology
the it's also interesting to compare the
huge library of speculations and there
are speculations about what's called
evolution of language really means
evolution of the capacity for language
that compare that with incomparably
similar a simpler topics like an
evolution of the communication system of
bees by any measure that's far simpler
question but it's barely studied in
biology because it's recognised to be
too hard on the other hand evolution of
the language capacity which is
comparably more difficult just not right
because the complexity of it join a
fossil evidence and so on you know
that's a huge topic now actually a
little bit is known about it not very
much and what is known as suggestive
I'll come back to what it indicates the
the one one thing that is known with
considerable confidence is that in the
past roughly fifty to eighty thousand
years since humans left Africa our
ancestors left Africa there's been no
evolution of the language capacity it's
changed it stayed identical and there's
very strong evidence for that there's no
difference that's detectable in capacity
for language any language in a Papua New
Guinea unlike that the tribe and you
know Dublin children are interchanged
they're they'll grow up the way their
society is and that seems to be true of
cognitive capacities generally if there
are group differences they're so subtle
that they're virtually undetectable so
that tells us that something at least
the ug the language capacity hadn't
changed hasn't evolved in roughly fifty
thousand or more years the with less
confidence but some you can suggest that
if you go back another fifty or a
hundred thousand years before that there
probably wasn't any language at all
there you look at the archaeological
where of course we have no fossil effort
for record but if you look at the
archaeological evidence there is a
sudden leap in creative activity
sometimes called a great leap forward by
fellow anthropologists roughly around
seventy five thousand a hundred thousand
years ago somewhere in that neighborhood
and it's you know complex tools complex
social arrangements numerical
development of numeric
a representation of planetary you know
the celestial events and so on and so
forth it's generally assumed sort of
plausibly that's that that's connected
with the emergence of language which
differently with human language which
differs radically along any dimension
you can think of from other community
from any communication system that
exists in other animals primates and so
on well these are among the reason of
course everyone would like to know
something about the neural basis for
language but it's very difficult to
explore the topic one reason is its
disconnect it's unrelated to any other
systems that are known so we know a lot
about the human visual system but that's
because the human visual system is quite
similar to the visual systems of say
monkeys and cats and rightly or wrongly
we allow ourselves to carry out invasive
experimentation with other organisms so
you can learn about their visual systems
that tells you something about ours so
there's something about the
neurophysiology of the human visual
system is understood but that's not
going to work for language there just
are no other organisms so there's no
other one to look at because there's no
analogous system anywhere in the
biological world there's kind of a very
weak analogies you know with birds ants
but evolutionarily so remote can't
possibly tell you anything it's so the
comparative study is out and we don't
allow ourselves to do in face of
experiments with humans you can think of
all kinds of possible experiments that
could teach you a lot as you can't carry
them out
so that means research in this domain
has to be sophisticated and indirect
some things are learned but not a lot
nevertheless I think it is possible to
say something about the essential
function of language you know the core
property of it but the way to do that
the only way I know
since comparative evidence is out and
there were physiological evidence is
limited there's some old mentioned some
but there is a way to do it and that's
to look into the way in which language
into language design what kind of a
system is it when you investigate its
character and another way of approaching
it is to compare is to consider
questions of communicative efficiency of
what would be in a system that is
efficient for communication compare it
with design of language and in
particular compare it with questions of
computational efficiency there's there
is an assumption here the assumption is
that however language developed it's
satisfied
it's a computational system so it
satisfied general principles of
computational efficiency which are not
specifically linguistic or even
biological maybe laws of nature so
granting that assumption for which
there's a good deal of evidence not only
in this but in other domains we can ask
about computational efficiency and
communicative efficiency and ask how
they interrelate
well I think considerations of that that
kind I'll barely have a chance to hint
at them do suggest quite strongly that
the traditional view is correct the
language is an instrument of thought
informally and that the modern dogmas
about language and communication are
just wrong communication isn't and as a
use of language of course but this
plenty of other uses as well and it's a
secondary it's not really critical part
of language and not significant
particularly specific to language and
communicating all kind of other way
style of dress I come your hair and
facial expressions innumerable ways to
communicate language of course is one
but nothing special about the connection
well this these questions began to take
a clear form approximately 60 years ago
when there were the first serious
efforts to try to actually construct
generative procedures computational
procedures that would meet the minimum
condition required namely a generating
an infinite array of unstructured of
structured expressions which have an
interpretation in these two interfaces
as they're called meaning and
externalization the sound as soon as
those attempts were made some very
puzzling phenomena were discovered
that's commonly the case when you begin
to look at some topic closely turns out
that everything he believed was wrong
actually that's the classic moment of
the origins of modern science so for
millennia
scientists had believed that there are
simple answers to the question why if
you let go over rock it falls and if you
release steam it rises they're going to
their natural place and how two objects
interact the through sympathies and
antipathies how do you perceive a
triangle is a triangle over there in a
form
Flitz through the air or gets into your
brain and there's a triangle in there
and so on for a range of questions these
were the conclusions of the best
scientists literally for millennia when
Galileo and others began to be agreed to
be puzzled about these phenomena
instead of just accepting them it
immediately turned out that all your
intuitions are totally wrong you know
the rest of the story that's how science
starts that's how discovery starts and
intelligent inquiry starts and any
domain it's been very hard for this to
penetrate the to the soft sciences and
the humanities just isn't grasped right
to the present day even in fields close
to the sciences like in its demand
computational cognitive science totally
misunderstood but the ability to be
puzzled is a pretty important one to try
to cultivate it's the core property the
thing that things had learned from
infancy up through graduate school and
Beyond well one puzzle about language
that came to light about 60 years ago
and is still very much debated and bears
on the question I was raising it has to
be very simple but rather curious fact
so it takes say the sentence
instinctively Eagles that fly swim and
ask yourself what instinctively goes
with well it goes with swim not with fly
or similarly suppose you raise a
question and you ask can Eagles that fly
swim well it can goes with swim not with
fly which is a curious fact because a
computational procedure is involved
which is quite complex there there is a
minimal distance relation that is true
of the actual linkage but it's minimal
structural distance its distance
it's the closest the two things that are
closest to each other when you look into
the structures and that's a
computational complex computational
problem on the other hand it worked the
other way through proximity instead of
structural distance it would be a
trivial copy
no problem you just check the closest
verb to instinctively or to can and
that's the one that's associated with
that's elementary elementary
computational problem but language
doesn't use the simple computation it
uses a complex one which ought to be
puzzling and it is supposedly I think
and in fact it's not just true of these
examples that's true of every
construction that's known in every
language that's known so there's
something far-reaching about it will
this the general principle mineral
search you know closest distance that's
all over the place and language that
probably it's just kind of a effect of
the general property of mineral
computation that I mentioned in this
case there is some supporting evidence
from neuroscience one of the most
interesting experimental results in
neuroscience has to do exactly with this
it involves it's an expert it's work
done in Milan the for those of your
linguists the linguist involved as
Andrea Mauro other biologists the they
investigated the following paradigm take
these speakers of German and and give
them to nonsense languages invented
languages one of which satisfies the
properties of say Italian which they
don't know and the other is designed to
violate principles of universal grammar
so in this connection take an invented
language in which the you negate a
sentence by putting the negative
particle after the third word let's say
the language doesn't a much more complex
way with using structural distance well
it turns out that for the case of the
nonsense language that satisfies ug
principles you get normal brain
activation
in the language areas for the case that
violates ug principles like having
negation as the third word in the
sentence you get a lot of brain
activation all over the place and people
can ultimately solve the problem but
it's evident that the teaching they're
treating is a puzzle and not as a link
not as a language problem there's also
some evidence some of you may know this
from observation of cognitively impaired
but linguistically capable subjects neil
Smith's work with his famous subject
they did try experiments like this and
compared with normals and you find for
much the same thing
well that yields a suggestion a possible
explanation for the curious fact that a
child reflexively uses structural
distance minimizes structural distance
and ignores the much more simple
computational process of linear distance
the assumption would be that linear
order is simply not available to the
language learner who is confronted with
examples like the ones I mentioned
rather the learner is guided by a ug
principle a principle of language
capacity which simply says there is no
such thing as linear order it's just
there's only structural properties and
you have to minimize those and that
conclusion has caused a lot of
consternation in the cognitive sciences
there's actually a small industry in
computational cognitive science trying
to demonstrate that you can get these
results by a statistical analysis of
massive amounts of data paper after
paper on that every approach that's
clear enough to look at fails
irremediably
furthermore it wouldn't make any
difference if they worked because
they're not dealing with the right
question suppose you could show for the
cases in English that I mentioned that
you could somehow the child could learn
this by statistical analysis of data
which isn't totally impossible but
suppose you could show it it would be
totally meaningless because the question
is why does language do it this way
always not just for these cases but
every case not just in English but in
every language and why does no child
ever make a mistake about it why is it
basically reflexive and that question
wouldn't be addressed
even if impossibly some of these
approaches work papers keep coming out
about it and that's actually a good
illustration of the unwillingness to be
puzzled that has to be overcome if
science is even beginning to take off
well a more far-reaching thesis is that
linear order is never available for
computation in the core areas of
language in syntax ends construction and
semantic interpretation there's actually
considerable evidence for that in other
domains too it seems that structural
properties like say hierarchy play a
role but order does not languages that
have said almost mirror image word
orders operate exactly the same way the
this suggests that the linear order is
only a peripheral part of the language
system and you can understand why it's
there the sensory motor system requires
it so you can't speak in parallel let's
say and you can't speak in structures
you have to speak in a sequence of
linear order of words so linear has to
be imposed somewhere
other arrangements but it looks like
it's just a reflex of the sensorimotor
system well one of the few things that's
known about evolution with fear of
confidence is that the sensorimotor
system was around for hundreds of
thousands of years before language ever
emerged doesn't seem to be adapted to
the language system apes for example of
approximately the same auditory system
as humans and even focus on the same
kinds of cement phonetic features
phonological features that are essential
for human language but of course when
they hear a language it's just noise
they don't hear anything actually
there's another striking curiosity
that's almost never been studied again a
failure to be puzzled as how come a an
infant of one day old infant can pick
out of all the noise around them some
subpart which is language related it's a
very tricky task if you think about it
if some other even an organ ate let's
say it was essentially the same auditory
system its presented with the same noise
it's just noise but for an infant it's
not noise some scattered part of it is
language related and that's reflexively
picked up and goes on almost reflexively
to gain the capabilities we're now using
including such properties as the one I
mentioned that you can't use linear
order in the internal computations
despite the computational simplicity of
it well that suggests already that you
should we should probably return to the
traditional concept of language the
concept that Galileo the cart and others
expressed the Whitney articulated in the
form I mentioned and particular and
recognized that external ization all
together is a peripheral part of the
whole language system
just reflecting accidental aspects of
the sensorimotor system which we have to
use for externalization and of course it
would follow from that that particular
uses of language like communication are
even more peripheral and secondary to
basic language and all the extensive
speculation about evolution of language
is just off the off the mark to begin
with you can throw out the libraries for
this reason alone actually there is
evidence from some evidence from the
limited evolutionary evidence around
that that conclusions correct they want
us time to go into that well if there
were time I would there isn't I would go
on to give some more complex examples
which require a little more thought and
attention but when you look into the
more complex questions of somatic
interpretation and communicative
efficiency and what you can show pretty
convincingly I think that that the
design of language yields directly
yields the basis for semantic
interpretation but constructs problems
for communication it mean it for it it
introduces properties into the what is
pronounced that it cause a lot of what
are called parsing problems problems of
perception and so on there's many
examples of this in fact every case that
won't have time to go into it but every
case that's known of a conflict between
communicative efficiency and
computational efficiency that is best
language design every single case that's
known and there's quite a variety
communicative efficiency is just
disregarded it you know hands down
always computational efficiency that is
good design for semantic interpretation
wins out
and that tells you something like
general the skip a lot of stuff this is
no time that the suggest a part from the
particular conclusion here that the
modern dogmas are probably all off the
wall that communication is not a
fundamental part of language it's very
peripheral along with other uses that
the language is designed basically as an
instrument of thought a result that it
developed apparently very quickly some
small rewiring of the brain and maybe
you know a hundred thousand years ago
which is nothing in evolutionary time
simply provided the computational
procedure simple computational procedure
which yields the which answers the
question with except that it modifies it
in that the externalization part is
secondary a matter of adapting it to a
sensory motor system that was all around
but kind of a more general point that I
would kind of like to bring up and I
won't go into but you can think about is
that if you make it close attention to
rather technical properties of the
nature of language specific technical
questions they can lead to conclusions
that have quite far-reaching
ramifications about the nature of our
fundamental mental processes and the
consequences of considerable significant
I think for the Human Sciences even in
their that currently barely developed
form so let me stop there
[Applause]
are you asking a question about the way
people think about it or about the
modern dog more about the facts why the
dogma exists yeah well I think as I said
it hasn't been studied but I think it's
probably obvious the 20th century
underwent a shift of attitudes towards
humans and their actions and so on
basically associationism and then
general behavioral ISM so you go back 50
years ago this second of psychology was
called behavioral science sociology was
behavioral science
everything was behavioral science which
is a very that's the time when I sort of
was in grad school or I was one of a few
people that this is pretty crazy even
without knowing that any conclusions
I mean to Cole say psychology behavioral
science is like calling physics meter
reading science because
you know the data for physics is reading
meters and that some of the data not all
of it some of the data from for
psychology is behavior not all of it but
it means that looking at the field was a
study of data not as a study of whatever
the internal structures are and that
just doesn't make any sense
the combined with this was something
else I write about this period computers
were being developed actual working
computers and it was widely believed and
still is that sooner or later they'll be
it was massive computers with very rapid
processing and they can deal with huge
amounts of data and carry out some
statistical procedure on the data and
something miraculous will come out it's
still very widely believed and people
are very misled by it
in fact there's a there's something
called the Turing test which you've
probably heard about which every year
there's a competition if you when it you
get $100,000 to pass something called
the Turing test a totally meaningless
task it's it's it's supposed to show it
can you show that machines think it's
all based on a paper of Alan Turing's it
was a great competition and one of the
founders of computational science and an
eight-page paper that he wrote in 1950
on what their machines can think but he
starts off the paper by saying the
question whether machines can think is
too meaningless to deserve discussion
that sentence has somehow
been ignored in the entire literature
and there's a good reason for it because
you know to ask whether machines think
is basically asking what kind of
metaphor you like it's like asking the
submarine swim well you know from a
certain point of view you can say so
from another point of view or not but
it's not a meaningful question
he put and he proposed this imitation
game which is now called the Turing test
but he proposed it for a different
reason he said it'll be interesting that
the idea is to see if he can construct a
program that'll delude a blind observer
you know one who doesn't see what's
going on to not be able to distinguish
the program from a person okay he says
they'll be useful for trying to as a
challenge to create bigger machines
better machines okay maybe so that
probably was but it doesn't say anything
about whether machines can think in fact
the whole idea of machines thinking is
posed in a way which is almost designed
to cause confusion I should say that the
people who are confused by this are some
of the most the leading philosophers the
most influential philosophers and
scientists and others is not a trivial
thing I won't mention names but many of
you
for one thing a machine the computer
itself is may be useful as a paperweight
but it doesn't do anything what is doing
anything is the program that you put
into it okay so the real cook if you
want to pose the meaningless question it
should be controlling well what's a
program a programs just a theory written
in a crazy notation so that a machine
can a computer can handle it so the
question really is welcome this theory
think in other words is this a theory of
thinking well you know the answer is not
unless you understand something about
fear of thinking nothing's a theory of X
just because it passes some meaningless
test you know it's a theory of X if it
gives you insight and understanding into
the nature of X so the real question is
are the theories that are written in
these programs that giving us some
insight into the nature of thinking I
said you pose that question you know
even bother with the prize because of
course they're not not doing anything
and these things combine the Association
is psychology the behavioral turn in the
human sciences the availability of data
processing they all combined to lead to
what in my view is just massive
confusion in all the fields related to
these topics that's probably the reason
I mean you know you have to look at
individuals and ask but I think if you
do you find something like that and it's
right to the present it hasn't changed
in the least yeah
[Music]
and so I'm just wondering so some
linguistic things that we do practices
that we engage that we've been trying to
call linguistic are are speaking to one
another also correcting each other's
uses of language so if I pointed up the
dog can I say look there's a lovely
pigeon somebody will say that's not a
duck so we try to get our language used
to conform so we're all speaking the
same it takes place but if you just
think about it for a minute probably
99.9% of your use of language is
internal it doesn't involve any other
people so you can't it's it takes a
tremendous act of will not to think to
yourself in language it's almost
impossible every minute of the day
you're talking to yourself you're when
you sleep you know doing the same thing
now there are cases of the kind that you
describe there are all kinds of uses of
the system just like they're all kind of
uses of this mine but it doesn't tell
you much in fact if you really look
closely this has not been studied
there's another dog right here that's
blocking the study of this
it's a dog move that in the modern
period actually goes back to pretty much
decline and then it's picked up by John
Cyril and others the idea that there
can't be anything in the mind that is
not available to introspection nothing
be in the mind unless you it may not be
conscious but it's got to be available
to consciousness otherwise it's not in
the mind that's a totally hopeless most
of what goes on internally is completely
beyond the level of introspection for
example the the case that I mentioned I
mean the principle which is pretty well
established that linear order is not
available for syntactic and semantic
computation you can't introspect into
that it's not conscious the same is true
of just visual perception for example
one of the most interesting results in
the study of visual perception is a
conclusion that came out of David Mars
lab Shimon almonds principle what if
it's called the rigidity principle this
they were able to show that if you
present a subject with two guests a cop
to kiss the scopic presentations you
know it's a screen with a couple of dots
on it if you have successive
presentations not many maybe three or
four presentations of a few dots on the
screen of what you perceive is a rigid
object in motion okay that's pretty
curious too
in experience you don't have no
experience with rigid objects throughout
all of human history till very recently
there weren't any rigid objects like
your walk in the forest no rigid objects
around and but somehow the system is
probably true for other it hasn't really
tested on other organisms it's hard to
test what's probably true for Apes and
cats and so on our system is just
designed to impose rigid objects in
motion on virtually no data and
that by now the mathematical properties
have been worked out the neurological
properties less known but again you
can't bring that to consciousness and I
think the same is true of speaking to
yourself try it sometime
think about what you're actually doing
when you talk to your what you call
talking to yourself I think you'll find
that what you're actually what's
actually in your mind consciously is
just fragments the little fragments flip
by and out of those fragments you can
suddenly construct the sentence in a
meaningful sentence and that meaningful
sentence is probably being constructed
unconsciously beyond the level of
consciousness internally by whatever
these generous processes are and bits
and pieces of it reach consciousness
like a couple of fragments of phrases
and that's what we call thinking to
ourselves and by now that's you know
that seems to be true in other domains
too there's some minor famous
experiments the livid experiments on the
decision-making which have been widely
misinterpreted but what was found was
that if you decide to do something say I
decided to pick this up milliseconds
before I decide something's going on in
the motor areas namely the the right you
know organization of motion to pick it
up well in the immediate conclusion was
that was drawn from this as okay that
shows there's no freedom of will and
don't you Angeles or at what it shows is
that everything that's going on is
beyond the level of consciousness at
which we know and every other domain -
but as long as philosophy of mind is
marine bound by this dogma that you
can't go beyond what's available to
consciousness or else is on the mind
it's never gonna discover
and I think and there's a whole
collection and I think that Dogma too
probably goes back to behaviorism I mean
it's pretty clear in Cline's case it's
quite they remember distinguishes it
says actions can be in accord with
principles or guided by principles
that's all in accord with principles
means like the planets following
Kepler's laws it guided by principles
means you formulate what you're going to
do and then you do it and you say
virtually all action doesn't fall in any
of those category those categories and
with John Searle that comes up is what
he calls his association principle you
know F dev has to be available to
consciousness somehow before it can be
attributed to the mind and a whole spins
off a whole theory about rules and so on
but that's just approaching these
questions of your hands tied behind your
back
and I think the same is true of the
considerations that you mentioned
they're real but it's very peripheral to
look to the use of language
whether you think about if you were
raised without an external language
without the shared language your
irregular to your desert island
experiment what would happen there's
actually some evidence about this there
are the most striking evidence is
studies there's a couple of studies of
children who were found who's who who's
deaf children who were whose parents had
been indoctrinated into what's called
the oralist tradition which is very
common until pretty recently that is
that deaf children should not be allowed
to learn sign language because they have
to be part of the general society so
they have to learn how to lip read it
just makes no sense at all by now at
least sensible areas that's all been
dropped but that was a major dogma for a
long time and there were parents who
were the one famous case of a couple of
three cousins in Philadelphia who
student have a lot of glycans
worked on it three cousins who played
together little kids have played
together they were three were deaf their
parents were so indoctrinated that they
didn't even gesture to the kids because
they didn't want them to be mislead into
developing signs so when the kids were
discovered it turned out that they were
chattering to each other in a sign
language which is a at the expected
level of development for a
three-year-old you know four-year-old
same structures everything this
so that essentially invented their own
language I have no data actually this
had been noticed much earlier by Eric
Klinenberg who that one of the you know
the person really founded modern biology
of language he was a fellow we were
friends back in grad school and at the
time he was interested in language
deficiencies so he went one of the
things he did was visit the School for
the Deaf the famous school for the deaf
and blind and Boston Perkins Academy he
went just to observe see what's going on
and they were all strictly oralist
you know that was the dogma but he
noticed that if the teacher turned to
the blackboard the kids would start
signing to each other kind of things
that kids do if the teacher isn't
looking and obviously they had developed
their own sign language and we're just
using it when they weren't under control
well you know in those days you couldn't
publish anything like this because it
was so counter to everything anyone
believed so it never got published but
since then when the topics become
legitimate there's other discussions
like that now let's take the case of
someone who has no input at all okay
there are a couple that's the wolf boy
case well chances are very strong that
the language capacity would never
develop but that's normal
I'm gonna take say the visual capacity
remember in the case of vision we can
study cats and monkeys and we know what
happens so if you take say a kitten and
in the first few weeks of life its
deprived of structured visual stimuli so
like that has a ping-pong ball orbs I
all it gets is diffused light but
nothing structure then the neurological
basis for analyzing visual systems just
degenerates it's the same there anymore
so they're never gonna learn how to see
and that's true of just about every
capacity they tend to have what are
called critical periods
you know periods in which the capacity
has to developer will never develop and
again we don't do experiments with
humans but if you did you'd probably
find that there are indirect evidence to
indicate that there are several critical
periods in which if there's if the
system is not stimulated somehow it's
not gonna function I mean most of us
have an experience with this for almost
all adults there are individual
differences but for most adults it's
extremely hard to learn a second
language
infants do it reflexively and a
ten-year-old will do it reflexively but
for older people it's it's worked I mean
if one of you were to go to a foreign
like country with your 10 year old child
you would discover that in a couple of
weeks the kid is jabbering fluently and
you're and he doesn't care and maybe the
kid doesn't want to be there that
experience but they just can't help it
they just learned the light and speak
the language like a sponge on the other
hand the adult can study and take
classes and work hard on it
it's not easy and probably some critical
period has been passed there is one case
that's been actually studied carefully
of a girl this called genie looking up
the literature
ge and I have to be careful about the
literature because a lot of popular
literary genre which is pure garbage but
there's also some technical papers as a
woman named Susan Curtis very good
cognitive neuroscientist who worked with
Jeannie and her papers tell the story
straight what happened with Jeannie is
that she was found when she was I think
13 years old as she was up in an attic
not tied to a chair heard some psychotic
parents and they would shove food in
occasionally she could pick up the food
needed but she had no they deprived they
tried to deprive her of any external
stimuli so nobody ever spoke to her you
know that sort of thing
when she was found of course she was
rescued there were efforts to try to
help her and Susan Curtis as the was the
therapist actually took care of her and
it looked for a while they were among
other thing that she was turned out to
be quite bright she could learn all
kinds of things and she was she learned
very quickly how to delude people you
know she was apparently very
manipulative she could make people think
she was doing all kind of things which
she wasn't doing and for a while they
thought that she was acquiring language
but it turned out to be an illusion
she was acquiring ways of diluting the
people around her into thinking she
could use language about with closer to
us as it turned out she could never
overcome that barrier now you can't
really be sure what that means because a
kid has been raised in those
circumstances is going to be totally
psychotic
so naturally so how much of this is just
general psychosis
how much is deterioration of the
language faculty you can't tell to do
that you'd have to do invasive
experiments of the kind that you can
imagine but we can't do so it's that's
the country act is another kind of
evidence that is quite interesting that
has never been a it's a tick Helen
Keller okay Helen Keller was extreme per
unit of blind and deaf very fluent you
know she wonderful writer you know all
kind of interesting ideas no difficulty
in expressing herself she learned what's
claimed is that she learned by touch
okay
her teacher grants all of them you know
spelled out words in her hand if it's
leaked recently been discovered from
photographs from that period that Helen
Keller actually had invented a technique
that is now using used for teaching the
deafblind the technique is to put a hand
on the face and your thumb is on the
vocal cords you can tell if the vocal
cords are moving and your fingers on the
face you can see the way the face is
moving so you got a minimal amount of
theta but now that's been studied
actually my wife worked on that at MIT
and there are subjects who've learned
this system who are pretty fluent they
nobody's ever reached the Helen Keller
level but it's pretty fluent which is
pretty amazing itself this is almost no
beta
however there's something else that was
discovered there were too few cases to
publish anything about it but the few
cases that worked
they found that every case that was
successful the person had lost sight and
hearing after about 16 months 18 months
old
what happened these are case of spinal
meningitis now it's curable something
happen anywhere but that where there was
a sudden loss of both speech and hearing
hearing in sight and if there were more
than roughly that age then they could
gain a fair facility in Helen Keller was
20 months old when she lost sight in
hearing and she gained you know perfect
fluency but before that there weren't
any successful cases well that suggests
something
it suggests that by say 18 months old
kid ory knows the whole language they're
not exhibiting the knowledge but anyone
who's paid attention to children though
that they know a lot more than they can
exhibit you know they're understanding
all kinds of things that they don't seem
to be able to do anything and it's
perfectly possible that by saying that
age the child has actually acquired the
major aspects of language and that the
Sodoma that method that I mentioned is
just kind of eliciting it you know
eliciting something that's already
inside now again if you could do direct
experiments with humans you could test
this but of course
can you have to look at indirect
evidence but that's I think the evidence
points in that direction thank you
that's a good question and I didn't hear
who you were I'm sorry
as your background linguistics yes well
then you know there's a lot of work on
it like Richard King's work on LCA for
example all of the there are various
ideas about how a structured system can
be mapped into a linear system and what
are the principles that do it and
there's some quite interesting ideas
pretty far-reaching but it's a real
problem it's a real question and it's
only been asked in recent years because
you know that it was only recognized to
be a problem in recent years now if you
go back to Scizor and Bloomfield you
know the great modern linguists they
didn't see it as a problem
the so first assure it's all Association
you know and in fact the caesarian
linguistics the near the concept of
sentence sentences somewhere
and boundary between a long and pole you
know it doesn't fit anywhere for
Bloomfield the language is just the
collection of expressions that can be
used in a speech community the same as
for coin and it doesn't mean anything
but as long as you look at the problems
that way which is pretty much like the
like scholastic physics you know
sympathies and antipathies going to your
natural place then you're never gonna
see any problems it's when you start
asking what it means for what kind of a
set is it that's the expressions that
can be used in a speech community when
you start asking those questions that
everything suddenly becomes very
puzzling including this question which
is a very live one today you know what
is you know it raises all kinds of
questions like how to japanese-english a
yield linear order when they seem to
have opposite structural orders there
are two questions there
some students at Trinity so I agree with
you some of the rejection of this door
well having extravasation of use as
probably thought but and that was the
opens up sort of an interesting now we
have to think of a new way to have snap
interpretation of semantic injure yeah
because now we have one person who sort
of also shared this view will be doing
further though he sort of gave his
Eastman same sort of in a couple of
places naked earth he finds your news on
semantics hustling is the world of
excuses and sort of the specters I'm
trying to say well the way to go back is
by having informational semantics and
then try to find some causal relation
between world and representations I mean
you've been advertising a couple of
places that mental representation
doesn't requirement representation off
and I would you can say that man
representation
presentation also thank you with that
too
but I still share something about focus
puzzlement at some point we have to have
so if I use possibly what do you think
about as well we're old friends for 50
years and we found each other's views
puzzling for its reciprocal
in fact when I mentioned about cows and
the word cow I had your footer in mind
his you if you know you know his view he
says exactly what I said child sees a
cow it's nobody says cow that sets up
the connection and from then on the
sight of the cow causes its causal
relation of the mental image image or
notion or whatever it is cow and if that
simply does not stand up to examination
as soon as you begin to look at words
instantly this was pretty well
understood in the 17th century so if you
read the lock Hume the English plate
nests others that they understood that
the air can our concept of you like if
of an object is not individuated by
identifiable physical properties so you
read lock on person for example this is
persons they put in these terms but what
he if you look at the kind of thought
experiments Locke carried out with from
what if you have two minds in same body
that kind of thing what he's actually
saying is that our concept of person is
based on some notion like psychic
continuity ok psychic continuity is not
a physical property it's not something a
physicist in
discover it's something that we're
imposing on the world it's like the
rigidity principle in fact for Locke
he says person is what he calls a
forensic concept it carries with it
notions like responsibilities and rights
well you know physicists can't look at
an object and say oh PS responsibilities
and rights actually there's a this is
known in the history of philosophy
there's a recent book on it by Galen
Strawson who brings up these things he
unfortunately doesn't refer to the
history about them because nobody knows
it but the but that's correct and and
that's just true of everything including
Cal's also you can quickly make up
simple thought experiments that show
that notions like Cal are also based on
psychic continuity among other
properties in fact there's something a
part of this is very familiar to
everyone fairy tales infants have no
problem understanding fairy tales that's
easy you know but just think of the
standard fairy tale you know the Wicked
Witch cast a spell on the handsome
prince and terms that turns him into a
frog let's say for the rest of the story
the prince has all the physical
properties of a frog all of them then
the beautiful princess kill kisses the
frog becomes the handsome prince again
that means it always was the prince
didn't matter what its physical
characteristics were because it's
because what makes it a person is
this strange property of psychic
continuity that runs through the whole
thing always and you can do the same
there's similar stories with animals you
know turned into something and then turn
back into themselves and so on and I
children have no problems with that
that's that perfectly straightforward
because their concepts are simply not
based on physical properties um of
course in part they are like you don't
distinguish you know say a cow and a
house or something but it's only a small
part of it most of their concepts even
of the simplest notions are pretty much
like the rigidity principle you see them
a certain way because of the way you
interpret the world and you can't get
that by association and causality so I
think Jerry's approach is and every it's
not just him
everyone's is hopeless from the start in
fact I think if you look closely you I
think you find that in a human language
there really is no referent no notion of
reference or denotation there's a ways
of interpreting the world based on our
internal conceptual systems but they do
not set up a relationship between an
internal symbol like a word and some
mind independent entity which was what
reference your denotation would have to
be and in fact feel it is your
philosophy no some of the famous
conundrums have to do with this so it
takes a the ship of thesis yeah
the dark story story is that a thesis on
a ship in the ocean and variants of it
any one of the boards rots throws the
board over word overboard replaces it by
a different board this keeps going until
finally every board has been replaced
and it's still the ship of theseus
although all the physical properties
have changed well that the conundrum
comes when you add say that there's
somebody on the shore who's picking up
the old boards and putting them back
together and rebuilds the original ship
which one is the ship of theses nobody
has an answer
Eric and the reason is our cognitive
systems are not designed so they can
deal with a question like that
actually I tried this out with my a
ridiculously small sample of my
grandchildren once made me watch some
space program
Star Trek or something where they have
there's device on the spaceship in which
a person can go into it and be
transported somehow reconstructed on
another planet okay so nobody has any
problem with that but then I asked them
what would happen if the person who was
reconstructed on the other planet was
still in the box that he went into which
one would be the person that's the ship
of theseus they were kind of stuck with
that they thought about it had different
answers but basically had no answer and
I think if you look at Crick these
puzzle it's pretty much the same the
puzzle dissolves if you don't assume
that there is an entity a mind
independent
entity that words like London or had RFC
and so on are referring to but if there
is no such relation in language then the
puzzle can't be formulated and of course
they're gonna be questions you can't
answer like which is that you know which
is the ship or who's the person which is
the person in the box but there's no
reason why you should be able to answer
them why should our cognitive systems be
developed so that any question you come
up with we have an intuitive answer to
no they're not
those are the traditional puzzles and to
find out why they're unanswerable we
have to look into the nature of our
conceptual systems and I think it's here
that ideas like say Jerry's just found
her right at the beginning because there
are no there is no way of all they try
enemies that any word you can think of
no matter how simple you'll find that it
it's the concept is individuated by non
physical properties bhakti this was
noticed by Aristotle Aristotle talks
about it he talks about it in
metaphysical terms so he asks what's a
house you know what's the definition of
house he's not doesn't say the
definition of the word house the
definition of the thing this is in the
metaphysics and he says the definition
of house is a combination of matter and
form okay so the matter is you know
board and bricks and stuff like that and
the form is what it's used for what the
design is things like that which are you
know this was all later reconstructed in
the 17th century and mr. melodical terms
these is the cognitive structures
without Aristotle's metaphysics anymore
matter and form but the basic idea is
right that what constitutes a concept
for us is some combination of things we
perceive and constructions that we
impose on it by our complicated
cognitive systems for which things like
a psychic continuity and design and use
and so on are critical now if there's
something that looks like a house say
but it's used to distort books it's a
library it's not a house
then this holds of every term you can
think of River tree almost everything
maybe everything everything has been
looked
I closed up so you started
sometimes at me I'm the three juniors
and then you probably need you to pour
your explanation there are certain
semantic structures in the head and one
of the things that rotation your while
communication is use of language it's
not essential but I was not very many be
aware you think that communication can
become essential when we've got other
people involved so when when you make
twenty cooperate with each other outside
when I see someone's facial expression
as a smile and it's beautiful and I say
and then I ask myself well are they
smiling to me because they breathe with
one same
perhaps they're smiley happy because
maybe what I'm saying is like a
ridiculous
or there are only possibilities for how
it how I interpret it they're smart how
I interpret their there's fun and said
that becomes essential for me to kind of
totally ask them is this what you mean
by your smile what you're saying or
perhaps you're right if no once we once
therefore there people arrive to you
want to cooperate with and we won't
understand well here you're using what
do they mean and pull crisis sense what
do they intended it's not really meaning
its intention yeah he tried to unite
them but I don't think that works but
here is a clear case of that's normal
and interaction with other people or
even what you read you try to figure out
what's intended you don't pay much
attention to the literal meaning of the
expression of course that gives you a
hint but you're really trying to figure
out what's going on in the person's mind
were they trying to convey and that's a
pretty tricky operation you know but and
a lot of things come into play you know
background assumptions where the
person's coming from intellectually what
are your shared beliefs Isis I said it's
a it's a complicated as social action
which of course it takes place all the
time and a language is part of it but
notice that the literal meaning of
expressions well as you say is only one
piece of the puzzle I mean if the
person's talking Swahili you can't do
this but if the person's talking English
language you know you can
instinctively and reflexively you know
no thought grasp the literal meaning
that's one factor and that enters into
you're trying to determine what the
intention is but the kinds of things I
was talking about just are the stuff
that's going on reflexively the literal
meaning and there that's quite
interesting properties and I think even
the look at the literal meaning shows
that communication and other language
uses are a peripheral of the system
doesn't mean they're unimportant just
maybe they're very important for human
life incidentally I think communication
is a bad word for this kind of social
interaction
I mean if communication is supposed to
have some meaning it has to do with
translation of information but most of
our interaction with other people isn't
transmission of information like you
know you talking to somebody at a party
let's say you're you know trying to
transmit information doing all kinds of
things or you're standing at a it's very
hard for people to be near each other
and not to talk if you want to really
embarrass people that put them in a
closed room and ask them not to talk to
each other I mean it's it's very
threatening you just can't do it you
know try it sometimes so you kind of
forced to talk to the people you don't
have to bust up you talk to the person
who's next to you but you're not
conveying information you're just
maintaining some kind of social
interaction that's comfortable so I
don't think it should be even those
things should be called communication
it's again the idea of using
communication comes from this kind of
instrumentalist approach to this study
of psychology and sociology everything
has to be for some you know
purpose there's no other to achieve
something but most of our use of
language even with other people isn't
achieving anything more than maintaining
a pleasant social conditions you know so
there are two questions here the lady in
the second row about modularity of mind
some of the ideas and particularly the
structural properties of the linguistic
system may be works available for those
individuals who don't have language for
whatever reason who fail to develop if
they're competent
is there a cognitive first of all about
modularity we have to make a distinction
between the two interpretations that
concept the one that's common use
actually is Jerry's Jerry photos is he's
talking about modularity of processing
systems so it's the input systems that
are modular he's arguing and it would
have to be extended to output systems of
course according to him the what he
calls the central systems have to be
unstructured coiny and isotropic so
there can't be any structure to the
input systems that does set up a problem
so for example why do you hear English
and speak English why don't you hear
English and speak Japanese and if the
systems are unconnected why is that the
case well there has to be structure for
the end for the central systems and here
you get a different notion of modularity
a notion of modularity that's more
related to acquisition than processing
so given all the noise and confusion
around you how do things get sorted out
into different systems well that's where
the internal system of modularity arise
and I think that's where your question
comes so what are the connections
between if any between the internal
linguistic system and other cognitive
systems
it's it's an interesting question and
the waited there are other language is
you every group of humans that's ever
been discovered has essentially the same
like same kind of language but there are
other there are other common properties
that are found like music just but I
think every society that's know the you
know uncontacted so-called primitive you
know hunter-gatherer tribes they always
have some kind of music of drumming
whatever it may be I think they almost
always have a dance that seems to be
universal these things just have no
function at all you know like what's ask
for but the children pick it up
instantly kind of automatically every
society has it you could ask the
question whether another thing that
every known society has is arithmetic
all capacity know that there's a lot of
misleading information about that that's
often claimed that aboriginal groups
don't have arithmetic that's based on
the fact that they don't have number of
words or they may have number of words
that only go to three or four or
something but this was studied carefully
by a really outstanding linguist Ken
Hale about 40 years ago he's one of the
founders of Australian linguistics and
he did study languages which don't have
number of words but he found that the
people first of all they have other ways
of expressing numbers like maybe they
don't have the word five but they could
go like that and other ways of doing he
also found that if these people are
introduced into a market system
they start selling and buying they can
do all the computations immediately so
they must have the whole number system
and the same that appears to be true
about color systems like a lot of the
system is well known that there are
languages that don't have color words
sometimes beyond black and white but as
he found with the australian aboriginal
groups they have other ways of
expressing it so they may not have read
that they can say blood like you know
and so the whole conceptual system wall
seems to be there the arithmetic is
particularly interesting because where
that comes from is is an old problem
after that goes back to the origins of
evolutionary theories of Darwin and
Wallace puzzled about the fact that all
humans they did know all the data but
they were right that all humans have
arithmetic will capacity and that's a
puzzle for them because it wasn't
selected it's never been used so there
was no selection in fact the using the
earth medical system is very recent and
very restricted to small groups of
people but everybody's got it
so where to come from Wallace in fact
thought that there has to be some other
process in evolution beyond natural
selection Darwin didn't like that so
they debated it what I think the answer
in all these cases has to be that these
things are kind of piggybacking on
systems that are already there for some
reason in the case of arithmetic if you
look closely at language design at the
computational the elementary
computational Princip
that enter into the generative procedure
that they actually yield arithmetic if
you take those procedures and you take a
system with one element and the lexicon
call it one it yields arithmetic so it
could arithmetic just could be you know
piggybacking on the system that's
already there but what about music there
is work some interesting work trying to
show that the basic properties of
musical systems are similar to the
structural properties of linguistic
systems is quite interesting work on
that maybe that'll come out dance you
could try this
a female some Goodman tried to do
something with dance but I think these
are really good question so the question
you have to ask where do these things
come from in the case of language we
have no idea where it came from but you
can imagine a way in which it could have
evolved suddenly it's a slight rewiring
of the brain that maybe the other things
just spin off them maybe there's some
other origin it's a good question but in
order to study you have to accept the
notion of modularity that is not used in
the philosophical literature not in put
modularity but rather central modularity
and that's what's explicitly denied by
Fodor and implicitly denied quite
generally
dr. Chomsky and I am a student of
linguistics in UCD my third year
one of the things about you mentioned
that the cow I was reminded I went to a
coffee shop just before I arrived here
but somebody's looking for the toilet
door and they were indicated to her to a
bookshelf citizen or so in a sense I'm
surrounded by doors in useful building
so that idea that for the door is
assumed to be that it looks like
something else but still as a function
in tourism tourism to Eureka yeah but I
was interested as well the idea that I
believe he wasn't use before the cost
conceptual metaphors which we should use
so the matter as well that is almost
become away which ideas are as far as
through political systems so that
so there are what sounds like serious
questions about whether the language
depends on thought or thought depends on
language but in order to study those
questions you have to clarify what you
mean by language and what you mean by
thought and the fact is there's very
little to say about thought except
insofar as thought is expressed in
language which undercuts the
investigation we have to find a way to
think about the thought that's language
independent and that's not easy I mean
you could do it in other domains like
you know imagery visual domains how do
you find your way home at night things
like that well it's some kind of thought
a lot of it can't be expressed in
language but this is no theory of
thought and until there's a kind of some
kind of a theory of thought that's
independent of language it's gonna be
very very hard to even pose the
questions so it's a traditional question
and but it's one of those questions
which I don't think we're in a position
to formulate because we don't understand
we mean by thought this is where the
misinterpretations of touring play a
role so it's a good question is I don't
have a baby farm with formulated yet I
think we have time for one more question
Paul L burn every Paul you will
introduce your perspective what
diagnosis it was since a media story I
marry mr. College in London
I'd like to ask you about something that
you said in response to a question a
couple of questions back maybe about
words not having real-world a reference
[Music]
as well what effector to point out is
that some of those cases seem to be
cases that are not accessible or not
easily accessible to consciousness
service that Walter Woodhouse you
pointed out will be strange features
orbit both now and in your writings but
I think it takes you know someone to
point out those kinds of pictures before
people realized about with other
examples though I think the ordinance or
you know the words to say the facts that
these phrases don't have real-world
reference seems more easily accessible
so
another sentence of yours I think ago
seemed like the bank moved across the
room after burning down yeah
which seems at first like a perfectly
straightforward sentence a little more
or less because throughout the training
of of events but then when you reflect
on it for just a second you think that's
funny you know there can be nothing no
real object could have a burn down and
then cross the road which is the point
any example so so my question is these
four the last kind of examples how is it
that we are able to use those Simmons's
so easily to convey a truth because it
seems on the first inspection at least
that you know if a sentence either
asserts or presupposes the existence of
an object that does not exist and then
he did many of these cases cannot exist
it seems unlikely should either just a
current false or they should come out
actually I should mention that Paul is
the only person who writes on Maddox who
takes any of this seriously so it's
unique but I think what it means is just
that most of what we do is unreflective
it's it's kind of like a seeing a rigid
object in motion when there's we're
seeing the moon
illusion or understanding other people
we have the slightest idea how we do it
we can't introspect into our own
behavior any more than we can introspect
into falling bodies I mean it's just
intuitively obvious that if you have two
two objects of different mass they're
the one with a larger mass is going to
fall faster this turns out to be false
but that's if we can't introspect into
something as simple as say falling
bodies or why some things fall others
rise how can we hope to introspect into
anything as complicated as what the
human mind is doing you've got to study
it from the outside of the way you study
other things and when you do it's very
hard there are illusions about one of
the main illusions in the goes through
all of intellectual history is that
somehow the ourself we ourselves ought
to be the easiest thing to study because
we can look into what's going on
so say you know Tom Nagel asks what it's
like to be a bat and that we can give
the answer but try answering the
question what it's like to be me I don't
think anybody can answer that question
either at least I can it's you can't
pose questions like that they don't mean
anything we to figure out what it's like
to be me or a bat or a nematode or no
matter how simple it is is a hard
scientific question and to ask what it's
like to be a person even yourself is
maybe that one of the hardest questions
you can write novels about it write
poetry about it or something but you
can't get a discursive account just
can't answer the question and I think we
can't hope to answer the kinds of
questions that you're talking about just
by introspection somehow when people use
the word Bank let's say they
automatically understand what you just
brought out and they don't find it
confusing unless you point out to them
look this technically doesn't make any
sense and then you get things like
secret keys puzzles but the puzzles
arise because you're trying to present
in a rational form that's you know
somehow objective things that are
handled by totally different way
yeah well I think I think we have to set
up two different systems there's error
many different systems in fact I think
there's a probably a high level of
modularity in the mind one of our
capacities they call it a science
forming capacity which every one every
that has in some fashion is to try to
make sense of our experience in a
coherent way
I mean Russell once pointed out that the
only thing we're really confident about
is their own immediate experience and
the rest of inquiry including all of
science is to try to give some coherent
account of what this experience is and I
think that's basically right this
science farming capacity which children
use to make sense of the world members
tribe Jews and so on as it's just a
different one it's also trying to make
sense of the use of language so for
example when you a child let's say if
present you know
Piaget tintype experiment where you know
something moves and something else move
the child will automatically set up the
content and invisible contact between
them you know there's got to be some
invisible mechanical thing that's
causing them to interact because that's
just the way we see the world that
in fact that's a major event in the
history of science it was when Newton
showed that doesn't work when he
demonstrated that evil was called in the
mechanical philosophy the assumptions
about the nature of the world that were
made by every great scientist you know
go they of oddments Descartes though
again to everyone and Newton himself he
believed it and that's why he regarded
his discoveries an absurdity that no
person with any scientific understanding
could pay any attention to but they just
happened to be true that you can't have
a mechanical universe that you have said
what he and others regarded as a kind of
alcohol property action without content
can't happen and our intuitive way of
understanding the world just happens to
be different from the way the world
appears when we apply our science
forming capacities to it that was a
wrenching moment you know in fact
changed the whole nature of science so
for Galileo of the great scientists of
the early modern period the goal of
science was to show that the world is
intelligible post Newton it changed that
took a long time for it to sink in but
basically changed we give up the hope of
understanding the world but we just try
to understand theories about the world
which is totally different that's when
you get you know apparent contradictions
like Hume who understood this pointed
out that Newton's the greatest
achievement was to show that there are
mysteries which we will never comprehend
he was referring to things like action
without contact interaction with
content on the other hand to get modern
scientists and philosophers like David
Deutsch David Abraham many others affect
generally who condemned what's called
mysterion ISM there's yet that is there
are things that we cannot comprehend
that's a damn tenet lots of others this
is some kind of pathology this in
principle we can understand anything
well what they're claiming is something
quite they already internalized the
change of the conception of science from
trying to discover an intelligible world
given up by the time Newton's
discoveries sank in to trying to
discover intelligible theories and maybe
we can develop an intelligible theory
about anything ever
you know about almost anything maybe
anything you can think of but that
doesn't mean that the world's gonna be
intelligible so mysterion is of just
almost has to be true and it was proven
by a in fact though he didn't like it he
thought it was absurd that Hume
recognized that recognize look it's true
what can we do with it
Locke recognized so luck you know one of
his great insights was you know what's
called Locke suggestion in the history
of philosophy that he said that just as
there are he putted the theological
framework where we can extract it from
that what he said is just as God added
to matter properties which we cannot
comprehend like action at a distance
so God might have superadded to matter a
Faculty of thinking it's the hypothesis
of thinking matter which was
it kind of opened up the possibility of
really having a scientific psychology
dropped for a couple of centuries but
that's it basically that you have to try
to figure out well what is the property
of whatever's in there that allows
thinking but I think that gets right
back to your question we can with their
scientific capacities we can look at
this and say hey there's something
really wrong here we have to have
another system for describing it which
doesn't have these internal
contradictions and that's just a
different system than what we call
common sense our ordinary ways of
looking at things and within the that
system you can devote in fact you try to
develop a notion of reference so in say
physics or linguistics or any other kind
of organized inquiry you you hope that
the entities that you construct mental
entities that you construct symbolic
entities you hope that they actually
pick out something that exists in the
world so if you scientists think they
found the Higgs boson they would like to
believe that there is a Higgs boson out
there you know and if linguist talk
about phonemes they'd like to say you do
something real that's a phony but that's
a totally different notion from the ones
in our ordinary language in fact this
leads to a lot of problems in
contemporary philosophy I think I like
take the whole twin earth discussions or
the idea that you know the water is h2o
all of those discussions they're just
mixing up two different systems
you can ask whether water is h2o in
natural language say English because it
doesn't have the word h2o
that's from another system you can't ask
whether water is h2o in chemistry
because it doesn't have the word water
and of course chemists use it informally
but they have h2o and not water there's
no if you actually look at what water is
in human language it's a very complex
notion doesn't any do h2o of course but
soap even you can't pose the questions
that are discussed in the between Earth
literature because of mixing two quite
distinct systems it's kind of curious
because the the philosophers who develop
these systems believe something that
comes from quietens it gets done and so
on that you can that words don't have
meaning except inside a language okay
well if you believe that then if you mix
up to two languages it's got to be
incoherent yeah and you'll get what
looks like a sentence water is h2o but
water is getting its meaning from
English and h2o is getting its meaning
from chemistry and chemistry is a system
which at least strives to have reference
that's the whole point of science and
English is a system of done strive to do
anything it's just it's just like
walking it's what it is yeah that
doesn't happen I have reference
thank you very much we'd not only have
used all the time allocated to this
session without going beyond it and
thank you professor Chomsky for your
generosity in answering all the
questions I think the apartment like
officially to make a presentation to you
at that stage and then we'll convey our
thanks as a group I would like to thank
professor Chomsky for this wonderful
occasion and thank you for coming and
this is a book of our treasures in the
Academy believes of our actually here
but also we have many treasures which
are and the national museums and and so
on and you will be interested that so
much of it has to do with natural
philosophy in the chemistry and so on
but there are very many beautiful things
and very thank you thank you very much
