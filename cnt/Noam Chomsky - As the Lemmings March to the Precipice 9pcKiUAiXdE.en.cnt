there have been some steps to addressing
the environmental crisis the Paris
agreements of last December have finally
gone into effect officially the
provisions are inadequate but they're at
least something and a basis for going on
it had been hoped that the negotiations
would lead to a verifiable treaty but
that goal was not attained its only a
voluntary agreement much weaker of
course the reason for this was clearly
understood it was actually reported in
the press though not prominently enough
the reason was very simple the
Republican Congress would not accept
binding commitments so there is no
verifiable treaty only something much
weaker a matter of no slight importance
and virtually no comment that's an
astonishing fact if you think about it
that a major political organization in
the most powerful country in world
history is literally dedicated to
destruction of much of life on Earth now
that might seem to be an unfair comment
but I don't think it is right now we're
in the midst of the quadrennial
electoral frenzy think about the
Republican primaries which recently
ended in the Republican primaries every
single candidate denied the facts about
climate change there was one exception
the guy who was supposed to be the
sensible moderate John Kasich he
conceded the facts but said we should do
nothing about it which is even worse
than denying them that's a hundred
percent the winning candidate it calls
for more use of fossil fuels including
coal plants the most destructive he also
calls for dismantling regulations
refusing fun
to developing societies that are seeking
to move the sustainable energy and in
every possible way accelerating the race
to disaster when you consider the stakes
it's a fair question whether there has
ever been a more dangerous organization
in history than today's Republican Party
I think the answer is no and worse still
there is no commentary on this right
through the primary campaign very little
sense that astonishing blindness as the
lemmings march to the precipice in fact
extends well beyond so in the past few
years there's been extensive and
typically euphoric coverage of the
prospects for a hundred years of energy
independence given new technology for
exploiting fossil fuels occasionally
there's comment on the local impact of
tracking but scarcely a comment if you
can even find one in fact and pointing
out that the euphoria amounts to an
enthusiastic call for the sixth
extinction to swallow us up at well that
similarly the growing threat of nuclear
disaster barely elicits a mention the
two most important questions in human
history on which the fate of the species
depends are virtually missing from the
extensive commentary on choice of leader
for the most powerful country in world
history
