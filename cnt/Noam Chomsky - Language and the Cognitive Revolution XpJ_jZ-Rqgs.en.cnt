nevertheless over some period this was
reinterpreted and given the contemporary
naturalistic approach namely aspects of
the world can be studied at various
levels and I have whatever property they
have if it's counter to air in common
sense intuition too bad for our
intuition that has no status so if in
fact I can affect the moon by moving my
arm it sounds crazy but if that's the
way it turns out okay and if it turns
out that the world is really ten
dimensional with infinite you know one
dimensional strings we'll okay sounds
crazy but if that's the way it turns out
fine intuition is irrelevant for them
where there are many levels at which we
can study this reality whatever it is
we're going to try to integrate them
that's the sensible version of the
unification problem there is no emotion
of existence or reality apart from what
figures in our best explanatory theories
in particular there is no theory at all
of the physical or the material these
concepts have disappeared with Newton
therefore we have no coherent question
to ask about what lies outside the
physical there no longer is a mind-body
problem except just by arbitrary
stipulation and the reason is there is
no such thing as body until somebody
tells us what physical means there's no
question about what lies beyond the
physical and physics has no concept of
physical it's just whatever we come to
understand or maybe more narrowly
whatever we come to understand in such a
way that there's at least a reasonable
prospect of integrating it with the core
Natural Sciences kind of loose idea but
there's no concept of physical or
physical reality beyond that turning to
the case of thinking or solving problems
or speaking a language right now we are
a mote in this sense of physical reality
we're most confident about the physical
reality of computational
representational systems at least by
naturalistic criteria so let's take an
actual case there are recent studies in
the case of language interesting studies
of it within the study of computational
representational systems you find many
different category
expressions I won't give details but for
example is a category well-formed
expressions perfectly grammatical and
then various kinds of deviant
expressions and they fall into all sorts
of different types
somatic incompatibility violation of
some principle violation of another
principle and so on that's internal to
the study of computational
representational systems only very
recently there's been some work on
electrical activity of the brain or
called event-related potentials and
which people have pretty surprisingly
but interestingly discovered specific
carlitz to these categories so a
particular kind of category of deviant
expression yields a characteristic event
related potential difference a specific
kind of brain of electrical activity in
the brain well that's kind of
interesting but why is it interesting
well it's interesting because it but
think notice that the thing we're
committed to from a scientific point of
view is the categories of expressions
given by the computational
representational system those are the
categories that come out of a background
of theoretical explanation and empirical
justification and so on the
event-related potentials are just
curiosity
I mean what's interesting about them is
that they correlate with what we
understand to some extent and therefore
maybe they're interesting notice these
are two the studies of the brain at two
different levels one it's electrical
activity one its computational activity
in the case of the computational
activity we have reasonably well
grounded theories with explanatory
character and so on in the case of the
electrical activity we know nothing just
a lot of noise up there but now the
study of the electrical activity the
brain has made progress because it has
found something that correlates with
what we understand much better namely
the computational representational
systems now maybe if these correlations
are extended and placed in a richer
theoretical framework will actually
begin to rely on them for some inquiry
that'll tell us something about the
computational representational systems
but that's the order of priority and
ground
goodness from the point of view of the
Natural Sciences the usual interpret I'm
stressed that because the usual
interpretation again is the opposite and
mistakenly of course in this
naturalistic approach we would never ask
such utter ly pointless questions as
whether airplanes fly or whether
computers think or whether algorithms
see triangles or whatever now what are
the real empirical questions and the
reasonable research programs well I
think they're the ones sketched earlier
it seems to me if we want to learn
something about humans or pigeons or
whatever we should begin by considering
something that though that they do well
and we should try to figure out how they
do what they do well we postulate some
particular Faculty of the mind meaning
the brain at a relevant level of
abstraction we try to determine its
properties in its mature state stable
state in its initial state we look at
the problems of state transitions
learning and growth the problems of
interpretation and a fixed state P the
receptive problems the problems of
execution of action insofar as that
study is feasible which is not very far
in fact virtually nothing we'll look at
the problems of unification one of them
being the integration of various levels
of inquiry the other the question of the
integration of cognitive systems the
first question we expect it's just their
scientific faith in unity of nature or
something we expect that there's going
to be an answer to the first question
whether we can find it or not but
there's no particular reason to expect
an answer to the second there may be or
there may not be if there isn't there's
no unified cognitive science for the
moment there's rural progress in a few
areas including vision at the
computational representational level and
in this case also at the cellular level
there's progress in language but almost
solely at the computational
representational level and some
performance
things like acquisition there's studies
of conceptual development closely
related language quite interesting there
studies of probabilistic reasoning and
error and various other topics there are
all sorts of areas where there's
interesting results concerning human
cognitive function as far as I'm aware
all within the framework of highly
modular assumptions which as I said seem
to be natural but apart from them but we
have very we're very far from any
understanding of the articulation the
architecture general structure of the
mind brain apart from a very few
specific modules which appear to have
their own special design that leaves
most of the questions one might like to
ask enshrouded in history and it's
entirely possible that this is mystery
of a kind that a human intelligence
which after all has its own specific
biological properties is unable to
penetrate even in principle
anybody wants to say things there are a
couple of microphones around yep I think
if you move over it will be either well
oh yeah oh good
sorry oh how about that yeah perfect
my name is George Watson I got about
three things on my mind one when you get
back to MIT and see your buddy sighted
when you get back to MIT and you see
your buddy study in there nematodes you
can pass a long time that you got it
from a farm in North Carolina he better
than we have black from st. you can pass
the long term that he got it from a
farmer in North Carolina there really
not go put them into soybeans he'll
never get his crop the market it's
interesting I didn't have any idea what
they were until I read this paper I'm
glad to know they exist the second thing
on my mind is I want to thank you
our probably never see you again and
I'll explain about 1973-74 I started
reading your writings on transformation
or generative grammar and I noticed
about every other paragraph on the page
you put a colon behind the verb and I
said I made a command decision I said
well the Chomsky can do it I can too
and I started that got me into
linguistics and international phonetic
alphabet and basically my
word of thanks to you is that today I
write what I think the way I want to you
I haven't looked up a punctuation rule
or a grandma rule since then glad to
have some impact on the world and my
attitude toward the prescription astiz
if they don't like it that's more of a
judgment of end and me I don't care but
you started me thinking I I said good
gracious if the if the way I have been
told the structure of the language is
wrong what's the impact on the
interpretation of the meaning and I had
to start going back to you everything
again I got Murata philosophy the second
time around I did first didn't
understand it the first time I
understand love a bit second Christmas
you talked about the 17th century I went
back read John Donne and for the first
time I understood what he was saying in
his poetry and I remember people falling
out like flies trying to read it the
first time when I was in undergraduate
school but you triggered the change of
thinking and me and I'm happy today
thanks to it I wanted to say that the
third thing is I got a question this is
more along the lines of what you were
saying last night
74 oil embargo gasoline went sky-high
interest went up everything went high
President Carter came in you think man
being a peanut farmer he had sense
enough not to putting the board embargo
on the soybeans when the Russians
invaded Afghanistan but he did and we
don't have those markets today thanks to
dumb peanut farm from Georgia I mean
it's tough matters and things like trade
deficits we started losing our
smokestack in a fish at least was what I
was reading in the papers about eighty
two three four and five we were gonna
become an information society and a
service society and
I noticed that we started laying off
people fiercely here of late
IBM 20,000 GM 74,000 the car
manufacturers which people always
considered stable companies in this
country or got these horrendous problems
but my question is of what is the trend
what are the trends that are going on
that we still aren't picking up on
because we don't have the cognitive
interpretation process figured out well
enough to look at the evidence to tell
us what's really going on because my
instincts are telling me that the
infrastructure of our society is being
heavily damaged and fed off with more
than an instinct I mean every statistic
from the study will tell you exactly the
same thing but only one comment I think
I just make a suggestion for thinking
about this I think you should be more
skeptical about the use of the word we
when you say we are losing our
infrastructure we are becoming an
information society we are losing
industry whose we is we the investors
who who own those industries well
they're not losing it they're just
transferring them elsewhere so suppose
that auto parts are being produced in
Mexico let's say our computers are being
computed on chips are being produced in
Taiwan or something and it's being done
by industries with corporate offices in
New York well from the point of view of
the worker in the United States yeah
you're losing your industry from the
point of view of the owner you're not
losing industry at all you're just
making more profit out of it with
cheaper labor now it just happens that
the people who own the industry are the
ones who are setting the policy by and
large so it's not too surprising that
you get the consequences you see and in
order to understand it it seems the
first thing we got to do is be willing
to
kind of disentangle ourselves from the
webs of ideology enough so that we at
least ask who the references when we
talk about we in the end from a pool of
people who are making the decisions
about social planning what happens to
the country isn't all that much
important what happens to the profits
and power of those who dominate it that
is important and those two things may
very well diverge I think they've
diverged pretty sharply in the last ten
years
Steve Kemp I gracious enough to answer
question in the last line I have a
question for two days ago Kenny at least
20 hours due to formulate the question
have you talked one of your principal
arguments for the innate miss of a
specialized module capacity of the
language is the rapidity with which
child acquires language and one thing
that struck me from your talk was that
the statement the child acquires
language rapidly is interest relative in
exactly the same fashion that the
statement Boston is near to New York
which was your example and how do you
answer some mind brain functionalist who
comes to you and says the child acquires
language excruciating explose slowly we
have this huge neural net there are
billions of synapse firings and billions
of weight changes I'm not good with
those you see if it is genuinely
interest relative and is the child
acquires right language rapidly is only
a true statement within some shared
interest how do you establish between
yourself and mind brain person a shared
interests that establish that your
statement is true that's a very good
point
in fact when I say that language is
acquired very rapidly that's all that's
you're absolutely right that's like John
is almost home what's rapidly that's
only meant to stimulate your imagination
it's not meant as a proposal the way
so the question is to construct an
explicit proposal as to how the language
is acquired now there are specific
proposals based on innate structure
there are no specific proposals based on
these nets so the arguments over if
somebody can propose this kind of what I
was saying before I mean if somebody can
propose a general learning mechanism or
some kind of a network or something that
does anything then we'll have something
to talk about so far the only thing we
have is highly specific structures and
when I give these qualitative comments
about it's done rapidly I simply mean to
say look what what else would you expect
I mean if children are picking up 12
words a day and every single one of them
meaning on one presentation and every
single one of them has the intricate
complexity that I only barely began to
illustrate in a case of one word you
know and if the same is true of
structural properties what else would
you expect
in fact what do you expect below the
neck so truly those are only qualitative
comments and they're not supposed to
convince anybody just sort of make you
think that what seems to be the case is
pretty natural but the real answer is
let's try let's construct a theory that
tries to explain why I take the
sentences I gave last time you know why
does John is too clever to expect anyone
to talk to me and precisely what it does
people know that without any evidence
that's easy to show they know it before
they've ever been presented with such
expressions so let's look for a theory
that accounts for that there is one
theory based on principles which are
pretty well established they apply in a
lot of different languages they seem to
work and so on and so forth that gives
an answer somebody can come along and
say well I think its neural Nets well
that's fine
maybe it's angels too but tell me how I
had sort of brainstorm just
I wasn't here last night a friend of
mine recorded that for me hopefully but
what the First Gentleman stope said
caused me to think and something you
said are kind of a general theme a motif
during your talk day really struck an
interesting chord with me the idea that
we seem to be directing our energy
studying things that people don't do
very well and that maybe we should we
could learn more by studying things that
people do do well that seems to point to
something on even a a mundane level for
me I I get the feeling that all of them
what might be called infrastructural
problems society today are when it comes
down to it moral problems we treat is
economics problems and these sorts of
things really I think ultimately have to
be solved on a moral level and I believe
that that will have to do with people
concentrating on things that humans do
well and when I think about it I think
that a lot of the things that people do
well are very simple subtle things that
people also take for granted
and that most of the people in this
world seems to be running around trying
to impress each other by doing things
better that people don't do very well
and I just wonder what uh what you
thought about this kind of thinking I'm
not sure I understand the implications
of what you're saying I mean it does
seem to me we ought to agree with
particular statements we ought to be
studying the things people do well if we
want to understand people I also agree
that the problems of society are and
substantial part mall problems but only
in the sense that when we plan our
actions we try to change things or
whatever we're we're doing it in terms
of some kind of moral values we ought to
be as clear about that as we can some
conception of what's right for people
and so on and it's good to be clear
about that
but beyond that I don't know where to go
I mean I think these subjects are too
intellectually fundament for deep
analysis to carry us very far you work
pretty much by instinct and intuition I
have I think that most people tend to
agree on these instincts and intuitions
when you sort of clear away a lot of
ideological cover and if you can you
want to sort of work with other people
about it or clarify your ideas or
whatever
you want to find that level at which you
have agreement about moral values and
then ask yourself rational questions
like none of those moral values and
given the way society actually is what
should I be doing to make it adapt
better to those moral values that's
being him you know responsible human
being whether it's in a small area like
the family or a big area like
International Affairs
I need try to clarify a little bit more
I guess I use the wooden world because I
tend to think of things moral as being
really more practical and taking place
on a simpler level I guess that's the
idea of that thought but when I say that
there's a lot of people in the world
seem to be concentrating on doing things
that people don't do well and they
should be concentrating on things that
people do do well the things the
examples that you gave of what people do
well were things like well walking and
talking and very simple things like this
whereas the examples of things that
people don't do well are things like
pole vaulting and maybe perhaps spending
a great deal of money to go to Mars by
the year 2000 well you know going to
Mars this certainly not something
you will but I don't think that answers
the question whether we ought to be
doing it or not the question is is there
any point in people going to Mars well
you know you go back and have a look at
the origins of that program and I think
you get a pretty straight answer to that
question that program originally came
out of the failure of the Bay of Pigs
invasion Kennedy needed a political
victory to overcome the effect of that
and he decided to set up a big crusade
the Apollo program we got this fantastic
thing we're gonna put a man on the moon
was there any point to that well there
was a big point for the electronics
industry they made a killing out of it
there was a big point for a lot of you
know scientists have got huge research
grants but there is a question did it
make sense to put a man on the moon as
distinct from a little receptor of some
kind you put a bunch of receptors on the
moon you don't have to worry about an
oxygen support system and you know
precautions for survival and so on and
so forth it's obviously going to be
vastly cheaper cheaper and vastly easier
from an engineering point of view when
you get any less information in other
words is a man the best instrument to be
on the moment well you know scientists
will have to answer that but I'm quite
certain the answer is no but a man a
human being is probably a very poor
instrument to be on the moon the choice
of human beings on the moon was to have
something dramatic to have something
that did get people excited and distract
them from their own problems and
subordinate them to power and and give a
shot to the electronics industry and so
on that was the motive for it and that
doesn't make any sense except you know
for IBM maybe but those that seems to me
the kind of questions that one should
ask not is it the kind of things people
do well or badly sometimes the kinds of
things people do badly are worth doing
like say quantum physics is the kind of
things that people doing badly that's
why there's so few people who can do it
well it's not like pole-vaulting kind of
quirk you know some people can do it
most people can but that's worth doing
thank you
you put me in mind of a possible
modification of Turing's test which if
you follow cartoons I'll call the mark
Alan's tamati test which is whether you
can tell the difference between the
cliche generating program and your
typical political candidate the typical
political candidate has more insults
that's very true in fact RA Lafferty
wrote a scientific I mean a science
fiction story where all the insults have
been standardized because we say my
opponent is an eight and a three and the
reply would be my opponent is the four
and a six
save save a lot of television time I
want to ask you what may not be quite a
question but when you talked about this
wonderful program which had generated
more whatever it was excitement interest
than anything in the history of the
intellectual world or whatever was they
said it reminded me of a conversation
that dr. stem over at NC State had with
a student that I witnessed some years
ago and the student said to dr. stem
what are we going to have workable
fusion energy and dr. stem said well
maybe in 50 years maybe in a hundred
years I don't know
and the students said well why do we
always see all these things in the paper
about fusions just around the corner a
great breakthrough etc etc and dr. stem
replied you have to say such things in
order to get your research grants that's
kind of like the quote that I gave
except in that case at least there's
something real going on in this case the
advertising is not obviously creating
at all well I guess the question or
possibly non question I want to ask is
you know there obviously is a good bit
of research money going into these AI
fold and I mean a lot of people paid
money to make just plain programs funny
thing I found I was working with a
friend of Mines commercial one and the
thing was awfully cowardly and I found
that if I told it to make a move that I
thought might work and then let it keep
me from getting killed then it worked
pretty well but if you just let it work
it took forever to do anything well I
must say on the I didn't say much about
it but I'm not quit you know I just did
my own the question of chess-playing
programs i only described the way i
thought one auto evaluator one ought to
first ask does it is it an interesting
question at the current moment of
science to figure out how people play
chess the answer that's probably no it's
not an interesting question of the
current phase of our understanding of
the mind but let's assume for the sake
of argument that it is an interesting
question so just for the sake of
argument then we take a look at the
progress some program that say does as
well as Kasparov or you know Grandmaster
now we ask does that program tell us
anything about the way humans do it and
the answer to that is flat no they're
designed so as not to tell us anything
about the way humans do it the programs
are designed to exploit the capacities
of computers which are different than
the capacities of humans so they have
deep search and fast
you know big memory and all that kind of
stuff so we therefore throw out the
systems instantly at least on scientific
grounds because they are learning so
they're studying what's probably a done
in question and they're giving an answer
which is totally useless so what's the
point well as far as I can see the only
point is either advertising and getting
research grants or maybe taking the fun
out of playing chess if there's some
other point I don't know what it is I've
helped this for about 40 years I should
say and I've never been able to convince
anybody so maybe I'm wrong the general
attitude remains the one that I quoted
from Herbert Allen that this is the sort
of core just like Drosophila you know
it's the sort of fundamental question in
the field and listen I mean as far as I
can see and have always felt it's
totally pointless question just a waste
of time
I mean maybe something or useful come
out on the side you know like maybe by
accident it will have some spin-offs
like you know maybe it'll help somebody
figure out more complicated software
ideas or something anything can always
have side effects but as a research
program than seen any make any sense if
that's the core of program of the field
and I think we just get rid of the field
ok let me try to ask my possible
question here then in your talk about
well in this tall you've described in
the natural science methods and ways of
doing things that are useful but then
obviously a lot of research money is
going into these things which are
apparently much less useful when this
wasn't quite to point insightful I think
is the thing you know a lot of things
are worth doing even though they're not
useful because they give you
understanding and understanding as a
value in itself but these things don't
even give you any understanding all they
do is maybe fool people or something
like that so what I'm wondering is is
there is there a connection in your
opinion or what do you think of the idea
that there might be a connection between
the kinds of things that get funded that
you know like real progress in science
and the kinds of things that get funded
in the economy and politics and so on
well first of all I don't regard this
depth of science so I don't know if
that's obvious from what I was saying
but I most of it doesn't seem to me
science at all it seems to me kind of
hype or maybe engine maybe
badly organized engineering or something
like that but within real science you
know people make mistakes but I think
there are you know there's sort of
reasonable interaction about what's the
right thing to do on sort of a rational
basis on this you know there's self
advertising and power trips and so on
and so forth
but when we move towards subjects that
have more intellectual substance you
move towards more integrity not because
the people have better genes but because
nature's a hard taskmaster and it
doesn't allow you to fake you know so
the more we understand the harder it is
to fake so you get more honesty just
kind of like that in areas like say the
economy and you know political decisions
and so on the stuff is usually for power
interests doesn't anything to do with
only marginal things to do kind of very
low order factors are things like humans
human significance or anything like that
which again is pretty you know I'm not
terribly surprising if you just look at
the institutional structures of the
society homes in a position to influence
decisions you know what their
institutional roots are well sort of
predicted kind of on trivial assumptions
thank you very much I'd like to close
with this comment if somebody makes a
computer that can do the sort of
analysis that you do then I believe
they've achieved something don't forget
you can't make compute you can't design
programs that do simple things like
talking like a two-year-old hi I wanted
to raise a point with the chess-playing
computer again I think it would take
issue with the fact or with your opinion
that they're they're useless right now
or they don't tell us anything I think
if we might be looking at it the wrong
way to say that a computer plays chess
but it doesn't model human thought makes
it useless I don't think that's not
useless it would be useless even if it
didn't model human thought maybe it
would be interesting but it would be
useless if it model human thought I'm
suggesting it's not only useless which
is not necessarily a major right period
but pointless but isn't it possible if
you look at it from a different
viewpoint to say can we design a machine
that can solve a problem within a
limited domain that humans have
difficulty with in which case I think a
chess-playing computers does very well
there's no point to designing programs
that will solve in general that will
solve problems within limited domains
there would only be that's like an
engineering problem this thing wouldn't
it be useful to build a beat machine
well not in that cell you know they can
build a big machine that helps you make
a bridge or something yeah that was
useful but there was no point in
building a big machine and similarly
there's no point in constructing a
program that'll solve some arbitrary
problem that you can do undoubtedly for
example it's trivial you can do
you can do it in your spare time if
you've taken the first semester of
computer science to write a program
that'll run through some decision
procedure for some simple part of
mathematics do that once you learned the
decision procedure and you learned how
to program he can do it so what but
maybe we're on taking steps towards
something we can use but that has to be
shown see that's it if somebody came
along and constructed some big machine
and said well you know this big machine
I constructed maybe it's a step toward
something useful well maybe but I'll
wait until I see okay well my point is
that it seems kind of selfish to think
that the only intelligence that we can
have or the only way we can solve very
very complex problems is to use a human
brain it's not true nobody believes that
you know you want to do weather
forecasting and every using human brain
really is all kind of mystical analysis
of winter weather patterns certainly
using computers going way beyond the
human brain that's an assignment
intelligence that's you know you you
want to solve a particular problem you
look for the best methods of doing it
for example if you want to solve the
decision problem for some elementary
branch of mathematics you'll use the
decision procedure that's not the way
humans do it right a global you want to
solve that problem for whatever reason
so there's one thing to say that we only
say the reason you try to understand
what humans are doing is because you're
interested in human beings right that's
if you're interested in human beings you
want to understand what humans are doing
that's total logical if you're
interested in solving a problem you try
to solve that problem okay like if there
was a purpose
- playing chess you know if there was a
purpose to winning chess championships
no that had some HS it's just a
convenient a convenient setting - to do
what - try algorithmic methods how
there's zillions of possible algorithms
and then you make a slightly different
game you make up a different algorithm
there's no point to it it's like growing
machines through arbitrary I think there
is a point what's the point the point is
that we know if it's doing a good job
right now but look we can set up endless
numbers and tasks and we can design
computer machines to do those tasks and
we can do it forever
there is no point well doing arbitrary
tasks you know sometimes it may turn out
that having tried an arbitrary test
you'll get something of some value but
you got to show that so like suppose
somebody said look I can build a machine
which will you know randomly interchange
the chairs in this room and I can do it
very effectively
well maybe can maybe can't is there any
point in building well I would argue
that the point for chess-playing
computers is that they experiment with
well there - I think theories right now
one is the chunking theory that berliner
uses and there's the other one which is
just kills it with hardware and we mean
theory has any intellectual interest
there is related to any problem of as
well that's an opinion well if you can
show that it is you got to show it well
I just here's the way I do
therefore it's worth doing if you have
to say look here's the way I do it and
there's some reason why it's worth
knowing the answer to that question
tell me the reason the reason can't be
that it beats somebody in a chess game
because that's of no interest well what
I'm saying is that maybe we could use
these a movie but maybe the guy who runs
the machine to randomize the chairs in
the room will get something that's
useful for some purpose to take any task
you like you know you crazy testy like
you could work on a machine that would
do it as fast as possible and you know
it's not inconceivable that as a result
of having done that absurd thing
something useful might come out but
that's not the way you do science I mean
what you can't think of anything
people in genetics didn't study
Drosophila because well you know let's
do something of random they looked at
their sample because they'll particular
questions to ask and one may be answers
to them the Drosophila happened to be
the right system the best system as far
as I knew to look at get those answers
similarly this guy who's looking at me
because they just say okay I'll try to
save him that name it does he picked
them because they're the simplest
organism with a wiring diagram worked
out anyone know something about wiring
diagrams I mean he's doing rational
inquiry you're trying to understand
something and you organize your task
your research program so it may lead you
to understand that you don't just do
something and the hope that something
will turn out well I don't think it's
that's true right now well what is what
is the goal well what we have in the
world are just we have a huge
environment and we have to do if you
want to maybe compute it is you have to
be able to make searches from a wide
variety of places I mean we have so many
choices we can do I can walk back to my
chair I can stand here I could skip back
to my chair you know we hit some we
don't study then because there's no
there's a multitude of choices
yeah but look there's
in those numbers of areas where you can
set up problems with multitude of
choices what thick this way you know if
you only pick this one you think I'm
gonna learn something from it see if the
model really is for Sokolow then let's
do with the basalt biologists did mr.
Sokolow ask a question that's worth
having an answer to sure the chess
playing is the way to answer that
question but nobody's doing them okay
touring test is fooled by algorithmic
systems believe you said something like
that well how will we know when we do
have an intelligent computer talk to it
longer no we're not we don't know ever
know whether we have an intelligent
computer any more than we will know
whether we have an airplane that flies
it's a meaningless question exactly as
Turing said how could I ask you this
question
we're let's say we're back in 1980 you
know or whatever the first right thing
was and suppose somebody came along and
said suppose I make something that goes
up in the air how we want to know if it
flies down the question you know it will
fly there's no question as to whether
it's gonna fly if you want to call that
stuff flying okay explain in English you
happen to decide to call it flying in
some other language you call it
something else but there is no empirical
question as to whether an airplane flies
and there is no empirical question as to
whether an algorithm things for exactly
the same reason flying is something boys
do talking English and thinking is
something humans do it sort of embedded
in a big matrix of human interests and
so on and just as airplanes don't do
whatever isn't birds are doing even if
they could pull somebody into thinking
that it's a
that would be irrelevant similarly
algorithms or brains are not doing
things that you missed for example is
there a question as to whether brains
think what brains don't think of course
they don't think my brain doesn't see
trying to help my brain let's forget
computers my brain doesn't see triangles
for trivial reasons seeing triangles as
a human action we tribute that
characterization to humans in a chrome
work of human interests and concerns and
motives the motion this notion is of
absolutely no use for science I mean did
we don't study in the sciences things
like thinking any more than we study
things like desks and the sciences I
mean these are concepts of common sense
now belong in the sciences they don't
enter into rational explanatory theories
so you in the sciences you constantly
trying to get rid of all these things
and move to concepts that have some
utility not things like discouraged
thinking or something like that or
digestion you know you look at what's
actually happening try to understand it
in terms of whatever concepts and
principles are relevant but to ask the
question whether a program thinks or
whether a brain sees a triangle is as
dumb is asking whether an airplane flies
it is not going to have an answer for
trivial reasons there is no answer to
the question whether airplanes fly and
there's no point setting up an analogue
of the Turing test that says well can we
construct something that's going to fool
a human under some circumstances that
tell us whether it's flying or not you
say you think I presume and what if we
make a machine with the attributes like
the human brain very complicated for the
human bringing an identity it's like the
human brain and the human brain doesn't
think well people humans humans do but
human brains don't any more than your
brain sees a triangle your brain doesn't
see a triangle for quite uninteresting
reasons and correspondingly something
with the characteristics of your brain
doesn't see a triangle people are the
ones who do things like that just as
prefering says now you can ask pointless
questions like what will be the
empirical conditions under which an
airplane flies yes the pointless
question you're never going to get an
answer of course now it's interesting
that any you know deal with sort of
phenomenal world like airplanes and
flying nobody asks those silly questions
I'm if somebody tried to start a new
science dealing with the question
whether airplanes fly they'd be laughed
out of you know know by the lab for the
humans contest there were some standards
yes but you don't ask whether cute
weather so you don't even ask what the
human spin applies where somebody came
along and said how do we know the humans
can't fly you take a look at the last
Olympics some guy went through your feet
why isn't that flying
no so any one order of magnitude that
Gainesville he argues that your grandma
Windows saucer so I don't date that much
that your grandma wind is the grammar of
a frenchman sorceress or our date that
much of the recent French intellectual
excitement is also rather pointless do
you have any ideas about the abuse have
you seen the papers at Hawley yeah
they could do this Norman Holland yeah
yeah you have these speculations that
you'd like to share with us today on
that talk very hard for me to comment on
the French intellectual themes as they
understand almost no word of anything
that has happened there for many many
years do you find any usefulness at all
and Gestalt very theory and Jungian
archetype archetypes mhm
well you know this actually this the
many of the ideas of Gestalt theory were
developed in a sort of a crazy context
admittedly but nevertheless developed
back in the 17th century discussions
there was a lot of discussion of EVP
like say Ralph Cudworth
and if you're willing to plow through
all the strange framework and the funny
idea is what you see is an analysis of
perception in terms of motions like
optimal forms causal factors you know
the ground figure-ground I mean a lot of
the ideas that later came up again in
installed psychology and there's
probably something to all those ideas in
fact you know some of them are even
beginning to be understood as far as the
avian archetypes are concerned I don't
understand a lot of it I've tried to
read it because as far as I know he
wanted as far as I'm able to determine
he's not great
people who ask questions about the
structure of knowledge systems which is
interesting most people haven't asked
such questions but whether there's
anything to those answers I don't know
am i I was wondering he said it there's
no purpose in studying things that we
don't do good that we do bad you said
that there's no purpose in studying
something we don't perform well but if
you wanna learn about us
there may be a purpose for some other
reason but um if you take an algorithm
and you see when this algorithm collapse
I mean first of all there's so much
effort in this direction I wonder how
could you just dismiss it like this the
saying there's no pointers and the so
much research envisioned studying visual
illusions and trying to deduce I mean
even the strip effect you're taking in
effect you see when our system collapse
and then you try to juice facts from it
and I just don't that's not the same
aversion to something moving very well
yeah but we made it perfectly in fact
that's why it studied that's why people
study an acre cue but an illusion is an
example of a situation where algorithm
for calculating something is collapses
you can do the same thing visuals
indecision behavior you can say that
when people and our intransitive they
perform some kind of an illusion because
they dress with reality a different
thing and then you could try and deduce
thing about the algorithm that really
exists in there that collapse under
these circumstances and maybe you can
learn something about the algorithms
well you know the fact that maybe you
learn about algorithms is not
interesting people study emotion
or people study say their ski style
studies of probabilistic errors because
that's something that people do
perfectly and they all do it and intend
to do it alike people do it fast and
spontaneously and of course one but from
other kind of you don't want to give
what the objective right answer is
that's not the issue
the point is studying say illusions like
TextEdit studying us take even simpler
than illusions take the study of
apparent motion okay no that's apparent
motion means you know a couple of dots
on the Kiska scope that show up and
people look at it and they see a line
well what they're seeing is wrong from
the point of view of the physical source
there wasn't any line they were just two
points but you're studying something
that people don't extremely well very
rapidly quickly without training they
all do it like you give them two points
in a particular relation they see a line
so therefore you won't tell you again
that's a good thing to study but wrong
in bed in this direction are also wrong
in bed are very well educated
terminological confusion what people do
extremely well is misinterpret that
illusion and that's why you study but
chess is not like that task
I'm not gonna be watches well what are
you doing well I'm talking about
defected and I think basically the
confusion is between what you call good
in what I call and I mean you mean fast
or accurate or the Marines
I mean the kinds of there are certain
kinds of action that people do naturally
and they do it alike and they do it fast
and they do it without training and so
on and this is what I mean think some
people do well now on one of those
things are for example misinterpreting
illusions okay but they're in that
category is just a terminological
confusion but if we do something bad
doesn't it mean that our system in some
way collapses under these circumstances
for instance collapse if you see two
points on it to kiss the scope is a long
and your system didn't collapse it just
gave a delusion which happen to be
inaccurate but that's not the system
systems working perfectly systems
working perfectly we might want to
understand how it works and in fact a
good deal of contemporary vision studies
that deals with just those things and
it's learned a lot about the system's
because those are things that people do
well fact David Marr who I quoted whose
point was that you should study things
that people who will was studying
exactly those things because those are
things that people do well mainly
misinterpret illusions and
characteristic ways so I don't I mean my
definition of what people are doing
badly is your definitions people do
let's just settle around terminology
we're only having a terminological
notational dispute really understand
what category were identifying okay the
category of recognizing straight
straight lines in an apparent motion
experiment is one category one and pull
wall thing and doing chest is category
two and running mazes that's category
two now Marv is saying and I agree with
them we should study category one if you
don't like my terminology for describing
it have any stake in the terminology I'm
sorry I will have to cut in gnome
I'm sorry we Noam Chomsky has another
okay one last person go ahead yeah you
mentioned in the beginning of you talk
about ways that humans represent their
knowledge of the world which I presume
you mean that they gained through
experience I don't mean that that's an
open question I would assume that most
of our knowledge of the world is not
gained through experience attending for
the same reasons that most of our
knowledge of language isn't or for the
same reasons that most of our physical
structure isn't knowledge what you know
sort of knowing about the world is so
deep I mean here we're just guessing my
guess is that that's going to break down
into many different modules but well let
me come back to what this guy Charles
Rocklin said in in the study of a an 800
cell organism with 300 neurons where the
wiring a diagram has worked out the
connectionist models are far too
abstract and far too remote from
physical reality to tell you anything
right we now ask the question in the
case of a system of 10 to the 11th
neurons where we don't know anything
about it might these systems be
physically real well you know it's not
ruled out but I don't think one
scientific intuition would lead one to
be very hopeful
okay this completes the circle it talks
that Nome has given here at the
University and I would like to take the
opportunity to thank him on the behalf
of the whole University community for
these engaging speeches and interviews
thank you
