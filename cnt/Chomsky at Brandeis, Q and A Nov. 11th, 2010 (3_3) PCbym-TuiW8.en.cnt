self defense without firehouse CZ i take
take custom rockets I think the one you
know one threat they feel they had they
know how exactly how to stop the cosmic
Rockets mainly reinstitute the ceasefire
as Hamas as requested during the
ceasefire crucial fact during the
ceasefire even though Israel didn't live
up to it they maintained the siege which
is an act of war that although Israel
didn't live up to it Hamas did there
were no Hamas rockets period not my
opinion that's the official Israeli
assertion jun 2008 when the ceasefire
was instituted preceding five years it
was mostly Israeli attacks mostly
overwhelmingly in fact I went through
much of them the main attack started
almost immediately after the stage
withdrawal January 2006 that's when the
US and Israel imposed a harsh harsh
sanctions in in reaction to the
Palestinian election it was pretty bad
if you go to june two thousand six it
was very good they were very serious
Israeli attacks on on in Gaza of
murderers attacks
in june two thousand seven the next year
when hamas a beat back the US attempt to
overthrow the government by a military
coup at that point the US and Israel
imposed an extremely harsh siege now
that's an act of war that's a serious
act of war and Israel of all countries
accepts that remember that Israel went
to war several times because it claimed
that it was being threatened by a siege
in 1967 the justification for the
Israeli war was that Egypt was
threatening access through the Gulf of
Turin that was a threatened minor siege
and Israel regarded as an act of war
defeat by those right or not but
certainly the siege on Gaza is far more
extreme so that's a major act of war
it's combined with constant military
attacks constant attacks assassinations
invasions and so on and yes there were
rockets that minimal rockets that the
heart which is of course a criminal act
in itself and Israel knows precisely how
to stop just accept the ceasefire means
ending the criminal siege and you're
done no no no house and rockets they
don't want it because it's another case
of how states prefer
expansion and domination to self-defense
or not happen why isn't there any people
in this room really well obviously
anyway i'll be glad the document you
like i would take a very interesting
comments exploring you exploring what
are clearly exploring them and the light
that goes on well i'm sorry i don't know
what issue your what yeah what issue
