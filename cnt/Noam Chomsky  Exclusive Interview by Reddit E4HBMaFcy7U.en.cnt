Ethan
probably
yeah I said
yeah this just the end I got more stuff
for you
I'll show you
Oh
very
you know I've others boys my house
alright
you
trying to ask
it's broke curious yeah
her
ok yeah
Master
hi hi Tim hi it's a whirl so what's up
pearls of what I'm here to where we
talking about um so these are reddit is
a social news site now so we this is a
plus we put the other day a lot of
requests interview Joe yeah i mean i
just wanted to show you it got almost
two thousand questions all right
comments and so two seconds per first
but a week i have a list here of 10 but
if they're okay i know you bloom the
time something you know as we get to the
three great britain was he using there's
no I just wanted to okay he was back in
alaska to get rich by rosedale yeah in
any particular complexion to it or so
read it was a story about programs so it
still tends to be kind of a lot of
computer science people but and they
just even the question some people i
have various sized backgrounds and i put
it sees surely they're done much closed
door yeah okay it's really over there
can you get this thing Highness or open
yes sir
ok and save a few minutes or the end
because one of the one of the things we
like to do with our interviews is give
you a chance to ask a question back to
write it down if you want to totally I
it goes it could be about broad topic or
something versus I think you're just
sort of okay more yeah so great so yeah
these are the questions and what would
be great so these are the user names of
the people who okay too handsy to read
them so yeah if you can read the user
name nice and then and then read through
the question mr. owns a little long I
don't know if you want to look you know
if you feel like jumping running in
after part of it that's fine but yeah if
you can read the username here some of
them are not easy pronounced cuz you
made from the internet so just do the
best yeah I'll keep an eye on time we'll
get through here I'm if you can just
read the top of screen tests out here
ok
whenever you're ready and if you need to
take a broke editor some throws bother
you just get started God's up here it's
permanent yeah just just stir OH he may
be introduced yourself okay first
question here is from cocoon 56 do you
currently see an elephant in the room of
cognitive science just like you named
150 years ago I guess that's a reference
to my critique of radical behaviorism
but something that needs addressing but
gets too little attention well one thing
that I think gets too little attention
in the room of cognitive sciences
cognitive science most of the work
that's done just doesn't seem to meet a
bear on cognitive science I could pick
up a couple journals your viewing exam
give examples the cognitive science
ought to be concerned is this should be
our biology if you're into sit it's
concerned with the nature the growth the
development maybe ultimately the
evolution of a particular subsystem of
the organism namely the cognitive system
which should be treated like the immune
system of the digestive system the
visual
system and solar when we study those
systems there are a number of questions
we ask one question is of course you
know what they are going to characterize
them but that's almost totally missing
in cognitive science I would take my own
particular area of interest language the
time working what's going of side and
some with full language but it's very
rare to see some effort to characterize
what it is you can do that wouldn't make
much difference what else you do the
same kind of question you have to ask
about any organ if you light so who's
the term loosely subsystem of the body
is how it gets the way it is so how'd it
go from some initial state which is
genetically determined to whatever state
it assumes and in investigating that
topic there are a number of different
factors of you can take apart for
analytic purposes of one is the specific
genetic constitution thats related
specifically for this system
mean that every piece of that is used
only for this system but just whatever
combination of genetically determined
properties happens to be to determine
that you have a million rather than an
insect visual system for example or gut
brain or whatever maybe that's one the
second is whatever data are outside that
modify the initial state to you look
some obtained state and third is what
are they had a laws of nature enter into
the gross development of the system
which of course they do overwhelming I
mean nobody for example assumes that you
have to get a genetic program to
determine that sells split into spheres
not cubes let's say let's do too
minimization of energy other loss of
nature in the same hopes throughout the
course development of course the same is
true for evolution evolution takes place
within a actually the specific physical
chemical channel of options and
possibilities and the physical laws
interval of time and didn't termini what
goes on and third questions that is
kinda like a ye question why is system
this way not some other way well there
again you there you go back into at this
point you really are facing personal
just dissed Oracle accidents like you
know asteroid hit the earth but more
significantly how do the physical and
chemical properties of the universe
enter into determining that certain
evolutionary changes take place under
particular circumstances well that's the
array of questions that oughta be asked
it's very hard to find any focus on
these questions at least in the areas of
cognitive science and I'm particularly
interested in like language for example
what you have is
extreme efforts which are sometimes
extremely strange to try to show that
trivial problems for which we basically
know the answers have had for 60 years
it can be somehow dealt with by the
massive data analysis so
examples but then I think I've written
about examples I think it's kind of off
track I'd like to see cognitive science
focus on the topics that are going to be
addressing now this is a very broad
brush so a lot of it does and is very
working cognitive science but this my
opinion too much be restricted in a lot
of the time and effort is spent my new
margin wasted on the birth delicious
wishes I'm a sense which we look at the
maneuvers which just collapse it
constantly if I made our kind of a
residue of the radical behavior isn't
that field salt that would become as it
developed could give examples the it's
mine but a very general broad brush
feeling unfair to a lot of very good
work but trying to
pick up tendencies which I think ur off
track this evening
second comes from the silent number
where some of your criticisms of today's
anarchist movement how to be as
effective as possible something they
anarchists over the look and your press
most prolific voice on this topic so
your thoughts would be very influential
I'll agree with the last comment but my
criticisms of today's an anarchist
movement are a little bit like the
pratik of cognitive science what is
today's anarchist movement I mean
there's quite a lot of people affected
on a present number of people who think
of themselves as being committed in some
fashion to what they call anarchism but
is there an anarchist movement I can one
think of is there something like as a
during the day how 20 years ago I happen
to be in Madrid that have to be made it
there were huge demonstration made a
demonstration hundreds of thousands of
people from the CNT do anarchist labor
organization well I haven't kind of
criticisms of the anarchist movement
since pain so at least of something that
pointed something there was something
criticized or to support to try to
change you but today's baptism in the
United States as far as I can see is
extremely scattered a highly sectarian
so each particular group is spitting
great duelist I'm attacking some of the
tendency sometimes doing useful
important things but it's extremely hard
to I think what is this is not just true
of people people think of themselves
anarchists but of the entire activist is
that the left it count noses there's
plenty of people more than the word at
any time in the past that I can think
except for maybe tiny piece very brief
moment in the late 60s our CIO
organizing and 30s and things like that
but there are people interested in all
sorts of things you may walk down the
main corridor at this university discs
students very active or engaged what's
pretty issues but highly fragmented
there's the very little coordination
there's tremendous sectarianism and
intolerance mutual intolerance
insistence on my particular choices do
with priorities would be and so on so I
think the main criticism the anarchist
movement is that it just ought to get
sacked together
will become
except divisions and controversy we
don't have the answers to letter
that all the end we have maybe
guidelines as to what kind of society
would like specific answers nobody
noticed that much and they certainly
funny a four inch of room for quite
healthy and constructive disagreement on
choice of tactics and priorities and
options but I just seemed too little of
that being handled in a comrade Lee
civilized fashion with a sense of
solidarity in common purpose as to how
to be as effective as possible yeah
that's exactly the point what should we
address don't have to give a list of
severe problems that the
world faces a summoner are extremely
severe so for example there are really
questions of Species Survival literally
at least two maybe more one of them is
the existence of nuclear weapons
somebody watching from Mars that would
think it's a miracle that we've survived
for the last six years and it's
extremely dangerous right now I said I
can't see a vacuum field would be a
priority and the other is a looming
environmental crisis and that is
something that anarchists particular
should be very dedicated to addressing
because it involves on one hand it does
involve the questions of technology like
can you get solar power to work and so
on and the anti-science tendency in
anarchism which does exist is completely
self-defeating on the school I mean is
going to take is going to require
sophisticated technology and scientific
discoveries to create the possibility
for a human society to survive unless we
decide well it just shouldn't survive
we should get down to you know hundred
thousand under gathers or something okay
except for that if you wanna be serious
about the billions of people in the
world who children and grandchildren
it's going to require scientific and
technological advances but it's also
going to require radical social change
and there's data particularly in the
United States but it's true elsewhere to
there have been a massive the state
corporate the social engineering
projects very self-conscious I were
doing since the same World War to try to
construct a social system that is based
critically on wasteful exploitation of
fossil fuels that's what it means to
suburban eyes to build highways and
stored railroads so on through the whole
gamut of planning that's been undertaken
well Hannah back means very substantial
social changes in order and ours are you
thinking about
I thinking about it doesn't just mean
I'd like to have a free and just society
that's not thinking about we have to
make a distinction if we want to be
effective that's the question if we want
to be effective we have to make a
distinction between which Michael
proposals sorry proposals and advocacy
you can propose that everybody ought to
live in peace love each other we
shouldn't have a hierarchy everyone
should cooperate and so on it's a nice
proposal okay for an academic seminar
somewhere advocacy requires more than
just proposal it means setting up your
goals proposal but also sketching out a
path from here to there that's advocacy
and the path from here to the air almost
invariably requires small steps it
requires recognition of social and
economic reality as it exists and ideas
about how to build the institutions of
the future within the existing society
kunin but also to modify the existing
society that means steps have to be
taken that accommodate reality that
don't deny its existence and sound like
it on the coral comedy that's these are
the only ways to the effect you can see
that if you look at the serious
substantial Annika's journalist it takes
a freedom to England which baby is the
oldest one of the oldest and his
generals that's been around through if
you read its pages most of it is
concerned with mild reformist tactics as
on a Christian it should it should be
concerned with workers rights with the
specific environmental issues which the
problems of poverty and suffering
with imperialism and so on yahoo should
be concerned if you want to advocate a
long-term significant the social change
where it's a war free and just society
and i can't have any way to be affected
otherwise you the insistence on purity
proposal simply isolates you from
effectiveness and activism and even from
reaching treatment approaching your own
goals and it does lead to the kind of
sectarianism and the narrowness and lack
of solidarity in common purpose that I
think is has always been a kind of
pathology of marginal forces left
particular but is particularly dangerous
here which gets to the next in sentence
from berserk RL is one question that to
summarize it
suppose we favor stateless society in
the long run it would be a mistake to
work for the elimination I said let him
be a mistake to learn to work for the
elimination of the statement short run
we should be trying to strengthen the
state because it's needed on the check
of power of large corporations yet the
tendency of a lot of anarchist research
man to his others is to show that the
power of large corporations to rise from
state privilege and governments tend to
get captured by concentrated private
interests but that would seem to imply
that the likely beneficiary the more
powerful state is going to be the same
corporately we're trying to oppose so if
business both derives from the state and
I so good at capturing the state why
isn't abolishing the state a better
strategy for defeating business power
than enhancing the state's power would
be what's very simple answer that it's
not a strategy and since it's not a
strategy all it can be a better strategy
the strategy of eliminating the state is
back in the level of let's have peace
and justice how you proceed to eliminate
the state can you think we're doing I
mean if there were way of doing it in
the existing world everything that
collapsed be destroyed you just can't do
it
there's nothing to replace if there was
a rich powerful network of cooperatives
community organizations worker control
of Industry extending over the whole
country the whole world in fact at any
talk about eliminated state but to talk
about eliminating the state in the world
as it exists is simply to keep yourself
in some remote academic seminar or a
small group you know saying gee this
would be nice it's not a strategy so it
can't be a better strategy we are faced
with realities what is described here
and in fact it's truly about plenty
about it too is that we have a number of
systems of power closely interlinked one
of them's corporate power business power
and that's by far the most dangerous of
all that means effectively unaccountable
private charities a second pretty
closely linked to the mistake power and
the Comets correct as the commentator
says I've written about it to LaVon the
state power tends to be overwhelmed
influenced by concentrated private power
okay those are real problems now we face
strategies so for example say take takes
a health care right on the front pages
what's the strategy for dealing with the
fact that tens of millions of people and
kick it for the best health care they
can get is to be dragged to an emergency
room when it's too late to do anything I
mean that's a real problem that's a huge
part of the population Sam problem is
that in a privatized unregulated
healthcare system like the united states
and i should say like because is the
only one in a privatized unregulated
health care system where the drug
companies are so powerful that the
government is need allowed to negotiate
drug prices and that kind of system
first of all health care is strictly
rationed by wealth very strictly and
simply it is designed in such a way that
the federal budget is going to be
destroyed you stick with the tendency
lawns will be anything left for
Google's for social security for worker
safety anything what will be left is for
the military that's untouchable keeps
going up another graph will look at
Obama has the biggest military budget
since Second World War so but as long as
that was over there untouchable another
elephant in the closet the radically
inefficient privatized unregulated
healthcare system is extremely harmful
for people except for the wealthy fine
and is also going to strictly house so
what we do about it well it's not a
strategy to say okay let's abolish the
state that doesn't do anything about in
fact it's just a gift to the
corporate state power sick because it
opens nothing a short term answer is to
do what the mentioned large majority the
population was wanted for decades unable
to develop a sensible national health
care system of the kind every every
other industrial country has one variety
or another has the large majority but
minions that you don't break down the
walls to organize people about it has
been for decades it's strongly opposed
by the corporate state axes but that's
not unbreakable you know their victories
have good one we can go to details you
know what what do you do about the fact
that the Democrats have sold out these
reasons not even minor palliate it was
like a public option and so on what do
you do about the fact that concrete
factors just an election in
massachusetts which is priced everything
almost completely misrepresented whether
that but one of the striking things
about the election was that union
members Obama's natural constituency the
Muslim people voted because this
tremendous apathy and they were wooden
cross aerate asleep election was won by
the wealthy suburbs but but those who
voted most of them voted for Scott Brown
Republic against the Democrats shooting
themselves in the foot incidentally was
one of the first things that happened is
to knock off one possibly pro-union
national Relations Board the 10 reasons
the reasons are very clear just briefly
repressed the reasons are that Allah
made it very explicit that he was not
willing to compromise or give up on
everything except one thing taxing union
members for their health care plans so
sure people aren't raged about that I
shouldn't maybe it's not a aggregates
positions simple elementary human
position okay if you're interested in a
long-term project of the question are
namely dissolving state and corporate
power you should be paying attention to
them you should be organizing work or
something you shouldn't leave it to rush
limbaugh of organized people with real
legitimate grievances that's the way to
fascism you should be out there
organizing on themselves on their
concerns their concerns can be related
to and easily related to much longer
term anarchist style projects but that's
where anarchists should be working and
the same is true and every other is part
of the side
but some things that are going on now
are kind of surreal but would offer real
opportunities for anarchist organizing
so let me take another the tendency in
the economy for the last 30 years but
state corporate planning since not
happen for out of the blue has been to
towards financial izing the economy and
the car learn that is undermining
domestic production to go together so
for example the share of financial
institutions in gb best product was
maybe three percent back in nineteen
seventy now it's a persian third and
comically a productive industry is being
sad which is fine for the owners rip
them if they could produce
Mexico China or something but it's
terrible for communities workers at the
same time it's finally being recognized
even by the corporate elite which has
been fighting bitterly against for years
that there's a real environmental crisis
coming and there I lose with the home so
they wouldn't do something bad and so
what they're now timidly saying as well
we should not be the only country in the
world and they've been industrial world
of been a high speed rail we should have
high speed rail minimal but significant
move towards dealing with severe
potential crisis well right at this
moment the government and the
corporations are dismantling productive
industry in SE michigan and indiana like
closing g emblazoned on sending the
production abroad
they're doing that that's one thing
doing the other thing that's happening
is that Obama's Transportation Secretary
is in your Spain using federal stimulus
money namely taxpayer money to try to
get contracts for a Spanish firms to
provide high-speed rail that the United
States needs can you think of a better
thing it's hard to think of it more
dramatic criticism of the state
corporate socio-economic system here our
communities and workforces being
destroyed well we well their tax money
goes to purchase in Spain what they
could be producing themselves actually
can't realize about that you're really
in trouble you're not a movement at all
of course that should be takes a to the
workers and Gary again Flint Michigan
or do they have to just sit and watch
this happen they can't take over the
work the work places the factories they
can run on themselves they can convert
them that's been done before much
greater conversion during the center of
the work of reproduction they'll need
state support for them because that's
the only institution that exists and the
only one that people could influence and
influence of privateering he can
influence the government's often than
done but take some support or near as
much as bailing out that Goldman Sachs
and so on it would take some it would
take a lot of popular support but it can
be done it can even be done within the
framework of conservative economic
theory which is pretty straight about
this text books on corporations let's
say I know it's not graven in stone that
they should work
shareholders which means a tiny
percentage of wealthy shareholders they
work in the interests of stakeholders
meeting work toward some community and
decide to do that but the workforce of
the community inside for those are
perfectly feasible efforts in fact it's
been done under cases where it's been
done this case was even to try on a very
large scale with us do and came close
was exceeded could with more corporate
support you know these are can go on
with this but these are real organizing
strategies which combine short-term
efforts which confront real problems
that people face in their everyday lives
with long-term objectives like creating
part of the basis for a society based on
free association so that I already
popular control and so on and it's
sitting right there in front of our eyes
those are maybe with the things we
should
not abstract questions like should we
try to destroy the state for which we
have no strategy
my feeling is that's the direction in
which kind of direction which thingy or
move it doesn't mean give it up your
long-term goals that's what I realized
and if there's another way to realize
them and their herd please present sorry
I think we're getting close to time here
oh so but if you want to ask a question
back to the community well I think of it
a lot of Islam I guess the question that
comes to mind his crews out of his
comments is there's a very large number
of people who are committed sincerely
and rightly to the kind of long-term
objectives that an actress have always
tried to look full and the question is
why can't we get together and decide on
and instead of condemning one another
for not viewing things exactly the way
we do why can't we try to formulate
concrete proposals which combine two
properties one dealing with the real
problems that people face in their
immediate daily lives you're going to
get anywhere you guys have to deal with
those that's not just for tactical
reasons it's also out of simple humanity
so on the one hand those while
maintaining as your guidelines the
conception of the kind of just and free
society that you would like to bring
into being through these steps and
sometimes the two were very close
together that's in case that I mentioned
like
take over a productive enterprise by
workforce communities which is not
it's a feasible objective that one that
has great deal of Appeal would have if
it were put forward as two brothers and
combines that both the long-term vision
and the short-term
dealing with real existing grievances
and problems and there are quite a few
things like that so the question is want
to focus on that rather than on abstract
questions such as what's the best
strategy for destroying the state
answered well though that strategy
because it was proposed
okay thank you
I'm sorry get through 2000 / but but
yeah maybe if I can email it to you you
have a chance to answer some of your
posts in our community we appreciate
that
I don't know your schedule selection
idiot
want to take her too much info
well okay what the pit mara wants to
write me an email with the answer
probably spend six seven hours a day
answer this is the more so is the
community that is involved in this
mostly sort of anarchism pendency um as
a whole outside not necessarily but i
think you mean when we announced that we
going to be visualized that really are
the strong sub-community of an artist
yeah yeah there's yet as a hood that's a
good year okay sorry I'm so rushed but
that's life we appreciate none of your
business
