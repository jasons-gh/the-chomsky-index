january 2008 january 2008 the official
US government position stated by the
president was that the u.s. was
committed to ensuring that there would
be permanent military US military bases
in Iraq permanent options for US
military actions in Iraq and privileged
access for us corporations to Iraqi oil
now that was always in the background
but in the early stages of the world was
kind of hidden under the usual
boilerplate of democracy and all the
other things but as the situation about
morning are desperate to the US they had
to come out with the truth and by 2007
early 2008 if you look closely the
official pronouncements were giving the
truth in fact they were saying exactly
what the left have been saying all along
that the goal of the war was to
establish a the US client state with the
major US military presence or it be in
position to nominate the region and of
course to control the energy resources
and picture US corporations had
privileged access to him he said that
for the years of the war you were
considered a
coming from Mars but finally by 2008
they had to concede it publicly
officially yes those are the warheads
and they had to give my for malia please
take a look at the Status of Forces
Agreement the US had to give up on every
one of those points that just as in it
had to step back year after year from
its efforts to prevent any form of
democracy and national representation of
the Iraqi democracy of nationalism just
added back door it's a major defeat in
fact one of the main books on war by a
very good British journalist Jonathan
Steele fifth grade it's called defeat
that's just the history of us feet and
in Iraq well what happens from now on
well depends whether Iraqis can continue
that process but it's just um for us to
learn to why was the u.s. forced to back
off well the primary reason was Iraqi
resistance nonviolent resistance some
major try them for non-violence but is a
secondary reason which is right here the
US population would not tolerate the
word us opposition to you constantly on
it's kind of a principle if you read
something if something is conventionally
belief in a primo take for granted it's
false and the opposite is true that is
commonly get this comment it's commonly
argued across the spectrum that there
was no opposition war in Iraq and people
welcome wasn't like Vietnam this huge
acquisition the barracks and other was
no opposition it's exactly the opposite
it takes it the vietnam war at any point
where it was at the same stage as the
iraq war and there was an office middle
not any no opposition but efforts to
express a physician were repressed
pretty violently like right here in
Boston for example when some people here
who must remember that in October 1965
after three years of the word Vietnam
couple hundred thousand American troops
that South Vietnam record destroyed we
tried to have her first anti-war
demonstration publicly on the bus and
common which is the sort of main place
for public demonstrations so it was a
small march from orbitz where he wasn't
common hundred maybe 4,000 people who
wasn't common and supposed to be talk
such as Westie wanted speakers it was
broken out by students violently broken
out by students in the other word the
only reason people were slaughtered was
like a longer state for leasing them now
to the next day the Boston Globe liberal
newspaper probably pick it up on the
Internet parade applause for the
counter-demonstrators big picture who
want to work with our
page denunciation of these hideous
counter damage to demonstrators who were
asking for things so mild it was
embarrassing we couldn't talk about cuts
topic awards after if not it's a talking
about stop the bombing of the north or
something like that out of a sideshow
well that was not been 65 you know if
the iraq were never got to that stage
left but being effects of the anti-war
movement in the 60s and it's expand the
expansion of the same popular movements
later in many ways led to a situation
where the public simply would not
tolerate the measures that were
undertaken in South Vietnam so if
Kennedy and Johnson had no problem
authorizing davon b-52 saturation
bombing driving mins of people at the
concentration camps of whatever they
went to chemical warfare no protest they
could do that correct I've never got
near if you can tell by the casualty
figures that the u.s. casual deceivers
interactor around 4000
like 60,000 troop levels are the same
sit could getting or near it and their
hampers by resistance at home and a
combination of resistance at home and
primarily massive resistance in Iraq led
to an American defeat okay so back to
the question where does it go from here
depends how these factors project into
the future but we can do something about
the ones here ones there of their
problem but it's something to be easy
certainly when Iraq was practically
destroyed it was nothing like Vietnam
which was totally wiped down but here
accented a very serious blow in every
respect but it's left with one effect of
the invasion was to elicit to sectarian
conflicts which had really not existed
in the best as late as about 2005 the
records were saying that they won't ever
be sectarian conflicts world
intermarried this together and so on and
so forth we want to find it blew up
fairy outfits these things do it's now a
risk right through the middle east the
US war has created a major sectarian
conflict through sunni-shia sectarian
conflict through the middle east which
is threatening to tear the region for
those are all big effects their problem
so serious that they just keep being put
off with loading dream about a result
like to the state of Kirkuk which is
clinging both by Kurds and Arabs
to pick up plenty of problems inside but
maybe they can deal with them sometime
and we can do what we can to prevent the
colonial administration from being
established to force the US government
to live up to what its form they rated
did the status of forces agreement easy
Obama's it certainly isn't planning to
do it if you notice that nobody's
talking about what's happening to the
military bases it's pretty hard to find
out that accused military bases over the
country I know that the they're being
taken care of by contractors us is sort
of farmed out most of the longer its
military work the private mercenary
corporations and the contractor the dirt
I just spoke to adjourn from journalist
friend of mine who knows the head of the
big contracting agency and he says
they're continuing to build a military
base what's the plan have to go to the
genomic cabinet to find out and they're
not telling you but we do know that
Obama is expanding the city and Baghdad
that's called amanda's in Century City
the huge construction small city inside
Baghdad size of the Vatican
which was running about a billion and a
half dollars a year Obama's increase the
1.8 billion for this year will probably
go beyond that which of course that's
not the embassy in the world except for
the months that Obama's building in
Islamabad and a couple which tells you
about the intentions are but that
maintains the intention is to try to
somehow reverse the defeat particular
easily but how this will pan out depends
in large measure our minds do we want to
spend billions of dollars a year to
build cities and react for Pakistan and
Afghanistan to ensure that we can throw
a region but with military bases and
torture chambers and so on that's our
choice that's another something else
that has to do with this first question
but deficit so we do have some questions
from our from the groups about anti-war
resistance and the difference between
Iraq then Iraq Iraq Vietnam in the 60s
Angela resistance then and resistance to
the occupation of Iraq today and
especially under Obama so we'll go have
lunch we'll ask these questions when we
get back and pick up right back up where
we left off
Chris could we had like could we have
volume on his side up the little bit of
a trumpsta yes is that ok so it's a
little bit low it was fine minutes
system I'm ripping the video from a
floor and a lot bloated yeah by asking
the year and guys now I asked them
respecting election
because we started late we've consulted
for those of us doing classes at the 330
spot I'm one of them and we then if you
don't mind we will extend this session
till four and then those sessions will
have you started that excuse me don't
interrupt our so that those sessions
with me hour and a half starting at four
they'll go into the social hour and you
can choose to go this classes or but if
you're going to do something else
besides those classes don't gather at
the Z how specific interfere with those
classes together the dying opens at
five-thirty etc we're extending this
diffuser the other would start before
right why did you want to say something
my street I stop making that good idea
alright so we are with mirrors it's okay
with you because we can always cut it
all short you know the social hour it's
oh you're we've arranged meetings you
not they're not it's not in the science
project of town
which doesn't mean you won't check the
schedule and see where the classes are
packed house at that time and maybe
there's a room that you can use
otherwise meander over to the to this
dis whoa is it open to 530 you can meet
those tables forever we're looking at
dinner not this rock star coming man
still lunch was very good but there were
about 20 men at the table with no rule
of dinner is any women who work to sit
at the table any seats left that I can
sit there
it's not like it's not about you but
you're in it
yes I give me a thumbs up when you're
ready okay so here we are with round two
everybody had a good lunch good and
there was an announcement earlier about
that I was like time schedule change if
you didn't hear because you're outside
ask somebody else at some point after
the session and you'll get the update
then so picking back up where we left
off with the occupation of Iraq you
often cite the mass protests before the
invasion of Iraq is evidence of
increasing political consciousness since
the 1960s but while popular resistance
increased during the escalation of the
Vietnam War it has declined since march
two thousand three how do you account
this well first of all take a look at
the history of popular resistance during
the Vietnam War which some of you are
old enough to remember the Vietnam War
began actually began in nineteen fifty
but it really took off in 1962 it was in
1962 the Kennedy initiated bombing of
south vietnam by the US air force they
used south vietnamese markings but
nobody was the planes did with nobody
was school initiated ease of napalm
initiated chemical warfare to destroy
crops and ground cover started some
operations against north vietnam there
were no North Vietnamese anywhere near
South Vietnam the uninitiated programs
which
of driving the population into good
amount of the concentration camps they
were called strategic Hamlet's driving
the population into concentration areas
where they were surrounded by barbed
wire to separate them from the
guerrillas who the US government knew
that they were supporting very similar
to what's happening in Afghanistan now
but that was nineteen sixty-two you
could learn about it I mean I learned
about it by just happening too for
example if you read the New York Times
if you got the page you know 27 or
something you could find a small item
that reported some of these things
casually because it was of no
significance I did continue the war
continued till by 1965 there was one the
leading specialist that most highly
respected by the US government civilian
specialist was Bernard fall is a millet
French military historian Vietnam
specialist so for example in Robert
McNamara's memoirs he's the only non
government person mentioned he was so
highly respected it was very good very
hawkish but he cared about the
Vietnamese which sort of made him look
as if he was on the left and by 1965 he
and he described exact words but he said
that you know South Vietnam is just
simply being devastated but by this
enormous us assault and that's when
troops started pouring in 1965 is also
when the u.s. expanded the word to the
north the goal was to try to pressure
the North Vietnamese to call off the
South Vietnamese resistance there was no
big secret about we now know a lot
because a ton of materials come out
pentagon papers and be classified
materials and it more or less adds a lot
of depth and complexity to it all of us
could surmise at the time even from the
leaks that were coming along the great
surprises but it turns out that the u.s.
understood very well that they were
fighting the population that the client
government they introduced had
essentially no support and that they
just had to fight a military war because
thats Sarah compared advantage there was
no breakfast I mean virtually none I
couldn't remember and like I think the
latest 1964 when I was trying to give
talks on the Vietnam War if we were
doing it at a college say at MIT where I
was we'd have to put together about six
topics you know then as a whale over
there was a guerrilla war going on the
Middle East five other topics and put
Vietnam in there somewhere and that
maybe he could get 10 people to come out
give a talk in a church with four people
you know the minister the organizer a
drunk who walked in off the streets it
was some guy who won the kid so I
mentioned the first public demonstration
October 1965 that was at a time when
Vietnam it was really hanging in the
balance South Vietnam could it survived
nope virtually no protest by then there
were a couple of teachings and there
were some small demonstrations SDS at a
demonstration but very little by 1967
protest was really taking off by that
time Bernhard fall again he was killed
in combat in South Vietnam
but his last book les reflections on a
war came out in 67 and in it he says
that he thinks it's doubtful that
Vietnam will survive as a cultural and
historical entity after the massive
attack of the most extraordinary
military machine that has ever been
unleashed against the territory this
size as it got much worse later against
Klaus and rural Cambodia but that was 67
speaking about Vietnam look at that
point he began to get protests by then
there were over half a million American
troops in South Vietnam theosis
extensively bombing the North that had
expanded the word board allows beginning
to Cambodia and an Falls account of
South Vietnam is quite accurate so yeah
he is starting to get bird tests and
among elites there was never any protest
literal I'm in so for example I just a
couple days ago happened to read there's
a journal called diplomatic history
which is one of the main scholarly
journals and among the scholarly
journals it's it's by far the most
serious but also the most open it's the
one where you can actually get some
critical commentary it's not just
regurgitating state propaganda and subs
you're really serious people they're
good serious scholars so they haven't
have an issue devoted to Vietnam and
it's pretty interesting to read it cause
he a lot about the intellectual culture
the kind of dovish intellectual culture
almost all the people that recall of
those opponents of the war but the only
positions that are represented are the
standard position which is the US lost
the war which i think is false because
and it was a mistake and then the what's
called the revisionist position which is
us could have won the war if they fought
harder that's the revisionist position
kind of interesting because in sixties
revisionism n mild criticism of us cold
war propaganda maybe both sides were
involved but the attitudes are shifted
so far to the right that revisionism
mountains the ultra hawkish position and
the Orthodox position as well it was a
mistake you know shouldn't have done
kind of like what you could read in
Pravda in 1985 about the invasion of
Afghanistan or which could have heard
from the German General Staff after
Stalingrad mistake you know tactical
errors and so on that's the liberal
dovish critical position among the
general population however things were
changing and there were there was there
were big auntie were demonstrations and
there was activism in it was significant
by the in 1960 on you airy 1968 the Tet
Offensive took place that event has been
grossly distorted in history was an
amazing event and if you're really
interested in popular movements you
should really have a close look at it
South Vietnam was completely saturated
with over half a million American troops
probably a hundred thousand or so
mercenaries South Korea and Taiwan
eighties Philippines on a huge client
army I think it was maybe seven hundred
thousand or so every village was
penetrated with intelligence government
officials and so on nobody knew that the
Tet Offensive was coming it was a
simultaneous uprising all over South
Vietnam took everybody by surprise what
that meant is that in every South
Vietnamese village people were already
organized to rise up a particular moment
against the occupation and it was Kim's
complete surprise to the occupiers that
means nobody talked about it earth
somebody did talk about it the eyes
didn't see it in the years
here I don't think there's an event like
that in history a little spontaneous
mass popular uprising well the US did
succeed in putting it down by massive
violence extremely destructive and now
it's treated for example in this issue
of diplomatic history that i mentioned
as a defeat defeat for North Vietnam as
North Vietnam went in there now there
were North Vietnamese troops about
50,000 of them a fraction of ten percent
of US troops but they were on the
borders they weren't in South Vietnam
the fact that were on the borders
basically trying to draw American troops
away from the country so that the
uprising could take place but this is
called the defeat for the North
Vietnamese because ultimately with
massive firepower and the US was able to
put down the uprising so that that's the
way it enters history defeat for the
North Vietnamese but what actually
happened is quite astonishing and power
centers in the United States understood
intellectuals still not understand it
but the business community understood
and basically the business community at
that point it was a very interesting
power play there was a group called the
wise men you know big Wall Street
hotshots and so on who went to
Washington and read the president of
riot act they told him what you gonna
withdraw he gonna have to stop
escalating the war it's costing us too
much it's whoring the economy
populations and upward so you gotta stop
the bombing North Vietnam announced that
you're not going to run to the president
the election was coming up start
negotiation and initiated withdrawal
plans and the president obediently did
everything he was ordered to do
instantaneously is he good insight into
how politics works in the intellectual
community something extremely
interesting habit
it all of a sudden turned out that
everybody had been a longtime opponent
of the war so the Kennedy memoirists
there are a lot of memoirs about Camelot
how wonderful it was the Kennedy
memoirists is shredding her sorensen the
rest of them immediately rewrote all
their histories literal completely
rewrote it inventing the story the fairy
tale which is very common on the left
note that Kennedy was trying to get out
of the war total fairy tale not a
particle of evidence for it he was a
complete clock and if you look at their
earlier memoirs at the time I barely
even mentioned Vietnam is that for
granted of course everyone's tour the
country who cares people like Arthur
Schlesinger Robert Kennedy they shift
all of that past without notice you
can't find a word about it in the
history of the Peter the current history
of the period okay so we were lying like
like troopers but we changed now we
created a false history for ourselves
and that's fine if you look at the
Pentagon Papers it ends the Pentagon
Papers ends around mid 68 couple of
months months after the Tet Offensive
and the left of the section on the last
few months is extremely interesting so
interesting that it's never discussed I
don't think you can find a reference to
it accepted what I wrote what Howard
Zinn or a couple other people but it's
quite interesting what it was a real
shock in Washington up until that point
they thought they're going to win the
war and all of a sudden it turned out is
this mass popular movement which that
carried out this credible event it's
going to go on for a long time it and it
Johnson the president they wanted to
send a couple hundred thousand more
troops to Vietnam after the data
the military didn't want want to join
teaser opposed for an interesting reason
they said we send more troops we're
going to a civil war in the United
States we're going to need those troops
for civil disorder control because
there'll be an uprising by young people
by women by minorities and so on oh
we're going to need the army to put it
down so we don't want to send any more
troops Johnson send any more troops
partly that partly the business world
telling them it's over well no those are
old in fact why the defense world thinks
it was an economic crisis that's
interesting too but one of the real
achievements of the anti-war movement
which you never find in the histories
and there are lots of scholarly books
now about the Attic world but they never
mentioned it's major achievement because
it's kind of ideologically impossible to
incorporate into your version of the
world what the anti-war movement did was
create enough disorder in opposition so
that the government could never declare
a national mobilization now if you
declare a national mobilization first of
all it's extremely efficient for the
economy like during the Second World War
when there was a national mobilization
the u.s. itis fastest growth and
economic history on industrial
production what purple people were
dedicated to the war effort Rosie the
Riveter and all that kind of business
which was real people really dedicated
to the war effort and it was for the
economy fantastic and pulled the country
out of depressions at the basis for a
post-work growth and of course it one of
the work huge work but Johnson couldn't
do it there was too much discontent they
could never called for a national
mobilization they had to fight what's
called the guns and butter war see a
pour money into the military but you've
got to keep the population satisfied so
that's the butter side and that is
inefficient economically inefficient
arms economy it led to stagflation
combination of stagnation of growth and
inflation which was harming the economy
and that's what the business community
understood would get much worse if they
tried to escalate the war even the
continued it so that's a major effect of
the addy war movement but which only
took off around 67 shortly before that's
literally months before the Tet
Offensive well then it goes on I won't
go through the rest of the history but
it's pretty much the same so those
worthy and then it left a lasting impact
on the country so Eddie war the feelings
just developed and grew along with a lot
of other changes the major effect of the
sixties wasn't really felt in so that
the major popular movements like say the
feminist movement which had a huge
impact on the country probably wouldnt
anything else but that's really from the
70s I mean it was started in the 60s you
know if it's and pieces of it kind of
really took off in the 70s there was no
environmental barely any environmental
movement in the 60s started around
nineteen seventy Earth Day and so on and
the same is true of anti-nuclear
movement 80s so on it all comes later
solidarity movements of the 1980s but it
had its roots in the activism the 60s
and it kept expanding under a lot of
oppression there were major efforts to
try to beat it back all kind of ways
under the war on drugs and go into this
if you like but a large part of it was a
very explicit effort not concealed to
try to put down to to impose was called
law in order to keep to get the society
to be passive and obedient again and
also to reverse the concern that by
nineteen seventy the population boat
not the elites we're actually beginning
to seriously question the righteousness
and justice of American policy and
that's dangerous bye it was very well
understood by 1970 that whole culture is
shifting in a dangerous direction we
don't just reflexively assume that
whatever the US government does is right
and just but may be mistaken which is a
virtually uniform in the intellectual
world under those of you who are and
studied these things in college it's
just like it's like an axiom can't even
question if you question that you're
considered a madman but among the
population that was being very seriously
questioned if I polls were showing that
about seventy percent of the population
described the war is not a mistake but
fundamentally wrong a tomorrow that's
pretty scary kind of like sit-down
strikes in the 30s it's really scary so
you had to do something so that we held
the moral high ground that we're the
victims of the Vietnamese sounds like a
hard thing to carry off but it was done
brilliantly and the war on drugs was a
major part of it in part it had other
you know other purposes luck in prison
the black population that's another
story but part of it was trying to gain
the moral high ground in the war in
Vietnam quite tricky when you've just
destroyed four countries killed a couple
million people in a war of aggression
that has like no credible pretext but it
was done and the drug war was a central
party around nineteen eighty seventy or
so a lot of propaganda started about an
addicted army to myth it was no effect
as a very good book style of the book on
it
mrs. the addicted army by jerry koosman
goes into a lot of the details but the
basic story is that the army that
soldiers were using drugs but at about
the same level of civilians at home as
he saved a young people so it's kind of
like the youth culture and they were
using drugs about the level of the youth
culture had no effect on combat that
anybody could ever detect there was
actual addiction in the army but it was
alcohol and tobacco both of which are
much more serious than called drugs and
that was that was serious but that's not
called addiction that's what rich people
do but but a myth was created about an
addicted army and that was contrived
reconstructed as an effort by the evil
communists to attack us they were
addicting our army to try to turn our
army into a collection of junkies could
come home and you know riots in the
streets and destroy the country and so
on and that was extremely effective I'm
you had people like Walter Cronkite you
made a remember or no was the great
liberal hero on television with Walter
Cronkite giving the lecturing and honest
television programs about how are our
boys in Vietnam and not only have to
face the guns of these evil communists
who are daring to defend their own
villages but also to face the drugs that
they're trying to dicked our soldiers
with so they're facing two kinds of
enemies so we're really the victims of
the Vietnamese were attacking us with
nominee the guns with even their their
drugs sorry the idea that the Vietnamese
are attacking us with their guns was
deeply rooted he go back to the Camelot
days Kennedy it's exactly what they said
so Adlai Stevenson who was the liberal
hero
an ambassador he was giving talks of the
UN about how in South Vietnam were
fighting a new kind of war a war of what
he called in internal aggression was
that that means the South Vietnamese are
carrying out aggression against us in
South Vietnam President Kennedy spoke
about what he called the assault from
within they're attacking us wounded in
Vietnam by now that's like second nature
so Iraq and Afghanistan are described
exactly the same way from that good if
you like it's an assault from within
aggression against us in their country
but Israel does the same thing they talk
about irani and aggression against
Israel in south Lebanon where the
Israeli army was occupying it and there
was guerrilla resistance so that's
Iranian aggression against Israel and
South living the desert you know in
imperial history it's there's a lot of
horrible stuff but it's pretty hard to
find anything that's this grotesque but
by now it's just like second nature in
the US intellectual culture so Kennedy
and Stevenson nobody objected when they
talked to those terms and by nineteen
seventy or so you get the liberal icons
like Walter Cronkite saying well they're
attacking us on any with guns but even
with drugs so we're the victims of the
Vietnamese a very successful propaganda
campaign has carried forward by 1977
time to get to Carter Carter was
president he was actually asked in a
press conference do we owe some debt to
the Vietnamese after all killed maybe
four million people to destroy the
country and so on he said we owe them no
debt because the destruction was mutual
so yeah we did some
to them move look at what they did to us
so it's mutual so it's finished I said
the French say exactly the same thing
today about what they did the haiti and
they just wiped out hate it's a long
story have a a lot of Francis wealth
comes from but they say well you know we
don't know I'm anything because look
what they did does I mean they stole our
property namely the slave plantations
they didn't pay an indemnity for like it
did they indemnity and look at look at
how many white people that killed when
they liberated themselves so it's all
even know goes on all the time but it's
particularly egregious here so by 1977
we owe them note that caused the
destruction was mutual that's Jimmy
Carter liberal by the time you get to
George Bush number one that's like 1990
it's gone even further Bush was giving
orations about how there were
discussions then about with whether to
lift the sanctions on Vietnam the word
didn't come to an end when we stopped
bombing them first heavy sanctions
