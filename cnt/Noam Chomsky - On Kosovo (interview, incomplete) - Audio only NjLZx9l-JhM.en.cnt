Chomsky welcome in in the read in your
writings on the subject it's clear that
you see mr. Milosevic and the Serbians
as the bad guys in the Balkans lately
our first question is where would you
have intervened to frustrate him or
would you and when and how well we have
to pick the time and place in up until
1995 there was a quite impressive and
successful nonviolent movement in among
the customer Albanians the Ibrahim
Rugova was the president they had set up
a parallel government they were
essentially running and their own
internal autonomy under conditions of
civil disobedience they were completely
sold out by the West the United States
wouldn't give him the time of day at the
Dayton Agreement that the Dayton
meetings they weren't even allowed to
take part the result was that within
among Kosovar Albanians they there was a
recognition of something which
unfortunately is true and we ought to be
concerned about the fact that it's true
and that is that the United States
government understands nothing but force
they came to recognize that the KLA
which was up till then a kind of a
ragbag rag the ragtag group of gorillas
became began to begin again popular
support it started to carry out attacks
against the police stations against
civilians from foreign bases with
foreign support the Serbs were
surprisingly slow to respond but by last
summer they did begin to respond and
they responded pretty brutally against
with retaliation against civilians by
the end of cording to NATO by February
there were about 2,000 people had been
killed and a few hundred thousand
refugees which is an atrocity but
unfortunately an all-too-familiar one so
for example the State Department reports
on Columbia just came out with almost
the same numbers for last year just to
make one
many examples at that point there were
all all through this time there were
options the options continued up until I
want to focus specifically on the
Balkans not necessary unco scible we've
been we've been reading and seeing
evidence of atrocities in the Balkans
for throughout the 90s at what point did
the Liz does the human predicament
warrant in the Balkans specifically
warrant some intervention by the United
States what should we have been doing
there and at what point if any would you
have used military force well I think I
think it is a serious mistake to ask
that question about the Balkans
specifically we asked that question
because that's what the government tells
us to do and I don't think that's the
way to look at issues so in all such
cases and there are many many much worse
than this going on right now we have
basically three choices just by logic we
can act we can do nothing that's one
choice we can act in such a way as to
make the situation worse to escalate the
atrocities or we can act in such a way
as to try to mitigate them those are the
three possibilities now in some cases is
quite obvious how to do this so in the
case of say turkey right next door where
the atrocities are far worse and the
rather rather similar in character but
much worse clinton intervened to
escalate so he escalated the expanded
the huge flow of arms to the turkey so
that they could carry out slaughters
ethnic cleansing driving out millions of
refugees on a scale much worse than
kosovo last year much worse in colombia
the same story send arms to the military
which are used to maintain them
atrocities in other places we do nothing
so for example in africa where there
were possibilities of with the british
and the united nations were trying to
introduce peacekeeping forces to prevent
what looked what could
and in fact did blow up to be major Wars
the Clinton administration refused to
provide trivial sums therefore torpedo
in the agreement so we decided to
nothing in the case of so we're
discussing both fit into this well in
the case of Kosovo the United States
acted about the way it did in Turkey
though three different modalities namely
it acted to escalate the atrocities so
it was it was clear you know I can't say
it was totally predictable but it was
certainly very likely there's a monster
leap there in in Turkey the bad guys
happen to be our ally and us remember
not just our ally there 80 percent us
arms which were being sent to which were
increasing you know as the atrocities
increased the arms will increased but
we're talking about the the the courage
the the Kurdish Turks or the Kurds
under under the boot of our allied
government the Turks but it's it's a I
think we're on the other side we may
have been party to we have may have
triggered an escalation by Milosevic but
it's exactly a reverse yes and I don't
want to first of all we the whole matter
of consistency of United States or a
foreign policy around the world is a
kind of a different issue I just I do
want to keep the focus on Kosovo because
if only because for whatever reason it
is the human crisis on the crisis on
page one yes and it's one that you
acknowledge it's not as I do it's on
page one and it ought to be on page six
if we were honest we would say yeah
here's a range of atrocities we ought to
be concerned with all of them not just
follow the government marching orders
that were given from Washington but okay
let's follow those marching orders and
look just at Kosovo now what should we
have done well on March 20 F to ask when
say March 23rd okay the day before the
bombing let's pick that day on March
23rd the US had
pushed through NATO an agreement the
rumbly a agreement which it had
essentially compelled the KLA to sign
and the Serbian Parliament rejected now
how did the Serbian Parliament reject it
well what they said is we won't we we
will grant autonomy to Kosovo but we
will not accept the military forces of a
foreign military alliance on our
territory namely a NATO alliance they
did go on to pass a resolution on March
23rd which said that after the autonomy
agreement is arranged by among the
ethnic groups in Kosovo we can move on
to international peacekeeping forces
though not advice they meant not native
didn't say but they meant not NATO
forces but international peace again all
these are these a lot of the more words
I don't think you'd you wouldn't want
Milosevic and Serbs in these
circumstances guaranteeing your autonomy
and you wouldn't have taken their
promise of autonomy absolutely okay but
I wasn't I also when this is a one we
were asking what the options were one
option was to pursue the diplomatic path
and to see whether this modality of
bringing in international peacekeepers
could have worked another option was to
decide to escalate the atrocities namely
by carrying out a bombardment which
predictably led to an escalation of the
atrocities I mean let me just quote the
UN US commander General Clark two days
after the bombing he informed the New
York Times that it was in his words
entirely predictable that the atrocities
would sharply escalate as a result of
the bombing well you know entirely is a
little too strong but it was certainly
highly likely consequence it's the fact
that when you bomb people they start to
they react where they're strong not
where you're strong they have a strong
on the ground so it was a one
predictable consequence of the bombing
of the path we chose was to sharply
escalate the atrocities there were no
refugees registered by the
High Commission of refugees on March
24th there are now couple hundred
thousand it but that's only one effect
the other effect has been to devastate
maybe finally demolish the very
promising and courageous democratic
movement in Belgrade well when you start
well the son of middle meningeal us the
other day said we've been united from
the heavens not by God but by the bomb
city thought and only God could unite
the Serbs now but now the bombs have
well that's of course true you know you
start running people and you know
smashing up their bridges and filling up
their hospitals they become they resist
they join now in the last of it is more
has more support than ever did that was
also predictable we've probably wiped
out the democratic movement in
Montenegro there are no serious crises
in Macedonia I mean that's what happens
from blind mindless use of violence
which happens to be what the Clinton
administration and its predecessors have
moved towards automatically also
remember though that before that bombing
there were these Nike takeoff t-shirts
scene and among the Kosovars just do it
let's get it on Milosevic must be
confronted the Hitler memories always
come up with sort of a line has to be
drawn certain kinds of people are
insufferable sort of thing and even the
people who in a matter of days would be
refugees felt and I think some of them
still feel it had to be done maybe and
I'm sure if you meant to Colombia you
could if in Colombia last year there
were three hundred thousand refugees
generated according to the State
Department
mostly by the army and paramilitaries
they add to the over a million who are
already there that's the biggest refugee
crisis maybe in the world if you ask
those people have been viciously and
murderously driven out of their homes I
don't doubt that many of them would say
bomb Bogota should we do even knowing
that the even if they know that it'll
get worse yeah just the same situation I
don't think we should bomb Bogota nor
should we bomb Washington which is
providing its arms but I'm sure you can
find people would say that that's not
that doesn't that's not determinative of
policy you have to think if you want to
carry out a policy you have to think
about its consequences
okay well the consequences in this case
there were alternatives the alternative
was to explore the diplomatic options
which did exist in still exist another
alternative was to make the situation
far worse I didn't have all the negative
consequences there's one which curiously
doesn't seem to bother Americans very
much and that is that it is
I mean it's so blatantly illegal that
it's not even worth discussing but it's
a it's yet another blow to the rather
fragile system of international order
which at least provides some some
minimal protection to the weak doesn't
provide any protection to the strong
they do what they want but the
principles of world order which we were
which we initiated no we instituted them
they provide some measure of protection
for against predatory States no I don't
think there are inclined I think you can
think of cases where they shouldn't be
applied but there it's like a system of
law generally you never apply you never
expect it to be applied a hundred
percent so for example there's laws
against cannibalism but they're relaxed
for people caught on lifeboats you know
and that's the way the law works however
little it's worth having law and it's
worth having the International framework
of world order although the United
States has been dedicated to destroying
it for years and furthermore says so so
for example I mean people are struck
here by a kind of collision of the rule
against the bombing or invasion of
sovereign states without the UN sanction
here but there also that collides with a
clearly tremendous wholesale continuing
violation a predatory treatment of the
Kosovars by the Serbian government how
do you how do you cut through
the russian-chinese veto at the UN to
say people who who as we said they want
to bring the world down to relieve their
own agony well first of all let's be
clear it's that the United Nations the
primary primary barrier to the to
stopping aggression has been the u.s.
veto the u.s. is far in the lead in
vetoes and the United Nations since the
1960's Britain is second France as a
descriptor again that's so let's if we
want look I mean we have to be realistic
it's the United States that bars UN
Security Council resolutions calling on
States to terminate their aggression and
atrocities overwhelmingly in this
particular case you're right it would
have been the Russian and Chinese veto
and you're also right that the I think
we can point there has been long noted
since the 5th 40s a kind of a tension
between two fundamental principles of
international law the UN Charter bars
aggression the use of force threat or
use of force without Security Council
authorization on the other hand the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
provides for rights of people against
their own state okay now there's a
tension between those two and it's in
that tension that the issue of so-called
humanitarian intervention arises and it
should be faced seriously it's not a
trivial case look at it in every case so
there are cases that really do quote
this is not a case that qualifies this
is a case in which this is not qualify
for international relief what sort of
data right to the rescue on the house on
fire no quite the opposite as we can see
from the consequences and it was
predictable and Vance what happened was
that NATO set the fire I mean it's as if
let me make a mundane analogy suppose
when I leave here we I see a crime in
the streets so I see someone robbing
someone else and I say well I can't just
stand here and let this go on so I pick
up an assault rifle and kill them both
and kill a couple of I standards on the
side and that when I'm asked well why'd
you do that I say well look at
I couldn't just stand there and let it
happen now that's not a humanitarian act
and in fact that's pretty much what
happened there were options of of moving
of pursuing the peaceful means that are
required by international law there was
the option of doing nothing as we do in
much worse cases let's say in Africa or
there was the option of making the fire
much worse which is what we did so
that's not a humanitarian intervention
there are real cases and if we want to
understand US policy after all we
shouldn't want to understand it we
should look at the real cases so the
most dramatic case in recent years is
the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia I
mean that terminated all awesome
atrocities in December how did the u.s.
react well by can by bitterly condemning
and punishing Vietnam for having had the
audacity to terminate Pol Pot's
atrocities we supported a Chinese
invasion we imposed harsh sanctions the
the New York Times denounced them as the
oppressions of Asia yeah that was a that
was a plausible humanitarian
intervention and and it tells us what US
policy is towards humanitarian
intervention just as Clinton's dedicated
the escalation of atrocities in Turkey
pretty much at the same time that this
is all going on and at a much worse
level tells us something about the
humanitarian motives I mean I think it's
a serious error to just focus on what
the government orders us to look at
Kosovo we have to look at it in a
broader context to understand Kosovo
we'll do it we'll do it with the help of
callers to the phone's 1-800 for two
three eight to five five
we're trying to think of Kosovo in the
big picture including Vietnam but also
to try not to be hooked on the get down
history necessarily and to see it fresh
1-800 four two three eight two five five
with professor Noam Chomsky of MIT 1-800
four to three
talk is the connection born ken is on
the line thanks Chris I was interested
by mr. Chomsky scenario of
killing the aggressor and killing the
victim as being an absurd one and I do
agree although I think it was done with
the intention of killing the aggressor
killing the victim with the hope that a
hundred thousand other victims wouldn't
be killed by the man with the gun so I
guess my question is in in light of the
fact that the were massacres that
occurred in wrought check and that they
are pretty much accepted as being crimes
against humanity what what would mr.
Chomsky say would have been the route
the US could have taken diplomatically
knowing the history of the Serbs in in
Bosnia and knowing that eventually the
question not only of sovereignty in
human international law would be
questioned but also the question of
whether mr. Barasa fetch would be a war
criminal whether you could actually
negotiate with him well the United
States chose to negotiate with him and
to sell out the kosovo albanians
nonviolent movement really would you
said that that was the US I would have
said not to sell out the Kosovars that
was not something that was tabled but it
was not tabled but you know there were
so many other things that basically that
was not tabled by US decision it was a
decision to exclude the cus of our
Albanians because it was only a
non-violent movement successful
nonviolent movement which the US had no
interest in and that is in fact what
destroyed it so I think that was a bad
mistake in in the case of coming up to
say March 1999 yes there had been
atrocities in Kosovo according to NATO
2,000 people had been killed in the
previous year as the Serbs responded to
KLA attacks on police stations and
civilians from foreign bases we might
ask incidentally how the United States
would respond if let's say Libyan based
terrorists were attacking police
stations and civilians in Boston but
let's put that to the side
the so then how should we have responded
to to the killing of 2000 people in a
year well that's a situation that arises
all
the world for example it arises in
Colombia right now there Rises in Laos
right now a much worse situation arises
in Turkey right now it's tens of
thousands how do you react well in in
these cases you have to think through
the consequences in this particular case
which is the only one we're told to look
at the concept of the options were
pretty clear on March 23rd there was a
disagreement between the United States
and the Serbian Parliament here we
prefers a Milosevic but there was a
disagreement between the United States
and the Yugoslavia on the terms of a
diplomatic settlement I don't think that
that that was a final decision you know
I think there was room for negotiation
there we chose instead to carry out the
bombing campaign which were which had
the effect as predicted of radically
escalating the atrocities now
you say and you could be right that
there might have been atrocities anyway
but you don't carry out murder because
maybe the person you're killing might
have killed somebody well I think my
question it was is it is it is it a case
of post rat check us feeling that they
were unable to negotiate with hostage no
it was a decision by the United States
yet they decided that they're going to
give him an ultimatum namely rumbly a
that was negotiation was after rachac
and it was a negotiation in which the US
had a position namely the one they
forged a trombley a their interlocutor
with whom they were negotiating Milazzo
which had a different position and
remember it's not we like to demonize
the individual but this is a country and
they're supporting and they have a
parliament they proposed an alternative
the u.s. simply flatly refused the
alternative is not unreasonable
in fact if what was the alternative that
we rejected the alternative was a
resolution of the Serbian Parliament
March 23rd to reach an autonomy
agreement for Kosovo among the ethnic
groups there
then to open the question of
international of an international
observer force by which they probably
met at UN force actually the New York
Times has taken even a stronger view on
April 8th Steven Erlanger their belgrade
correspondent wrote I think he's
exaggerating but what he wrote is that
the Serbian Parliament had agreed to a
UN military force on March 23rd that's
we don't really know because it's barely
been covered here but I think he's
probably exaggerating but in any event
in that domain it was over this ground I
mean do you do you take the Serbian word
on that that they were interested in in
a viable kind of autonomy that that
Kosovo to live under no any more that I
take the u.s. word for it when they
signed the Paris agreements or when they
agreed to the sqls agreements in Central
America first I take their word for it
because they didn't mean it you know if
you don't take the word for the fact
that they're going to do that and seeing
that they might have allowed an impotent
force to come in to Kosovo and the fact
that the OSCE was on the ground and
physically near rapchak at the time of
the maskers what what is our next what
is our next step our next step is
diplomacy remember that those massacres
that you're talking about are going on
every day just a couple of days ago one
took place in Colombia got about three
lines do we therefore bomb Bogota know
what we do is what we ought to do is to
stop providing arms to the people
carrying out the massacres and then move
and diplomatic directions knowing
perfectly well that you cannot trust
either them or us because we don't keep
our agreements either
that's what diplomacy is like you're
dealing with states that do not act in
good faith that have their own interests
and you try to find peaceful means
between them you keep mentioning rechak
and remembered the nato figures 2,000
people killed in a year that's
unfortunately not enormous by
international standards comment on
international standards the answer it's
enough to terrorize the population and
consolidate serbian control our
profession that you can't
let them talk to you about promises of
autonomy it seems to me if we believe
that and we should simply remove
ourselves from the scene if the only
thing we can think of doing is to make
the situation far worse
well that's then we therefore disqualify
a cab rake with noam chomsky this is the
connection from WBUR Boston I'm
Christopher Lydon this is the connection
our guest is Noam Chomsky the linguist
who became the preeminent Dubbs dove and
the kind of foreign policy critics
critic in the Vietnam period and has
been more and more involved in thinking
about the law the morality and the
effect of American policy in the world
we're talking this hour of course about
Kosovo professor Chomsky you referred
earlier to the Clinton administration's
kind of blind attachment to force in
this case the striking thing also here
though is that for many years the
ministration didn't know what to do
about the Balkans especially after
General Colin Powell had said we do
deserts we don't do mountains the Bush
administration didn't want a fuss for
the Balkans even after the success of
the first Gulf War don't you see I mean
it is radically different from Vietnam
in the Kennedy Johnson Nixon era in that
truly the impression has been that we
didn't want to use force we didn't want
to get into that rock pile in fact it is
quite different from the kennedy johnson
era in the at that the country was just
a different country so when john f
kennedy sent the US Air Force to bomb
South Vietnam to drive people 100 you
know actually millions of people it
turned out into concentration camps to
use napalm to carry out crop destruction
there was no protest took years before
protests developed the Bush
administration understood that it was
quite different and in fact there is a
bush administration a policy statement
which was leaked presumably by the
Pentagon and pieces of it were published
in the press New York Times which as
they came in saying that well quoted it
said that in the case of a confrontation
with much weaker enemies which are the
only kind we think of confronting
in the case of a confrontation with much
weaker enemies we must defeat them
rapidly and decisively or else we will
lose political support that's a change
that was not true in the Johnson and
Kennedy period so that's yes that's true
the population won't accept aggression
on the scale of Vietnam now what about
the Balkans I don't think the way you
described is exactly accurate the Bush
administration and the Clinton
administration stood by in the Balkans
as long as it was an ugly brutal
business at that point they wanted the
Europeans to be there they wanted Europe
to be there while it was well you know
there was real fighting there wasn't any
way to resolve it and so on and so forth
what the u.s. did was stand on the
sidelines aren't armed the Croatian
military which is not different from the
Serbian military as they armed them
trained them changed the balance of
power so that the forces of violence
were roughly comparable in the two sides
a support of the Croatian army when it
went through Krajina driving out a
couple hundred thousand Serbs by the
time the two sides were equalized and
exhausted the u.s. moved in and imposed
in effect a partition of Bosnia so it
wasn't that they had no plan they had a
plan it was the effective partition of
Bosnia into greater Serbia and greater
Croatia and the u.s. waited until the
dirty work was done and when it was
possible to institute this planet moved
in it instituted if you think Europe is
happy about that you're wrong Europe
didn't like it at all they were given
the dirty work and then they were kicked
aside after the conditions were
established that allowed the u.s. to
take come and take over but that's the
reliance on the use of force is very
striking I mean perhaps the most
dramatic case right now is Iraq where
the u.s. is US and Britain which is a
kind of an attack dog are
internationally quite isolated they're
carrying out regularly both on the
sanctions and the bombing the the reason
that the u.s. does not go to the
Security Council to get authorization
for its
attacks is it when the snows not going
to get him and it's not just China it's
a girl from no one
the in fact Madeleine Albright stated it
very clearly at this as UN ambassador
when the US UN was refusing to go along
the whole of it you were to go along
with us violence she said we will act
multilaterally when we can and
unilaterally when we must for our
interest yeah we've heard that before
at the time of the December bombing in
Iraq the administration said we prefer
to act with our allies NATO but if not
we'll act alone notice we do not even
prefer to act with the United Nations
they're killing the sanctions alone are
killing 5,000 children a month that's I
want to come back to to the Balkans from
for most of us it takes headlines and
news and some people actually the
beginning of a war for us to take it
seriously or to start focusing the
question is on in this country and
people are sort of rechecking the pulse
of popular opinion every day as to
whether ground forces ought to be
committed in retaking Kosovo and whether
this is the beginning of an even larger
effort by the United States government
against Serbia for people who are waking
up to this thing what would you be
telling them about the road ahead both
the policy will all be done what might
be useful what they're going to be told
what they're gonna need in the way of a
kind of Hemingway crap detector what are
the stakes the first thing I would tell
them is not simply to follow the
marching order of course given from
Washington yeah so if you want to stop
atrocities in the world lots of ways to
do it we could defuse the bomb what's in
last I would save a couple thousand
people killed a year like Kosovo last
year we could stop arming Turkey to
crush its Kurds if you want a lot of
other cases let's look at Kosovo what
could we do
i ground troops would probably be the
worst possible thing and I don't think
the US would do it either because it
would mean a first
it's technically quite difficult and it
would probably mean fighting a major
guerilla war for years with unknown
consequences
my fear is frankly that what the US will
do is after having predictably
caused the atrocities to radically
escalate just as general Clarke said
what it may do is move on to a
Carthaginian solution and if you think
that that's how to character take a walk
below the 20th parallel and suddenly
didn't Vietnam it's not a caring just
salt the well you want to salt it but
you know essentially devastated which we
can do from a distance that's
unfortunately more likely in fact one of
the effects of bombing is it very much
an hour as the options so options that
were available on March 23rd no longer
are I don't you mentioned before the
French ambassador French had proposed
made a proposal which in fact is very
much like the Serbian proposal on March
23rd but that may not be open it may be
that the only that the least ugly of the
alternatives open is one that's been
discussed by Thomas Friedman the New
York Times and Michael mantel down in
the globe and others namely a kind of a
partition in which Serbia takes the
northern areas which happened to be the
ones that are richer in minerals and
have the historical monuments and this
office turned into some kind of a
protectorate where some Albanians will
live in misery
we may have restricted the option so
that that's about the least ugly one
left
