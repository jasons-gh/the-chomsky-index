this evening will be the 4th Raymond
Williams Memorial Lecture the trust
which is organized for of these memorial
lectures invites someone who they feel
is working in the spirit of Raymond
Williams or whose work he would have
wished to see encouraged and honored and
so far we've had four of the annual
lectures and also in the spirit of
Raymond Williams
we've organized some outside London they
in fact they've been three outside
London and four of the annual lectures
here in London itself previous give us
of the memorial lecture have been Edward
Sayid Gwyn Alf Williams Marina Warner
and outside London Umberto Eco Terry
Eagleton and Stuart Hall who've given
lectures in Glasgow kela and Cardiff
well this evening it's our very great
pleasure and honor to introduce Noam
Chomsky to give this forth memorial
lecture and I would just like to say a
little bit
not because Noam Chomsky needs any
introduction but because we do feel that
he is extraordinarily well placed to
give this memorial lecture and we do
feel that in inviting him to do so we
are encouraging precisely the type of
courageous public intervention of which
Raymond Williams so warmly approved and
which he himself all
so undertook I I think I should say to
begin with that we also perhaps felt
that there was even some affinity in the
work of Raymond Williams and Noam
Chomsky even though it it is in
different fields and I suppose it would
be this that in the work of both of
these great scholars one does see a
commitment to the extraordinary
potential that lies in ordinary people
and one can see that this can give rise
to great work of cultural criticism or
in the case of professor Chomsky to his
innovative a revolutionary work in the
field of linguistics but this commitment
to the potential of ordinary people is
something that also naturally grows over
into a critical vigilant stance against
the arrogance of power and against the
corruption of all the channels of
communication discussion and public
debate which is such a ominous feature
of public life not only in Britain but
also in the United States Raymond
Williams of course himself put forward
bold proposals for democratizing the
media not by enlarging a power of the
state but by empowering people from
below and by empowering communicators
and releasing them from the tutelage of
commercial interests and of the
interests of power holders I think
Raymond Williams saw this as a
particularly key area because he felt
that democracy itself democratic life
was in danger of atrophy in its formal
bodies in Parliament in Congress and
other such institutions and that's why
he put such great emphasis on the need
for a democratic revitalization of the
means of communication
and that's why he himself also
participated as a public intellectual a
responsible intellectual speaking out on
the great issues of the day well it need
hardly be said that Noam Chomsky has
been doing that and doing that for more
than three decades many of us remember
his tremendous essays at the time of the
Vietnam War and the huge role he played
in gradually awakening a critical spirit
even in the most unlikely places in the
United States in the late sixties the
middle and late sixties in subsequent
decades and including on occasions when
the going was even more difficult Noam
has been a vigilant eye and a strong
voice against oppression the injustice
above all the oppression and injustice
supported by his own government or the
government that is to save the United
States and by the West more generally in
Nicaragua and perhaps one should mention
most recently and memorably for all of
us the occasion two years ago when the
governments of the United States and
Britain unleashed the Gulf War now in
Britain as in the United States we're
just passing through a period where
through a chapter of accidents through
events entirely outside the control of
the government a court case has gone
wrong and apparently it's discovered to
great amazement that the British
government was covertly breaking its own
supposed in bargain on the dictator
Saddam Hussein against whom it launched
that ferocious attack and of course at
the time it was arming Saddam Hussein it
was perfectly well known that he'd been
gassing Kurds oppressing oppositionists
inside his own country I think many of
you may remember Noam Chomsky's splendid
essay that was printed in our in in The
Guardian in the run-up to the Gulf War
which exposed this and many other
hypotheses long before we've had the
confirmation which has so lately arrived
well I don't wish to say any more by way
of introduction I know that Noam Chomsky
is speaking tonight on the year 501 I
think this is a reference to there the
first year after the 500th centenary of
Christopher Columbus which has been
marked by many of us as an event which
shows the dark side of the spread of the
westerlies global power and influence
and which also requires of us a critical
spirit well I'm also pleased to say that
Noam Chomsky's book deterring democracy
is now available in paperback and I
think even some copies can be purchased
at the door I think that the title of
the lecture he has chosen this evening
is linked to the theme of his next book
so without further ado I would like to
introduce professor Noam Chomsky
actually I was going to talk about the
500 first year of modern philosophy but
I guess I better shift the the year 1992
poses a critical moral and cultural
challenge for the more privileged
sectors of the world dominant societies
as of course as Robin mentioned we enter
year 501 of the European conquest of the
world and how that challenge is
addressed I think it's likely to have
quite a faithful consequences in recent
years the subjugation of the South as
it's now euphemistically called the
subjugation of the south has intensified
the gap between the rich and the poor
has doubled since 1960 this is largely a
consequence of the neoliberal policies
that are imposed have been imposed on
the traditional colonies while 20 out of
24 industrial countries are more
protectionist today than they were a
decade ago the World Bank has recently
estimated that the protectionist
measures of the industrial countries
which are keeping pace with their
free-market bombast reduced the natural
the national income of the south by
twice the amount of official so-called
development assistance which is itself a
form of export promotion the South
Commission may call for a new world
order as they called it that will
respond quoting to the South's plea for
justice equity and democracy in the
global society but that plea is sure to
remain unanswered short of major changes
where powers where power lies what will
be heard and has been heard is the
vision of the New World Order of George
Bush who borrowed the same phrase a few
months later as part of the rhetorical
cover for the u.s. British war
Golf this is the new Imperial age as the
Financial Times recently called it with
a global system paraphrasing the
Financial Times a global system
orchestrated by the group of seven the
IMF the World Bank the GATT and their
corporate financial constituencies a
major feature of the era that we are now
entering now by the time Europe when I
speak of Europe's conquest of the world
I of course mean to include the English
settled colonies one of which now leads
the crusade and also the Japanese I
borrow here South African usage and
describe the Japanese is honorary white
rich enough to almost qualify at least
Japan was one of the few parts of the
South that joined the Corps with core
industrial societies with some of its
former colonies in its wake having been
able to avoid the doctrines that are
applied to ensure the subordination of
the traditional colonies which are
sometimes called free trade or
structural adjustment or our noble
ideals from which we of course are
exempt and always have been Adam Smith
took the discovery of America and that
of a passage to the East Indies
according to me the two greatest and
most important events recorded in the
history of mankind which certainly made
a most essential contribution to the
state of Europe opening up a new and
inexhaustible market that led to vast
expansion of productive powers and real
revenue and wealth oil quoting in theory
he said the new set of exchanges should
naturally have proved as advantageous to
the new as it certainly did to the old
continent but that was not to be the
savage injustice of the Europeans
rendered an event which ought to have
been beneficial to all ruinous and
destructive to the conquered people who
suffered dreadful misfortunes
Smith roti revealing himself to be an
early practitioner of the crime of
political correctness to borrow some of
the terminology of contemporary cultural
management he went on to point out that
their superiority of force enabled the
Europeans to commit with impunity every
sort of injustice one case that he found
particularly appalling was Bengal a rich
and fertile country with advanced
manufacturing when the British arrived
already devastated by Smith's day in
1776 hundreds of thousands died of
famine in a single year he wrote because
of the conditions imposed by the
conquerors which turned earth into a
famine while officials of the Honourable
company plow up a rich field of rice or
of the grain in order to make room for a
plantation of poppies for the opium
trade which was one prime source of the
huge profits that stimulated the first
Industrial Revolution along with the
lucrative slave trade and robbery of the
colonies generally these Smith's
conclusions that 100 years ago are quite
well supported by contemporary
scholarship Europeans fought to kill and
they had they had the means to satisfy
their bloodlust in the American colonies
the natives were astonished by the
savagery of the Spanish and particularly
the British meanwhile on the other side
of the world the peoples of Indonesia
were equally appalled by the all
destructive fury of European warfare
quoting all this from a contemporary
military historian Geoffrey Parker
Europeans regarded all the conquests as
small Wars he comments its nomination of
the world relied critically upon the
constant use of force it was thanks to
their military superiority rather than
to any social moral or natural advantage
that the white people's of the world
managed to create and control however
briefly the first global hegemony in
history those temporal qualification
in my opinion are open the question well
the consequences of what Adam Smith
called the savage injustice of the
Europeans are not in doubt including the
two worst demographic catastrophes in
history and the record of devastation
and oppression that continues until the
present day
the grim truth has been kept quite
remote from consciousness and with
remarkable efficiency to this day among
educated sectors one example that's been
quite well studied is their reaction to
the Pol Pot style atrocities that were
directed by the United States in its own
backyard in recent years as it conducted
a violent war against the church and
other miscreants who sought to bring a
measure of freedom and justice to one of
the most brutalized corners of the world
outside of more disciplined circles
however the cultural awakening of the
1960's opened many eyes a fact which has
aroused much fury among the connoisseurs
it's worth taking a moment to inspect
the wonders of the Commissar culture
highlighted in fact by this current
example there's now a solemn debate in
progress about the u.s. dedication to as
it's called exporting democracy it was
supposed to have been the guiding
doctrine of the Reagan administration
sober thinkers warned that voting by
granting idealism a near exclusive hold
on our foreign policy we go too far
harming our own interests it's New York
Times Chiefs diplomatic correspondent
Thomas Friedman quoting high officials
there's no confusion about the operative
meaning of democracy or how the grand
victory was won all of this was revealed
with great clarity after the end of the
Cold War removed any residual appeal to
this
interference with the awesome mobility
of our other purpose keeping just to
Central America as the sent as the
Berlin Wall fell elections were held in
Honduras in what George Bush called an
inspiring example of the Democratic
promise that is today spreading
throughout the Americas there were two
candidates they both represented large
landowners and wealthy industrialists
with close ties to the military were the
effective rulers under US control they
had no political programs so the
campaign was largely restricted to
insults and entertainment rather like
another campaign that had taken place
somewhere it's not long before human
rights abuses by the security forces
escalated before the election starvation
and misery are rampant having increased
considerably during the decade of
democracy as its called
along with capital flight and the debt
burden but there was no major threat to
order or to investors at the same time
same month the electoral campaign opened
the Nicaragua it's 1984 elections do not
exist in US commentary they could not be
controlled and therefore they are not an
inspiring example of democracy taking no
chances with the long scheduled 1990
elections Bush announced at once in
November 1989 that only a victory for
his candidate would end the embargo that
was strangling the country the White
House and Congress then proceeded to
renew their support for the Contra
terrorists in defiance of the Central
American presidents the World Court and
the United Nations which had been
rendered irrelevant by the US Security
Council veto Nicaraguans were thus
informed very explicitly that only a
vote for the u.s. candidate would end
the terror and the illegal economic
warfare the intellectual class in the
United States and Britain and other
places went along continuing to suppress
the US
of the peace process with the diligence
that's required on important affairs of
state I did a review of the press in
Latin America in the United States and
was kind of interesting in Latin America
the electoral outcome was generally
described as a victory for George Bush
even by those who celebrated it in the
United States in contrast the outcome
was hailed as quote the victory for us
fair play with Americans United enjoy
kind of Albanian style that's New York
Times headlines now it's not that I was
typical all over the press no exceptions
it's not that the celebrants were
unaware of how the US victory was
achieved rather there was just
unconstrained joy at the grand success
in subverting democracy here's a Time
magazine for example it was quite frank
about the means that were employed to
bring about what they called the the
happy the latest of the happy series of
democratic surprises as democracy burst
forth in Nicaragua the method they said
was I'm quoting to wreck the economy and
prosecute a long and deadly proxy war
until the exhausted natives overthrow
the unwanted government themselves with
a cost to us that is minimal leaving the
victim with wrecked bridges sabotage
power stations and ruined farms and thus
providing the u.s. candidate with a
winning issue ending the impoverishment
of the people of Nicaragua well to
appreciate the character of the
political culture it's only necessary to
take the same phrase imagine it
appearing in in Stalinist Russia with a
few names change an intellectual
exercise which is far beyond the
capacity of Western commissar is
needless to say but let's leave that
morass and turn to some other ones as
the Quinn centenary approached the
traditional apologetics were sounded
once again and they're not entirely
without merit so it takes a the
economists in London it had a point when
it lauded what it called the passion for
justice of the Spanish murderers and
torturers it is in fact true that they
wanted to keep some of their victims
alive to slave in the mines where their
life expectancy was about the same as
that of forced laborers at Auschwitz as
historian David stanard observes and he
compares this more humane attitude with
that of the English settlers seeking
Levens realm their goal was simply to
rid themselves of the natives entirely
as they carried out what the leading
newspaper in the United States in the
mid 19th century called the glorious
work of subjugation and conquest one of
the leading heroes whose name now graces
the capital city of Texas explained that
the American colonists would be
satisfied with nothing short of
extermination or expulsion the US would
soon sweep the country of the Indians
and drive them as they always have
driven them to ruin an extermination
Stephen Austin explained he was speaking
to what he called the madmen who sought
to establish a free red white society in
Texas where he had already successfully
cleared those he called the natives of
the forest
there were people more humane than
Stephen Austin like George Washington
who felt that in his words the gradual
extension of our settlements will as
certainly cause the savage as the wolf
to retire both being beasts of prey
though they differ in shape Thomas
Jefferson advised that the backward
tribes that the borders will relapse
into barbarism and misery lose numbers
by war and want and we shall be obliged
to drive them with the beasts of the
forests into the stony mountains
meanwhile all blacks would be removed
Africa Jefferson said leaving the
country without blot or mixture or to
Haiti which Abraham Lincoln recognized
in eight
sixty-two in part for the same reason a
modern rendition of all of this is given
by a contemporary standard history of
American diplomacy published in 1969
Thomas Bailey where we read that after
winning their independence Americans
concentrated on the task of felling
trees and Indians and of rounding out
their natural of their natural
boundaries well like Adam Smith Thomas
Jefferson was a man of Enlightenment
than humanity representing the heights
of European civilization exploring
further we reached the great thinker who
discoursed authoritative leone same
topics in his lectures on philosophy of
history a half-century later in 1830 as
we approach what he called the final
phase of world history when spirit
reaches its full maturity and strength
in the German world German includes
England speaking from these lofty
heights Hegel explains that native
America was physically and psychically
powerless so that it must expire as soon
as spirit approached it hence the
aborigines gradually vanished at the
breath of European activity according to
him they were inferior even to the
Negroes whose character has nothing
harmonious with humanity entirely
lacking and Moral Sentiments they
practice polygamy so as to have many
children to sell into slavery which is a
benevolent institution enabling them to
become participant in a higher morality
and the culture connected with it they
have such contempt of humanity he said
that they allow themselves to be shot
down by thousands and war with Europeans
life has a value only when it has
something valuable as its object which
is a thought beyond the grasp of
creatures who are at the level of a mere
thing an object of no value such
thoughts persist right to the present
day liberal critics of the Vietnam War
explained that the
poor use the strategy of the week
inviting us to carry our strategic logic
to its conclusion which is genocide but
we are unwilling to destroy ourselves by
contradicting our own value system soft
humanitarians we feel that genocide is a
terrible burden to bear
William Fife and Townsend hoops explain
just a couple of weeks ago strategic
analyst Albert Volstead er added that
the Vietnamese were able to bear the
costs imposed on their subjects more
easily than we could impose them ideas
that were just too noble for this cruel
world while Hagel lectured on the
psychic disorders that caused the
natives to expire as spirit approached
President Andrew Jackson announced his
Indian Removal Act and explained that he
was deeply moved by his generosity in
having done my duty to my red children
namely by expelling them expelling the
civilized tribes who had in fact created
a remarkably successful and productive
self-governing Society after having been
brutally expelled in violation of other
equally solemn treaties if any and if
any failure of my good intention arises
Jackson said it will be attributable to
their lack to their want of duty to
themselves not to me his lucky children
were then driven at Bayonet Point on
what they called the Trail of Tears
perhaps half survived the generous and
enlightened policy of the US government
as the operation was described by the
Secretary of War with a routine and self
acclaim for unspeakable atrocities now
there was an eyewitness observer who
described how the Pioneers deprived the
Indians of their rights and exterminated
them with singular Felicity tranquilly
legally philanthropic Lee without
shedding blood and without violating a
single great principle of morality in
the eyes of the world it was impossible
to destroy people with more respect for
the law
of humanity de Tocqueville wrote on the
scene
nothing reveals this remarkable capacity
more dramatically than the Western
reaction to the Indochina Wars which are
in fact one of the most savage episodes
of the 500-year conquest they left
millions of corpses three countries
utterly devastated children being killed
to this day by unexploded bombs deformed
fetuses in hospitals in the south notice
not the north which was spared the
particular atrocity of chemical warfare
from this record one issue remains the
savage treatment of the United States at
the hands of the Vietnamese barbarians
they get it day after day in the press
today for example in the New York Times
we read stories with headlines like
Vietnam trying to be nicer still has a
long way to go with Asia correspondent
Barbara Cosette reporting that although
the Vietnamese are making some progress
on the missing Americans they're still
far from approaching our moral standards
and there's a hundred others with the
same tone and content Friesen clinton
will be in the act properly statesmen
like President Bush a few days ago
announced that it was a bitter conflict
but Hanoi knows today that we seek only
answers without the threat of
retribution for the past in other words
their crimes against us can never be
forgotten but we can begin he said
writing the last chapter of the Vietnam
War if they dedicate themselves with
sufficient zeal to locating the remains
of Americans who they viciously blasted
from the skies we might even be in
helping the Vietnamese find and identify
their own combatants missing in action
Chrisette adds and we perhaps might even
lift the embargo that strangling vietnam
that is if American businessmen feel
that they're being cut out of potential
profits which is the only serious issue
the adjacent that was a story on the
front page of the New York Times right
next to it there's another one which
reported the visit of the Japanese
Emperor
where he failed to unambiguously accept
the blame for Japan's wartime aggression
that revealed again a deep flaw in the
Japanese character that has very sorely
puzzled American commentators in the
past year as they commemorated the date
which will live an infinite namely a day
when Japan attacked the naval base in a
u.s. colony that had been stolen from
its inhabitants by force and guile
loyalists elsewhere insist on greater
vulgarity for example in England where
you can find people like Robert conquest
who mocks reports of u.s. directed
atrocities as the sheerest absurdity
perhaps the silliest he wrote what in
1986 was a solemn declaration but I'm
quoting him by a leading figure in Oxfam
that he had evidence showing that the
Contras in Nicaragua had committed
various atrocities especially against
medical and educational staff something
that would obviously have no possible
motive he explained that is therefore
transparently vulgar propaganda five
months before he wrote and on the scene
inquiry of 120 health professionals of
the American Public Health Association
and the World Health Organization had
reported that the Contras were quoting
systematically destroying hospitals and
clinics and killing and terrorizing
health care workers giving many details
Human Rights investigators have provided
a horrendous and detailed record as for
the reasons those who are too stupid to
be able to figure them out for
themselves could turn for assistance to
the CIA State Department and the u.s.
Southern Command who explained quite
clearly why the Contras were directed to
attack what were called soft targets
main meaning undefended civilian targets
the former head of intelligence of the
main contra force who defected described
his training illegally in a US Air Force
Base and he explained how the Contras
there were trained in his words to
attack a lot of schools health centers
and those sorts
things we have tried to make it so that
the Nicaraguan government cannot provide
social services for the peasants cannot
develop its projects in other words to
ensure that scarce resources are
diverted to military expenditures as the
CIA put it in an internal July 1983
assessment three years before a common
conquest explained his perspective some
of the commentary the British press on
the latest Nobel Prize given to
Rigoberta menchu really surpasses belief
sometimes when I read the British press
I must say I think there's something
subtle going on that I don't understand
too subtle for us Colonials to cash or
something anyhow quote if I'm
misunderstanding explain it to me the
others from The Telegraph they concede
that the Guatemalan army did Massacre
Indian populations and drive them out of
their country but I'm quoting it is the
left-wing terror tactics that have
plagued the Americas for more than a
hundred years not the genocide
elaborations of the slaughterers and the
torturers or of course their pay masters
and directors who remain unmentioned in
polite society the ideological movement
of the guerrillas opposed a much greater
danger to the way of life of the
Highland Indians in Guatemala than the
brutish but fitful intrusions of the
military regime that's from the journals
Central American specialists you can
find such things elsewhere if you go
down to the depths of the Stalinist
archives you can find things similar to
these performances which are quite
regularly in the press
in fact traditionally the British have
been able to compete with the best in
this game Lord Cromer explained that the
British possess in a very high degree
the power of acquiring the sympathy and
confidence of the primitive races with
it with which they are brought into
contact his colleague Lord Curzon who
was
of India proclaimed that in the Empire
we have found not merely the key to
glory and wealth but the call to duty
and the means of service to mankind in
fact heaven must be full to overflowing
if the Masters of self adulation are to
be taken at their word saudade reason
the subject people's find strange ways
to express their gratitude
so Nehru for example who is incidentally
quite an Anglophile wrote that the only
possible parallel to the Viceroy of
India would be that of Hitler the
ideology of British rule he wrote was
that of the Haran folk and the master
race an idea inherent in imperialism
that was proclaimed an unambiguous
language by those in authority and
manifested in practice as Indians were
subjected to insult humiliation and
contemptuous treatment writing from a
British prison in 1944 Nehru was not
unmindful of the benevolent intent of
the rulers the solicitude with which
British industrialists and economists
have shown for the Indian peasant hero
has been truly gratifying in view of
this as well as of the tender care
lavished upon him by the British
government in India one can only
conclude that some all-powerful and
malign fate some supernatural agency has
countered their intentions and measures
and made that peasant one of the poorest
and most miserable beings on earth he
also points out that you can draw quite
a good correlation between the length of
British rule in various areas and the
impoverishment of the population there
others have been less genteel in their
commentary although Western culture
which has the guns and the wealth
remains largely immune the shameful
record if considered at all is regarded
as insignificant or even a proof of our
nobility and it's here that the moral
and cultural challenge arises at the end
of the first five hundred years of this
story which is sure to continue one
striking feature of the European
conquest has been
the leading role of state power and
violence was a lot of very good
contemporary scholarship on this
summarizing a lot of it gains traced
orient James Tracy writes that Europeans
broke violently and to relatively open
Asian trading systems organizing their
major commercial ventures either as an
extension of the state or as autonomous
trading companies which were endowed
with many of the characteristics of the
state and in fact were backed by the
centralized power of the home country
the English were particularly efficient
which is why Britain won the game the
booty that was brought home by Sir
Francis Drake and other pirates may
fairly be considered the Fountain and
origin of British foreign investments
John Maynard Keynes wrote laying the
basis he pointed out of the for the
investments that were the main
foundations of England's foreign
connections by the mid 17th century
England was powerful enough to impose an
effective trading monopoly in the North
Atlantic while driving its rivals from
India where state power was used to
quite good effect a 20th century British
Royal Industrial Commission recalled
that Indian industrial development was
quoting not inferior to that of the more
advanced European nations when merchant
adventurers from the West arrived it may
even be that the industries of India
were far more advanced than those in the
west up to the advent of the Industrial
Revolution economic historian Frederick
Claremont points out citing British
studies on that matter from 1700 written
barred Indian textiles later forcing
India to take inferior British products
other advanced in Indian industries were
also undermined including shipbuilding
glass paper and others India became
rural rural eyes and impoverished an
agricultural colony of industrial
England such measures were unavoidable
Horace Wilson a friend of James Mills
wrote in his history of British India
1826 had this not been the case the
mills of pace
Manchester would have been stopped in
their outset and could scarcely have
been again set in motion even by the
power of steam they were created by the
sacrifice of Indian manufacturers in
1757 as he conquered mango Clive
described the textile center of Dhaka as
extensive populous and rich as the City
of London by 1840 its population had
fallen from a hundred and fifty thousand
to thirty thousand Sir Charles Trevelyan
testified before a committee of the
House of Lords quoting him and the
jungle and malaria are fast encroaching
Dhaka the manchester of india has fallen
from a very flourishing town to a very
poor and small town it's now of course
the capital of Bangladesh the very
symbol of hopelessness and despair much
like Haiti which was the wealthiest
colonial possession in the Americas
producing three-quarters of the world's
sugar by 1789 also leading the world in
production of coffee cotton and other
resources providing France with enormous
wealth from the labor of its roughly
half million slaves and later completely
devastated in large measure as a
retribution for its successful slave
revolt as the savage injustice of the
Europeans took its course continuing
until the present day is going on right
now under Britain's permanent settlement
of my 1793 the lands of India were
privatized modern touch to that that
yielded wealth to local clients and
taxes for the British rulers while
quoting the settlement fashioned with
great care and deliberation as to our
painful knowledge subjected almost the
whole of the lower classes the most
grievous oppression to British Inquiry
Commission in 1832 the director of the
East India Company reported that the
misery hardly finds
parallel in the history of Commerce the
bones of cotton Weaver's are bleaching
the plains of India
note that the experiment was a failure
only for the experimental subjects who
far as I recall were not asked to sign
consent forms but those who design the
experiment for them it worked very well
in fact typically the experiments that
are carried out the experimental
subjects don't even have the rights of
laboratory animals who at least are
considered subject to certain ethical
requirements by the 19th century India
was financing more than two fifths of
britain's trade deficit providing a
market for british manufacturers after
the destruction of its own industry as
well as the troops for its colonial
conquests and of course the opium that
was the staple of british trade within
with china the experiment as it was
called in bengal has been followed by
many others quite typically with similar
results although nobody grows any
conclusions from that
I'll give the concern to a contemporary
example and quite an illuminating one
namely Brazil by the 1920s the Colossus
of the South as it was called was hailed
by the US press as a mighty realm of
limitless potentialities no territory in
the world is better worth exploitation
than Brazil's The Wall Street Journal
pointed out perceptively in 1924 after
world war ii the united states was able
to take complete control kicking out the
british the the united states at that
time was very much in favor of and what
they called an open world but with a
closed hemisphere inside of it the
closed hemisphere the u.s. already
controlled there was no need for that to
be open and the open door was not to be
applied in Latin America in the Middle
East that's us tariffs the rest of the
world not yet under US control was to be
open and the results are reviewed in a
highly regarded scholarly work by Gerald
Haines as the senior historian of the
CIA I didn't actually know there was
such a position until I read the book
the u.s. goal he says was to eliminate
all foreign competition from Latin
America to maintain the area as an
important market for us surplus
industrial production and private
investments to exploit its vast reserves
of raw materials and to keep
international communism out although US
intelligence he notes could find no
indication that it was trying to get in
international communism just a code word
for people with the wrong ideas the u.s.
sought to prevent what Washington called
excessive industrial development which
he explains means competing with US
industry industrial development of
quoting must be complementary to US
industry while guaranteeing American
profits and dominance and of course
ample profit remittance competition with
foreign capitals a Britisher Canadian
capital was considered excessive and
therefore allowed agricultural
development was promoted as long as it
avoided what he calls destabilizing
programs like land reform relied on US
farm equipment and fostered commodities
that complemented US production and
created new markets for US agricultural
commodities Brazilian desires were
secondary he concedes although it's
useful to pack them a little bit and
make them think you're fond of them
as John Foster Dulles put it what US
planners envisioned he says but seldom
stated was a neo-colonial relationship
with Brazil furnishing the raw materials
for American industry and the United
States supplying Brazil with
manufactured goods they the Americans
pursued a neo-colonial neo Merkel murk
simplest policy which he explains is a
classic liberal approach to development
that just shows you how supple an
instrument economic theory can be in the
right hands us leaders who says used
Brazil as a testing area for modern
scientific methods of industrial
development
another bangle and short for example US
X us experts encouraged Brazilians to
open up the Amazon to development and to
follow the u.s. model of railroad
operation the latter perhaps a touch of
black humour but crucially they provided
Brazil with very sincere and advice on
how to benefit US corporations in fact
the account if you read through it is
inter lorded with such phrases as the
best of intentions sincerely believed
and so on by lucky accident what was
sincerely believed conformed quite
nicely to the interests of US investors
however ruinous it might be to our
little brown brothers hands again
strikes traditional courts including the
endless faith in the benign intent that
so miraculously serves self-interest
another goal he points out was
cultivating the Brazilian military which
US officials promoted as the protector
of democracy this farsighted program to
achieve our democratic vision came to
fruition in 1964 as the generals took
command terminating Brazil's post-war
parliamentary interlude and instituting
a neo Nazi national security state with
ample torture and repression inspiring
their counterparts throughout the
hemisphere to do the same kind of
notable illustration of the domino
theory one which for some reason has
never mentioned when one brings that up
they follow to prove neoliberal doctrine
again under
continued US tutelage and created what
was called an economic miracle that was
greatly admired though there were some
reservations about the statistic
sadistic violence by which it was
instituted the brilliant achievements of
the generals and the right-thinking
technocrats made Brazil the Latin
American darling of the international
business community business latin
america reported in 1972 Arthur burns it
was chairman of the Federal Reserve was
also full of praise for their miraculous
work as the Chicago boys were invited in
by another collection of fascist killers
a year later after the overthrow of IND
and Chile Chicago School economist
arnold harberger held up brazil as the
exemplar of a glowing future under
economic liberalism latin american
economist david felix report reports it
was true and people recognized that the
miracle had a few flaws over 90% of the
population lived under conditions of
increasing misery for many of them
comparable to Central Africa mit
examples which I presume you know but
profits flowed and the tiny elite was
doing fine and macroeconomic statistics
were quite okay so it was an economic
miracle in the technical sense Haynes is
writing in 1989 he describes the results
of more than four decades of US tutelage
and dominance as a real American success
story
America's Brazilian policies were
enormous ly successful he writes
bringing about impressive economic
growth based solidly on capitalism this
triumph of capitalist democracy stands
in dramatic contrast to the failures of
communism although admittedly the
comparison
unfair to the Communists who had nothing
remotely like the favorable conditions
of this testing area for capitalism with
its huge resources no foreign enemies
free access to international capital and
aid and benevolent US guidance for half
a century and the success is indeed real
from the early years Ames writes US
investments and profits boomed as
Washington intensified Brazil's
financial dependence on the United
States influenced its government's
decisions affecting the allocation of
resources and nudged Brazil into the US
dominated trading system if the
conditions of Eastern Europe are beyond
the wildest dreams of much of the
population that's the way the cookie
crumbles we should not underestimate the
scale of the achievement it took real
talent to create a nightmare in a
country as favoured and richly endowed
as Brazil and in the light of such
triumphs which can be duplicated over
much of the world it's entirely
understandable that the rulers of the
new imperial age should be dedicated
with such passion to helping others
share the wonders and that the
ideological managers should celebrate
the accomplishment with such enthusiasm
and self praise well such as the way
with experiments they don't always
succeed except for the designers it's
another one of those puzzling irony's of
history that being used the well-behaved
intellectual the essential point about
all this was actually perceived by Adam
Smith and one of the many parts of his
classic work that nobody bothers to read
he argued that monopolistic companies
and colonies had a grievous impact on
others and were harmful for the home
country as well that part you read what
he went on to say that our merchants and
manufacturers have been by far the
principal architects of policy and their
interests have been most peculiarly
attended to by the system though not the
interests of consumers and working
people in short the costs were social
and the profits poured into the coffers
of the principal architects well that
too is a lesson that carries over into
year 501 Adam Smith's emphasis on the
crucial element of class conflict is
only one of the many interesting
features of his thinking that have been
filtered out as it's been converted into
an instrument of domination and
oppression state power also played a
major role in development at home
especially in England from the days of
the massive expropriation of the
peasantry and on
there's a recent quite an interesting
recent study on this by John brewer
historian of England who points out that
Britain's emergence as what he calls the
military wunderkind of the age in the
late 17th and early 18th century
coincided with them all these are quotes
with an astonishing transformation and
British government one which put muscle
on the bones of the British body politic
contrary to the liberal tradition
written in this period became a strong
state what he calls a fiscal military
state thanks to a radical increase in
taxation and a sizeable public
administration devoted to organizing the
fiscal and military activities of the
state the state he points out became the
largest single actor in the economy one
of Europe's most powerful states judged
by the criteria of the ability to take
pounds out of people's pockets and to
put soldiers in the field and sailors on
the high seas lobbies trade
organizations groups of merchants and
financiers fought or combined with one
another to take advantage of the
protection afforded by the greatest of
economic creatures the state its brewer
the role of the state was not merely to
conquer and to conduct experiments it
also acted to promote exports to limit
imports and in general to pursue the
protectionist import substitution
policies that have opened the way to
industrial take off from England to
South Korea without any exception
that I've ever heard of the same is true
of the United States from textiles
through steel to modern electronics and
pharmaceuticals and biotechnology the
state has been called upon to protect
private capital from the destructive
impact of free markets to organize a
huge public subsidy and to provide a
state guaranteed market to cushion
management decisions the role that has
been played primarily by the Pentagon
based system in past years there's now
much concern in the United States
read about it all the time over the need
to find other measures to guarantee the
system of public public subsidy private
profit that's proudly called free
enterprise
now that the possibility of appealing to
the Great Satan the justify the
traditional Methodist has been lost the
crucial role of state of the state in
what's late development has been widely
recognized by economic historians since
the work of Alexander Gershon grown
about 40 years ago the East Asian model
is one familiar case is a major study
and a very interesting one by 24 leading
Japanese economists who review the
decision by the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry meet
the right after World War 2 they decided
to disregard prevailing economic theory
and the advice of their economic
advisors and instead to assign a
predominant role in the formulation of
industrial policy to the state
bureaucracy in a system that they say is
rather similar to the organization of
the industrial bureaucracy in the
so-called socialist countries the this
radical defiance of economic precept
they point out set the stage for the
Japanese miracle and Western specialists
do not disagree one of the leading
conservative Japan experts Chalmers
Johnson describes Japan as the only
communist nation that works because they
were efficient instead of corrupt the
pattern in fact is
section lists as far as I know economic
success has invariably relied on
activists policies that deliberately
alter market incentives there's a very
extensive recent scholarly study by
Hollis Chenery and others which reviews
the point comparative study and it
points out that periods of significant
export expansion are almost always
preceded by periods of strong import
substitution look at the exceptions you
see they really prove the same point
that is state intervention and violation
of the market these conclusions are
important to bear in mind as you observe
the measures that are now being employed
to keep the third world in its place now
including Eastern Europe which is being
restored to its traditional role true
those who expect to win the competition
are going to laud the wonders of free
trade so everybody knows that Britain
was a great advocate of free trade from
about 1846 up until the late 1920s it
became an advocate of free trade after
it had smashed up the competitors and
created its Industrial Revolution and
that put it in modern terms the playing
field was leveled namely vertically
which is the way it's supposed to be
leveled in the 1920s however Japan
unfairly began to produce more cheaply
and efficiently at which point Britain
effectively closed off the Empire Empire
followed by the Dutch the Americans and
the French an important part of the
background for the Pacific War the u.s.
preached the principles of free trade
selectively as they've just indicated
after world war ii for much the same
reasons until us hegemony declined and
what is these days called a tri-polar
world economy Reaganite conservatism as
it's called doubled the percentage of
imports subject the protectionist
measures among other devices of state
intervention which were in fact among
the most protectionist in the world in
the 1980s aid to dependent mother's
succumb to so-called conservatism
but aid to dependent bankers and steel
executives and electronics firms
flourished in fact throughout the
corporate sector has insisted on massive
state subsidies to maintain private
power and privilege that was a lesson
that was learned by the corporate
managers who flocked to Washington to
run the essentially totalitarian wartime
economy that in fact finally pulled the
us out of the Great Depression belief
that capitalism might be a viable system
has long disappeared apart from the
remote margins and of course the
mainstream doctrinal system which
naturally seeks to subject intended
victims to its destructive impact but
the successful economies will not hear
of it and never have which is why
they're successful by World War two u.s.
planners were well aware of their
unprecedented economic and military
power and they intended to use it to
organize the world in the interests of
the social sectors that they represent
at home the population are considered
ignorant and meddlesome outsiders who
must remain spectators not participants
in the political system voting walter
Lippmann and other progressive thinkers
as they developed a suitable democratic
theory for the modern age the economic
system must observe sure totalitarian
principles with the Raval restricted to
the role of rented tools and passive
consumers it was also necessary at that
point to reverse the first and the last
legislative victories of labour in the
mid 1930s and to dismantle the
organization's and the threat of
democracy that they posed that's at home
abroad the industrial societies were to
be reconstructed along similar lines
that was a major task of the early
post-war period as the traditional
conservative order was largely restored
including fascist collaborators while
labor and the
a fascist resistance were weakened and
marginalized as much as possible with
great violence when that was necessary
the great workshops as they were called
were to be Germany in Japan restored the
conservative business rule and under US
control now that plan required that
Japan be provided with its empire toward
the south as George Kennan put it he was
the chief of the State Department policy
planning staff and one of the leading
architects of the post-war world and
Germany had to be partitioned with the
rich industrial areas kept under
unilateral Western control and protected
from what the British Foreign Office
called economic and ideological
infiltration from the East which is
something very like aggression political
set successes by the wrong people are
commonly described as aggression in the
Orwellian language of the internal
documentary record so in Japan a
potential victory of labor which every
was afraid of would have been as they
put a concealed aggression by the
Russians in Vietnam the United States
was fighting what the Kennedy
administration described as internal
aggression that is aggression by South
Vietnamese peasants against the US
troops who were trying to defend their
country from them and so on throughout
the South throughout was to be restored
to its service role and in fact there
was sophisticated planning each area was
given its particular role Africa was to
be exploited quoting kenan again
exploited for the reconstruction of
Europe Southeast Asia was to fulfill its
main function of providing raw materials
and markets along with Latin America
Middle East resources were to be managed
by what British imperialists had called
the Arab facade that could be trusted to
serve the interests of the Masters for
the third world generally a 1948 CIA
memorandum observed it would be
necessary to strike a balance between
supporting local nationalist aspirations
and maintaining the colonial economic
interests of Western Europe and there
could be little doubt as to the relative
weights when serious interests were at
stake well as global manager and global
enforcer the United States perceived the
main threat to all of this as what were
called were commonly called radical and
nationalistic regimes that are
responsive to popular pressures for
immediate improvement in the low living
standards of the masses and development
for domestic needs these are quotes
tendencies that conflict with the demand
for a political and economic climate
conducive to private investment with
adequate repatriation of profits and
protection of our raw materials and so
if this sounds like some tenth-rate
Maoist tract that's because the most
vulgar Marxism is absolutely standard in
the internal planning record and the
business press with of course the value
is reversed I'll spare you similar
things radical and nationalistic regimes
are intolerable in themselves even more
so if they appear to be succeeding in
terms that might be meaningful to
oppressed and suffering people in that
case there's another couple other
technical terms that come along in that
case they're called a virus that might
infect others or a rotten apple that
might spoil the barrel of course not by
conquest but by the demonstration effect
of successful development so when Henry
Kissinger warned that the contagious
example of a Indies Chile would infect
not only Latin America but also southern
Europe he did not
I think anticipate that I end his hordes
would descend upon Rome I say I think
because the extent of his ignorance and
stupidity is hard to exaggerate but I
don't think he had that in mind
rather I assume that what he meant was
that
voters would get a message that
democratic social reform was a possible
option
the sandanista revolution without
borders was a spectacularly successful
government media fraud but the
propaganda images did reflect an
authentic concern from the perspective
of a hegemonic power and its
intellectual servant's declaration of an
intent to provide a model that will
inspire others which in fact is the
actual source of the imagery does amount
to aggression much as the British
Foreign Office understood in the late
1940s when a virus is detected it has to
be destroyed naturally and potential
victims have to be immunized the Cuban
virus called forth invasion
unprecedented international terrorism
and economic warfare all of which of
course continues and a rash of national
security state says in Brazil to prevent
the rot from spreading and much the same
was true in Southeast Asia in the same
years a notable example which gives
great insight into Western civilization
was the euphoric Welcome that was
afforded to the huge slaughter in
Indonesia in 1965 which really have to
be ready to be believed the standard
approach to the virus itself is a
two-track policy as in the case of alien
days Chile the hardline called for a
military coup which was finally achieved
the soft line was outlined by ambassador
Edward Korea Kennedy liberal he said
explained we must do all within our
power to condemn Chile and the Chileans
two utmost deprivation and poverty a
policy designed for a long time to come
to accelerate the hard features of a
communist society in Chile so even if
the hardline did not succeed in
exterminating the virus the vision of
utmost deprivation should keep the rot
from spreading and ultimately demoralize
the patient itself and crucially it
provides ample grist for the mills of
the commissaries who can produce cries
of anguish at the hard features of a
communist society pouring scorn on those
apologists who
what is in fact happening very same
model was applied to Cuba and Nicaragua
it was extended after Cold War pretexts
had to be abandoned simply showing their
utter irrelevance in the Cuban case in
fact the policies go back 170 years
another fact that has to be obscured by
the cultural managers well to introduce
some further technical terminology this
is mostly advice for those of you who
are looking for professional careers and
so you catch on rotten apples constitute
a threat to what's called stability so
as Washington prepared to overthrow the
first democratic government in Guatemala
in 1954 a State Department official
warned internally that Guatemala has
become a quoting well Guatemala has
become an increasing threat to the
stability of Honduras and El Salvador
its agrarian reform as a powerful
propaganda weapon its broad social
program of aiding the workers and
peasants in a victorious struggle
against the upper classes and large
foreign enterprises has a strong appeal
to the populations of Central American
neighbors where similar conditions
prevail so stability in short means
security for the upper classes and large
foreign enterprises and naturally it
must be preserved again such thinking as
pervasive and understandable an entirely
independent of the Cold War after the
Gulf War when the Cold War was lost as a
pretext beyond hope of redemption George
Bush returned to support for his old
friend and Ally Saddam Hussein as he
crushed the Shiites in the south and
then the Kurds in the north western
ideologues explained that although these
atrocities offend their delicate
sensibilities
we must nevertheless accept them in the
name of stability the chief diplomatic
correspondent of The New York Times
again Thomas Friedman outlined Bush
administration reasoning Washington he
wrote seeks the best of all world an
iron-fisted Iraqi Hunta without Saddam
Hussein a return to the days when
Saddam's iron fist held erect
much to the satisfaction of the American
allies Turkey and Saudi Arabia not to
speak of the boss in Washington Saddam
Hussein committed his first serious
crime on august 2nd 1990 when he
disobeyed orders therefore he must be
destroyed you're not allowed to disobey
orders but some clone has to be found to
ensure stability incidentally while
Britain is agonizing over the curious
sudden discovery of what was always
known namely the Britain in the United
States were arming their good friend
Saddam Hussein the compartmentalised
British mind is able to overlook the
fact that Britain is right now the major
military supplier to an absolute clone
of Saddam Hussein namely General Suharto
who is using British aid to crush
consummate the genocide and Timur among
other pleasant actions but you can't
expect the commissar class to get that
into their heads the Communists danger
to stability is further enhanced by
their unfair advantages the Communists
are able to appeal directly to the
masses President Eisenhower complained
again using the standard vulgar marxist
rhetoric in internal discourse our plan
our plans for the masses preclude any
such appeal Secretary of State John
Foster Dulles dpad he added to this he
deplored what he called the communists
ability to get control of mass movements
something we have no capacity to
duplicate the poor people are the ones
they appeal to and they have always
wanted to plunder the rich that's the
greatest problem of the modern Europe
the same concerns extend to the
preferential option of the for the
poorer of the Latin American Church and
other commitments to independent
development or democracy and they also
extend through our old friends like
Mussolini and Hitler Trujillo Noriega
Saddam Hussein when they forget their
assigned roles although major themes are
persist
and then we'll continue into year 501
and beyond policies do have to be
adapted to changing contingencies there
was a change in world order of lasting
importance that was recognized
officially in August 1971 when Richard
Nixon dismantled the international
economic order that had been established
after World War two in which the u.s.
served in effect this international
banker German led Europe and Japan had
recovered from wartime destruction and
the US was facing the unanticipated
costs of the Vietnam War the world
economy was entering into a period of
tribe polarity and also of stagnation
and declining profitability of capital
one perfectly predictable reaction from
the early 1970s was a rapid
intensification of the class war that is
waged by the corporate sector its
political agents and its ideological
servants of the years since the last 20
years have seen an attack on real wages
Social Services unions indeed any
functioning Democratic structure so as
to overcome the Troublesome crisis of
democracy as it was called that was
brought about by the illegitimate
efforts of the public to bring their
interests into the political arena in
Central America one can send out the
death squads at home where subtle means
are required another objective is to
establish a de facto world government
which is devoted to the task of ensuring
that the world's human and material
resources are freely available to the
supranational corporations and banks
that are denominated to Imperial age its
operations have to be insulated from
popular awareness or interference it's
taken for granted that not very many
people are going to follow the internal
deliberations of the GATT negotiators
the IMF with their enormous impact on
global society and of course not the
transnational corporations and
international banks and investment firms
which are immune to inspection and which
dominate production and commerce and
conditions of life worldwide in a system
of internally managed trade classical
economic theory a firm is considered an
island of central management in a sea
and a free-market sea by now the islands
are approximately the size of the sea
and the sea itself has little
resemblance to free-market ideology an
interesting example of this is the north
american free trade agreement NAFTA
that's now being consummated in north
america it's gonna have very large-scale
consequences it's quite intriguing to
see how it's being handled it's you
can't be quite certain about what its
consequences are because it's secret
nobody knows what's in it but it's
pretty clear that it's going to be a
bonanza for investors and probably a
disaster for workers in the environment
it's an executive agreement the text was
even withheld from a union based labor
advisory committee which is required by
law to review such measures it was
withheld until one day before the report
was due and then still largely kept
secret that's a striking example of the
utter contempt for democracy on the part
of the so-called conservatives which is
believe it or not even greater than that
on the part of the so-called liberals
Congress abdicated responsibility
citizens know nothing in such ways we
can approach the long-sought ideal
formal democratic procedures that are
utterly devoid of meaning as citizens
not only do not intrude into the public
arena but scarcely have an idea of the
policies that will shape their lives the
point in fact it's far more general by
now people have scarcely any idea what's
happening around them there's an
interesting academic study that just
appeared about the
presidential election in the u.s. it
reports the less that less than 30% of
the population was aware of the
positions of the candidates on major
issues although 86% knew the name of
George Bush's dog actually to my
amazement I mentioned this on Swedish
radio in an interview right after the
election and before I got to the last
part the Swedish announcer interview no
you said oh you mean Milly but the
general propaganda does get through when
people are asked to identify the largest
element of the federal budget
less than a quarter gave the correct
answer which is military spending almost
half select foreign aid which you can
barely find I'm indignant exist the
second choice was welfare which was
chosen by 1/3 of the population who also
far overestimate the proportion that
goes to Black's and the child support
and although the question wasn't asked
you can be sure that virtually no one is
aware that so-called defense spending is
in fact in large measure welfare for the
rich another result of the study is that
the more educated sectors were the more
ignorant which is not surprising since
they are the main targets of the
indoctrination system and they are also
the ideological managers so they have to
be instilled in them the right ideas
namely the proper falsehoods Bush
supporters who are the best educated
scored lowest overall on factual
judgments now the public is not unaware
of what's happening although with the
success of the policies of isolation and
breakdown of organizational structure
the response is erratic and
self-destructive faith in billionaire
saviors the myths of past innocence and
all sorts of fanaticism mixtures that
have not had happy consequences in the
past in this general framework the Cold
War can be understood in large measure
as an interlude in the
north-south conflict of the Colombian
era unique in scale but quite similar to
other episodes and its basic logic even
before Columbus Eastern and Western
Europe were diverging in fact along a
fault line that goes right down Germany
the Bolshevik takeover quickly
eliminated any socialist elements but it
was radical nationalist it was a threat
to stability in the technical sense and
had no little appeal elsewhere in short
the Soviet Union from 1917 was a
gigantic rotten apple now and naturally
it called forth the not the usual
reaction including immediate military
intervention now of course there are
other pre tastes so if you take a look
at say the George Kennan scholarly
history of soviet-american relations
he writes that it was the dissolution of
the Constituent Assembly in January 1918
that created the breach with the Western
world with an element of finality the
British ambassador was deeply shocked he
said and promoted armed intervention
from that point on Woodrow Wilson was
particularly offended a few months later
Wilson's invading army dissolved the
National Assembly and occupied Haiti by
genuine marine corps methods and the
words of the marine commander Smedley
Butler major Smedley Butler the reason
was that Haitian legislators had refused
to ratify a constitution
imposed by the invaders that gave them
the right to buy up Haiti's lands there
was then a marine run club aside that
remedied the problem arranging for the
Constitution to be ratified with 99.9%
approval with 5% of the population
participating accordingly
Wilson is revered as a great moral
teacher and the
solo self-determination and freedom the
Bolsheviks in contrast had violated our
high principles and had to be overthrown
by force following the same high
principles the u.s. enthusiastically
welcomed the fine young revolution
carried out in Italy in 1922 as the
American ambassador described it well
into the 1930s Mussolini was that
admirable Italian gentleman in the words
of the man who took credit for the
Constitution forced on Haiti president
Franklin Delano Roosevelt fascist
atrocities were acceptable because they
blocked the threat of a second Russia
the State Department explained Hitler
was described as a moderate for the same
reason in 1937 the State Department saw
fascism as the natural reaction of the
rich and middle classes in self-defense
when the dissatisfied masses with the
example of the Russian Revolution before
them swing to the left
fascism it said must therefore succeed
or the masses this time reinforced by
the disillusioned middle class will
again turn to the left as you doubtless
know that conception is now being
revived by ultra right and the UH Nazi
German historians and will doubtless be
the accepted doctrine of the future
given its utility for power interest a
host of other murderers and torturers
were placed in power and supported for
on exactly the same grounds the actual
logic of the Cold War from 1917 was much
the same as in the case of Grenada or
Guatemala although the scale of the
problem was vastly different the
situation became more dire after 1945
when traditional Eastern European
service areas were removed and the virus
reached such a level of military power
that it actually had a deterrent effect
lending part assistance to targets of US
attack it's kinda interesting see how
the problem of this oversized rotten
apple was dealt with in policymaking led
to some curious contortions there was a
major secret study of July 1945 recently
classified in which planners tried to
put a satisfactory gloss on the US
intention to take control of the world
and surround Russia with military force
while denying the adversary any rights
at all beyond its borders that may seem
to be open to the criticism of being
illogical they worry but the criticism
they explained is only superficially
plausible the reason it's the u.s. plan
they said is a logical illogicality one
of my favorite phrases the reason is
that by no stretch of the imagination
could the US and Britain be thought to
have expansion expansionist or
aggressive ambition but Russia is
different for the following reason their
uncoding there's a rising tide all over
the world we're in the common man
aspires to higher and wider horizons and
we cannot be certain that the Russians
have not flirted with the thought of
associating themselves with this
criminal conspiracy pursuing the commie
tactic of appealing to the poor who have
always wanted the one to the rich as
Dulles later put it in other words only
when it has clearly adopted the
principle that the rich men must have
their way everywhere may the Russians be
allowed to enter the servants quarters
it's worth bearing in mind that there
was no concern over no high-level
concern over Russian aggression and
furthermore crucially that Western
leaders were completely untroubled by
Stalin's awesome crimes Truman for
example wrote that he liked and admired
Stalin thought he was honest and clever
and thought that he could deal with him
and Eisenhower and others agreed with
what went on in Russia was not his
concern Truman declared Stalin's death
he wrote in his diary would be a real
catastrophe but he added a crucial
footnote Stalin Russia cooperation was
contingent on the u.s. getting its way
85% of the time in short as usual the
problem is not crimes which can
as awesome as you like but
insubordination that's a fact that has
been made clear by a host of gangsters
from Mussolini and Hitler and Stalin up
to Saddam Hussein for such reasons the
US had little interest in resolving the
Cold War conflict that's getting late
and I'll skip the history but in fact
it's true right up to the present this
unless you could return them to the
service role short of that no kind of
settlement is even worth thinking about
and there were many opportunities it's
not and down any longer the Soviet Union
reached the peak of its power by the
late 1950s always far beyond the west by
the mid 1960s the Soviet economy was
stagnating and standard social
indicators were beginning to decline by
the late 1970s military spending was
flattening and the autocracy was unable
to control rising dissidents the command
economy had in fact carried out basic
Industrial Development but it was unable
to proceed more advanced stages and it
also suffered from the global recession
that devastated much of the south by the
1980s the system collapsed and the core
industrial countries which are always
always far richer and more powerful won
the Cold War
much of the Soviet empire will probably
return to its traditional third world
status with the old Communist Party
privileged class the main clitoris
taking on the role of third world elites
linked to the international business and
financial interests which is in fact
exactly what's going on right now
throughout that period great efforts
were undertaken to present the Soviet
Union as larger than life about the
overwhelm us by the late 1970s Soviet
decline was absolutely unmistakable but
there was rising hysteria about the
gargantuan
Soviet system leaping from strength to
strength straddling the globe
challenging the US even threatening its
survival establishing positions of
strength in Laos and Grenada and
Mozambique and other such crucial
centers of world strategic power these
delusionary efforts were accompanied by
much fantasy about Soviet military
spending which have since been exposed
as utter utterly false and quite likely
outright fraud to save you some other
things the collapse of the Soviet empire
offers enough quite a number of
opportunities to Western power along
with the restoration of East Europe to
the traditional service role for one
thing it offers crucial opportunities to
establish the north/south divide more
firmly within the rich societies one
aspect of globalization of the economy
is globalization of the third world
two-tiered model they go together its
corollary couple months ago the chairman
of daimler-benz warned the huge German
conglomerate warned that if there were
further strikes the corporation would
transfer manufacturing facilities
elsewhere in particular to Russia with
its ample supply of trained and healthy
and it is hoped docile workers the
chairman of General Motors uses similar
threats with regard to Mexico and other
sectors of the third world and
incidentally Eastern Europe it was a
nice article about this in the Financial
Times the other day which pointed out
that while GM plans to close 21 plants
in the US and Canada it has opened the
huge 700 million dollar assembly plant
in East Germany with great expectations
heightened by the fact that thanks to
over 40% unemployment workers are
willing unquote
from the Financial Times now workers are
willing to work longer hours than their
pampered colleagues in western Germany
at 40% of the wage and with few benefits
the point is that capital can freely
move people can't or in fact they're not
permitted to by those who applauded Adam
Smith's doctrines which required free
movement of labour of course apply them
when it suits their fancy the u.s. press
also bitterly assailed the striking
German workers last spring for what it
called their soft life long vacations
and general lack of understanding of
their place as instruments for the rich
and the powerful the idea is that they
should learn the lessons that were
taught at the same time to American
workers by the caterpillar corporation
profits and productivity were up wages
were down the right to strike was
eliminated by the resort to scabs
permanent replacement workers returning
the u.s. to the situation of a century
ago when the admired philanthropist
Andrew Carnegie destroyed the world's
this country's largest union at
Homestead by bringing in scabs protected
by the Pennsylvania National Guard that
victory enabled him to slash wages
imposed twelve hour work days eliminate
jobs gain monumental profits a
magnificent record it was called that
was to a great extent made possible by
the company's victory at Homestead a
historian of the world's first
billion-dollar corporation the same
victory cured the region of the dread
threat of democracy as working people
were afraid to speak well on organize
for fear of being blacklisted and
starvation if not direct state violence
of which there was plenty these
conditions in fact were not overcome
until the Great Depression and they're
now being restored and so the world
should run in accord with what Adam
Smith called the vile maxim of the
Masters in one of his many denunciations
of capitalism all for ourselves and
nothing for
people this caterpillar strike in 1992
is a historic event as was the homestead
lockout century earlier its first time
in 60 years that a major corporation has
felt powerful enough to use the ultimate
weapon against a very substantial Union
the United Auto Workers in this case
these are the results of a fierce
corporate campaign that was undertaken
as soon as American workers finally won
the right to organize in the mid 1930s
after long years of bitter struggle and
violent repression which are completely
unmatched in the industrial world in
fact the violence was so extreme that it
even scandalized journals like the
London Times you can draw your own
conclusions for them that that victory
for working people and for democracy
sent a chill through the business
community the National Association of
Manufacturers warned in 1938 of what it
called the hazard facing industrialists
and the newly realized political power
of the masses unless their thinking is
directed we are definitely headed for
adverse adversity and a major
counter-offensive was very quickly
launched accelerated after the elite
concerns that were aroused by the crisis
of democracy in the 1960s and it has had
quite significant success the results of
it are neatly captured in a New York
Times headline a couple of weeks ago in
the business section which reads paradox
of 92 weak economy strong profits
America is not doing very well the
article opens but it's corporations are
doing just fine with corporate profits
hitting new highs as profit markets
margins expand just paradox inexplicable
insoluble and it's one that will only
deepen as the architects of policy
proceed without interference from middle
some Outsiders what the paradox entails
for the general
is demonstrated by numerous studies of
income distribution and real wages
increasing poverty including starvation
infant mortality and so on in cities and
in rural areas that are coming to
compare in these respects to the third
world and of course the richest the
world's richest country with
extraordinary advantages over all the
1980s have accelerated a global rift
between a small sector enjoying great
privilege and a growing mass of people
who are suffering deprivation and misery
the internationalization of capital that
accelerated since 1971 breakdown on the
Bretton Woods system also gives a rather
new character to competition among
natural national states just to sight in
one indication the US share in world
exports of manufacturers declined about
three and a half percent from 1966 to
1984 but the youth but the share of
us-based Translational corporations
increased during this period and
international trade patterns reveal
quite a different picture
if imports from overseas subsidiaries
are counted as domestic production in
fact foreign affiliates increased their
share of total exports of manufacturers
by us-based firms from under 18 percent
in 1957 to 41 percent in 1984 there's a
1992 World Bank study that reports that
intra intra firm trade meaning centrally
managed trade inside a particular firm
within the largest 350 transnational
corporations contributed about 40% of
total trade those are the islands and
the alleged free trade see more than a
third of US trade is currently between
foreign affiliates and their us-based
parents that is internally managed trade
and current figures are surely higher
from these which in fact
from a decade ago as a social entity the
country and most of the population may
decline but the corporate empires are
playing quite a different game based on
the theological doctrine that the
Masters have the right to make
investment decisions unencumbered by the
concerns of their servants and the
workplace and the community and with
some somewhere around maybe a third of
world trade already conducted within
north based transnational corporations
these are factors of growing importance
as we look forward toward year 501 the
tendencies toward the new Imperial age
that are heralded by the international
financial press are obvious and
understandable along with the corollary
the extension of the north-south divide
to the inhabitants of the rich but there
are counter tendencies throughout the
north notably in the United States a
great deal has changed in the last 30
years at least in the cultural and moral
spheres if not at the institutional
level if the Quinn centennial of the old
world order had fallen in 1962 it would
have been celebrated once again as the
liberation of the hemisphere in 1992
that was impossible
just as no diplomatic historian today
could write about our task of felling
trees and Indians and get away with it
there's ample evidence also that
Washington is well aware of the domestic
constraints that virtually rule out
state violence traditional intervention
the ferment of the 1960's reached much
wider circles in the years that followed
it elicited new sensitivity through
racist and sexist oppression to concern
for the environment respect for other
cultures and human rights one of the
most striking examples is the third
world solidarity movements of the 1980s
with their very broad social base in
fact right through middle America in
this case and their unprecedented
agent in the lives and fate of the
victims that process of democratization
and concern for social justice could
have large significance
well these developments are perceived to
be dangerous and subversive by the
powerful and they're bitterly denounced
as we read every day in the press and
journals and that too is understandable
these developments do threaten the vile
maxim of the masters and they also offer
the only real hope for the great mass of
the people in the world even for the
survival of the human species in an era
of environmental and other global
problems that cannot be faced by
primitive social and cultural structures
that are driven by short-term material
gain and that regard human beings as
mere instruments not ends thank you
[Applause]
and lemons very kindly agreed to answer
these before just while you're thinking
of what theirs might be I have two
announcements one is that the Raymond
Williams Trust will be organizing next
spring around Easter time a seminar on
his work including a seminar where
themes connected with the nature of
imperialism in the current world and the
cultural distortions that that has
produced were in the theme of books of
his like the country in the city will be
taken up and developed if you're
interested in this could you please
write to Graham Martin professor at
Graham Martin at the arts faculty at the
Open University and you'll be sent
further details also if you're able to
make any contribution to the trust that
would be gratefully received and you
should send it to Professor Graham
Martin arts faculty the Open University
and just another thing that I might
observe is that I understand that Noam
Chomsky will be interviewed by John
Pilger on The Late Show the theme that's
right so I'm sure you're advertised has
been wetted by this tremendous discourse
so pointed so precise such an indictment
could I now ask four questions
that's the lectures on philosophy of
history his final work you know the
summation of his thought 1830 1831
industrial society where you can produce
very little you can produce great wealth
but with little of the population
productively employed a great part of
the population is productively employed
it's just employed in Papua New Guinea
and high repression areas the idea is to
show the effect of the there has been I
mean there's always been multinational
corporations you know of course but
there's been a very rapid acceleration
since the breakdown of the international
economic system in the early seventies
very rapid acceleration there other
factors that contributed to it too so
and that's what's indicated in some of
the statistics that I mentioned so you
now have internally managed trade in a
kind of corporate mercantilism as it's
sometimes called where the labor is
moved to high repression areas so that
you don't have to worry about those
pampered workers at home as the
Financial Times puts it and in fact this
is a it is a kind of if you I don't know
if post-industrial is the right term but
there is a shift of models I mean there
was a kind of a Ford Henry Ford style
model where the idea was you've got it
production was basically not the economy
was more or less national not totally of
course but more or less national and
that meant you had to have consumers to
keep profits up so for innovated the
idea of paying workers enough so that
they could buy something and that would
enable manufacturers to make profits I
think there's a shift away from that
towards production by workers who don't
have to
by anything because they're mostly
either in the third world or in the
third world that's coming back at home
in the United States and to a certain
extent in Britain where you can have
higher repression unorganized workers
who really are not and then if we can
organize because you kill the organizers
or something like that and if they try
you just bring in others will replace
them because a huge overflow as you
drive people off the land and so on
no they're never going to be consumers
so who are going to be the consumers
well in the internationalized economy
there are rich sectors everywhere fairly
substantial rich sectors and the
industrial societies and smaller but not
insubstantial rich sectors in the third
world so you know go to a typical
third-world country say Brazil after
this great I think you know success
story for capitalism and say 5% of the
population or what something like that
live at approximately the level of you
know Western European elites maybe
richer sometimes and you know 80 percent
live like you know Central Africa now in
a rich society like say the United
States the proportions will be different
of course but the structure is becoming
more or less the same and the idea is
that the poor people everywhere will be
the wealth producers and the rich people
everywhere will be the consumers and the
domestic societies the domestic the
countries will be essentially police
forces controlling their own populations
while the major decisions about the
world economy and world society are made
by the international corporations and
financial institutions and the de-facto
world government which is growing in a
quite natural way to reflect their
interests that's the new Imperial age of
the financial times the the decisions
are raised to the level of supranational
institutions where Parliament's can't
influence them and citizens don't know
about them
the problem with Parliament's is that
although they're more or less controlled
by the same interests they are to a
limited extent so
to the influence of the Ravel and you
want to eliminate that as you destroy
democracy totally which in fact has
always been the aim of a lead so I mean
there are kind of dreamy fantasies going
around about history with a capital H
converging to a liberal democratic order
I mean this isn't even fantasy
continuing Chinese occupation of Tibet
that's an atrocity but we ought to look
at its history in fact why does China
occupied the bed
well one reason is because in the 1920s
in the 1930s the Western imperial powers
insisted that China occupied to bed they
wanted China to dominate the surrounding
areas Tibet Manchuria and Mongolia
because it was assumed that China is in
our pocket it's one of the China has
been opened to Western exploitation ever
since the British opened it up in the
opium war forcing them to take British
lethal narcotics because there's nothing
else they wanted and ever since then
China has been a plaything for the West
and it was assumed in the 1930s that
that was going to continue so therefore
China ought to be as large as possible
to be a proper market and therefore the
West insisted on something which was by
no means natural namely that Manchuria
Mongolia and Tibet be incorporated
within China well later something
happened in China that the West didn't
like that much but they were stuck with
what they had the cheese butter yes it's
an atrocity
like most occupations
yeah I meant to yeah well at the end
very rapidly so much so that she almost
missed it
she thought she caught a note of
something positive and actually that's
extremely important I mean it the United
States and in fact much of the world is
completely different culturally and
morally than it was 30 years ago the
effects of the sixties revolutions were
enormous I mean you see them in every
imaginable respect and the rulers are
terrified of it I mean that's why you
have these Tantrums now in the press
about what they call political
correctness there's sort of right you
know there are a lot of people around
who don't believe in racist oppression
and in sexist oppression and who have
respect for other cultures and think
you'll to care about other people and
who are opposed to violent aggression
and who don't like sadism and terror I
mean all of these monsters are in fact
running around that wasn't a problem
thirty years ago they weren't running
around but now they're there so
naturally the commissar class is
becoming totally hysterical
that's they've tried very hard to get
rid of them and they can't I mean take
say the Vietnam War for the last thirty
years there's been unremitting
propaganda in the United States to
portray the Vietnam War in fact the
whole history as an atrocity by the
Vietnamese and suffering Americans I
gave a couple of samples but it's
uniform and if you sample the educated
classes everybody sees it like that you
go to the general population and they
are totally out of control there's
regular polls because business wants to
keep its finger on the public pulse so
you know how to propaganda and stuff the
latest on this issue nineteen ninety
seventy percent of the population 71
percent of the population regards the
war given a set of choices as not a
mistake but fundamentally wrong and
immoral among the educated sectors is
statistically undetectable such a
position
and that 70% of the population is people
who have never heard it expressed
everybody who answers that question must
think I'm the only person in the world
who thinks this because they certainly
never read it anywhere all they read is
it was a noble cause that went awry and
maybe Canon mistake and so on but nobody
believes it the population is just out
of control and it's the same on every
issue I mean when Anita Hill maid
brought her charges the whole thing
turned into a catastrophe but just
imagine what would have happened if
Anita Hill had brought those charges
forward 30 years ago I mean nobody even
bothered to laugh you know I mean yeah
sure that's what things they're supposed
to be like well now they could the
Senate tried to suppress it but they
couldn't you know leaked out and they
had to pretend to face it of course they
didn't but they had to pretend because
the population is like that and it's
like that on every issue in fact less
just the day of the opening of the
ground campaign in Iraq there was a leak
of a very interesting document it was
hidden but it was there and it was
interesting a Bush administration
planning document from the early days of
the Bush administration and here's what
it said it said in the case of
confrontation with much weaker enemies
meaning anybody that we're willing to
fight you obviously don't fight anybody
it's going to shoot it back if you want
what's called a military hero is
somebody who sits in an air-conditioned
- office somewhere shuffling around
papers while his troops murder people
who can't shoot back that's the
definition of a hero like Norman
Schwarzkopf from the British equivalent
his name I've forgotten the so in the
case of much weaker enemies it says we
must not only defeat them but defeat
them rapidly and decisively because
anything else will undercut political
support recognize to be completely thin
now you know there is a traditional
pattern of intervention goes way back
traditional intervention means you send
the Marines to occupy Haiti for 20 years
or to chase Sandino around in the hills
forever you know or you send like you do
like John F Kennedy did you send the US
Air Force to start to start bombing
South Vietnam the smithereens
that's traditional intervention it's not
even an option anymore
I mean the only options today are
clandestine warfare which is clandestine
means secret from the population at home
clandestine warfare is just a sign of
fear of the population it's not secret
from anybody else you know think about
what clandestine operations are they're
not secret to the victims you know the
not secret to the big network of states
around the world who are participating
in them
in fact the Aisne secret from the press
except they're low enough level thing
pretend not to know it they're secret
from the domestic population and you
only resort the inefficient clandestine
terror if more efficient direct terror
is not available that's why there was
such a sharp increase in Clinton and
complexity of clandestine terror during
the Reagan years they know the
population won't accept it so that's one
option and the other is rapid decisive
victories over much weaker enemies when
you're guaranteed that they're not going
to shoot back and those are the only
options the so-called war and ever and
the Gulf which was not a war of course a
war means you got two sides shooting at
each other the Gulf slaughterers we
ought to call it met those conditions
first you demonize the enemy and I
terrorized the American population then
you go in very fast destroy everybody
before I guarantee that no one will
shoot back and that you can get away
with but that's you know not nice for
the victims but it's a very sharp
narrowing of the options and this is
true of everything the Quinn Centennial
is a very dramatic example when they
were planning the Quinn Centennial they
were planning a celebration of
liberation it there was so much popular
protest they had to back off it then
became an encounter it was about as much
of an encounter as the encounter between
the Germans and the Jews and Europe in
the 1940s and plenty of the population
understands that too so the whole thing
just turned just collapsed couldn't do
anything you know well that's a sign of
cultural improvement it's even reached
the educated sectors went to a limited
extent so for example up until the 1960s
it's remarkable but true up until the
1960s even scholarship you know
anthropologists and
like that we're completely suppressing
the history of what happened in the
United States I mean it was possible for
a leading diplomatic historian to talk
about felling trees and Indians and
nobody batted an eyelash ok felling
trees and indeed you that now it's
impossible they had to start telling the
truth about what happened which is of
course mass genocide and it's not that
they found new evidence you know the
evidence was always around it was just
suppressed and it's coming out and
there's fair amount of understanding and
that's true of lots of other areas you
know that's really important those are
tremendous changes now they have no
institutional reflection you know that
the great genius of American and British
society has been to isolate individuals
enough to make people so isolated you
know but they can't do anything okay
they're all sitting there somewhere you
may have seen this the other day there
was a study of the European community
you know life patterns how long do
people sleep and all that kind of thing
and one of the one of the questions they
asked is how long people watch TV
Britain broke the record you know ninety
percent of the population I think it was
four and a half hours a day of TV
watching well that's the perfect way to
isolate people you can have complete
freedom you know everything all
democratic rights absolutely perfect as
long as every person is glued to the
tube you know so you can't talk to
anybody and you can't get together and
you can't pull your resources and you
may have your own crazy ideas in your
head you know like in your own head you
think yeah yeah they're getting on war
with an atrocity but as long as that
happens you can have democratic forms
and that's what's being achieved in the
advanced industrial societies that's
what's being called the triumph of
liberal democracy but you know it
doesn't have to be like that
I mean unions and other popular
organizations were created in the past
under much more violent or oppressive
conditions than exist today with a lot
of struggle and it can be done again and
you don't have to have the vile maxim of
the masters that Adam Smith's deplore
not necessary you can go after the core
issue which classical liberalism also
deplore namely wage labor which was
regarded as atrocity by classical
liberals in the 18th century if you look
back yeah you can go after that too this
is another form of oppression and
autocracy there are lots of
possibilities if this if these
broadly-based popular movements can
manage to overcome the fact that they
don't have resources and that they are
scattered and that they're isolated and
they're very little ways of
communicating with one another and so on
sure it can happen
yeah
so so in other words without the prop of
Fanta communism which has been the basis
for the propaganda system for actually
70 years how can paper I think you
mentioned the independent but in fact
any paper continued to localize the
atrocities on some particular enemy okay
well you know the same way they did
before 1917 there actually was a history
before 1917 now if you look back it was
the same you know I mean nothing
happened during the Cold War except in
the pre days I mean new methods of
mobilizing people say take the United
States which I know better than England
so I'll take the United States when
Woodrow Wilson sent the Marines to
occupy Haiti and the Dominican Republic
which was no joke incidentally you know
they massacred people they reinstated
slavery as I mentioned they throughout
the constitutional system and places
then sold the country off to American
plantations it is yet to escape that's
the reason why Haiti and the Dominican
Republic are still horror chambers the
pretty rich countries when he did that
there were no were no Bolsheviks around
it was 1915 and 1916 so he was defending
the u.s. from the Huns before that the
the US Navy was defending the United
States from Chile believe it or not in
the 1990s 1890s before before that it
was mainly defending him from England
and the way if you want to understand
how these things work you ought to look
at the US record on England was despised
you know it was regarded as much worse
than the treatment of Russia this goes
way back to the late 18th century the
idea expressed by the founding fathers
John Adams and others was that England
will always be our enemy until we are
her master the takeover of Texas when
the u.s. took Texas and the under the
Jacksonian Democrats the major motive
was to try to monopolize cotton cotton
was there in those days like oil is
today
you know is the main commodity in world
trade and it's what got the Industrial
it was the main factor in the Industrial
Revolution so the idea was that if the
United States could control Britain was
very strong then you know like the
British fleet was a deterrent u.s.
couldn't conquer Cuba you know it
couldn't invade Canada all these things
that wanted to do because the British
power was too great the idea was that if
the US could monopolize the production
of cotton which they figured they could
do if they took Texas we can not only
bring England to our feet but we can
bring the entire world to our feet you
know I mean the the worst charges
against saddam hussein were in fact real
about the Jacksonian democrats in the
1840s if you look back and it was mainly
england that was the enemy that we had
to defend ourselves again actually this
led to some more comical examples too if
you like Thomas Jefferson back around
1785 was trying to figure out in the
state 7 1790 and so on was trying to
figure out what it was that made the
English character so in susceptible the
civilization as he put it and he decided
the problem he was scientists you know
so he decided that the problem was
probably that the English ate too much
animal food and he therefore concluded
that maybe the solution would be in
their kitchens not in their churches as
he put it and in fact couple years later
he strongly supported the French he was
hoping French would conquer England
presumably assuming that would improve
the cuisine as well as and and it just
goes on from there you know so
written was true was the enemy which
inspired even more hatred probably than
then Russia and today is only this was
reciprocated except in the case of the
British attitude toward the United
States it was contempt rather than you
know fear so for existing if you one
example and it's around 1870 or so some
benefactress benefactor offered
Cambridge University a bequest for a
lectureship in American Studies which is
kind of like if somebody offered them a
bequest and you know I don't know I
can't even think of an example so absurd
nobody could imagine why you should
study it is but he offered them a
bequest in American Studies and the idea
was that every other year a they should
get a Harvard professor over to talk
about you know this colonial culture
over there and there's big debate about
it in Cambridge they finally voted it
down and the fear was that if they
brought a professor from Harvard he kind
of read this to believe that he would
stir up subversion among the the
undergraduates and in fact one of the
Don's one of my favorite lines how did
he put it he said if we do this there's
going to be a biennial flash of
transatlantic darkness
and they weren't gonna have to take any
chances with this so they turned it down
so they you know the problem with both
ways but it's never hard to conjure up
enemies you know I mean you go back to
the Declaration of Independence which is
one of the most disgraceful documents on
record the u.s. the founding fathers
were describing how they were defending
themselves against the merciless Indian
savages whose known way of warfare is
the massacre women and children
okay maybe by the 1950s people had
forgotten that but they knew the truth
they knew that it was the merciless
European savages who had to teach the
native people the the European Way of
warfare namely he wait till men leave
the village and then you go in and you
slaughter the women and the children
they knew it because they were doing it
what they could say it anyway and in
fact we've been able to read it for 200
years without batting an eyelash over it
so you know conjuring up enemies is a
job that the commissaries are very good
at it's something that also naturally
grows over into a critical vigilant
stance against the arrogance of power
and against the corruption of all the
channels of communication discussion and
public debate which is such a ominous
feature of public life not only in
Britain but also in the United States
Raymond Williams of course himself put
forward bold proposals for democratizing
the media not by enlarging the power of
the state but by empowering people from
below and by empowering communicators
and releasing them from the tutelage of
commercial interests and of the
interests of power holders I think
Raymond Williams saw this is a
particularly key area because he felt
that democracy itself democratic
was in danger of atrophy in its formal
bodies in Parliament in Congress and and
other such institutions and that's why
he put such great emphasis on the need
for a democratic revitalization of the
means of communication and that's why he
himself also participated as a public
intellectual a responsible intellectual
speaking out on the great issues of the
day well it need hardly be said that
Noam Chomsky has been doing that and
doing that for more than three decades
many of us remember his tremendous
essays at the time of the Vietnam War
and the huge role he played in gradually
awakening a critical spirit even in the
most unlikely places in the United
States in the late 60s the middle and
late 60s in subsequent decades and
including on occasions when the going
was even more difficult Noam has been a
vigilant eye and a strong voice against
oppression injustice above all the
oppression and injustice supported by
his own government or the government
that is to save the United States and by
the West more generally in Nicaragua and
perhaps one should mention most recently
and memorably for all of us the occasion
two years ago when the governments of
the United States and Britain Unleashed
the gulf war now in Britain as in the
United Steel will be the fourth Raymond
Williams Memorial Lecture the trust
which is organized four of these
memorial lectures invites someone who
they feel is working in the spirit of
Raymond Williams or
whose work he would have wished to see
encouraged and honored and so far we've
had four of the annual lectures and also
in the spirit of Raymond Williams
we've organized some outside London they
in fact they have been three outside
London and four of the annual lectures
here in London itself previous give us
of the Memorial Lecture have been Edward
Sayid Gwyn Alf Williams Marina Warner
and outside London Umberto Eco Terry
Eagleton and Stuart Hall who given
lectures in Glasgow
kela and Cardiff well this evening it's
our very great pleasure and honor to
introduce Noam Chomsky to give this
forth memorial lecture and I would just
like to say a little bit
not because Noam Chomsky needs any
introduction but because we do feel that
he is extraordinarily well placed to
give this memorial lecture and we do
feel that in inviting him to do so we
are encouraging precisely the type of
for ages public intervention of which
Raymond Williams so warmly approved and
which he himself also undertook I think
I should say to begin with that we also
perhaps felt that there was even some
affinity in the work of Raymond Williams
and Noam Chomsky even though it it is in
different fields and I suppose it would
be this that in the work of both of
these great scholars one does see a
commitment to the extraordinary
potential that lies in ordinary people
and one can see that this can give rise
Ivor to great work of culture criticism
or in the case of professor Chomsky to
his innovative a revolutionary work in
the field of linguistics but this
commitment to the potential of ordinary
PDS were just passing through a period
where through a chapter of accidents
through events entirely outside the
control of the government a court case
has gone wrong and apparently it's
discovered to great amazement that the
British government was covertly breaking
its own supposed in bargain on the
dictator Saddam Hussein against whom it
launched that ferocious attack and of
course at the time it was arming Saddam
Hussein it was perfectly well known that
he'd been gassing Kurds oppressing
oppositionists inside his own country I
think many of you may remember Noam
Chomsky's splendid essay that was
printed in our--in in The Guardian in
the run-up to the Gulf War which exposed
this and many other hypocrisy long
before we've had the confirmation which
has so lately arrived well I don't wish
to say any more by way of introduction I
know that Noam Chomsky is speaking
tonight on the year 501 I think this is
a reference to the first year after the
500th centenary of Christopher Columbus
which has been marked by many of us as
an event which shows the dark side of
the spread of the westerlies global
power and influence and which also
requires of us a critical spirit well
I'm also pleased to say that Noam
Chomsky's book deterring democracy is
now available in paperback and I think
even some copies can be purchased at the
door
I think that the title of the lecture he
has chosen this evening is linked to the
theme of his next book so without
further ado I would like to introduce
professor Noam Chomsky
actually I was going to talk about the
500 first year of modern philosophy but
I guess I better shift the the year 1992
poses a critical moral and cultural
challenge for the more privileged
sectors of the world dominant societies
as of course as Robin mentioned we enter
year 501 of the European conquest of the
world and how that challenge is
addressed I think is likely to have
quite faithful consequences in recent
years the subjugation of the South as
it's now euphemistically called
the subjugation of the south has
intensified the gap between the rich and
the poor has doubled since 1960 this is
largely a consequence of the neoliberal
policies that are imposed have been
imposed on the traditional colonies
while 20 out of 24 industrial countries
are more protectionist today than they
were a decade ago the World Bank has
recently estimated that the
protectionist measures of the industrial
countries which are keeping pace with
their free-market bombast reduced the
net the national income of the south by
twice the amount of official so-called
development assistance which is itself a
form of export promotion the South
Commission may call for a new world
order as they called it that will
respond quoting to the South's plea for
justice equity and democracy in the
global society but that plea is sure to
remain unanswered short of major changes
where powers where power lies what will
be heard and has been heard is the
vision of the New World Order of George
Bush who borrowed the same phrase a few
months later as part of the rhetorical
cover for the u.s. British war
Golf this is the new Imperial age as the
Financial Times recently called it with
a global system paraphrasing the
Financial Times a global system
orchestrated by the group of seven the
IMF the World Bank the GATT and their
corporate and financial constituencies a
major feature of the euro that we are
now entering now by the term Europe when
I speak of Europe's conquest of the
world I of course mean to include the
English settled colonies one of which
now leads the crusade and also the
Japanese borrow here
South African usage and describe the
Japanese is honorary whites
rich enough to almost qualify at least
Japan was one of the few parts of the
South that joined the core with core
industrial societies with some of its
former colonies in its wake having been
able to avoid the doctrines that are
applied to ensure the subordination of
the traditional colonies which are
sometimes called free trade or
structural adjustment or our noble
ideals from which we of course are
exempt and always have been Adam Smith
took the discovery of America and that
of a passage to the East Indies
according to me the two greatest and
most important events recorded in the
history of mankind which certainly made
a most essential contribution to the
state of Europe opening up a new and
inexhaustible market that led to vast
expansion of productive powers and real
revenue and wealth oil quoting in theory
he said the new set of exchanges should
naturally have proved as advantageous to
the new as it certainly did to the old
continent but that was not to be the
savage injustice of the Europeans
rendered an event which ought to have
been beneficial to all ruinous and
destructive to the conquered people who
suffered dreadful misfortunes
Smith wrote he revealing himself to be
an early practitioner of the crime of
political correctness to borrow some of
the terminology of contemporary cultural
management he went on to point out that
their superiority of force enabled the
Europeans to commit with impunity every
sort of injustice one case that he found
particularly appalling was Bengal a rich
and fertile country with advanced
manufacturing when the British arrived
already devastated by Smith's day in
1776 hundreds of thousands died of
famine in a single year he wrote because
of the conditions imposed by the
conquerors which turned earth into a
famine while officials of the Honourable
company plow up a rich field of rice or
other grain in order to make room for a
plantation of poppies for the opium
trade which was one prime source of the
huge profits that stimulated the first
Industrial Revolution along with the
lucrative slave trade and robbery of the
colonies generally these Smith's
conclusions that 100 years ago are quite
well supported by contemporary
scholarship Europeans fought the kill
and they had they had the means to
satisfy their bloodlust in the American
colonies the natives were astonished by
the savagery of the Spanish and
particularly the British meanwhile on
the other side of the world the peoples
of Indonesia were equally appalled by
the all destructive fury of European
warfare quoting all this from a
contemporary military historian Geoffrey
Parker Europeans regarded all the
conquests as small Wars he comments its
nomination of the world relied
critically upon the constant use of
force it was thanks to their military
superiority rather than to any social
moral or natural advantage that the
white people's of the world managed to
create and control however briefly the
first global hegemony in history those
