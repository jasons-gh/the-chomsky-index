if you were president today what would
you do right now president of the United
States well if I were if I had made it
to the presidency meaning with the kind
of constituency and support that's
required to be a president in the united
states i'd probably do what Obama's
doing but what ought to be done is what
Eragon is doing there is the turkey is
becoming the most significant country in
the region and its recognized Aragon's
far and away the most popular figure and
they've taken a pretty constructive role
on many issues and in this case he is
the one leading public figure leader who
has been frank outspoken clear and says
Mubarak must go now now is when we must
have changed that's the right stand
nothing like that in Europe and nothing
like that here and what do you think of
the role of the US corporations we spoke
to Bill Hartung who wrote this book
profits of power prop8 GTS about
Lockheed Martin the overwhelming amount
of money the billions that have gone to
Egypt haven't really gone to Egypt
they've gone to us weapons manufacturers
like General Dynamics like Lockheed
Martin like Boeing etc in fact Boeing
owns Norris which is the digital
technology that's involved with
surveillance of the cell phone of the
internet system they are where they can
find dissident voices for the Egyptian
regime and who knows what they will do
with those voices just among others but
these corporations that have made such a
killing off the repression where are
they standing right now in terms of US
policy well they don't is who press
releases so we have to speculate but
it's pretty obvious that they have a
major stake in the dictatorships not
just Egypt so for example a couple of
months ago Obama announced the biggest
military sale and history to Saudi
Arabia
60 billion dollars worth of jet planes
helicopters armored vehicles and so on
and so forth the pretext is we have to
defend Saudi Arabia against Iran
remember that among the population if
anyone cares about them ten percent
Regardie ran as a threat and a majority
think the reason be better off if Iran
had nuclear weapons but we have to
defend them against Iran by sending them
military equipment which would do them
absolutely no good in any confrontation
with Iran but it does a lot of good for
the American the military industrial
complex that Eisenhower was referring to
in that clip you ran a while back so yes
William heartens quite right about this
in fact a part of the reason why there's
such strong support for Israel in in the
military lobby in the militant
military-industrial lobby in the United
States is that the massive arms
transfers to Israel which whatever
they're called end up centrally being
gift of they go from the US the pocket
of the US taxpayer into the pocket of
military industry but there's also a
secondary effect which is well
understood there are kind of a teaser
when the u.s. sends f30 of the most
advanced jet aircraft of the revised
Israel then Saudi Arabia says well we
want a hundred times as much second-rate
equipment which is a huge bonanza for
military industry and also recycles
Petro dollars which is an important a
necessity for the US economy so these
things are quite closely tied together
and it's not just military industry
construction project development that
telecommunications
in the case of Israel high tech industry
so Intel Corporation the major the
world's major chip producer is has
announced a new generation of chips
which they hope will be the next
generation of chips and they're they're
building their main Factory in Israel
just announced an expansion of it the
relations are very close and intimate
all the way through again in the Arab
world certainly not among the people but
we have the washer principle as long as
they are quiet who cares we can
disregard them and the significance of
Mubarak in the Israel you know Israel
Palestine Egypt axis I mean going back
to nineteen seventy nine if you could
briefly remind people why he's so
important as the media keeps saying he
has meant peace and stability with
Israel he gives the US access to their
airspace he guarantees access to the
Suez Canal talk about that and what the
change would mean we the we should
actually go back a little further in
1971 the president Sadat of Egypt
offered Israel of full peace treaty in
return for withdrawal from the occupied
territories he cared about the Sinai not
but Israel considered it rejected it
Henry Kissinger's national security
adviser supported the rejection State
Department then supported Sadat and
Israel it was a fateful decision that's
the point at which Israel quite
explicitly chose expansion over security
they were then expanding into the Sinai
planning to build a city of a million
people the Egyptian Sinai settlements
driving farmers out into the desert and
so on well that was the background for
the 1973 war which made it clear that
Egypt can't simply be dismissed then we
move on to the negotiations which
led in 1979 to the US and Israel pretty
much accepting Sadat's offer of 1971
with her all from the Sinai in return
for a peace treaty that's called a great
diplomatic triumph in fact it was a
diplomatic catastrophe a failure to
accept it in 1971 led to a very
dangerous war suffering brutality and so
on and finally the US and Israel
essentially more or less accepted now as
soon as that settlement was made 1979
Israeli strategic analysts the main one
was a venerian Eve but others to
recognize right away that now that Egypt
is excluded from the confrontation
Israel is free to use force in other
areas and indeed it is very soon after
that attacked Lebanon didn't have to
worry about any Gyptian deterrent that
was gone so we can attack Lebanon and
that was a brutal vicious attack killed
the 15 20 thousand people that finally
to the 720 massacre destroyed what's
most of southern Lebanon and the not no
defensive rationale in fact it wasn't
even pretended it was an effort to as it
was said it was a war for the West Bank
it was an effort to block embarrassing
Palestinian negotiation diplomatic
offers and move forward on integrating
the occupied territories well they were
free to do that once the Egyptian
deterrent was gone and that continues
neutral Egypt is the major Arab state
the biggest military force by far and
neutralizing Egypt does free Israel and
when I say Israel I mean the United
States and Israel because they work in
tandem freeze them to
carry out the crimes of the occupation
tax on Lebanon the five invasions
already there might be another one and
Egypt is not does not interfere
furthermore Egypt cooperates in the
crushing of Gaza that terrible free
election in January 2006 not only
frightened the US and Israel in like the
outcome so turned instantly to punishing
the Palestinians but the same in Egypt
the victor in the election was Hamas
which is an offshoot of the Muslim
Brotherhood the very much feared by the
Egyptian dictatorship because if they
ever allowed anything like a free
election the Muslim Brotherhood would
obviously make out quite well maybe not
a majority but it would be a substantial
political force and they don't want that
so therefore they cooperate Egypt under
Mubarak that cooperates with Israel and
crushing Lebanon built a huge fence on
the Egyptian a border with us
engineering help and it's a sort of
monitors the flow of goods in and out of
Gaza on the Egyptian side it essentially
completes the siege that the US and
Israel have imposed well all of that
could erode if there was a democratic
movement that gained influence in Egypt
just as it did in Palestine I should
mention that there's one other semi
democratic election in the Arab world
regularly that's in Lebanon Lebanon is a
complex story it's a confessional
democracy so the Shiite population which
is the largest of the sex is
significantly underrepresented under the
confessional system never
less the elections are not just state
elections under dictatorships and they
have outcomes to which are suppressed
here so for example in the last election
the majority of the popular majority was
the Hezbollah led coalition they were
the popular majority in the last
election I think about fifty three
percent well that's not the way it was
described here if you read say Thomas
Friedman he he wrote a note about the
election about he he was practically
shedding tears of joy at free elections
in which Obama won over omada nejad well
you know what he meant is that in the
representation under the confessional
system which under a series under
represents a Shiite population of the
pro us coalition won the most seats that
again reflects the standard contempt for
democracy all we care we don't care that
the majority of the population went the
other way as long as they're quiet and
passive and interestingly Hezbollah
quietly accepted the outcome did protest
about it at a time but since then their
power has increased and now there's a
serious threat and Lebanon which we
should not overlook
