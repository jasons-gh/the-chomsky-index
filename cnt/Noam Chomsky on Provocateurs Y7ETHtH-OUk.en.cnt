it's pretty routine so for example
60s in the anti-war movement every group
that it wasn't really or you know a lot
of separate groups all over the place
but they all had learn some lesson one
lesson that they had to learn pretty
quickly is that if there's somebody in
the group who's dressed like a Hollywood
version of a hippie you know and who's
shouting off the cops or let's break
some windows or whatever you're very
likely to see him in court testifying
for the police because that's their job
you know try to turn activism to
something that will alienate the public
and you know break the law and give you
grounds for refreshing so they're all
over I mean I was involved with groups
that were dealing with resistance so
young deserters and people like that but
we quickly learned that if there's
something really sensitive we can't do
it in a group we have to do an affinity
groups if somebody's life is at stake
you know because this chances are
there's somebody around is an informant
and you know that's what police do that
you can tell by taking a look at the FBI
cases they've just been coming up with
the terrorism cases and almost all
entrapment you know somebody joins gets
in contact with a bunch of guys who kind
of loose ends don't know what they're
doing and confused and suggest something
to them offer them some money pretty
soon they're trying to have stuff a fake
bombs i'm wearing the arrests in almost
to jail
