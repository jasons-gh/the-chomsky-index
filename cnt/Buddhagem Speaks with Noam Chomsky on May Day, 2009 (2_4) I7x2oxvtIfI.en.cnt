I mean these efforts were terminated by
the war when there were other concerns
are during the word that was massive
labor organizing they were picked up
again in the late 40s and by the 1950s
just massive campaigns were launched to
the scale it's incredible it's pretty
good scholarship on it to take over
everything you know captive audiences
and factories sports leagues churches
schools or textbooks and schools that
cinema anything that can be reached was
press of course to vilify unions and
union leaders particularly at all
corrupt you know thugs disrupting our
harmony harmony and so on and so forth
and it's not without a fact it it's it's
a major factor in the decline of unions
and destroying unions is extremely
important because that means they're one
of the few ways in which ordinary people
can get together not only to try to
achieve normal rights don't like decent
working conditions wages and so on but
also just to participate in a democratic
process if people are isolated they are
victims there's very little that they
could do to implement their own ideas or
know what their ideas are you work these
things out with other people you
organize to push them forward and so on
and one of the results is a sharp
decline in industrial unions but also
sharp decline and democracy so our
current form of democracy is one of
passivity every four years doing polls
and push a button and you go home your
opinions have almost nothing to do with
policy that's a huge gap between
attitudes and policy and that's the way
it's supposed to be
striking illustration of the propaganda
was aimed at two things really primarily
unions they're terrible because they're
a democratizing force and they help
working people but also just it was also
aimed at democracy you're supposed to
hate the government actually the
business world has an ambivalent
attitude towards government so kind of a
love-hate relationship they want the
government to very strong and powerful
but working for them but they want
everyone to hate it if it works for that
so you can see that pretty dramatically
on april fifteenth let's say April
fifteenth when you pay our taxes the
attitude that's instilled in people is
you know it's kind of like a day of
mourning they those outsiders are
stealing your hard-earned money and
you're forced to give it to them because
nothing you can do about it it's
coercion from an egg and force not
suppose we lived in a democracy the
attitude be the opposite in a democratic
society people would be cheering on
april fifteenth they say you know here's
the day when we all jointly contribute
to carrying out the policies that we
decided on well that's democracy the
idea here is to turn the culture on to
keep the free institution so they say
sort of free but ensure that the
cultures tutela tarian that is that you
know the government is some outside
force you got to protect yourself
against maybe have guns in your backyard
to protect yourself if they come and get
your try to keep them from stealing your
taxes or something and that's in still
very intensively by verily with a huge
industry of control of thoughts and
attitudes public relations industry and
these are its prime objectives you can
see the word actually sometimes pretty
dramatic so it takes a Obama he wanted
to make it a gesture to show his love
for working people so he went to a
factory in
Illinois Peoria to give a talk to
workers at a plant well his choice of a
plant was interested he went to the
caterpillar plant now that was over the
objections of church and human right
groups who are proposing objecting to
the role of caterpillar in violence
conquest and destruction as in the
Occupy israeli-occupied territories it's
interesting that there was no protest
from the work from from the labor
movement and it's striking because
caterpillar was the first industrial
organization to in generations to
destroy a strike by bringing in scabs
that's pretty serious this is I think
1988 it's during the Reagan general
Reagan attack on the labor movement
which was severe hated workers and tried
to destroy them but of course of that
caterpillar became the first industrial
organization to follow the Reagan
injunction to bring in strike breakers
to brick strikes at that time the United
States was alone in the industrial world
in permitting this not totally alone
South Africa didn't permit it either
double years later South Africa joined
the world so the US remains alone now in
the industrial world in permitting these
techniques that wasn't even brought up
in fact I don't think it was even later
historians weren't aware as they know
from the discussion because it's you
know the actual history has just been
wiped out of people's minds probably
Obama and his advisers didn't know
that's not so long ago it's not ancient
history and this is part of the
destruction of the labor movement in the
Reagan years carried out very overtly I
mean Reagan basically informed employers
that the government's not going to but
not going to implement the laws and in
fact business week later reported that
firing of workers for illegal firing of
work
for attempting to organize I think
triple during the Reagan years Clinton
added his own version of that it was
called NAFTA NAFTA provided one of the
main predicted and in fact in actual
effects of NAFTA was to provide
employers with a method for illegally
preventing organizing so if workers want
to organize in some plant the owners
could run a meeting or put up a sign
saying Mexico transfer job or something
meaning if you try to organize this
plant we're going to Mexico that's
illegal but if you have a outlaw state
than our what's illegal so in fact a
disruption of organizing efforts by
illegal means I think increased it for a
wide maybe fifty percent or so under
Clinton partly by this method and it
continues I mean right now they're Obama
part of his platform was to permit
so-called card check the employee Free
Choice Act which would give workers an
opportunity to join unions by will if
they wanted without employer coercion as
a huge propaganda attack on that you
know walks democracy and so on we can
forget that but the relevant point is
it's it's declined and the snore geek
can find it in the agenda anymore
somewhere hidden someone because it's
part of a long tradition that's pretty
natural in a business run society and
this is very much a business or in
society more than others too I don't try
to make sure that people remain atomized
to isolate it not organized and hence
essentially under control even with
freedom no formal freedom but it is a
very unusual labor history in the
industrial world and that I suppose
relates to the fact that there are not
the kind of organized protests know
to the extent the door in Europe at
least against the impact of the affinity
crisis that was created by the financial
institutions it's not it's worth
remembering it's not just the financial
institutions I mean there's a for
American workers that's crisis in the
core economy manufacturing industries as
well but the dramatic crisis right now
is financial institutions they
essentially created it now they're being
called upon to fix it up meaning
returning to what it was before but you
know that's a large theme of American
history
