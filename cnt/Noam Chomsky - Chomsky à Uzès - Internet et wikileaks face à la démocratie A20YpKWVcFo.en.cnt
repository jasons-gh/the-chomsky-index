the pill Cassie Cassie well the Internet
of course makes a huge amount of
information available cousin telnet a
beautiful mess from society signals
however having a lot of information
available is not necessarily very useful
yeah what who's the phone has shown
excessive zippity zappity suppose some
young person asks says I want to become
a biologist you must know that I don't
keep the vm euros you can tell I'm go to
the Harvard University biology library
and everything after knows there
hopefully the idea sewa to see a piece
or let's go see a time for me to approve
lessons easy stuff that doesn't do any
good at all may is good what they did a
lot of goodies if you approach a massive
information you have to have a framework
of understanding that he was ever
gathered the compulsion remote Akeldama
pals for see all the damage you have to
know what you're looking for search it
out and disregard the things don't
matter and think about the things to do
matter if you have a cushy cancel a show
that popped onto a TV ad steve adubato
and when you approach the internet it's
the same story your deluge with it's
even worse because if you go to the
biology library at least most of us
there is true no
it's a gamble Saltalamacchia let's go oh
my god you go text messages one of the
original secret too many communities
beliefs or a pay week no cash
alternative over shortly synthetic the
internet is very valuable anyone who
wants to cherish research going to use
it you have to know what you're doing so
that a team again what does not have
that meatloaf levels about como on
youjizz attended WikiLeaks is also
useful but of limited use meat eaters of
digital modality the junior TT dt
WikiLeaks is informing us of what the
diplomats say to the Home Office the
mechanisms fo sho sovel diplomat death
valley national holiday eternally damned
again cayman in the Diplomatic Service
or any serious journalist or historian
can tell you and you can easily find the
diplomats very commonly tell their
superiors what they know they want to
hear no que decia italico a deputy pub
at t0 scuba suit area subaru ship area
walking on top that's the way you move
up in a bureaucracy Canseco polygonal
that are logically there's some rather
striking it
for people who call the truth and hey
that paper boss yeah exactly haha yeah
yep yep utility couple of the first
sample is not a former ambassador in
Britain Craig Murray is this man pretty
oriental visited India waving courageous
honest man kwazulu head he was posted to
spec Assad which is one of the most Carl
monsters dictatorship anywhere he'd help
us to all news baby stone and if he kept
putting did he touch something yet he
insisted on throwing the British Foreign
Office what was going on there dr. death
and he prevented any capable yes he stay
for the other signal t88 a month me
Stanley that he did so he was telling
the British Foreign Office that their
favorite dictator was boiling his
opponents to death in water area
torturing every imaginable criminal
activity yeah did he did this he didn't
mind that man yelled let heat that
Rebecca 18 is what was all that talk to
my dad it today that's not the story
they wanted to hear I know pass it on
each other and he decided homeopathy on
top so he was thrown out of the planet
surface yes it is happy people
and that's nevertheless there is
interesting information that's coming
out maple Talia is fo national data self
key self is hitting on defense it's not
at all like the Pentagon Papers the
antibiotic a document about Python the
Pentagon Papers were like capturing the
archives of a conquered country Leah
docomo dramatic voted to be able t
bikini tempo LCC a Vienna took people
sure that won't get the B it's a very
revealing inquiry into 25 years of
high-level planning and discussion the
city only don't get paid a bit his her
van sank a needed to pass for me again
and I think that's the reason why the
media and in fact most the scholarship
has pretty much avoided they say I don't
like a day early David yeah I'll go and
fetch okuma body DeLuca monument a good
good idea people except for the
superficial works I gotta get ready
assoc deficit could give you some
examples of you like actually but I was
assisting then Ellsberg and distributing
it so I had it in advance yeah
the DC beata people t delta p to the p
models lady you got apples so i was able
to write about it extensively right away
is a immediately added is it looking
awful sweet but the parts i wrote work
I'm never mentioned in the media
accounts of the medigun Damien's koj
Canada media Monsieur de Monte but that
wouldn't it yeah they filtered out into
the better parts of scholarship but only
worse they're real skewer to say did he
play any point say forget the on your bb
body maybe I'm a benefic that means here
actually I just to go back to WikiLeaks
one of the notes to my mind the
interesting revelations from WikiLeaks
was not about the Diplomatic Service
what was about Western intellectual
culture ave po mafia representatives
from the bikini today on diplomatic save
us quesadillas decade any romantic the
visit at uni may proofs sue so
definitely appeal to him the link that
most of the publicity no headlines
they're so conditional you for a
commentary and so on even Tabitha week
was the revelation that the Arabs
support Western policy on Iran this is
Suzuki a voce the food hahahaha at a
boutique Amy again at a meeting held a
little yellow in fact what was reported
was that the Arab dictators support
Western policy fiscally the authenticity
this weekend deep data about ella tiene
que le gallo what was not reported is
that the population
overwhelmingly of Moses it solo tiene de
alabanza the local dish ambassador
professional lpt canada erica Hill and
the excitement and enthusiasm which with
this was greeted is a dramatic
illustration of the utter hatred of
democracy on the part of Western
educated opinion y el gato topological
27 years old away previous to that end
portal to a democracy the pub is a heat
oxy not that the ideas as long as the
people are under control no matter what
they think we just care about the decade
Tom Kelly population a ps2 controller or
deposit want is a SI hasta mas amo
others just as the meid together and
that's the kind of reason why democratic
uprising says in South America now in
the Arab world or so frightening to
western power is equal circular
evolution democratica focuses wanna be
issued on Madonna so see if they don't
