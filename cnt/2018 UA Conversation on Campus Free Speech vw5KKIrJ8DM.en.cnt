white and associate dean Kathy Adams
Reister congratulations
I'm not last I am indebted to the
fantastic work of a DSPs staff and
development and technique and
communications and community engagement
for all their work and putting this
event together the topic of free speech
on campus has received renewed attention
in recent years due to the hostile
reception and occasional dis invitations
of controversial speakers on college
campuses tonight's panelists will
discuss the boundaries of free speech
both on and off campus and in the
process address the tensions between
adhering to the legal guidelines of free
speech and promoting a non-hostile
campus learning environment the topic is
more timely than ever in Arizona where
in April of this year our governor
signed HB 256 3 which directs the three
state institutions and community
colleges to create free expression
policies that quote ensure the fullest
degree of intellectual freedom with
tonight's discussion the University of
Arizona demonstrates early leadership on
the thoughtful discussions necessary to
implement this directive and tonight's
panelists include some of the most
prominent voices in the country on the
topic of free speech seagal been porous
is a professor of education political
science and philosophy at the University
of Pennsylvania where she also chairs
the University's Committee on open
expression her most recent book is
titled free speech on campus in it she
offers strategies to deescalate tensions
and negotiate debates surrounding
trigger warnings safe spaces and speech
that verges on hate her nuanced approach
is called inclusive freedom which aims
to protect free speech while taking into
account the necessity of making sure
that
all are included in the ensuing
conversation the book includes a
discussion and analysis of the many
recent and well-publicized instances of
free speech controversies on US campuses
and it should be of particular interest
to faculty administrators and student
groups assembled here tonight nadine
strossen was the first woman and
youngest president of the American Civil
Liberties Union which she led from 1991
to 2008 she is currently the John
Marshall Harlan the second professor of
New York at New York law school a
frequent speaker on constitutional and
civil liberties issues her media
appearances includes 60 minutes today
Good Morning America and The Daily Show
she has been speaking and writing about
free speech since the 1990s 1977 court
decision involving Skokie Illinois her
2018 book hate why we should resist it
with free speech not censoring is an
in-depth analysis of prohibitions
against hate speech with many
international examples that provide
contrast to US law she argues quote that
the very concept of hate speech is
irreducibly riddled with ambiguity
conflicts and confusion and concludes
quote that benefits will come to flow
from increasingly vigorous sophisticated
counter speech and other non sensorial
countermeasures such as education Noam
Chomsky laureate professor of
linguistics and the Agnes nomes Harry
chair is an uncompromising free speech
advocate a stance that has often
outraged presumptive allies on the left
and subjected him to both personal and
professional risk
Chomsky's view is encapsulated by his
claim that quote if we don't believe in
freedom of expression for people we
despise we don't believe in it at all
the founder of modern linguistics whose
contributions have influenced many
fields from computer science and
psychology
mathematics Noam Chomsky is one of the
most cited scholars in history and we
are proud that he has chosen the
University of Arizona as his academic
home
tonight's panel will be moderated by
famed First Amendment attorney Bob Korn
Revere a partner at the law firm
Davis Wright Tremaine Korn Revere
specializes in freedom of expression and
communications law and is the president
of the First Amendment Lawyers
Association and an adjunct professor at
the Cato Institute he represents
students and faculty members as lead
counsel for the stand up for free speech
litigation project of the foundation for
individual rights in education in
numerous cases he has successfully
represented university students battling
censorship on campus including the
unconstitutional enforcement of free
speech zones I might add as a historical
footnote then in 1967 former congressman
Ron Barber at the time a student at the
U of A and president of the Young
Democrats pressure the director of the
student union to provide a free speech
zone on campus so that the group could
protest the Vietnam War such zones were
made illegal in 2016 on Arizona campuses
so now free speech is permitted
everywhere Bob will open the panel with
a brief overview of the campus issues
but before that commences I've asked
Trevor Tim co-founder and the executive
director of the freedom of the Press
Association foundation to provide some
context for our discussion specifically
regarding the First Amendment from the
viewpoint of a self-described millennial
tim is a journalist activist and lawyer
who writes regularly for the intercept
as well as the New York Times The
Guardian and the Atlantic his 2016 TED
talk explaining how the First Amendment
is quote the safety valve of our
democracy has over 1.4 million views and
his 60,000 strong Twitter feed is a
leading social media forum on current
threats to privacy free speech and an
independent press please join me in
welcoming and thanking the panelists for
Joe
here tonight
good evening thanks so much to Dean
Jones to the University of Arizona and
the Don moon foundation for putting on
this wonderful and very timely event so
as everybody knows the First Amendment
is sort of having a moment the rights to
free speech to protest to gather news
have never been so important yeah at the
same time at least we're led to believe
they've never been more controversial in
fact the phrase free speech itself seems
to have a negative connotation for a lot
of people as white nationalists and
right-wing agitators have attempted to
hide their repellant ideology by
claiming that their movement is really
just about free speech yet at the same
time the First Amendment remains a
critical tool especially for those
fighting against white nationalists and
for social justice and progressive
values it protects the press when it
publishes information leaked from the
Trump White House
it protects protesters from prosecution
even when they're in the vicinity of
violence it protects human rights
advocates when they post him information
for how immigrants can stay safe from
ice or Trump's deportation port force it
protects students everywhere who
advocate for the divestment from Israel
which several schools and several
politicians have attempted to ban it
even protects twitter users who
generally advocate for quote punching
Nazis from the perspective of First
Amendment advocates the benefits are
clear but at the same time US First
Amendment advocates have a duty we have
to we need to understand the point of
view of many students who may be wary of
First Amendment law and why students may
not fully buy into the right to allow a
poor in speech actually protects them
rather than hurts them you know after
all for a long time the most widely
cited justification for America's broad
free speech protections was that the
best arguments will win out in the
marketplace of ideas
but you could forgive anybody from this
generation who have seen their job
prospects evaporate in front of them
because of the financial collapse for
not exactly putting their faith and in
anything resembling a marketplace you
know contrary to what has been repeated
ad nauseam in for example the New York
Times op-ed page I don't actually
believe that college students or the
under forty generation or Millennials as
everybody derisively likes to call them
are universally hostile to free speech I
myself am a millennial and so even I get
offended by that
after all campuses are just as likely or
as a recent fire study showed even more
likely to censor left-wing speech it's
true that some polls have shown that
college students are a bit more hostile
to free speech than baby boomers but
others have shown they're more tolerant
it really depends on how you phrase the
question and there's also reasons to be
hopeful you know young people and
college students are incredibly
passionate about civil rights and racial
justice issues speaking out far more
than a generation that came before it I
mean when I was in high school just
fifteen years ago all the older
generation complained about back then
was how young people didn't care about
anything anymore and that everyone was
apathetic now the complaint seems to be
the young people care too much so you
know I think what this debate needs is a
lot less complaining about kids these
days and more about how the First
Amendment actually protects you in
practice so you know First Amendment
advocates do not defend a pauran or
disgusting speech because they wish to
protect racists and misogynists just so
that they have a platform in fact part
of their goal is just the opposite they
do so to protect those protesting
against those same people the same
government justifications that are used
to shut down a white nationalist rally
like Public Safety or vague threats of
violence are the same justifications
conservative governments have used to
shut down Occupy Wall Street protests
after the financial crisis or black
lives matter protests
today all you have to do is read the
news to see how rules restricting speech
can actually backfire on those that
they're supposed to protect the most so
we need to think more about the young
people of color who have actually
recently been banned from Facebook or
had their accounts suspended under
Facebook's hate speech rules for
actually calling out or documenting hate
speech so more people can hear about it
or the war crimes prosecutors who are
furious with YouTube and Google for
deleting videos under their new anti
promotion of violence policy which they
had planned to use as evidence in war
crimes trials in Syria or all of the
real news organizations who have seen
their online traffic fall off the cliff
because of Facebook's push to eliminate
fake news but we want to hear all sides
of this debate tonight all of the many
benefits but also all of the trade-offs
when it comes to robust free speech
rights there are so many things on this
topic that we can discuss and I don't
want to take up too much time we are
incredibly lucky to have such a
distinguished panel tonight it's no
exaggeration to say that our panelists
are some of the most important free
speech speakers and scholars on the
First Amendment in the last half-century
so with that I will turn it over to our
distinguished moderator who he himself
has been had a direct hand and many of
the most important free speech legal
cases in the last thirty years so please
join me in welcoming Bob Korn Revere
thanks Trevor thanks JP for inviting me
and Don for sponsoring this thank all of
you for coming
hope to have a very impassioned dialogue
here tonight as Trevor mentioned I am a
practicing lawyer that's why I thought
it was important to come in costume
tonight also I understand it's a
university crowd so you may not have
seen a suit before so this is this is
what they look like
anyway as as a working lawyer I'm sort
of more like the mechanic on this this
crew I I sort of used the principles of
First Amendment in my job day-to-day but
the real thinkers the theoreticians the
people who are developing First
Amendment theory and giving it deep
thought are the ones that we're going to
hear from tonight and so what I'm going
to try and do in the first few minutes
is try and talk about how we got to this
stage in the development of First
Amendment law and how that pertains to
the issues that are currently happening
on campus and so we start with the words
of the First Amendment as Trevor
mentioned there is some concern about
people who just invoke free speech
particularly for younger people who just
hear about this as protecting the Otzi's
and so on it's like saying why is this
protected and someone says well the
First Amendment requires it it's kind of
like asking a theologian a question and
they say well because God said so and so
it's important to understand how we got
to this stage of development these forty
five words guarantee five basic American
freedoms free ones of press freedom of
religion freedom of speech freedom of
assembly and freedom of petition
actually it also protects freedom from
religion so really it's six but the text
of the first amendment really doesn't
tell you anything about the content of
those amendments and what they really
mean it's important to recognize that
the First Amendment was not interpreted
by the Supreme Court for the first
hundred and forty years of the Republic
and when it did get around to doing so
it did so on a case by case basis
tailored to the situate
presented by those particular cases so
the first case came in 1931 in a case
called Stromberg versus California where
a 19 year old Yetta Stromberg who was
the counselor at a summer youth
communist camp was arrested and
convicted under a California law that
made it a felony to fly a red flag in
opposition to organized government it
was the first time when it reached the
Supreme Court that that Court held in
favor of a First Amendment claim holding
that this violates rather basic rights
of freedom of expression now after the
stromberg case a number of other
decisions of the twentieth century began
to flesh out and define what those
forty-five words of the First Amendment
means over the the fourteen words if
you're talking about just protections
for freedom of speech and freedom of
press courts didn't get around to
intellectual freedom cases until
sometime later
so in 1940 in one of the first decisions
in this area a court in New York upheld
the dismissal of famed philosopher
Bertrand Russell from the City College
of New York basically for being an
atheist but also for as the court
described it for teaching immoral
installations salacious doctrines in his
books for holding abhorrent ly repulsive
ideas on nudity and masturbation meaning
he wasn't against them
he held tolerant view views toward what
the court described as the damnable
felony of homosexual ism and also said
that academic freedom doesn't protect
this because academic freedom really
only protects what is good and does not
protect the freedom to teach evil so not
off to a great start when it came to
academic freedom and protections of the
First Amendment and it didn't get much
better in the 50s when we were going
through the period of the Red Scare and
McCarthyism during that period anyone
accused of any kind of leftist views had
to watch out and one of the primary
tools being used by institutions around
the country was the loyalty oath in fact
in 1950 California
loyalty oath requirement and the State
Board of Regents dismissed 31 professors
because they refused to sign it they
challenged that were later reinstated
but the Supreme Court didn't look at
loyalty oaths until really late 50s
through the early 1970s with somewhat
mixed results free speech issues for
students came to campus in the 1960s
most notably beginning with the Free
Speech Movement at Berkeley in 1964 and
the issue there was that students wanted
the right and the ability without being
impeded by the university to be able to
talk about the political issues of the
day on campus now this was the 60s so
where there are a great number of
political issues to talk about starting
with the civil rights movement every day
we were confronted with new outrages for
people being denied civil rights and
denied the ability to speak about it in
their struggles and one of the or two of
the important lessons we learned from
this era and the cases that also we went
to the Supreme Court or that governments
could not use local ordinances like
disturbing the peace to quell peaceful
demonstrations and secondly that the
First Amendment prohibits the
application of what is called the
hecklers veto that is crowds do not get
to denounce and hound people away from
speaking and that it is the government's
obligation to protect the speaker rather
than to allow the unruly mob to silence
the speaker this was also the time of
the anti-vietnam war movement and so we
see the clashes up here in the Chicago
Convention in 1968 the Democratic
National Convention we see peaceful
protestors being met with bayonets and
of course the tragic iconic photograph
from Kent State in 1971 after four
students were killed by Ohio National
Guard while they were in the midst of an
anti-war demonstration not all protests
were violent or raucous this is Mary
Beth tinker
and her brothers who won the right to
wear black armbands to school in
protesters Vietnam War actually they
were armbands in mourning for the people
who were killed on both sides of the war
the landing of landmark 1969 decision
basically reaffirmed that neither
students nor teachers shed their
constitutional rights to free expression
at the schoolhouse gate that same year
was the year of the Stonewall rebellion
or the Stonewall riots which marked the
beginning of the gay rights movement in
America I've always been a little struck
did you notice in the Free Speech
Movement photo you had people in
Berkeley coming to a demonstration
wearing suits kind of looked like a
Blues Brothers convention this has
always struck me that the cops in the
background here look like they're
actually members of the Village People
but anyway this was the beginning of the
gay rights movement and the same was
true of the women's movement around the
same period where you have people
turning out in the streets and rely on
these same principles that were affirmed
by courts during the civil rights era
now of course not everybody who was
protected by these laws we would
describe as progressives as a matter of
fact in the late 1970s in 1977 to be
exact the American Nazi Party sought a
parade permit to march in Skokie
Illinois which was the home to many
Holocaust survivors it was an important
idea the ACLU to its credit defended the
right of the speakers and in a landmark
decision that cost stately a cou many
supporters helped affirm the principle
that the First Amendment is neutral
politically that it protects firebrand
priests and Vatican critics alike it
defends people to advocate either for a
woman's right to terminate a pregnancy
or against it it protects anti-war
demonstrators as well as people who
would support the government's position
in a war and we see these same issues
really recurring today the issues have
not changed
from the protests for Occupy Wall Street
to black lives matter to the tumult of
our current political dialogue if you
can call it a dialogue and then of
course the tragic events of
Charlottesville where you have the
unremitting ugliness of seeing Kiki
towards parades and violence in the
streets and again as in Kent State
resulting in a tragic death of course
the events of what's happening in free
speech around the country applies
equally to what's going on on campus so
we see violent reactions to certain
speakers coming to campus in this case
all right speakers we see the reactions
of students polarizing as well some
arguing that speech that is
uncomfortable or offensive or that
marginalizes certain groups should be
banned where other students will support
a more robust notion of protecting
speech regardless of the consequences we
see demands for safe spaces this of
course is adjunct professor Melissa
clique asking for some muscle to oust a
student photographer from what she
called a safe space we also see this in
demands for trigger warnings although of
course the concept of trigger warnings
as I think we'll hear means many
different things to many people when I
used to teach courses on Oh FCC law and
the George Carlin's 730 words I would
often tell students at the beginning of
the semester you know here's a trigger
warning if you really are bothered by
harsh language now is the perfect time
to get the out of here
so trigger warnings are there as well
there we also have free speech zones as
JP was talking about free speech zones
being places relegated by administrative
decree on certain camest campuses that
limit the expression of student views to
certain limited areas of campus that has
become an issue in litigation around the
country
and we also see demands to oust certain
speakers deny them a platform on campus
because either the speakers or their
ideas are considered to be too hateful
now all of this is governed by First
Amendment law but more importantly and
for purposes of tonight's discussion it
also has a question of not what the law
is but what what is what it is the law
what you want it to be and here's where
I think a quote from judge learn at hand
from 1944 really touches on that point
because it's not a question of what the
law protects but what the collective
what the public wants it to protect and
whether or not it's protected in the
hearts and minds of the citizens so with
that we're going to explore these issues
as they apply to the campuses today and
let me start known with you and let me
just ask how would you assess the
current state of freedom of speech on
American campuses and what would you
identify is the biggest problems okay
simple question I think it's in many
ways problematic in ways that it's
important to consider carefully and to
think about in the light of our
experience and history generally these
issues will be discussed in the period
that follows Siegel and Dean are both
written important books about it and
there have been others the indication
that there's a problem of free speech on
campus is given by polls of students
which show that considerable majority
sometimes close to three-quarters
believe that hateful ideas have no place
on camp
racist sexist xenophobic and so on and I
think that is a problem it's a problem
because though you the motives are
understandable admirable in many ways
and can be accommodated appropriately I
think nevertheless the principle is
mistaken we I'm sure we'll have ample
discussion of that and it's also a
tactical error for quite a number of
reasons one of them you've just seen if
you look at the history of such concepts
which is rich and ugly they had the
print such principles have almost
invariably have been directed against
vulnerable groups groups that deviate
from what George Orwell once called the
pervasive orthodoxy and have been
efforts to sustain a power authority and
domination oh that goes right till the
present in fact and we can anticipate
that if such principles are established
and expected in a firm fashion that'll
continue to be the way they're used and
there's another reason why it's
tactically mistaken if you have a
festering sore the cure is not to
irritate it but to find out what its
roots are where it comes from and to
deal with those racist another such
speech is a festering stor sore by
silencing it you simply amplify its
appeal and even lend that a veneer of
respectability as in fact we've seen
very clearly in the last
a couple of years and what has to be
done plainly is to confront it and to
ask where it comes from and to try to
deal with the roots of such ideas that's
the way to exer pate the ugliness and
evil that lies behind a such phenomenon
and as we think about this I suggest
reflecting a little long something
that's really not the topic tonight but
nevertheless is worth keeping in the
back of your mind that when we ask about
the state of free speech on campus today
we should be asking ourselves in
comparison to what well the natural
comparison is to the period when student
activism in the modern period really
began to take off some of the pictures
that you saw the 1960s so what was the
situation like on campus at that time
well one of the major recent books on
free speech on Canopus actually the book
that we had the lead review in the New
York Times Book Review last Sunday it's
called the coddling of the American mind
and it discusses the danger of safe
spaces other devices which are leading
it claims with some justification to
citizenry which is unwilling to face
alternative ideas and stays within its
own cocoon and that's destructive of the
people of course destructive of
democracy I think there's fair amount of
validity of that and we can ask what it
was like in the 1960s
well when the student movements began to
develop what they were opposing was safe
spaces namely the university system and
the intellectual culture which was a
safe space for the prevailing orthodoxy
with remarkable effectiveness as Orwell
wrote speaking of England that's what
the University in the culture was like
and mines were indeed coddled they were
protected from what regarded as
dangerous ideas actually saw an example
of that in the comments about Russell
happened to be a little bit earlier but
that was very much the case in the
academic environment and in fact the
intellectual culture generally in the
1950s and early 60s that's why when you
look at the what the student movement
was doing it was not only engaged in
important tasks of trying to gain the
right of free speech on campus but in
discipline after discipline students
were creating alternatives the major
issue in the 60s one of the major issues
was the Vietnam War the committee of
Concerned Asian scholars initiated by
students flourished since still alive
was a critique of the prevailing
orthodoxy in political science and Asian
Studies Department which was extremely
rigid same happened in economics and
political science and history and so on
the Union of Concerned Scientists
scientists was critiquing the
unwillingness of the scientific
community to confront seriously of the
effects of the use of the technology
scientific ideas that they were
developing this was prevalent throughout
and if you look back at the orthodoxy of
the 60s you can understand why and we
may have forgotten but it's worth
remembering so for example in the 1960s
the leading study of American diplomatic
history by a distinguished liberal
scholar blandly described the tasks of
the colonists once they had attained
independence of their task he said it
was to turn to the job of felling trees
and Indians and expanding to the
national borders that's pervasive
orthodoxy felling trees and Indians and
expanding to the national borders not a
hint of protest actually if you look up
the phrase on Google you'll find the
nature of the protest a couple of dozen
quotes from things of mine and nothing
else because no one saw anything wrong
today I think it would be inconceivable
that you could have a statement like
that almost anywhere but certainly not
in the leading most prestigious history
of American diplomacy and it continues
the leading anthropologists in the
country we're telling us that the Indian
population was a group of scattered
savages dedicated to vicious warfare or
no culture of nothing the
in the Cold War which is of course
raging at the time the soul a comic idea
that could be expressed was what's
called the Orthodox position the United
States is absolute sublimity our enemy
is ultimate evil nothing further discuss
if you think about and this conveyed it
not only coddled the minds of students
but coddled the general population so
you look at attitudes at the time about
5% of the population thought that
interracial marriages were tolerable 50
years later it's about 90 percent that's
a large reason for that is the impact of
student activism you have to recall that
in the 1960s the United States still had
anti-miscegenation laws the laws so
severe that when the Nazis in the 1930s
were looking for models these were the
only ones they could find but they were
too harsh so the Nazis wouldn't accept
them because we had us had the one drop
of blood principle that was too much for
the Nazis same on issue after issue boy
it's something that one should
definitely bear in mind so yes the
academic culture the intellectual
culture were safe spaces they were
coddling the American mind and the
student activism has played an enormous
role in the vanguard of demolishing much
of this there's plenty to be done still
we can say not this extreme but some of
our things today and that should be
recognized in fact it's happened right
here in Tucson as many of you know
better than I do
there was
effort by the legislature to kill a very
effective Mexican American Studies
program in the schools
it was confronted by students high
school students who demonstrated
protested effectively they didn't manage
the ban the law but they did create a
help create a mentality which led
federal judge to impose an injunction so
that it can't be applied these are very
important things to keep in mind I think
in the background when we talk about the
problems of a campus of free speech on
campus today which are very significant
ones thank you know Nadine do you want
to take a check at that time yeah both
Bob you alluded to probably the most
famous or infamous ACLU case in our
almost 100-year history
the so-called Skokie case where an
organization which has been in the
vanguard of civil rights and civil
liberties and striving for equality and
against hatred and discrimination how
could we come to the defense of the free
speech rights of Nazis who had the polar
opposite view and interestingly enough
that position although it was a slam
dunk winner in the courts of law because
the legal principle that was at stake is
what the Supreme Court has called the
bedrock principle of freedom of speech
that government may not discriminate
against any idea or viewpoint no matter
how hateful or hated it is if we
disagree with it we can ignore it we can
refute it we can demonstrate against it
but we should not allow government to
silence it so it was completely
uncontroversial in the courts of law all
the way up to the United States Supreme
Court but in the court of public opinion
it was so controversial even among
are carrying ACLU members right diehard
free speech supporters as you alluded to
we lost 15% of our members so when I
hear that today's college students are
so intolerant of free speech and
unprecedented numbers I have to laugh
and say this is always true throughout
my entire adult lifetime and I think
it's sort of a human nature if somebody
is in common sense right if somebody is
saying something evil what's the harm
from suppressing that evil message the
harm is exactly what Noam talked about
that you have to look beyond the
particular message to the underlying
principle and you have to make people
understand that if the principle is that
a hated message in a particular
community can be stifled just because it
is hated then no speech is safe and
particularly endangered is any speech as
know'm indicated that challenges the
status quo that advocates for law reform
and justice so in the Nazi case in 1977
the arguments were made that their ideas
are hated and they're dangerous and
they're subversive and the ACLU pointed
out in our brief that that was exactly
the same argument that was made just a
few years earlier also in Illinois in a
town called Cicero Illinois which was
highly segregated and when Martin Luther
King tried to have a pro civil rights
demonstration there the people in Cicero
made exactly the same arguments that
were made by the people in Skokie
because in Cicero it was the pro Civil
Rights message that was seen as
subversive and dangerous so I think
forums like this are so important
because it gives us an opportunity to
get beyond the the sound bites right
we're not too
free speech for Nazis we're defending
freedom of speech so that anti-nazis can
exercise it as well so that we all can
go so I have to agree with with what
you're saying Nadine and also no I'm but
I actually think that the way that we
apply these principles of neutrality and
the strong support that we should have
democratically for free speech we have
to apply it appropriately to the
different institutions that we are
addressing and when we are thinking
about colleges and universities we have
to think about them not as any other old
part of the democratic system we have to
think about them as institutions that
are serving a particular mission and the
mission that universities and colleges
serve is the search for knowledge or
truth as people sometimes like prefer to
think about it
the search for knowledge and truth which
calls for a greater tolerance for a
great diversity of ideas and opinions
and also we have the mission of
educating students and this mission
sometimes indicates that we need to
rethink some of our basic principles in
the way that they apply to our campuses
so we need to think about the unequal
burden that the open expression can
create for many of our students and that
doesn't mean that we need to censor
speech or that we need to set up a
committee that will say you cannot say
that and you can say that but that we
need to be more sensitive to the impact
of words in an educational context right
you asked Bob what is the state of free
speech on college campuses today I
actually think that universities and
colleges you know the 4,000 or so
institutions around this country that
are part of the higher education sector
they are one of the greatest defenders
of the First Amendment today I think
that they are one of the greatest places
where First Amendment is actually
protected and where free speech is
practiced every day what do we do here
all day long we only just talk I mean I
think ideas and opinions are negotiated
as just the daily course of action way
more than they do in many of the other
institutions is this in this country
whether it's social media whether it's
private businesses whether it's even
some of the institutions of government
so I think the higher education sector
is not perfect we have various things to
work on we're not always supporting
diversity of opinions we sometimes
overreact as students or as professors
or scientists etc and and we suppress
speech so there is a lot to work on but
I actually think that as a sector we are
doing a pretty good job supporting and
protecting the open expression of ideas
and I just will so that I don't sound so
rosy I will note that Bob in your
presentation you mentioned the Tinker
case and how students and teachers in
high schools or in public schools don't
shed their freedoms at the school's door
my main concern for colleges and
universities is that students today come
to campus from public schools in the
United States that for 40 years have
been limiting the tinker decision for 40
years now there are more and more forms
of expression for young people
especially middle and high school
students more and more forms of
expression that are not permitted and
more and more leeway that the courts are
giving to school
to teachers and administrators to
silence high school student speech if
it's disruptive to the learning
environment if there is sexual innuendo
if there is some reference to drugs
there are all sorts of reasons to limit
high school student speech and so when
these same young people come to campus
they have never practiced they have
never experienced an atmosphere of open
expression in their daily life in their
institutions that they study at so this
is something that is of greater concern
to me in the area of open expression
then you know the various things that we
clearly need to work on on our campuses
you know and yet going back to that
wonderful statement from learn at hand
that speech is going to I you I'm not
sure you had you didn't have that one in
your slides I think so different
different different one but let me say
this it was a famous speech given in
1941 during World War two called the
spirit of Liberty in which he said the
spirit of Liberty lives in the hearts
and actually it was insane and women if
it if it lives there then it needs no
court no constitutional law to save it
if it dies there no Constitutional Court
no law can save it and what has been so
inspiring on the high school front
because I totally agree with Seagal that
the law has moved in a terrible
direction but look at the student
activism that we had against guns and
you know in pro-gun regulation even from
much younger students and that to me is
you know free speech is alive and well
even at that age - yeah but I think you
put your finger on something and talking
about the really wide divergence between
the First Amendment protections for
university students versus the
protections for secondary school
students and in many ways the tinkerer
decision in 1969 was the high point for
the protection of student free
expression at that point and it's been
cut back since then so that the
divergence between what students have
been used to by the time they get to
college is pretty wide and I think that
twins
speaks to the point that you raised at
the outset of your comments that the
university is a special environment and
yet you have a population of people who
are expected to have and understand the
four First Amendment rights but it
requires the universities to be involved
in a balancing act between creating an
inclusive environment in which
marginalized groups are considered be
accepted and at the same time protecting
and preserving full First Amendment
protections
how can universities perform that
balancing act without tipping too far in
one direction or the other there has to
be a mixture of devices we have to
understand and recognize that a
university has multiple dimensions it is
a domain in which research and inquiry
should be carried out without external
constraints with a willingness to
challenge received ideas to confront
prevailing orthodoxy almost all of the
great discoveries of the past have been
made by people who overturned firmly
held beliefs passionately held beliefs
often facing enormous difficulties to
the extent of being burned at the stake
if you go back far enough but finally
breaking through universities should be
a domain like that on the other hand
it's also true that a university is
somewhere between a public place
person's home so for example I think
everyone agree that no one has a right
to come into my living room and post a
sign saying kill the Jews or even in my
office or even on the door of my office
which is a public space and for students
at the universities in part their home
and they have a right to have their
concerns their susceptibility to insult
and denigration be they should have a
right to be protected from that so there
has to be a mixture and I think the
right mixture is to allow to ensure to
ensure that there is freedom of inquiry
that there's openness to anyone being
invited if they have hateful views
confront the views and more seriously
look into their roots we want to
eliminate them to extirpate them at the
roots not just to put them off and say I
don't want to hear them and at the same
time I think it does make sense to allow
things like safe spaces to permit
students to have the right to avoid
being confronted with things that are
they feel are harmful and denigrating
and to generally create an atmosphere of
free interaction and discussion which
will lead to the understanding that the
way to confront things that are hateful
and injurious is to deal with them not
to escape from them it doesn't help you
to escape from them it helps you to
confront them and find out where they're
coming from
and go after the sources of where
there's coming from that I think is what
a proper learning experience is and it
it requires I don't think there's a
single formula that you can use to say
here's what we do all the time
cases have to be dealt with on the basis
of existing circumstances with sympathy
and understanding but in the background
holding firm to principles that I think
are valid and significant so the way a
lot of universities have started dealing
with this matter in the recent in the
past couple of years has been adopting
principles like the Chicago principles
which are basically a set of statements
that affirm the commitment to open
expression and the refusal to or an
insistence on maintaining an open
environment for research and free
inquiry just as as known was describing
just now
I think principles like these are of
course very important but they are
insufficient because they refuse to
recognize the justified expectations
that students have that we fulfill the
implied promise that we made when we
admitted them to college right that they
are actually welcomed members here that
when we create an environment of open
expression we don't just mean that we
are defending all ideas we also mean
especially in an educational environment
that we ensure that all people can
actually participate in the conversation
right so that is not just the ideas that
are protected but also the individuals
who are looking to participate in the
process of their own education and their
own training or whatever it is that they
came to do at the University and so I
think the students
you know you mentioned on some of the
polls that are coming also in Trevor
mentioned that polls coming about or
surveys about students whether they are
supportive of or unsupportive of the
First Amendment or open expression
policies I think students are saying
something very important right they are
saying when I come to my semi home right
as the university is serving me for a
few years I'm looking for an assurance
that my contributions are gonna be
recognized as any other person's
contributions it doesn't mean that I'm
always right or that everybody is going
to agree with me but it means that I'm
not going to be denigrated that my
dignity is not going to be undermined
and that I'm not going to be silenced
because of a group I belong to as in
your example because of my identity or
because of some assumptions that people
make about me so my sense is that the
balancing act has to be rooted in a
commitment to the dual purpose of the
University the search for knowledge and
the educational mission of the
University which requires creating not a
safe space in the intellectual sense
that you rightly just now criticized a
norm in your previous answer but a safe
space in the sense of a sense in the
sense that we provide all of our
students that they are welcome and
valued members of our community of free
inquiry I totally agree with everything
that's been said and if I could
summarize and recapitulate it's that we
should celebrate and
encourage and provide a safe space for
diversity inclusivity equality and
dignity for all ideas and also for all
people and what the reason I wrote my
book is I saw that too many students and
other people seem to feel that there's
an inherent tension between the equality
diversity inclusivity societal Harmy for
people versus free speech and based on
my own experience and based on studying
what's happened around the world under
laws that do censor hate speech
I am completely convinced that Liberty
for freedom of speech and equality and
dignity for all people are ultimately
mutually reinforcing that the best and
most effective possible way to advance
equality and dignity is through free
speech in addition to of course outline
actual discrimination and by the way I
referred to this we have not come as far
as we need to on that basis I mean in
this country at the federal level it is
still completely lawful to refuse to
hire somebody or to fire somebody
because of their sexual orientation or
gender identity so I mean clearly we
have not done enough to outlaw actual
discriminatory conduct and we have to
vigorously enforce laws against
discriminatory violence which also
occurs too much the so-called hate
crimes or bias crimes but in terms of
responding to hateful ideas I've heard
it hear from both of my colleagues we
have to edge
and empower all of our students
including perhaps especially those who
are members of groups that are subject
to disparagement and I do not at all
mean that they should have a special
burden to respond to hate speech all of
us have that moral responsibility I
think especially those of us who oppose
censorship should be the first ones to
be on the frontlines to raise our voices
against any kind of hateful
discriminatory expression and we are
seeing but we have to empower those who
are subject to disparagement give them
the education and the resources and the
resiliency and the access to
communications technology to amplify
their voices and that is a point that
was made over and over again for example
by President Obama including his last
couple of commencement speeches one of
them was at Howard University of course
a historically black institution and he
said look I know it puts a burden on
minority students to do it to go face to
face with those who are disparaging them
but you want to make deep-seated changes
in society right that's what the black
lives matter movement is about and the
only way you're going to do it is the
way the civil rights demonstrators in
the sixties did it which is confronting
those who tried to bring you down and
not allowing them to do it and there are
ways that educators and psychologists
can empower everybody to be an effective
advocate and to to be resilient and and
rather than allowing somebody to demean
you they are the ones who are demeaned
by those ideas and let me just say one
other thing because I don't I think it's
not only a matter of trying to refute
mongers I actually have a lot of hope
based on research I did for my book that
we cannot we should not give up hope for
them too there are such inspiring
stories even of people who have been
leaders of hate organizations when
people reach out to them with compassion
and with empathy for them as human
beings of course condemning their ideas
but not treating them as criminals not
giving up on them right we believe in
restorative justice I do even for people
who have committed murder so why not for
somebody who has you know committed a
hate crime or hate speech act and I have
hope based on actual experience as an
organization called life after hate
which was founded by people who were the
heads of violent hate monger
organizations who came to see the error
of their ways and are now working
full-time to recruit others away from
those organizations I just want to make
a really quick response you say that you
know educators and psychologists can
assist people in being more resilient
and more effective in confronting
disparaging comments or racist or other
biased views about them and my my view
about this that it in a way for it
trusts educators and psychologists a
little bit too much and demands a little
bit too much of them and I am a big
supporter of teachers and psychologists
I like you know all of these professions
but I don't think we should sort of like
relegate this responsibility to the
domain of somebody else so we need a
systemic approach that recognizes the
responsibility of the University to
address the challenges that are that's
that that's the point I was getting to
let me probe that a little bit further
because I think you've all very well
articulated the fact that there is a
balance that has to be addressed and and
know my particularly take your point
that universities are special places and
that they are also residences but you
know you would have different rules for
inside a dorm room or inside a classroom
as you would for the vast open spaces of
the university they're more like a
public forum and the question then is
what are you defining or how do you
define what is a safe space because you
know does that mean that's a space in
the open spaces of the university where
you prevent anyone from saying anything
that could be considered derogatory you
know and that is where we confront that
potential conflict between equality and
Liberty you know how do you perform that
dual role of trying to serve both values
without restricting what people have to
say what some people would call hate
speech although it's a term that is
undefined or it means something
different to everyone who uses it not
whether their balance is there to be
struck other than through more speech or
education but how do you strike that
balance as an institution I don't think
we have to ask under what circumstances
do we so we're all committed to the
principle of freedom of speech do we
agree that a neo-nazi group can put up
in Times Square in New York big
advertisement saying kill all the Jews I
don't think there's a simple formula
that answers that question
to consider lots of factors and I think
that's those questions arise in case
after case within the university I think
it should be a principal I don't think
we could really find absolute principles
but there are some principles that you
need that you need quite a burden of
proof to overcome them but one of those
principles is that any speaker on any
topic should be permitted on campus I
think that's the right principle it's
also I think tactically right again I'll
use the same image I used before if you
have a festering sore you don't deal
with it by saying I'm not going to look
at it and you don't deal with it by
irritating it so it gets worse and you
deal with it by treating it and asking
where it came from
and dealing with the roots and that's
the way you deal with 8fo ideas someone
wants to put up a sign saying kill the
Jews ask where that's coming from and
why anybody is even listening to it and
deal with that not look away and say I
don't want to see it and don't allow it
to be said which again gives it a veneer
of respectability and I think that's
there are general principles they are
not absolute but they are worth holding
holding with real fervor and commitment
and recognizing at the same time that
there may be circumstances in which
modifications and are necessary in order
to deal with legitimate sensitivities
and concerns can I make a suggestion of
some places on campus that could be inch
in my view as an
academic and as a civil rights human
rights advocates should be safe spaces
one no I'm already alluded to and that
is in residential areas or quasi
residential so it would be dormitories
for students or for faculty members
their offices I think that is analogous
to the home and it should not be a
free-for-all for people to come in and
express their views in a place where you
have a right to demand sanctuary or the
library another another example would be
the classroom where we as professors
have a responsibility to create a
certain environment that is maximally
conducive to education I think it's
completely appropriate to do what I do
in my law school classes which is to and
and Trevor can attest to it because he's
a graduate of a couple my law school
classes to say for purposes of your
professional training as well as for
equal respect and equal opportunity for
participation I'm only going to allow
you to use the kind of language that
would be appropriate in an argument
before the United States Supreme Court
although seeing all the rumpus that's
going on in Congress lately who knows
maybe I'm going to have to have a higher
standard than that and also
etymologically the term save space first
came into use I would say around the 70s
or 80s when we first shockingly recently
by my standards started to see a major
influx into colleges of women and
members of racial minorities who
traditionally had either been wholly
excluded or very marginalized and they
would be sometimes admitted in very
small numbers and feel very isolated and
alienated and I think it was very
positive the universities would create
you know certain hall or a building or
area where african-american students or
women or other people who were
minorities could feel safe relating to
people with whom they shared a certain
background ironically the University of
Chicago
despite its vaunted free speech
principles and the letter which I
support by the way and the letter that
was sent out by some official they're
saying we don't have any safe spaces the
University of Chicago does have that
kind of safe space including for LGBTQ
students and I don't think it should not
be a preserve where certain ideas are
off-limits but it's more an affirmative
idea to create a special welcoming
environment for students who would be in
particular need of that so I think
you're making needing some really
important distinctions between different
spaces within the university the
university is not just one structure
right the classroom you know I don't
permit protests in my classroom right if
people don't like my syllabus where they
may not take the class but if they have
to take the class they can come and
speak to me we did see protests inside
classrooms in some colleges and I think
that's not the right space to do that
right so we can differentiate between
different places that are safe or where
different kinds of speech is appropriate
and other places where safety and
dignity and affirmation should be
prioritized but I still don't think that
any kind of speech as was suggested I
think by both of you generally speaking
that any speaker should be permitted at
the University I think universities
again they are not the marketplace of
ideas they are trying to promote a
particular mission for it for example
they prioritize what they see is at
least not going beyond the boundaries of
accepted knowledge for instance
I think it's completely permissible for
the Geography Department in my unit at
my university not to invite to decide on
principal not to invite a speaker from
the Flat Earth Society I think it's fine
I think this goes beyond what we see as
acceptable scientific knowledge and so
the Flat Earth Society is not
represented in our conference about
whatever it might be and I don't know
anything about geography so it was just
so for all you know the Flat Earth
Society could be so I think it is
important to recognize that as
institutions we elevate and we value
certain types of speech now obviously we
make mistakes and obviously there's
gonna be internal negotiations about
what's appropriate and obviously we as
we all agree that's why I'm saying
obviously right because the people up
here have agreed that this is that we
need to have very broad boundaries for
the kind of speech that we accept but we
already don't accept every kind or every
kind of speech if I want to go into my
classroom my philosophy classroom and
read poetry its protected speech but
it's not appropriate for my professional
Road right so we anyway regulate where
which types of speech are appropriate
and I think that makes sense for us
about different things we're talking
about the difference between academic
standards which talk about whether or
not someone is competently performing in
their discipline versus whether or not
someone is legally protected and being
able to express an idea even a hateful
idea or a minority idea and so I guess
the question comes down to whether or
not the university as a specialized
location is covered by the same First
Amendment as the rest of society or a
different First Amendment more like what
students in secondary education have
which is a
minimalist less protective version of
the first amendment and well I in in my
view it's neither right because I think
of course it's protected by the broader
requirements of the First Amendment not
the more limited one which are meant to
defend the people who are minors I mean
it has the school is seen as a serving
you know people who are not yet citizens
right the courts are not recognizing
people under 18 they are seeing them
more as citizens in training and so
their freedom or Liberty to express
their views is seen as having to wait
until they grow up and are able to
express ideas more effectively which is
the justification for prioritizing the
learning environment over the students
expressing their own views their views
don't matter yet by this standard I
don't accept that right but by these
standards their view are not for their
views are not formed yet and so it's
fine to limit their expression I clearly
don't think that this is the case about
university students right I think we do
need to provide a robust context in
which students should actually be more
free to express their views than we
currently permit and definitely more
free than what some current state
legislators are promoting you know
limitations on student protests etc I
don't think that's justified by the
university's mission or by some view
that we may have about students so I
think it's really the University's
commitment to make sure that it's
protecting the rights and the liberties
of all students to participate which
sometimes might mean if not censoring
then at least limiting the reach of
biased views and hate based view who
decides that this is so definitely not
my committee let me tell you
I don't think we need to have a
censorship committee that is gonna sit
and you know sort through ideas and
decide we already have a lot of avenues
at the university peer reviews
departmental meetings so decisions that
permit certain speakers or that
prioritize certain speakers over others
that prefer certain forms of expression
over others I think the disciplines are
providing us with some opportunity to
vet speech according to the university's
mission
I think shared governance which I know
is in decline and I lament that but
shared governance including with
participation from students is another
Avenue that permits us to try and
understand what are the concerns that
students are raising maybe some of them
are exaggerated they are young people I
mean maybe there is something they can
learn about the First Amendment I have a
lot to learn too as well so I think a
process of decision making about what is
appropriate I don't think is beyond the
pale for an educational institution that
is trying to promote its own mission
right I don't think it's the same even
in at a public university that's more
restricted by the First Amendment of
course even at the public university I
don't think it undermines the goal of
government shall make no law and I don't
think it undermines the goal of
maintaining a broad basis of
conversation well you know again we're
we're kind of mixing together different
aspects of the university so every
university to the best of my knowledge
has some public areas which are
essentially like public parks and there
they're literally open to the general
public even beyond the university
community there it's like the
traditional Hyde Park Corner in in in in
London right anybody who has the
physical space can put stand on a
soapbox and say anything he or she wants
but in other contexts who's going to be
invited to give a title
lecture who's going to give a
commencement address who's going to be a
guest speaker in class who's going to be
part of a lecture who's going to be
invited to a wonderful program like this
obviously you have to make selective
judgments and of course one of the
factors that you take into account are
the person's ideas that said I would
resist deciding to exclude somebody
solely because the ideas are
controversial and hated by some people
or seen as hateful by some people let me
give a good example the President of the
United States
I think his ideas are hateful many of
his ideas are hateful it's a position
the ACLU has taken in many lawsuits
against the Trump administration a
record number but I still think there
would be educational value in bringing
him to a university campus where know'm
could interrogate him
she would like you to interview Trump
about Trump the president about his
ideas we're all looking forward to the
next program
let me ask each of you if you could
recommend one thing or two things that
you think universities should do to
protect and preserve freedom of
expression on campus what would that be
what should the very cities do to defend
freedom of expression if you could make
one recommendation how do you how to
defend it on campus you know maybe I'm
simple-minded but I think if a group of
students decides they want to hear a
speaker who in my view is utterly
hateful destructive I think I'll say
something totally outrageous okay but I
think true if you take the people who
are in positions of power in the United
States in the political system in the
financial system in the general economic
system I think that things that they are
doing now ranked as the most evil in
human history literally just think about
it for a second anybody who's not living
under a rock knows that were undergoing
a process of global warming which within
a short period of time maybe by the end
of this century if conditions continue
the way they are will lead to basically
making organized human life
actually impossible imagine living in a
world where the sea level has risen and
say 20 feet just think about what that
would mean the big banks in the United
States JPMorgan Chase Jamie Dimon and
others are rapidly increasing their
investments in fossil fuels that is they
are trying to accelerate this process in
the political system the leadership
which is perfectly cognizant of
everything I just said we can show that
other actions and other cases are making
decisions which will lead to this
outcome if you can think of anything
comparable to that in human history I
would like to hear it
nevertheless if a student group decides
to invite Jamie Dimon or rich Tillerson
or Donald Trump I wouldn't say that that
has to be blocked I would say let's hear
what they have to say let's confront it
let's refute it let's find the sources
from which it's coming and try to deal
with them before it destroys all of us
and I think this principle holds in case
after case
[Applause]
what recommendations would you make you
go I mean I would agree completely with
what Nam just now said I think
universities must not censor or limit
student organizations and student groups
and they should have not only just the
permission to invite whichever speakers
they are interested in hearing but also
the equal support if the university is
supporting student organizations it has
to do that in a neutral way and without
choosing according to the content of the
ideas of the speakers but I would also
say that the university should at the
same time take the initiative to expand
some of the ideas that are present on
campus if it sees that these ideas are
skewed or that there are some visions or
some groups or some members of campus
that are not being effectively heard the
university can and it does organise
events on its own it's not on I mean you
mentioned commencement which is of
course one of these special events but
there are other events like this one and
much smaller ones where you can support
more ideas to be heard if you see that
the university is prioritizing that
student organizations are prioritizing a
certain set of ideas you can then
sponsor and support other visions and
other perspectives so I think you should
you especially have the the
responsibility to do that when the ideas
that are being raised are contradictory
to the mission that you are trying to
advance them maybe even contradictory to
the values that the university is trying
to hold if there are gonna be biased or
hate based based speakers I don't think
we need to as a university as a
committee or as an administration to
chase them out or to prevent them for
coming definitely not but I do think we
need to then
counterbalance their views by supporting
you know a speaker series or an event or
other contexts in which contrary
contradicting ideas will be voiced and
heard in an effective way through the
support of the University and I would go
one step further and I understand
correctly there is agreement that say if
a group of students wants to bring a
speaker who most of us think have
obnoxious ideas they should be permitted
to do it if there are voices in the
universities that are suppressed they
should be the suppression should be
overcome their right to confront the
speaker should be facilitated however
there's a difference between the
university facilitating and supporting
alternatives and the university taking a
position I don't think it's right for
the university to take the position if
we do that we'll be back to what
happened to Bertrand Russell will you
ask for concrete suggestions for
promoting freedom of speech and I think
this forum and the whole series thanks
to the generous donors and thanks to
your star professor here Noam Chomsky
has is really epitomizes what I think is
so important and that is education about
freedom of speech principles especially
because they're they're not taught
anymore in high schools right we're not
even taught a lot of what used to be
called civics about the Constitution and
to the contrary the we don't learn how
to exercise those rights so I think
universities have a special
responsibility starting with orientation
and I understand a lot of orientation
programs if not all of them teach us
about diversity in the important sense
of respect for the dignity and equality
and voices of all of us given our
different backgrounds and that should
also extend to diversity of ideas and it
should also be not only an abstract
indoctrination into or introduction to
the principles of freedom of speech and
why they're so important historically
the crucial social justice advocacy that
was suppressed
before we had robust freedom of speech
but we have to create opportunities for
students to actually exercise their own
free speech rights we have to do that as
teachers in our classrooms and we have
to do it through co-curricular
activities and we have to do it by
encouraging you whatever your views are
to remember what I consider to be the
most important right of all and that is
the right not to remain silent last
question on that and that is the civics
education that you talk about which I
agree is badly needed and is essential
is it also necessary to educate students
that the right to exercise their free
speech and their obligation to exercise
their free speech rights also entails
the obligation not to disrupt other
speakers absolutely and I think a very
concrete step that universities could
take but I didn't realize I have time to
to make that point is to enforce
disciplinary rules when students or
others violate other people's free
speech rights through violence or
through disruptive protests don't get me
wrong I absolutely defend the right to
vigorous protest and that would mean you
know silently protesting in my view that
even means
you know vocally voicing objections to
speak
but not for such a sustained period that
you interfere with the right of the
speaker to try to convey a message in
the right of willing audience members to
hear that message but we've seen too
many instances on college campuses where
actual violence and physical injury and
assault any classroom demonstrations as
Segal mentioned have gone unpunished and
that creates a disincentive to others to
refrain from violating free speech
rights and it is escalating security
costs on many campuses which at some
point they're not going to be able to
afford those costs and then free speech
will really be in jeopardy thank you let
me thank all the panelists and JP we'll
see yourself thank all of you very much
thank you again dawn very much thanks to
all the panelists thank you for all
coming so far it was right in the middle
of the week and I know that you had to
push aside some students yourselves to
be here and I really appreciate it
I've read both of these books they're
fantastic books they're all so different
in the topics that they address and in
the and the conclusions and as I like to
say they are available at better
bookstores
as well as outside here if you are at
all interested thank you all for coming
