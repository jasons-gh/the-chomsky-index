have your attention please c-span is all
funding this and so it's caught the rule
which is the cool audition Horace and
we're very excited about that community
around the air in several weeks as part
of the total series of democracy all in
Weston's on the way inside a company
that this room is filled it's almost
like filling the Roman Colosseum to do
this at a nine o'clock time up and I'm
supposed to be matter at the University
and so I'd like to open over here and
thank you very very much for coming to
an automatic of our 13 of those who over
the last many years all this time on
future of democracy very pleased have no
chance of activists say read this
product for many years and saw
indication of American the vertex that
got you into the wrong context of an
illness but welcome home it's great to
see you bye thanks on this is a student
center program I'd like to invite you to
the rest of the seventy or sell ours
that we could be encountering over the
course of this weekend I'd like now to
introduce portrait honest in one of our
sophomores and nature international
relations she's worth extraordinary part
in this project single work on saturday
evening in the context of a panel on
truth reconciliation issues on justice
and transitional societies working on
cd-rom electronic book curriculum ever
trying to develop our society people are
still asleep any different all facets of
working this long government on the
country mall massacre portrait thank you
for this honor of accepting a tradition
democracy in America is not something we
think about on an everyday basis we are
in the habit of criticizing our
politicians on the grounds of their
social merits but don't take the time to
stop and take a look at the Democratic
establishment that our government is
working under Lincoln stated the ideal
of a government of the people by the
people and for the people but is that
what we have in the United States today
dr. Noam Chomsky is here today to help
us explore this issue further the New
York Times States dr. Chomsky is
arguably the most important intellectual
alive the Chicago Tribune stated that he
is the most cited living author the man
who will stand before us today a
professor of linguistics and philosophy
at MIT is one of the world's leading
thinkers dr. Chomsky's profession has
led him in the direction of thinking
about language his analysis of grammar
and other languages have stretched the
boundaries of normal language analysis
searching for the truth and explanations
rather than settling for literate
literate descriptions dr. Chomsky has
written in lectured widely on philosophy
intellectual history contemporary issues
international fairs and u.s. foreign
policy some of his books include on
parent ideology necessary illusions
deterring democracy and rethinking
Camelot JFK the Vietnam War and US
political culture it is now my great
pleasure to welcome dr. Noam Chomsky to
Tufts University and epic
the announced title which I suppose is
somewhere was critique of Madison and
democracy and that title is both too
broad and too narrow for what I'm
actually going to do it's too broad
because I'm not going to try to give a
really close analysis of Madison's
complex and evolving views over half a
century there is very good scholarship
on the topic including several recent
studies that reach quite different
assessments I'm going to keep to my own
choices about the what seemed to me the
leading themes that are important for
understanding the special nature of the
Madisonian Democratic experiment and
also the forms that it took as it
evolved and is taking today it's in this
latter respect that the title is a bit
too narrow but there's also a lot more
to say about the implications of all of
this for global society but that I'll
have to put aside for reasons of time
well the American experience is surely
the most important and interesting one
to study if we want to understand the
world of today and tomorrow there are
some very obvious reasons for that one
is simply the power and the primacy of
the United States which is completely
without parallel the second is that it's
stable and long-standing institutions
which are also democratic institutions
which are exceptional and the arguably
unique thirdly the United States was as
close to a tabula rasa as it's possible
to find in the historical world and that
was understood at the time Tom
in 1776 remarked that America can be as
happy as she pleases she hath a blank
slate to write on and that was more or
less true not necessarily for pretty
reasons but it was true the indigenous
societies which were themselves rich and
complex were largely swept away and the
neighboring regions were conquered by
force including third of Mexico there
was a vast and rich land with
unparalleled resources and also
advantages which was in fact open as a
blank slate to write on the United
States was also unusually free from
external threat which again gave
opportunities for acting independently
the national territory of the United
States hasn't been threatened since 1812
there's there's a history of contrived
threats along an interesting history so
for example a century ago the US Navy
was defending our national territory off
the coasts of Chile just to take one
example during the Cold War last 50
years or so the threats were mounting
contrived but consciously and rather
deceitfully contrived and that's sort of
conceded so for example after the second
were a crucial aspect of the Golden Age
of what's called the Golden Age of
capitalist development after in the
first 25 years or so after the Second
World War a crucial aspect of it was
enormous government subsidy and it was
recognized in the late 1940s that the
economy couldn't survive otherwise the
business press fortune and the business
week and so on pointed out right after
the war that advanced industry cannot
survive in a free enterprise competitive
unsubsidized economy and the government
must be the savior the Truman
administration moved in
huge military expenditures and explained
sort of on the side that the word they
use is not subsidy the word to use is
security so you can get people to pay to
agree to massive transfers of public
funds to high-tech industry if you
frighten them enough and that's in fact
been one function of the cold war since
the beginning the same is true of
intervention it's recognized pretty much
that a good deal of the intervention in
fact probably you could argue almost all
of it and military action over the last
50 years was under the guise of security
but was motivated by something else that
fact too is not unfamiliar to
scholarship so for example although it
isn't very well advertised on Samuel
Huntington the well-known political
scientists at Harvard around nineteen
eighty when the Reagan administration
was setting forth on a new wave of state
terrorism and intervention pointed out
that we may have to sell intervention
and other military action by creating
the misimpression that it's the Soviet
Union that we're fighting is it then he
added that that's what the United States
has been doing ever since the Truman
Doctrine which is more or less accurate
these are among the reasons why the
so-called peace dividend quickly
vanished it it was never realistic to
believe that there would be one and of
course there isn't and why policies
continue approximately as before very
little change after the tactical change
but nothing much with the end of the
Cold War and the reason is that the
whole Pentagon system which is a very
broad system had other motives and the
concern the contrived security threats
were designed to facilitate them but now
they go on with other pretexts in any
event the country really was uniquely
free from external threat it's hard to
find an analog there's also over in the
United States very little residue of
earlier European structures or an hour
at a conservative tradition we don't
really have conservatives in the United
States there are people who call
themselves conservatives but they're
mostly radical status who combined
support for an extremely powerful
intrusive state with coercive social
norms something that a genuine
conservative would certainly Winsett the
lack of a conservative tradition in the
United States may be in fact probably is
part of the reason for the weakness the
relative weakness of the social contract
and of support systems by comparative
standards these typically had their
roots and pre capitalist institutions
and they don't exist much here the blank
slate didn't have them it's not that
they're missing but they're here too
much less extent than say Europe this
blank slate did provide opportunities to
carry out political and the economic and
social experiments without very much
constraint well in studying history also
final comment about this to quite an
unusual extent again really unique the
social socio-political order was
consciously designed using the
advantages that were available now in
studying history it's you can't
construct the experiments but the United
States is about as close to the ideal
case of state capitalist democracy as
you could as one can find and for that
reason alone is particularly important
to study aside from its power and the
stability to institutions well
furthermore the main designer James
Madison was an astute political thinker
and also a very lucid one his views
largely prevailed Madison eloquently
upheld the call for the preservation of
the sacred faith of sacred fire of
Liberty that he wrote into George
Washington's and
log your address but it's important to
understand his quite clear and explicit
ideas about the kind of Liberty that had
to be preserved these ideas perhaps come
out most clearly in the debates on the
Constitutional Convention 1787 Madison
focused on England naturally that's the
model for a Democratic Society that they
would look at at the time and he pointed
out that I'm quoting him in England at
this day if elections were open to all
classes of people the property of landed
proprietors would be insecure and
agrarian law would soon take place what
we would call agrarian reform which
would infringe on property rights and
the sacred fire of Liberty that he spoke
is to burn most brightly to preserve the
rights to own property which are
privileged above all others Madison went
on in the debates to warn that the new
government that they were framing that
they were constructing has to be
designed in such a way to ward off the
unjustice that would come from a
functioning democracy as in the example
mentioned that is it would have to
employ them again it would have to
secure the permanent interests of the
country against innovation with a
variety of devices to protect the
minority of the opulent against the
majority the permanent interests of the
country that have to be preserved
against innovation our property rights
in particular the rights of the opulent
minority who have to be protect
protected against the majority meaning
that democracy has to be a very limited
system well that remained the guiding
principle from the framing of the
Constitution up until today not only
here but also in the forms of democracy
that the United States has been willing
to
tolerate elsewhere that's an important
topic I wish there were time to go into
it but I'll have to put it aside for
lack of time it's easy to be misled by
the public record the public rhetoric in
which these ideas are generally framed
so in the Federalist Papers which people
read which were of course written for a
public you know kind like a propaganda
document the Federalist Papers do
discuss the rights of minorities and the
need to protect their rights but the
discussion is framed and rather abstract
and general terms however madison made
it quite clear that he had a particular
minority in mind namely the minority of
the opulent who have to be protected
against the majority the that fact i
should say is recognized pretty much
across the range of madison scholarship
so even among those scholars who most
strongly defend the interpretation of
madison as a committed democrat you find
the same recognition the most important
of those as lance bannings fine scholar
published the most recent extensive
madison biography and he argues against
other madison scholars that madison
differed most profoundly from other
leading framers by according the
people's right to rule the same
importance as the protection of the
rights of property as banning puts it
throughout his life madison kept to his
principle that in a just and free
government the rights both of property
and of persons ought to be effectively
guarded notice he's arguing against
another stream of scholarship which
holds that madison concentrated on
property rights not the rights of
persons and he takes the view that
madison insisted that both both be
preserved
that however even banning who's at the
extreme in this respect agrees that I'm
quoting him in Madison's determination
to protect minorities against majority
infringement of their rights it is
absolutely clear that he was most
especially concerned for the properties
for the property to minorities among the
people that position somewhat obscured
in the Federalist Papers is unambiguous
forceful and explicit particularly in
the original constitutional debates as
in the passages i quoted although it's
sometimes masked by the public
presentation I should note important to
recognize that although there is a
consensus in Madison scholarship about
Madison's special concern for the
property minorities the way that the
consensus is formulated very much
understates the point so have a look
again at the defense of Madison as a
true Democrat at the outer limits Lance
banning Madison kept to his principle
that in a just and free government the
right both of property and of persons
ought to be effectively guarded and
that's a standard formulation but it's
kind of misleading you really have to
think about what it means so we have the
rights of persons and we have the rights
of property and they have to be balanced
but what are the rights of property so
for example take say this pin okay it's
my property what rights does this
pinhead well the answer is the pen
doesn't have any rights property has no
rights that's meaningless maybe I have a
right to property so somebody could say
okay I have a right to own pen could
argue that but the pen itself has no
right so rights of property is an
extremely misleading phrase but it
refers to and sort of masks is the
rights of persons to own property well
furthermore it's worth noting that that
particular right is not like other
rights so for example my right to free
speech doesn't infringe on your right
free speech okay but my right to own the
pen does infringe on your right down the
pen fight on it you don't okay so here
we have a special right namely the right
of persons to own property which has to
be balanced against all other rights and
happens to be different from others and
it's the one right that excludes other
people so the Madisonian principle once
we sort of take away the array of you
know misleading formulations the
Madisonian principle is that government
must guard the rights of persons
generally but it must provide special
additional guarantees for the rights of
one class of persons namely property
owners and their that particular right
of theirs which infringes on the rights
of others has to be privileged among all
other rights that means the landed
proprietors in England who might be
threatened by agrarian reform in a
democratic society and the opulent
minority generally who have to be
protected against the majority in the
new society that they're developing this
all took on quite a different meaning
century later i'll get to that madison
foresaw that the threat of democracy was
going to become more severe over time
because of the increase quoting because
of the increase in the proportion of
those who will labor under all the
hardships of life and secretly sigh for
a more equal distribution of its
blessings he warned that equality of
suffrage the equal laws of suffrage
might in time shift power into their
hands he said this is still the
constitutional conventions they said no
agrarians attempts have yet been made in
this country but the symptoms of a
leveling spirit have sufficiently
appeared in certain quarters to give
warning of the future danger the future
danger is a danger of democracy notice
the basic
ask that Madison faced in framing a
system which we wish to last for ages
was to ensure that the actual rulers
will be the opulent minority they will
as he put it secure the rights of
property again the misleading
formulation that means the privileged
right to property which stands above all
other personal rights so they will
secure the rights of property against
the dangers from an equality of
universal of universal universality of
suffrage which would vest complete power
over property in hands without a share
in it which will certainly be true as
under his accurate prediction that the
proportion of those who labor under the
hardships of life and secretly sigh for
a more equal distribution of its
benefits will only grow how do you do
this well first of all notice that this
is one position that Madison never
changed throughout his life so in 1829
when he was reflecting on half a century
of American democracy he stressed again
that those without property or or the
hope of acquiring it cannot be expected
to sympathize sufficiently with its
rights to be the safe depository of
power over them again not rights of
property but rights to property the
solution that he came up with back in
1787 was to ensure that the upper house
which would have Senate should have the
main power I would ought to come from
and represent the wealth of the nation
the more capable set of men who will
sympathize sufficiently with the rights
of property and will protect the opulent
minority against the majority and the
system that was designed the voting
patterns that checks and balances the
distribution of powers it was arranged
for the same end the idea was that the
the wealthy would essentially
run it and the general society would be
fragmented offered only kind of a
limited participation in the public
arena which is to be effectively in the
hands of the wealthy and their agents
let me stress the consensus among
Madison scholars on this topic so again
Lance banning who most strongly affirms
Madison's dedication to popular rule
agrees putting him that Madison's
Constitution was intrinsically an
aristocratic document designed to check
the Democratic tendencies of the period
that it was designed to deliver power to
a better sort of people as he put it
excluding those who were not rich well
born or a prominent from exercising
political power now there is a debate
about how well how firmly that line was
held in the years that followed but
there's no serious debate about the
original intent which was quite clear
and become still more clear I think if
we think through the reasoning I that
led to it as particularly is expressed
in the constitutional debates which I
quoted and whatever room for debate
there might be about the early years of
the of the system by with the time we
reach the end of the 19th century and on
until today I think there can be very
little doubt that the Democratic
tendencies of the revolutionary period
were very well contained and that power
is firmly in the hands of the wealth of
the nation who safeguard the principle
that the minority of the opulent must be
project protected against the majority
well this account of the Madisonian
roots of the prevailing conceptions of
democracy is unfair in one important
respect like Adam Smith and other
founders of classical liberalism madison
was pre-capitalist and anti-capitalist
in spirit
Lance banning describes him as an 18th
century gentleman of honor to depths
that we today are hardly able to imagine
he had nothing but contempt for what
Adam Smith called the vile maximum of
the Masters of mankind all for ourselves
and nothing for anyone else and it's
quite likely that Madison would have
sympathized with the so called factory
girls and artisans of eastern
Massachusetts in the early days of the
Industrial Revolution which began around
here when they condemned what they
called the new spirit of the age gain
wealth for getting old but self which
they regarded as a degrading and
demeaning doctrine that destroyed human
values and signaled the defeat of the
American Revolution to working people in
the rising industrial society by now
it's perhaps hard for us to remember how
shocking was the radical capitalist
ideology that started to come along
around the 1820s it was given its
sharpest doctrinal form in what was
called the new science of economics of
David Ricardo and Martha's and Nassau a
senior and others the new science
rejected the traditional view that
people have a right to live that was
taken for granted in traditional
societies feudal societies slave
societies and so on it was assumed that
people have some kind of a place a right
to be in that place generally a pretty
rotten place but at least some kind of a
place however the new science challenge
that it proved with the certainty of
Newton's laws as Ricardo put it modestly
it proved that people have no rights
apart from what they can gain in the
market you only hurt the poor by
to help them so the new science proved
and if people can't survive in the labor
market since they have no other rights
they should go somewhere else which was
not impossible in those days recall that
free movement of labour is a fundamental
principle of free market doctrine you
know in free not free movement of labour
you don't have free market that's one of
the many principles that are overlooked
as the theory has been converted into a
weapon an ideological weapon of
oppression in the service of the vile
Maxim and the opulent minority relying
very heavily on state power for example
subsidies under the guise of security I
should add that even Ricardo who was the
leading exponent of the new science was
unable to free himself completely from
traditional human sentiments so Ricardo
recognized that his famous principle of
comparative advantage was based on the
assumptions that labor is mobile and
that capital is immobile if you drop
those assumptions doesn't work that's
incidentally the opposite of what
prevails today labor is immobile and
capital is mobile but we're still
supposed to worship at the shrine even
though the assumptions on which the
conclusion rests have been reversed in
Ricardo's day the assumptions were not
all that unrealistic there were vast
open spaces which were being cleared of
their inhabitants and that meant a place
for impoverished people of Europe and
criminals there was much less need for
prisons in those days because he could
send him off to the United States and
Australia and also for poor people they
could move once the land was cleared I
but what about capital well capital was
largely a matter of land and land is
immobile so that part of the assumption
is correct but as for the rest Ricardo
remained a captive of pre-capitalist
values he argued that the rich would be
satisfied with a low rate of profits in
their own country rather than seek a
more advantageous employment for their
wealth and foreign nations and the
reason they would do that is just
because of human sentiment community
spirit and so on Adam Smith had a much
clearer view in this regard years
earlier when he said no they're going to
follow the vile Maxim so the point is
even Ricardo found it hard to free
himself from the taint of human
sentiments despite the teachings of the
new science but it was a dramatic change
the restriction sharp restriction and
the concept of human rights that was a
central component of rising industrial
capitalism that continues right to the
present as a result of quite extensive
and often violent popular struggle over
long periods there is now a reasonably
large array of Rights that have been won
and there are now even international
conventions on human rights the basic
one is the universal declaration of
human rights of December 1948 that
declaration inspires quite a good deal
of noble rhetoric and you know posturing
before TV cameras and so on it can also
be used by the powerful very selectively
as a weapon against some current enemy
but the reality of the matter is that no
state takes the principles of Universal
Declaration seriously the United States
for example flatly reject a good part of
its solemn commitments as expressed in
the Universal Declaration namely the
whole range of articles cancer
learning social and political rights
which we simply assert do not apply we
declare that they are invalid though we
signed them of course the this is a
residue of the principal denial of such
rights under the pure form of market
doctrine that was prescribed and
preached by the new science that
meanwhile incidentally the United States
parades courageously as the defender of
Human of the universal declaration
against third-world relativists all kind
of bad guys that's a pretty impressive
propaganda achievement and it's a
tribute to the obedience of the educated
classes folks like us that they can get
away with as they do there's never any
challenge to this even though it's
radically false on the most obvious and
transparent rounds the fate of the new
science as a weapon of class warfare and
in the limiting the importance of human
rights that's an interesting part of the
history the last hundred and eighty
years and a very lively and important
topic today but a different one then
again I'll have to put it aside well
let's go back to Madison as an
eighteenth-century gentleman his values
were pre-capitalist he expected the
wealthy men who would be given power to
be as he put it in lightened statesman
pure and Noble benevolent philosophers
who will work selflessly for the public
good he soon learned differently as the
opulent minority used their power
exactly as Adam Smith had described
namely pursuing their vile Maxim and by
1792 Madison already recognized that
there were problems he warned that the
Hamiltonian developmental state was
substituting the motive of private
interest in place of public duty leading
to a real domination of the few
an apparent liberty of the many Madison
deplore the daring depravity of the
times as the stock jobbers become the
Praetorian Guard of government at once
its tools and its tyrants bribed by its
large esas and over eyeing it with their
powers and combinations well apart from
the eloquence of the rhetoric it's not a
bad picture of the modern world and the
state of democracy in it it's a picture
incidentally that's shared by over
eighty percent of the population in the
United States who hold that the
government works for the few the few and
the special interests not for the people
that's up from a regular fifty percent
or so about 15 years ago there are
related judgments the same percentage
over 80% regards the economic system as
inherently unfair about the same
percentage holds that business has too
much power working people too little and
by about 20 to 1 which is a huge number
for a poll it's believed that business
should sacrifice profits for workers and
communities that's another ominous sign
of that leveling spirit that the Madison
warned about and the need for vigilance
to protect the opulent minority against
the majority by ensuring that democratic
forms have very limited function well
with all of its flaws from the
standpoint of democratic principle
Madisonian democracy did take a long
step towards popular democratic
government it was a new departure but in
fact in complex ways at the doctrinal
level there were indeed regressive
features that's of course a value
judgment but i think it's sustainable
and it becomes clearer i think if we
look back at the history of democratic
theory which goes way back before
madison so let's go back to his origins
the sort of founding document of modern
political theory Aristotle's politics
which is careful and well argued and
very timely
it focuses on central themes of
everybody's agenda Aristotle quite
carefully discusses many different kinds
of possible society on democracy its
preference he discusses what a democracy
should be it should be a community of
equals aiming at the best possible best
life possible for all at the common good
it should be a community of free men
equal and participatory and notice
incidentally freemen that's meant
literally doesn't not women not slaves
of course so his concept of people is
limited but if we're being too critical
of Aristotle we should remember that
it's only in very recent years that
these fundamental flaws and democratic
theory have begun to be addressed in
this century and still only quite
partially well to achieve these ends
democracy Aristotle went on to say must
be a welfare state he didn't use the
phrase but that's what he's describing a
democracy he said must provide lasting
prosperity for all by distribution of
public revenues by means that he goes on
to describe the goal is relative
equality of outcome of condition okay
the notice that the contemporary
doctrine equality of opportunity that's
a much more recent innovation it's
related to the rise of industrial
capitalism with its narrowing of the
concept of human rights namely to those
that can be obtained through the market
although in the real world stress again
that there's a rather large footnote of
the rich and the powerful demand and
receive ample protection from market
discipline for this they rely on a very
powerful nanny state which transfers
public revenues to them on a massive
scale protects them in other ways
it sometimes reaches the level of sheer
farce as in the United States recently
or England where the Reagan nights here
extolled the glories of the free market
to the poor at home and abroad while at
the same time they were boasting proudly
to the business community that they were
breaking all post-war records in
protectionism and public subsidy for the
rich as indeed they were or say when
Newt Gingrich preaches Stern lessons 27
year old children on the need to learn
responsibility and overcome the
debilitating culture of dependency while
at the same time he holds the record the
championship for bringing federal
subsidies to his own rich constituents
who can if they had to face market
discipline would perhaps be selling rags
but they can applaud their
entrepreneurial values and their
conservatism under the wing of the nanny
state and all get away with it again so
this proceedings without comment thanks
to the extremely impressive self
discipline of the educated classes you
really have to give credit to the
educational institutions they do their
job the classic thesis going back to
Aristotle is that in a free and just
society we should seek to achieve
equality of outcome therefore it must be
a welfare state in which as he put it
everyone has moderate and sufficient
means with the extremes of wealth and
power eliminated that isn't achieved
talk of democracy is not serious because
there cannot be free and equal
participation in self-government quite
apart from the resulting injustice and
the infringement on fundamental human
rights again in the pre-capitalist sense
of human rights in which human beings
are considered to have intrinsic value
other than market value these ideas
just right through the Enlightenment and
classical liberalism for example take
Adam Smith Adam Smith as everyone knows
gave a argument for markets but a rather
nuanced argument if you look closely and
it's also interesting to look at his
reasoning his argument nuanced argument
for markets was based on the assumption
that under conditions of perfect liberty
markets would lead to perfect equality
that is they would lead to equality of
outcome which is an obvious desideratum
for a free and just society they didn't
bother to argue that point because it
was taken for granted and his for the
same reason Adam Smith was in favor of
he putted government regulation in favor
of the workmen which said as always just
and equitable but not in favor of the
Masters everyone is familiar with Adam
Smith's remarks about how wonderful the
vision of Labor is in the first
paragraph of wealth of nations but not
too many people go a hundred and couple
hundred pages later where he points out
that the vision of Labor is an atrocity
and that in any civilized government any
civilized society the government will
have to intervene to protect people
against the division of labor because it
will turn human beings into creatures as
stupid and as ignorant as it's possible
for a human being to be therefore it
must be stopped same principle we have
to can't accept these things when they
don't lead to relative equality of
outcome and that's common take another
major figure of the liberal pantheon
Alexis de Tocqueville he also took it
for granted that equality of outcome was
the desideratum to be sought he warned
in fact of the danger he was talking
about democracy in America remember the
1830 and he praised it he warned however
of the danger of a permanent inequality
of condition and an end of democracy if
the manufacturing aristocracy rising
before our eyes one of the harshest that
has ever existed escapes its bounds as
of course it did beyond his worst
nightmares
this I should say that another related
and very important element in classical
liberalism was opposition to wage labour
which goes much deeper a classic formula
is that if a person produces on command
let's say under wage labor if an artisan
produces something beautiful on command
we may admire what he does but we
despise what he is because he's not a
free human being using his own
initiative and powers to create de
Tocqueville took the same view he as he
put it the art advances but the artisan
recedes the Adam Smith's had the same
view his critique of division of labor
which I mentioned is at a deep level a
critique of labor on command wage labor
which violates the essential human right
to freedom to be a free creative person
a modern political theory sometimes
recognizes a version of this picture but
rather attenuated one I think it
recognizes that opposition to wage
labour was quite real but it attributes'
it to the Republican conception of civic
virtue that is wage labour undermines
the independence of spirit that's
essential for self-government that
interpretation is certainly correct but
i think it's only part of a much deeper
and more interesting story that is a
deeper opposition to wage labour based
on a conception of natural rights and
human nature a conception which is quite
interesting in itself but interesting
roots but that is another topic again
well however one interprets the fact the
opposition to wage labour remained a
very powerful current of American
thought and also struggle right through
the 19th century the labor movement from
the 1830s up to the huge Knights of
Labor or going to say
through the end of the century it
condemned wage labor as an infringement
an intolerable infringement on central
human rights the Independent Labour
press which was just being done by
working people in their own factories
and so on it held the principle that
those who work in the mills should own
them all of this i should say is as
american as apple pie without the
dubious contributions of radical
intellectuals and it extended well
beyond the working class so abraham
lincoln for example held that it is
wrong for capital to buy labor enslave
societies and it is no less wrong for
capital the higher labor under what was
always called wage slavery except as a
temporary expedient on the way to
freedom that was the ideological banner
under which northern work workers fought
the civil war michael sandel over
Harvard points out correctly the
Republican Party proudly presented
itself quoted slogans as not only the
anti-slavery party but emphatically as
the party of free labor free labor
meaning free from wage slavery from
working on command that's the Republican
Party the new york times in 1869
condemned the advance of wage labor as
the rise of a system of slavery as
absolute if not as degrading as that
which lately prevailed at the south will
come quite a long way since those days
but the these ideas which are truisms in
my opinion remained alive well into this
century takes a John Dewey the leading
American social philosopher again as
American as apple pie his roots are
right here his the main focus of his
work was on democracy and he held the
talk of democracy is idle when big
business rules the life of this
controlling production commerce
communication and the press democracy he
said presupposes also presupposes a
transition from a feudalistic to a
democratic social order in which workers
are masters of their own industrial fate
not tools who lent them to have to rent
themselves to private tira knees as long
as the fuel istic social order remains
in place he held politics is nothing
more than the shadow cast over society
by big business the tools and the
tyrants of government in Madison's
phrase and democracy is only a matter of
form well that's a powerful and central
tradition in western intellectual
history that goes from the origins of
recorded thought about democracy and
Aristotle and democracy and freedom
right into the 20th century including
substantial currents of the
Enlightenment and classical liberalism
and Madisonian democracy was a departure
from it for reasons I've already
mentioned but actually it was a
departure in an even deeper sense than
I've already indicated so let's go back
to Aristotle remember that for him a
leveling spirit is essential to
democracy otherwise it cannot be free
and equal and participatory but
Aristotle also gave another reason this
one's kind of hypothetical he said
imagine that a de menthe kind of a
logical reason he said suppose a
democracy could exist in which there
really was free participation suffrage
in other words but there was the
majority of the population were poor and
wealth were concentrated well under
those circumstances he said the majority
would use their voting power to for
their own end not for the common good of
all and well-run democracy should be run
for the common good of all notice that
James Madison faced exactly the same
problem raised exactly the same problem
in the Constitutional Convention in the
remarks that are quoted about the threat
of agrarian reform he said suppose there
democracy in England people could vote
then they would carry out an agrarian
reform they devote their own interests
and they would threaten the rights of
landed proprietors what he misleadingly
called the rights of property well they
both face the same dilemma Aristotle and
Madison exactly the same dilemma but
they gave different solutions Aristotle
solution was to restrict poverty with a
welfare state then democracy would be
possible Madison facing exactly the same
dilemma drew the opposite conclusion we
must restrict democracy so that the
privilege of the opulent minority is
protected now these are crucially
important facts about American democracy
which in a free society would be taught
in high schools civics courses in my
opinion and would be common knowledge
notice I'm not using any exotic sources
these are absolutely the standard major
you know intellectual roots of our
society and thought it's a crucially
important departure from a classical
tradition taken on pre-capitalist
assumptions however as I mentioned well
all of these issues took on a very
different form towards the end of the
19th century and since recall the
Madisonian principle departure from
traditional theories of democracy and
rights but still a principle namely the
rights of persons must be protected but
certain of these rights namely the right
to property must be privileged above
others now for madison persons meant
persons but toward the end of the 19th
century the concept of person underwent
a radical change in a highly
undemocratic manner with the growth of
the industrial economy and the
concentration of power in new corporate
entities that brings us to the last
century in which all of this takes a
very different form recall that
corporations were initially considered
to be the theory of the corporation was
a grant or concession theory so for
example if we want to
together and you know build a bridge
across a river or something we can
become incorporated to carry out that
task we can we are partners it's a
partnership we can get a state-chartered
carry out that task that's corporation
the corporation was legally bound to
keep the stated limits namely build that
bridge that's we got the charter for and
the corporation had no rights and the
only rights were the rights of the
participants the individuals in the
partnership individual owners now that's
what a corporation was okay through the
19th century the picture began to change
there were huge economic changes
especially after the Civil War by the
end of the 19th century by around
eighteen ninety three quarters of the
wealth of the country was controlled by
corporations by now the top few hundred
control most of the domestic economy and
most of the international economy it's
health an enormous infringement on
freedom and right as the economy changed
legal theory changed long with it not by
legislation but in the hands of courts
and lawyers and intellectuals it began
to recognize of corporations had been
are difficult artificial entities set up
as partnerships with no rights for a
stated purpose and chartered that way
but they came to be regarded as natural
entities as collectivist legal
institutions as the leading legal
historian of the process over Harvard
Burton Horowitz describes it these
natural entities were granted the rights
of persons in fact mostly early in this
century in fact immortal persons so much
more than the rights of persons and
there were no longer any limits on what
they could do they didn't have to keep
to their stated purpose so they could
acquire property or they had First
Amendment rights and so on this became
very serious when New Jersey kind of
broke ranks and permitted the right of
incorporation in 1889 with no
constraints at all corporations could do
anything they want
they all started flocking to New Jersey
that's why you have things like Standard
Oil of New Jersey and so on that forced
other states to go along you know to
destroy the traditional constraints as
well it's one of the reasons
incidentally why business is so much in
favor of devolution these days of
reducing power from the federal
government to the states then it's much
easier to play one State against another
and to make sure that public revenues
really go to the opulent minority not
anyone else so if federal grants go from
government the federal to state level
you can be pretty sure that the the New
Jersey legislation is a typical example
the intellectual roots of this
transition from corporations as
artificial partnerships to collectivist
legal institutions that the electoral
roots of that are nyoka galen do the
idea that organic entities that stand
over and above people have greater
rights than people the same intellectual
roots are the roots of fascism and
Bolshevism means and in fact the three
systems are very much on par
corporations fascism and Bolshevism I
think that becomes pretty clear when you
look at the thinking that lies behind
them that's the essentially the end of
the national rights doctrine the idea
that rights derive from the nature of
people there was a parallel shift which
is interesting the courts began to
change inul e the corporation was the
owners the participants like us if we
form a partnership that picture
gradually shifted and the corporation
was identified with the directors okay
not the people so the corporation became
so it became the directors in legal
theory there was a parallel shift in in
the bolshevik system in fact it was
predicted by rosa luxemburg and and by
Trotsky in fact in the early days before
he joined in himself what they pointed
out and predicted was that the bolshevik
system would
about the people but the and the working
class but the working class would be
placed under the rule of the party and
the party under the rule of the central
committee and the central committee
under the rule of the maximal leader
exactly what happened of course and very
much the same happened in the history of
our form of collectivist legal
institutions corporations as power as
the concept of what the corporation is
first of all it got a status as an
organic entity open up of people with
greater rights but also it became
identified with the central committee
not the participants and the leadership
the CEO even in legal theory those are
interesting parallels it should be more
discussed i think i should say that it
all of this was appalling to
conservatives genuine conservatives this
shift the collectivist legal
institutions was very much opposed by
conservatives who regarded the laws that
ratifies as laws that ratify a new
absolutism when being conservative legal
scholar put it establishing entities
that are like kings and princes and
destroying individual rights and of
course also destroying markets remember
that these are huge commands economies I
mean any business is an interference
with the market internally doesn't work
by market principles when you get to
these huge organic entities I mean
internally market principles are gone
and of course they're enormous another
one classic study Robert Brady Veblen ID
con amidst around nineteen forty point
in an important book pointed out that
these new corporate entities he said our
strict top to bottom absolute isms the
inverse of democratic control they
follow the strict conditions of
dictatorial power and if you look at the
structure you see that that's pretty
obvious equally obvious they cast the
shadow that we call politics over
society there are its tools and its
tyrants to quote GUI in Madison and
they're also of course dedicated to a
propaganda
program quoting Brady that becomes a
matter of converting the public to the
goals of the control pyramid it's
another matter of great importance for
contemporary democracy to not really
have time to go into but of enormous
importance again the kind of thing that
would be taught in high school civics
courses in a free society well that
brings us up to our present period the
question is often raised how
corporations affect democracy kind of an
odd question it's sort of like asking
how sulfuric acid affects metals or how
Lions affect lambs in the real world not
particularly friendly the they're
antithetical you know they're absolutely
antithetical in their internal structure
their totalitarian their influence and
control is extraordinary in economic
economy politics and social life as to
the means of communication which are
course essential to a democracy we don't
even have to ask that how corporations
influence them they just are
corporations and with consequences that
are quite predictable and we'll verified
as enormous international implications
as well which I can't go into well let
me just sum up there is a line of
thinking that goes from Aristotle right
through the Enlightenment and classical
liberalism to John Dewey others Bertrand
Russell and others in this century major
theme of the indigenous American working
class movements independently and it
seems to me to identify a very
significant and appropriate principles
about democracy and freedom in a sense
the business world agrees with this
except that the values are reversed that
is they're opposed to democracy for
perfectly obvious reasons although it's
okay if the shadow is properly cast and
power remains in the hands of
wealthy of the country the business
world is also opposed to markets again
for obvious reasons those selectively
markets are okay for temporary advantage
when the playing field is properly
tilted typically as a result of
large-scale state intervention that's a
leading thesis of economic history from
England right up Phil the new clean
growth areas of East Asia the United
States is a dramatic example
illustrating that from its origins as a
highly protectionists country relying
heavily on state power for industrial
development and that goes right up to
today to the celebration of the World
Trade Organization on telecommunications
a couple of weeks ago meanwhile the
society resist and over time it has it
has never accepted the principle of the
new science that people have no rights
the societies resisted in various ways
and over time it's expanded the reach of
human rights of democracy it's a
painfully slow process it's also sick
like their periods of regression we're
in a period of significant regression
right now in my opinion but over time I
think you can sort of sense a slow
advance towards something like the
Aristotelian principles now however
extended beyond his category of freemen
and towards a conception of human rights
that has been much enriched and widened
by intensive popular struggle over the
years all of this goes on in parallel to
increasing power for the new absolutists
absolutism of the corporations the new
kings and princes that conservatives
condemned ascent a century ago as did
working men and women well the long-term
outcome of that conflict is
unpredictable but I think it's important
to stress that it is controllable
there's a major propaganda effort
underway now to make people feel
hopeless
send resign it's all out of control you
know mysterious forces of globalization
and markets and that's not the other
thing almost total fraud when you look
at it but understandable it makes people
feel hopeless resigned passive you know
what can I do look for survival
strategies these are human decisions and
human institutions are there under
popular control in principle and even in
practice if there's sufficient
dedication in support of democracy and
human rights even the famous
globalization is not dramatically
different in scale from say early in
this century and the extent to which it
is different is easily under public
control as for the institution's
themselves and like others including the
fascist and Bolshevik forms of
absolutism they have to demonstrate
their legitimacy as always in human life
if they can't demonstrate their
legitimacy they should be dismantled as
has often happened in the past and
dismantling them makes it may make it
possible at least to advance towards
fundamental principles of justice and
freedom that are quite deeply rooted in
the traditions of thought and popular
struggle for thousands of years thanks
okay yeah must be early in the morning
talking about your recommendation be for
corporations does should they be
eliminated or Israel his of a trend
toward changing them adapting them to
the democratic ideals well my feeling
about corporations is very much like my
feeling about Bolshevism and fascism to
which they which they resemble in a
short term period you want to reform
them okay so if you're living under say
the rule of a king you know it makes
sense to plead with the King to be to
act more kindly to his subject you know
and that's always good you know instead
so don't torture as many people and you
know give more gifts to poor people and
so on and that makes good sense when the
population of the united states by 22
one says that corporations ought to
sacrifice profits for communities and
workers that ninety-five percent
majority is saying the king ought to be
more benevolent not so harsh and that's
good I group that the King ought to be
more benevolent but of course you can go
a little further and say is the
institution legitimate at all and I
don't think it is for the reasons I
discuss so therefore it ought to be
dismantled and workers ought to be the
masters of their own industrial fate as
do we put it and all the rest you know
our way back to Lincoln and you know
back to Aristotle and so on now it's
kind of an interesting commentary on the
way the propagandist the doctrinal
system has functioned that ideas that
were standard among you know mill hands
and Lowell a hundred years ago sound
unimaginable today I mean they were
saying look the institution's
illegitimate
it's infringing on our rights as free
men and women we're not they were not
asking the autocracy to be more
benevolent they were saying it should
disappear because we want to enjoy the
rights that we want in the American
Revolution or so they thought nowadays
that's almost unthinkable and the most
that can be asked for is that the
absolutism be more benevolent that the
King act a little more nicely well
that's a tremendous victory of a
propaganda system in which educated
sectors have played the leading role
after all should remember that we're
talking about ourselves and it has very
it's been extremely hard for a hundred
eighty years now there has been an
effort to drive out of people's heads
normal ordinary human sentiment and to
make them think just for themselves you
want things just for yourself you know
instill the new spirit of the age gain
wealth forgetting all of itself you have
no rights of it but you can get on the
market with of course that Bigfoot note
that the rich and the powerful insist on
massive protection from the nanny state
in extreme forms under say Reagan and
Gingrich put always and it's been a very
hard battle to get that across but it's
you know over time it has worked so now
people don't even think about being free
the most they think about is asking the
ruler to be more benign but to get back
to your question I don't think we should
limit ourselves to that yeah it's
important to ask the ruler to be more
benign so for example I think we should
urgently do something about the fact
that we are facing a major social crisis
as the advocates of a powerful nanny
state for the rich are kicking our
continuing a massive war that they've
been conducting for 15 years against
children and families and women
particularly and are winning it they're
going to be out in the streets hungry
the main effect of the welfare reform
and certainly its purpose is to lower
wages for poor people I mean didn't take
a genius to figure that out
obviously if you force people notice the
assumptions that underlie that as well
the assumption is that women who are
raising children have to be sent to the
workforce the implication it's no work
to raise children that just sort of you
know comes free like raising children
taking care of a home that's not work
anybody who's had a child knows that
what's work is going to the office in
downtown Boston and speculating against
currencies to lower growth rates that's
work and you can sort of prove it
because after all we live in a
meritocratic society so you measure the
value of work by the amount you get paid
for raising child you get paid zero for
speculating against currencies to lower
growth rates you get paid huge amounts
so those guys must be doing real work
and now we've got to take these other
people who aren't doing any work just
raising children taking care of homes
and so on we have to make them work but
of course they're going to have to work
at government subsidized jobs at below
minimum wages which simply harms the
lower sector of the workforce naturally
now you know there's a principle of law
that you can determine intent by
predictable outcome you know if you can
if the outcome is predictable you use
that as evidence for intent which means
that obviously this was the intent of
the law the intent is to continue the
major battle against families and
children and women and the poor
generally and the same thing abroad but
now also to harm even further the what's
called unskilled labor sounds like a
small part of the work for except that
it's seventy percent of the workforce
and that's proceeding and we should do
something about that so I think that
should be immediately on the agenda make
the autocrats be less brutal and cruel
but I don't think they should have the
right to rule either I think we should
be able to understand what mill hands
and Massachusetts or Abraham Lincoln or
others understood
if one assumes that nationalism
represents a possible threat to
democracy isn't one possible antidote
the multinational corporation our is the
is the Cure worse than the illness well
first of all I don't think that
nationalism in itself is a threat to
democracy I mean nationalism is you know
it has all kinds of facets nationalism
can involve a focus on the richness and
authenticity of individual cultures for
example I mean natural if nationalism is
exclusive and oppressive yeah it can be
a threat to freedom if on the other hand
nationalism means accentuating and
enriching your traditional cultures than
quotient so nationalism in itself I
don't think you can say anything about
pent out it's used as to the Cure
multinational corporations yeah that's a
we could have an East India Company
running running the world I don't see
what that cures that's you know form of
absolutism kind of like Bolshevism and
fascism so it's not a cure for anything
you know it's just an increase in the
power of absolutist institutions I mean
here I entirely agree with conservative
with the few conservatives who are
ground there are probably aren't any
anymore but the ones who are around a
century ago
incidentally these multinational
corporations just for to eliminate some
illusions about this there are there are
some very good technical studies of
multinational corporations but that's
when I know is it's any truck but
there's a very good and highly regarded
technical study by two British
economists just came out recently the
best one they study the top corporations
in the fortune list of international
corporations and what they find is that
they are really national corporations
they're not multinational overwhelmingly
their sales are domestic their powers
domestic they rely essentially on their
national governments to protect them
there on conclusion is that of the top
hundred on the fortune list everyone has
benefited from industrial policies of
its home government and more than twenty
have been able to survive as businesses
because of takeover or bailout by their
own government that's over 20 out of 100
that includes for example Lockheed
gingrich's favorite cash cow which was
saved from destruction by a huge
government bailout well that's you know
that's the top multinational
corporations they're not really
transmitted they're very few that are
really transnational there domestically
based they rely on the powerful state
and there and on local markets they do
international eyes but not to the extent
that's believed furthermore most of the
interactions among them about 75% are in
Europe Japan and the United States that
is at seventy-five percent of the
transactions well those are three areas
of the world where formal mechanisms do
exist parliamentary mechanisms to
control all of this without fear of
military kuz that father
forget title of the book but something
about came out about a year ago and it's
the major technical study of
multinationals moment they're very
skeptical about the whole idea of
globalization as are plenty of other
people if you look at gross figures of
trade flow and investment and so on and
so forth relative to the economy it's
not much different than it was in the
early part of the century under the gold
standard there are some differences but
mostly in short-term financial
speculation that's everything to
understand correctly I take it that your
view is fairly optimistic and a fit in
the following regard that you don't
regard the existence of these large
organizations as an inevitable result of
a sort of technological determinism or
scientific determinism I don't think
there's anything to do with it I mean
the you know this I'm first I think one
should be extremely skeptical about that
for one thing you should just initially
people always ought to be skeptical when
some view is put forth that makes you
passive and resigned and happens to
benefit the people who are putting forth
the view okay that's already initial
grounds for skepticism for a reasonable
person when you look at this could be
true but you know you're kind of you
start reaching for your wallet at that
point the in this case I think it's just
not true I mean takes a information
technology you know the big new wave of
the future I mean it can be used to
dominate and control it can be used to
liberate to you know the same
information technology that can
concentrate decision-making in you know
offices in New York and Zurich and the
you know London that same technology can
be used to provide information to
working people in a factory in real time
so they can make their own choices and
in the bottom of the information doesn't
care this has been pretty well studied
in some cases with very interesting
results there's a couple of interesting
books by Dave noble used to be at MIT
not there some argue because of these
books but all that others debate that in
which he studied the he's a he studies
the development of modern technology and
industry very good modern historic
economic historian he he dealt
specifically in these books with the
machine tool industry numerical control
of machine tools so you know that's
computer-controlled machine tools big
central part of the economy and he
discovered that the the technology like
most technology was developed in the
public sector industry doesn't want to
waste money on research and development
that can be used by anybody they want
the public to pay for that okay that's
one of the ways in which the public pays
the costs of advanced industry and
transfers public resources to the rich
so it was all developed in the public
sector meaning you know the Army in the
Navy and so on that was true of
automation generally and virtually
everything in the contemporary economy
internet is a dramatic case I which
we're just seeing transferred into
public private hands right now the he
pointed out that he went in detail
through the ways in which these
technologies were developed and he
pointed out I think pretty convincingly
that the you could have done it in two
different ways the methods could have
been developed so as to place
decision-making power into the hands of
skilled mechanics who would sort of run
you know the work flow and decide what's
going to happen or you could use the
same technology to D skill workers and
to put the control
process in the hands of managerial
sectors which is incidentally highly
inefficient from an economic point of
view because managers are essentially
waste you know the the United States has
many more than other countries we have
got three times the level of managerial
control of other comparable countries
the and that was designed the second way
you know not because of the technology
but for power interests it was designed
to D skill workers and empower managers
and the bosses well yeah could be used
for that and it was and of course when
you work through the state sector that's
what's going to happen because those are
the guys who control the state sector
but his argument is and you can see how
convincing it is I think quite
convincing that it the technology could
have allowed the opposite as far as I
can see that's true of just about
anything it's very hard to find an
argument for a technological imperative
look look for it I mean you hear it all
the time but you should always be
skeptical when you hear that because
that argument is an argument that says
look you're powerless just you know
suffer in silence and meanwhile I
benefit I mean anytime an argument has
those properties you should be skeptical
and you should want a strong argument I
don't see one in this case
could you please tell us what you see is
the alternative and if there are any
examples of a well-functioning
alternative and how we would transition
from our current system to that
alternative no there's alternatives just
as there were alternatives to feudalism
and slavery and the Bolshevism and
fascism namely dismantle the repressive
institutions and place power in popular
hands it's always it's never an
all-or-none business you know so there's
elements of it all over the place for
example unions let's say were a big
attack on the privileged character of
the private power of the opulent
minority these the sort of social
contract that developed from around the
mid 19th century was the result of a
social reaction to the new science and
its doctrines I mean what basically
happened is the if you look at the
history the vibe around eighteen the
1830s it looked like the Masters had won
the day you know end of history and all
that sort of thing the in England that
is they had legislated you know the
rules of the new science people have no
rights can't live on the market go
somewhere else etc the only problem was
that it turned out that the British Army
was spending all of its time putting
down riots because people got the weird
idea that if we don't have a right to
live and you don't have a right to rule
you know and then it got worse because
they started labor organizing and the
Chartist movement moot came along and so
on well you know fortunately the science
is rather flexible since it largely is
an instrument of ideological warfare and
it just changed so the same people who
were giving the old story like NASA a
senior now said yeah turns out according
to the new science that the people do
have other rights by the time you get to
say John Stuart Mill you have sort of
you know kind of a social democratic
picture of political economy and that
leads the way to the social contract in
the welfare state
okay that was an improvement took a long
time to reach the United States the
United States didn't really come until
1930s and it was always weak at how weak
it is you can see by looking at the
newspapers right now for example in
South Korea workers are struggling
rather bitterly right now to protect
themselves from laws that have always
been in force in the United States in
the United States the laws have always
permitted corporations to fire workers
and replace them not just with scabs
which is bad enough but with permanent
replacement workers meaning kick them
out if they try to organize I mean that
the United States has been censured for
that by the International Labour
Organization I think it's the only
industrial country to have been censured
but here it's kind of taken for granted
in South Korea you know they don't
accept it and that's what the big
struggles are going on with industries
trying to impose it in the government
and the working people are rejecting it
so you know we don't the idea that we
have to go teach people how to be free
you know funny idea but the all of these
are steps have been steps forward there
are a lot of rights that were not
recognized before at voting rights for
example french eyes economic right
social rights are always under attack
right now it happened to be under sharp
attack and there have been more serious
attack against the whole conception of
the absolutist rule so they're all over
the place but maybe the biggest one is
in spain the big monitor Gunn
enterprises which is one of the most
successful economic enterprises in Spain
industry banks communities and so on
it's essentially worker owned this came
out of a kind of a left Catholic
tradition and it's you know it's not
utopia like it has managers and so on
but it's worker owned and been very
successful one of the more successful
parts of the Spanish and European
economy is in fact and there's other
things all over the place that you can
look at I but these are just constant
battles
I mean there's a constant effort to
construct you know to intensify the
system of absolutist control and state
power supporting the rich Reagan and
Gingrich for extremes and there's always
a popular struggle against it as to the
asking is there a viable alternative to
absolutist rule that doesn't really mean
much it's like asking in the 18th
century is there a viable alternative to
kings and princes well you know you
couldn't point the one you couldn't
point to a parliamentary democracy in
the 18th century did that mean you
couldn't have parliamentary democracy no
doesn't mean that I mean you could have
it but you have to create it
you pretty much answered my question but
basically what I was going to ask is
along the other alternatives is there I
think pretty much is there an
alternative to institutional means of
production and I think other other ways
of arranging production yeah I mean you
sort of seem to be hinting that view the
way to go is to sort of impose
regulations that would ensure more
democratic institutions and the means of
production is that well I think it's not
so much impose regulations that would
ensure it i think absolutist
institutions should not be given legal
status I don't think we should give
legal status to organic entities that
stand over and above the rights of
individuals whether they're called
fascism or Bolshevism or corporations or
whatever so I I do think that human
rights come from that are sort of rooted
in human nature really and that these
collectivist institutions are not
persons it shouldn't have right how
should the production be organized well
you know I don't think that's a trivial
question the answer you have to sort of
experiment but the principles ought to
be I think pretty much the ones that
were expressed by mill hands and lola
century ago those who work in the mills
or own and they ought to carry out to
Democratic decision making about how
they work in conjunction with
communities who play a role as consumers
and families and participants and so on
there are a lot of modalities in which
that could be worked out but I don't
know there are people who in fact have
sketched out detailed proposals
personally I'm a little skeptical I
don't think anyone's smart enough to
design a society at least I don't know
how but I think you have to sort of try
you know try various things see how they
work and so on
I I realized that a lot of our economic
system you know has a lot of flaws that
a lot of problem problems with it you
know like Rachel aber that's not
particularly pleasant that you know rich
have the big gap between rich and poor
but I mean it's together now because
there's been like increasing standards
of living in America and isn't in that
one way like a justification for it the
wide still around why capitalism for
mine standing has triumphed and it's
still so much done I don't think so I
mean there was rising standards of
living in slave society slaves were much
better off in the early 19th century
than in the early 18th century said an
argument for slavery well I'm it's a
terrible argument you know I mean UN any
system in fact you can give that
argument for stalinism there was a very
substantial economic growth in Soviet
Union it's the second world not the
third it was until nineteen eighty nine
it was the second world not the third
world now it's back in the third world
because it's undergoing capitalist
reforms something you're not allowed to
say incidentally but if you read you'll
notice they've had 10 years of
capitalist reforms which have driven
them right back into the third world
where they came from okay but if you
just look at it in terms of economic
growth it was reasonably successful
that's exactly what bothered Western
leaders if you read the documentary
record right up to the 1960s where it
sort of runs dry at the moment you find
that the great concern was that the
second the Soviet Union was presenting
itself as a model for modernization
within a single generation and that was
raising all sorts of trouble not owning
a third world but even in the rich
countries I didn't care about Russian
aggression what they cared about or you
know Stalin's terror or anything and
didn't bother anybody in fact Truman
admired Stalin you know thought he's an
honest man you know deal with them and
so on he said he didn't care what
happens in Russia
so on but the name of Churchill insanely
who's defending Stalin and cabinet
meetings as a great man and so on and so
forth they kills Bay peoples they want
that's irrelevant the problem was then
they never expected them to be attacking
anybody you know but the what they were
afraid of was the economic growth which
was especially in the third world
considered quite impressive actually
seems true of Cuba the documents have
just been released and they're
interesting on Kennedy in the Kennedy
administration in Cuba and it's kind of
interesting to see the way the facts are
being hidden so for example just to
illustrate the when you know this thing
is going on at the World Trade
Organization the European Union has
brought charges against the United
States for violating the World Trade
Organization agreements with the
helms-burton act and the Cuban embargo
altogether and the United States is
isolated on that I mean in international
arena the only votes for the united
states are israel which is reflexive
that's like saying the ukraine voted
with Russia and in the old days so
Israel and Uzbekistan for some reason I
don't know what whose Beckett's done and
Israel are the only countries that voted
with the United States on this whole
european union's against it what was
interesting is that when the united
states i simply withdrawn from the world
trade organization jurisdiction says you
have no right to deal with us because
we're the boss of the world but the
reasons were interesting the reasons
were that this is a policy that goes
back they said falsely to the kennedy
administration we've had three decades
of policy of overthrowing the government
of cuba and the European Union has no
right to challenge our policies I was
Stewart eyes enhanced at the government
spokesman well there was no reaction to
that kind of interesting in itself it's
taken for granted that we have a right
to overthrow another government if we
feel like it and if anyone challenges
that they're off base but there was an
interesting response on narrower ground
by Arthur Schlesinger in the New York
Times
and he said to said want to remind his
friend Stuart eyes and hats that that he
misunderstood the Kennedy administration
policies the policies he said were based
on i'm quoting Castro's troublemaking in
the hemisphere and the Soviet connection
but now that's past so it's an
anachronism well as Schlesinger was here
comes the discipline of the educated
classes for example the people in
fletcher school and so on who certainly
know what i'm going to tell you right
now the documents that came out not long
ago from the early 60s i bear directly
on this question Arthur Schlesinger was
the head of the Latin American mission
of the Kennedy of the incoming Kennedy
administration which was laying out you
know talking about the problems and the
plans for Cuba and there he explains
what trouble making in the hemisphere
means and what the Soviet connection
means he said the problem with Castro he
said is the I'm quoting the spread of
the castro idea of taking matters into
your own hands okay which he said has
great appeal to people in Latin America
most of whom live in terrific poverty
and oppression and are trying to find a
more decent life and with the model of
this Cuba in front of them they're
likely to do all sorts of things so
that's Castro's trouble making in the
hemisphere what's the Soviet connection
well the Soviet connection he said is
that in the background the Soviet Union
is presenting itself as a model for
modernization in a single generation ok
that's the Soviet connection well yeah
so therefore we have to overthrow the
government because of that kind of
troublemaking and that kind of
connection and in fact that extends much
more broadly you know Kennedy and
McMillan in their discussions in the
early 60s were worried about the Anora
for economic growth of the Soviet Union
what it would imply the same was true of
Dulles saying goes right back to
nineteen seventy so the facts of the
opposite of what you're describing
perhaps my question could be put
little differently if if this system is
so bad and everything why hasn't there
been excuse me higher system our system
insult is so bad why hasn't why hasn't
there been grated movements to challenge
it well he's in challenged all the time
I mean we have a for example we have a
very violent labor history and hundreds
of American workers were being killed
right into the late 30 I finally they
got labor right there has been a very
extensive challenge through the through
the 50s in the sixties the whole thing
blew up and in fact many concessions had
to be made and it still continues I mean
we right now happen to be in a period of
regression but as I say it's cyclic you
know it was much more regression in the
1920s when labor was really crushed so
yes there's always challenge and
struggle but when you say is the system
so bad I don't even know what that means
I mean slave societies went on for
centuries and centuries without any
challenge okay did that justify them and
in fact if you really want to be serious
about it the slave owners were giving
arguments rather like yours so slavery
very much like it take a read say George
fits you who was the leading spokesman
for the American you know South slave
owners in the south at the time when it
was becoming a serious issue like around
1840s he had pretty powerful arguments
in favor of slavery what he was saying
is he was saying is look the reason you
northers northerners are against slavery
is because you're any Negro racists we
are not racists we think that you should
take care of your subjects so we treat
them nicely and we even do that on
economic grounds because there are
capital you know like if I on make an
anachronistic analogy if if I buy a car
and you rent a car okay and somebody
comes a year later and has a look at the
two cars which car is not be in better
shape okay well mine because I own it so
I'm going to take care of it not yours
because you rent it you can just throw
it away
get another one okay that's exactly
Fitzhugh's argument he says look we on
people you just rent them so therefore
we take care of them we treat them well
we respect them there are capital
besides we have human relations with
them we are pre-capitalist we still have
human relations you just treat them as
tools under wage slavery and they're
much worse off and so we're the ones who
are moral you're the ones or tomorrow
and in fact under under the slave system
if you take a look it was reasonably
efficient you know conditions were sort
of improving people live better slaves
live better in 1850 then 1750 okay
everything you're saying could stand as
a perfectly good or not I could be a
good argument for slavery but was
offered as an argument for slavery
similar arguments were given for
Bolshevism our tix a fascism and why was
hitler so popular now Hitler was the
most up through the 30s it was the most
popular leader probably in German
history well the reason is he carried
out a social revolution people are
living a lot better I mean like not
everybody you know not Jews for example
but people were but Germans were living
a lot better it was very successful
Hitler on either understood or you know
figured out or his advisers did that
large scale scale state expenditures
could rescue a morbid capital economy
from destruction pretty much what
American business learned during the
Second World War and he was doing it and
it was the economy was booming they were
better off and so on is that an argument
for fascism I like to thank dr. Chomsky
for a great speech and a good exchange
that followed on behalf of Epic I like
to thank all of you for participating at
11 right now in about 10 minutes the
report of the pilot citizens panel on
telecommunications is being held in
coolidge hall and baloo so I should rush
over to that
