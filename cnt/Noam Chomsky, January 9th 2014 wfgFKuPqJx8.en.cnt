I doubt it very much I don't see any
sign of it there may be some
reevaluation of drones in the future
because of something that is discussed
in the professional journals has made it
to the mainstream yet and that is that
as drone technology improves its being a
perfect weapon for terrorists you can
already buy a small drum for a hundred
dollars on the internet unless they get
smaller more effective the perfect
errors weapons and they'll probably be
used that's what happens to technology
that won't there baby some rethinking
but I don't see anything
I think the u.s. is going to pull out
all the stops to try to apprehend him
somehow and unless he's very cautious
you will probably be never ended and
subjected to a pretty harsh punishment
it's a pretty addictive assistant
natural liftin strangling Cuba for 50
years of in a complete international
isolation and get a load to the General
Assembly they more selective Israel but
it's sort of a mafia doctrine you just
don't permit defiance of the mess
well the United States is unusual and
that there's an immense propaganda
campaign what we funded to try to
convince people that is there's no
climate change or if it is it's not not
a panic and it creates a certain amount
of confusion on the part of the
population understandably I'm their
major networks like Fox that are devoted
to trying to confuse people on this so
the only do that the only answer is
education organization or no other
mechanisms
because they're not I bet them about the
individuals those corporate powers that
are behind it sure they understand
what's happening they simply rank
short-term profit the higher than
destruction of the possibility of the
decent life in the future that's a
pretty natural corporate culture and
then and it's a business run society to
a large extent so unfortunately that's
reality baguettes face
it's belated at least decriminalization
which is sure a felicitation should have
taken place a long time but there's no
real basis other than prejudice racism
history for criminalisation marijuana I
mean there there are substances that are
vastly more lethal but tobacco and
alcohol are criminalized there may be
efforts that discourage the use to do
that's but in the case of marijuana
attaching goes back to literally
straight races reasons and as bill
justification the United States is again
pretty isolated on this infected the
last emissary conference in Colombia ugh
leaders ago there was no consensus that
could be reached on any of the issues
and the reason was that the United
States and Canada refused to go along
with the rest of the hemisphere two
issues one was bringing two back into an
asterick affairs gee listen Janet
refused the others decriminalization of
the drugs mainly gonna wanna the
hemisphere almost entirely wants to move
in that direction he was
refuse latin america are the victims of
this that's where the killing takes
place the fumigation which account the
warfare driving off the land tens of
thousands of people being murdered in
mexico there they does the source of the
problem is here the US are narrow is the
source of demand but also incidentally
supply majority of the guns being used
Mexico or coming from the southern
states here comes easily some of your
favorite cartel so they're the victims
that we're the problem that we were used
to do anything about the US and Canada
are simply going to be separated from
that message earnest and significant
steps towards decriminalization or even
legalization didn't face all over the
world that have been quite successful
such you cut down music ribbons and us a
lacquer that's been the couple's nature
as good deal of work um relation between
music and language experts on the best
words number right here they're quite
interesting question what are another
form of music seems to be a cultural
universal dance also and first language
is this an interesting question about
what but the origins aren't what the
relations are there even interesting
then questions which are being explored
about neural globalization so for
example it seems that musical memory is
dissociated from some other forms of
memory not as far as i know from
linguistic memory so it'd be interesting
to note can a person retain language
would lose Ava's musical memories or
conversely as far as I'm aware there is
no evidence in that regard there are
other kinds of dissociation and there
are structural similarities between
musical forms associated classical
the language future suggested so it's a
rich area
