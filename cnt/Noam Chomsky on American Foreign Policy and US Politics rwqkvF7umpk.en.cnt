Part without emails 
Harris always got what this got 
Barnes Professor at Biotechnology did 
Not sure you are supposed to have this type of restaurant and other than try 
Made out of twelve but I have some time with it 
presentaci great pleasure after you are here 
Graduate Haha Gray Depo is now written or more than a hundred specialty 
Prolific at the very least books 
From American dominance including in the new specs that the SEB mandarin will be repeated 
Perhaps from the media apparently equaled cited filming of history is taking place 
I only care behind leaving the marks of Shakespeare are the hidden BH Bible 
Plato and Freud 
Or argument of the Bible upright in the new sis his new book hope some expectations 
Well without jobs for the first time in the book she talks about the US State Department 
Policy 
Already starting out soon with your fans is not great for an exceptional American idea 
ism 
So let me start perhaps really from asking you what you think of 
The main problems with American fork balls 
Who paralyzes hopefully that stands out I'm not a fan of American Gallery had it 
This is like saying I am not Hanover fast 
The moon is called green trees 
Not Found 
OK 
Strong straightened out fast habit 
They consider themselves exceptionally impressive 
The United States is no exception 
good 
The basis for a visit 
Not too big before that 
politely 
The problems with American foreign policy is our 
It is rooted in the central nature that we are the ace 
We know that 
So we can know if we want to tell you to go back to 
They say the second world war 
Upon returning to the point where u_s_ became a world power 
Before that he had wanted it largely occupied in the national territory 
Conservative population 
Including Mexico 
And expanded to uh ... 
Ea statute 
Pretty much take control of the Western Hemisphere 
The data is not stable 
You know invaded the Philippines killed a few hundred thousand people however 
The real global power after that time Britain was the others to them 
The unit that was not 
Global Po 
I became a soldier in the book World War 
And uh ... the planners died 
Carefully plan the year completely 
How to run the post-war world 
Uh ... 
Tho in 
It was the basic idea that there should be what they call grandparents 
U_s_ which will be totally under control 
During which u_s_ will not be tolerated 
Uh ... any expression of sovereignty 
He stepped in with u_s_ global designs 
One that would be a competitor of course allowed to untuk u_s_ 
The area is very expensive to have been included 
Western Hemisphere 
Asian user 
Huh 
That the former British Empire that u_s_ the take over includes 
Crucially 
Uh ... energy reserves in the Middle East 
With 
That are in the main ones of the world and death 
Pointed out that the planners uh ... 
Whether we control the Middle East or we can control the world 
Uh ... hence you will of course included as much of your Asia as possible 
At least for the service 
Commercial and industrial center of Western Europe 
It was good that a very small big area 
And i will guarantee that granbury of u_s_ uh ... 
With it the limit is the dominion of Sandoval, that is, the exercise of sovereignty 
Well of course uh ... 
He spoke to a large extent speaking poetry in the following years of 
a path 
He was just too ambitious to order 
With a bit of power turned v'll 
Who are the rubles 
Uh ... 
Uh ... is that decolonization that uh ... 
This week uh ... another ball re-industrial powers 
war results 
The night before before I think you have to have an Elmo 
Over the world and basically try economically poor 
North American-based u_s_ postpaid 
Europe mostly on the basis of German and uh ... at the time Japan on the basis that it is applicable Asia 
Big economic powers 
Anderson spent pregnant women in that organization more 
Whenever fiscal policy remains little 
And uh ... that's why we have maybe 800 military bases around the world 
Not anyone else 
Why do we have 
Spending a lot on the military is uh ... relative to the rest of the world combined 
A more technologically advanced art with 
Keep destroying uh ... 
Plan to be able to override anything force anything 
And uh ... why did we spectral dollars invade two countries in 
Center 
Middle east ... uh occupy central asia selling books to them 
And on and on those very serious problems 
Silt binder 
Let's try to find out or you can tell us why you think we can do these things 
Of course we get to this idea that is for freedom and democracy 
Uh ... but what the real goal was power and that was money 
Who and who makes decisions and why 
When she did the position too 
The decisions were made in the 1940s which I discussed in 
Government and agreement is another point 
Government planning and implementation departments 
He suggests ghost is wrong 
But remember that the state director is the closest very lean linked 
To focus private capital 
For the corporate sector 
The financial industry in recent years and others 
Army notes or energy companies 
Closer mechanisms 
Whereas, the basis is the implementation of the plan 
And it is not very surprising that the plan is implemented on their interests 
However, this is how it is always done 
This is intended for you Adams data guys for women 
Talk about England 
Correctly indicated 
One of the policy engineer 
They are the people who are mainly on the country and out today 
Manufacturers 
And maybe she has to ensure her own interests are 
Very well served with motorhome 
Agree that any influence on others including the people of England's mother ... 
Perch took us 
This is one of my simple intuition 
Energy systems generally hold it 
It is not a big surprise but uh ... we are like other power systems 
Without apprehending his last book he tells uh ... 
Of course hopes and aspects first occur jobs so it is an example of cigarettes 
Guidance 
That old wraxall 
Hussein was 16 of our conquest of Iraq and it is as simple as saying hey 
Defense contractor will earn money Albert will earn money, and therefore we do not 
Going to Iraq because of that now there are other forces each one of those 
Words reflect strong reasons for invading Iraq 
Records from the world's second largest oil reserves 
It is right in the heart 
Uh from ... what the Middle East is the main energy uh ... reservation 
From the world 
China Casbah 
The regime was the client, and it has a large military base in Iraq and access to 
Preferential access to its resources 
Of great credit to the people who are 
Irene counterparts dealers manufacturers 
Uh ... energy companies 
From industrial companies, banks, and so on, this mission did not 
It was styled sanitary status defeated 
He defeated u_s_ goals in Iraq 
A very important fact 
From the beginning of the cycle of all kinds of pretexts 
You know we're going to uh ... with their weapons tied up with you all cried 
You know weapons of mass destruction that collapsed when uh ... there was new 
The leading democracy was brought in 
In fact, u_s_ fought democracy every step of the way 
They tried to block the elections when he couldn't random but uh ... 
He tried to manipulate Clement to carry on right through through 
End 
19 work out of eight thousand 
When it was very clear that u_s_ would not change its goals 
The Bush administration 
Barney started talking about what to do 
Until November 12 
2007 January 2008 there were 
Uh ... strong 
Important announcements by management and dating 
He said they discussed what dot com should be 
We could have talked about the Special Forces Agreement, what to do 
Included 
At that time they were ordering 
I knew what it should include 
Hobby ... 
UIT 
u_s_ right to use 
Military bases in Iraq 
At the end as a basis for other combat operations and the privilege of access 
For u_s_ 
Iraqi energy resources 
U_s_ corporate 
He said that this will quite clearly that they are going desperate 
Likewise, she didn't get any of those 
The united nations it was not able to uh ... 
But uh ... suppressing Iraqi nationalism 
Now u_s_ to kill a number of militants that was not a big deal 
But they could not deal with his counterpart brought together non-violent popular resistance 
It was in the back 
Down 
Step by step maturity 
Find books from any direct friends of the leading companies at 
Grocery stores analysts people like uh ... 
Jonathan Steele that 
Ava Gardner potential times other cities have addresses such as defeat 
Defeated u_s_ 
So but it is clear what war has so far been reasonable answers 
Seems like illegal in a week if the user is future solent's look at it in terms of 
That companies are about when you look but that was realization i 
Adoption is too late or else you may not understand why we are one of the oil when we were 
Do not get loyalty of course 
People were the American ruling bride and let my kids be nineteen 
The fifties 
The u_s_ was great 
It produces your source 
An interest 
But nevertheless, it was dedicated to the management of Eisenhower u_s_. 
It was dedicated to monitoring the Middle East 
Oral Middle East before the mentioned reasons i 
Planners admitted 
That if we dominate the Middle East or we can dominate the world 
And on this carrier sit 
You can control what others do 
Whether we use it or not 
Eisenhower management protection 
For the sake of uh ... 
For the benefit of Texas oil producers 
Insist on exhausting our local stock 
Using the reserves went home care and uh ... 
Instead of buying much cheaper ... mother of the Middle East yellow 
Well thought out 
Those profits were short-term accounts 
But in general apart Perry was not presented in favor of the population 
Scarcely 
It may not be limited to only eight or anywhere else 
So we are what Afghanistan looking uh ... we have President Obama design women 
Of course we extend our stay there anymore 
Knowing how you think this decision gets made I mean he is a president in a while 
Decision-making or actually I don't think it's the main decision but 
Quad institutions in a specific direction 
To walk us through it if you are and how you can relate to what we have been 
Was discussed here because that is innocent 
Uh ... they don't have much oil that they have pipelines but they haven't 
One 
The state is famous for surgery 
We return to what but when Bush invaded I bought a man 
laboratory 
And he said uh ... 
People would go and get better positioned to know what to do about it 
You know very well that there are many books there but for that 
Bob Woodward's example book goes last 
In detail about what he was told by the insiders about the position 
Maybe this is just not worth looking at however 
And they will but we hope that we do not have internal documents that we have to 
Meditation 
My holiday weapon inspector 
It is that Obama and his advisers make the political decision 
They understand that uh ... they know that unpopular wars 
A majority of the population yet believes that we shouldn't either 
But they also know 
If they leave Afghanistan without something they can call it 
win over 
And it will be 
Slaughtered by the publicity wing system right 
And how to share their specifications try to find a way to do 
hang on 
Long enough 
So it couldn't be a situation that maybe she could tell is their victory in 
Partially withdrawn 
Lamar that a sub-sample is trying the same in Iraq 
For us in the city I like the old town as the latest book calls out some expectations 
Prescott who deserves any bright spots in American foreign policy 
for a while 
She settled it 
Non-encroachment technical recruiter complete their poems damage that word 
Long-term interest of the people 
Error choosing a Marshall Plan 
He was personally second in his favor at the time but without illusions 
The Marshall Plan was a good plan aimed at 
How helpful in recovering Europe 
But its main goal 
Work for u_s_ corporate power 
Now that it has been barely hidden 
When I remember which situation 
Most of it is done by motivating us to the industrial world that it destroyed 
World War II 
Although u_s_ which was already the richest country in the world 
Industrial production is almost four times 
We literally had half the world's wealth 
At the end of World War II 
And u_s_ manufacturers 
It was a huge surplus 
Uh ... and need it in a market 
Also where is the market on the body 
Only in other industrial societies 
They even had a real test captured with taxpayer money to help others 
Rebuilding industrial societies 
And after you know the IA market for the u_s_ industry 
But also space for expansion 
In it the multinationals have somehow actually got to start it 
I knew this was not especially my idea that you could read it in Reagan said 
The same is true, Ministry of Commerce said 
The business press rebound well understood 
But preparation done but we should have no illusions 
Bite but not the best we can all four enlightened self-interest where we have yes 
Companies make money however 
It also helps to rebuild 
Parts of large portions of Europe are anisha and grabs this is not as bad as this 
The thing that is actually very good 
Uh ... point 
I spread unemployment from 
Uh ... I don't think it's the best I could hope for 
I do not think the best you can go or choose a country from the Soviet Union 
Is that uh ... 
And support in Eastern European countries 
Uh ... to the extent that it was actually richard misery union 
And it's 
Better that they do it today 
Traded in the way we deal with its colonies 
Well but I don't think this is the most I can open the door and I haven't but I 
No praise of work 
Well ... uh misuse 
They get a broad question but you think our system is that was the cabinet 
Along 
We don't really have a democracy on time 
We had a ripple 
Marketing issue praised and yes or no 
It is not even more or less fare that has many dimensions 
Or in some respects the United States is very free 
You will go for example or 
He takes freedom of speech 
Which are protected 
It was more in the United States than any other country in Ohio 
This is probably a very good friend 
Achieve not in the Bill of Rights and by the way 
It is not the treatment most obtained in the sixties 
That's when the Supreme Court cases are a big factor 
Reached within 
Impact of the civil rights movement, and so on 
But there are now speeches of freedom 
Much uh ... 
Uh ... hey protect Carly 
Much more than them 
Other countries and a lot of it is good 
on the other side 
We just hardly have a political problem 
9 fifty years ago he mentioned that u_s_ dallas president 
Especially one political party in the business party 
With two factions called Republicans and Democrats 
And they hope all down a little 
They are in the best interest of their business department 
The novel is sometimes from 
Some help to residents sometimes not 
You can see it all the time 
Olympic President Obama's update 
Was a little bit 
The essence of the response 
There were financial institutions 
From now they are the most important part of 
And most of the economy contributes a lot to the birthday of the economy 
Heaven does not weigh much they are perhaps at forty percent of corporate profits 
good 
Very doubtful what contributes to the economy in the immediate with too 
strong 
And uh ... is that the corresponding 
According to the traditions of politics u_s_ that would have been studied completely 
Well documented 
This tradition is in 
The case is usually with 
Concentration of financing 
Everywhere all the time of politics 
Financiers expect to pay off 
Blue it was not a big surprise but uh ... 
The biggest beneficiary of Obama's domestic politics 
Where are the financial institutions who take very to the economy 
And you can see it right away 
One of the people we chose as his economic advisors was not there 
Find out about the Nobel Prize who had to 
Where was that 
Condemned a politician that led to the crisis uh ... 
It was not people or like 
The youngest technician is Paul Krugman and others 
He chose the people who created the crisis 
One of the basics 
Robert Rubin over there 
Plumbers are the puzzle of the superintendent who is best known for doing us 
Undermine 
Regulation of derivatives is one of the main causes of the crisis 
Great writers and parents 
The answer is Yahoo stock exchange 
And the two created 
Save anonymous financial institutions in 
Obviously I needed something 
Financial institutions have destroyed the economy so that it has to be done 
Doubtful buttons right had to be done in a way that uh ... 
Enriches us with those who create the most powerful crisis ever made 
This is what you would expect from a policy path to work 
D now 
I think this is a conscious decision, but while all races know what I think 
Players who participated in the destruction of the economy anyway because these guys got paid by 
Not a conscious decision 
How to achieve that decision? 
Uh ... 
If you go back to the General Office of the Soviet Union 
And you ask what the people were thinking 
We had a good idea of   what they were thinking because we were there 
Internal published documents 
They were thinking that there is 
Saving democracy from the US-led fascist attack ... oh 
They're gonna make a generation 
It also benefits people 
You reject the fascists Anita 
We have tons of documents that are kept 
Pamper the country 
One of the only Japanese fascist document 
Overflowing 
your mercy 
When when they were carrying massive massacres in China 
They were bringing earthly paradise to China 
And protecting people from thieves were trying to undermine him 
So on and so forth 
It's very hard to go oh automatically you look you find themselves serving 
Creating ideologies 
SOS Obama brainwashed by the system 
You do not know anything about it Obama 
dust 
Psychological escape ms family 
After submitting the issues 
And I don't care what uh ... you know immigration and really fought 
I care what he did 
By itself and then finally six if we can deal with questions broadly resolved 
Been in this mess, and it's complete to the outside ... oh 
You and I may disagree over something but we agree that 
And all our politicians are bought their machine it's the system at Rick 
Pointed when we hear 
Uh ... how can we fix it 
If we can 
What we can do with Genentech if you look at how American history is there 
Then waves of progress and then decline 
So the current situation, for example 
Somewhat similar to the twenties 19 
1923 Inequality is enormous 
And about what it was in the 19th century 
Uh ... there was uh ... the labor movement has been largely destroyed 
Independent or a third of them 
That clearly represents friends 
Woodrow Wilson Red fears and other devices were still in operation 
19 twenties on the utopia of the masters of the end of history 
Well you know nineteen thirties changed radically 
It was the popular movement to stay here 
Democratization of the country that created it 
Very important ... uh the government was forced to create uh ... 
Care measures are great 
Social security uh ... workers rights uh ... 
This is who 
Much improved the country, and it was perfect 
But there has been a great improvement 
Affects the regulation of financial institutions 
that was good 
From the absence of any financial crises 
So I started to dismantle every million seventies and eighties 
You can't look at the 60s and the popular movement here for them 
Also lead to a great democratic transformation of the country 
puff 
Freedom of expression protection that i mentioned uh ... 
AA was the country to cede another civil rights movement 
Women's rights are a very important factor 
Creating the right to ethnic minorities and this is the most free and unjust society 
It can happen to me again that it will happen on his own 
Which sites 
Dedication effort 
What would happen if how did they do what we give up on the form we can so we Lauren 
You can do that now 
Secret pictures most know we have you old you but the fruit is gone 
Books apply to the modest mid-thirties was 
Very active in the sixties and there is no big secret 
Pitch-positive organization of devices 
California's dedication and commitment 
Choose appropriate procedures for cases with 
On that it works you can look through the details but we cannot not sit down 
Strikes in the thirties uh ... 
Organize uh ... in outreach groups for women in 
Sixties and seventies soon 
Any movement of war activity or all things work 
After that most of the cells have gone 
The book and discuss the latest southern seas are called some expectations 
Or thank you very much for joining Celia someone who has a way to do it again 
Well well good
