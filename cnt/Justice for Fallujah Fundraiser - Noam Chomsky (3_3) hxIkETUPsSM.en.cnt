so anyway the Iraqi coup with these
dangerous objectives was what's called a
virus and the diplomatic literature you
have to eliminate it and it was quickly
eliminated John F Kennedy who was a
specialist and murderous military kuz
that instituted vicious brutal
dictatorships carried out one and with
the help of the British in Iraq in 1963
CIA organized a coup I did throw out the
government ended these threats CIA
distributed the Baath Party is the ones
who executed it distributed lists of
leftists who should be assassinated
there were lots of killings they also
went beyond and killed us as
professionals and teachers and so on and
that was actually the first us support
for Saddam Hussein it was not a major
figure but who was involved in rehearsal
of the poo without going into the
details the major us support for Saddam
Hussein began in nineteen eighty and
when right after the Iranian Revolution
which overthrew the shah us time tyrant
to the US Britain had installed 1953
right after that iraq invaded iran with
you with us support in 1982 the reagan
administration took Iraq off the list of
states supporting terror perfectly
arbitrary list but they removed them
from the list because it was necessary
now to support them they were going to
be our ally and you may recall a year
later when Donald Rumsfeld went to Iraq
and famous handshake where they made an
arrangement for the u.s. to support your
act and it's
noble cause of attacking Iran trying to
overthrow the regime it was a very
brutal attack Iraq used chemical weapons
hundreds of thousands of Iranians were
slaughtered Iran hasn't forgotten this
affect people like mud and a judge were
I think in the front lines at that time
doesn't the memory remains though they
knew that they had no Iran had no
support from anyone in the world the US
was sporting Iraq Saddam then turned his
weapons against the curves inside Iraq
and major massacres and the Kurdish
reasons with chemical weapons the Reagan
administration tried to suppress any
knowledge of them and in fact blamed
them on Iran so I was able to cut off
any protests Thatcher did the same in
England the US even support for Iraq
Saddam was so extreme that the u.s.
authorized they gave authorization to
sit down to do something that only a
really treasured ally can do in fact the
only other allied has been authorized to
do this is Israel namely to attack a
u.s. ship and kill dozens of seamen and
get away with Israel did it in 1967 USS
liberty Saddam did it in 1987 USS start
a destroyer hit by Iraqi missiles
targeted by Iraqi missiles of killing a
couple of dozen sailors kind of a tap on
the wrist he was good friend but finally
the u.s. basically intervene directly
and won the war for Iraq well a u.s.
love for Saddam Hussein didn't end at
that point after the war continued under
George Bush the first 1989 Bush actually
invited Iraqi nuclear engineers to the
United States for advanced training in
nuclear weapons production that was
nineteen eighty-nine a couple of months
later in early nineteen ninety
Bush sent a high-level senatorial
delegation to Iraq led by Senator Robert
dole the presidential Republican
presidential candidate a couple years
later including alan simpson who's now
on Obama's deficit Commission the
respected senator and they were sent
there to convey bushes greetings to his
friend Saddam and to assure him that he
should not pay attention to criticism
that he hears in the American press we
have this freedom of press business here
and there's no way to silence them but
he should just ignore them because he's
such a nice guy the transcripts of that
had been available for years try to find
them somewhere like you can it's got a
search like most important things well
that was april nineteen ninety a couple
months after that saddam made his
committed his first crime none of the
things that i described count his first
crime was disobeying orders were more
likely misunderstanding he sent troops
into equate you don't disobey the orders
of the master this gave the there were
negotiations options is long story but
it gave Bush the opportunity to destroy
completely defenseless people stand tall
like Reagan after he invaded Grenada and
six thousand US troops got eight
thousand medals of Honor for defeating
40 Cuban paramilitaries and Reagan was
standing tall a lot of cheering and Bush
wanted to do the same I suppose so
invaded your active waited the
negotiations options and was able to say
after a couple of months that there's a
lesson the lesson to the world is what
we say goes and you better listen to it
if not this is what you find and
infrastructure was destroyed amount of
it amounted to bylaws
over fear destroying sewage plants power
plants and so on well that wasn't enough
there was a an uprising in 1991 a Shiite
uprising which probably would have
overthrown so dumb but the United States
they don't want that it didn't want your
Rockies to run Iraq so it authorized
Saddam to use a military helicopters and
aircraft to crush the rebellion killing
thousands of people the general in
charge general Schwarzkopf said well he
didn't realize that when he authorized
that I'm to use these aircraft that was
actually going to do it so he was
snookered by Saddam's and that got away
with then then came the sanctions that's
now Clinton the sanctions were literally
genocidal both the administrators of the
soft side of the sanctions the
oil-for-food programme respected
international diplomats Dennis how of a
monstrance banach both resigned one
after the other couple years later
because they regarded them as in
violation of the Genocide Convention
they were killing hundreds thousands of
people mostly the vulnerable children
women and so on elderly they also
strengthened Zidane they devastated the
civilian society they compelled the
population to rely on him for survival
and they probably saved him from the
fate of other monsters many of them
quite comparable to Saddam who were
overthrown from within and who the US
and Britain supported until the last
minute of their vicious rule the
Ceausescu in romania mr. Hart though in
Indonesia mobile do in the Congo Marcos
and the Philippines in fact quite a
quite a rogue's gallery Saddam probably
would have gone the same way
incidentally not just my opinion but the
opinion of Halliday and fancy onek who
were the Westerners who had by far the
most in
about Iraq with lots of inspectors over
the country and so on and we're in fact
totally blanked out of me of the media
during the crucial period planning for
the invasion and in fact since written
about it can't get reviewed and the US
and Britain and so on well that's the
way these are the ways we protect
ourselves then came were I don't have to
talk about that and as I said there's
new examples daily well the these there
are deep-seated features of an imperial
culture we share them the the assumption
that what we say goes we go in the world
what we do is Justin right can't be
crime the idea that we should recognize
any criminal act as outlandish and be
submitted to the international law is
outlandish we see this all over the
world right now I so move to another
part of the world stop in a second takes
a China the China is a big problem they
don't accept the principle that what we
say goes and they're too big to push
around so it's a problem and the State
Department is getting desperate in fact
it's interesting to read the warnings
that they're issuing to China couple of
weeks ago the State Department warned
china that if it wants to be a response
if it wants to be accepted into the
international community which of course
we run it has to be a responsible member
of the community that has to meet its
international responsibilities and what
are its international responsibilities
to follow us orders that China must
observe the US sanctions against Iran
those sanctions have absolutely zero
force except the force of power
silence the China has absolutely no
reason to or anyone else to honor them
Chinese quite happy to support the US UN
sanctions but those are toothless in
fact they like the UN sanctions because
the UN sanctions keep Western
corporations out of Iran and open up
opportunities for them to for markets
and exploiting the oil resources and so
on so quite happy with the UN sanctions
but they don't follow the US sanctions
and and the u.s. is desperate about it
it can issue the warnings but probably
in the Chinese Foreign Office it's just
elicits laughter you know I'm going to
listen go ahead and do what they want
furthermore the same is true in the
region so turkey for example it just
announced today that its planning to
triple its trade relations with Iran
there were already quite high and
growing and it's very natural trading
relationship but turkey needs the energy
around needs the manufactured goods and
this is part of turkeys kind of outreach
the whole region there already they've
just built the pipeline to Iran that
Pakistan is not the same Brazil which is
the most respected country in the south
as vigorously supported Iran's right to
enrich uranium and so incidentally have
the non-aligned countries for years very
strongly saying yeah Iran has the right
to enrich uranium members of the
non-proliferation treaty the US are
becoming increasingly isolated Europe
goes along with the US Europe has chosen
so far to be vassals of the United
States rather than an independent force
but that's about it outside of that the
what we say go goes line is beginning to
collapse South America and elsewhere and
that is causing a lot of hysteria and
Washington and it's a very dangerous
situation when a powerful country which
is used to running the world is foiled
they may turn out to act in a desperate
and
way and beginning to see signs of that
so just a couple weeks ago there were
naval exercises u.s. naval exercises in
the seas were right off the coast of
China well China objected they objected
particularly when there were plans to
send a advanced US aircraft carrier the
George Washington a nuclear aircraft
carrier with according to the Chinese
with the capacity to hit Beijing with
missiles they didn't like that and they
protested it and it led to considerable
annoyance in the United States Hillary
Clinton gave you know talk about the
Freedom of the Seas now the Chinese are
interfering with the Freedom of the Seas
and the press also condemned the Chinese
were interfering with our right to carry
out naval exercises off their coast you
can just imagine what would happen if
the Chinese Navy were carrying out
similar exercise in the Caribbean they
don't have to imagine it because we have
a nuclear war and everything to be
finished but it's again it reveals the
depth of the Imperial mentality there's
a Pentagon study that just came out
which was very had a very ominous
warnings about China about the growth of
their military forces which put into
this study are about reaching about
one-fifth of the level of US military
expenditures in Iraq and Afghanistan
which is of course a very small part of
the military budget nothing and they're
also the forces are beginning to maybe
threaten the use of our forward
deployment bases in Okinawa and Guam
we're the only country that has forward
deployment basis all of this is
connected with Iran a long story that
there's no time to go into but the the
hysteria is building up and it could be
quite dangerous we've seen plenty of it
past a wounded saber-tooth Tigers not
nice to have an
backyard and in a way that's what we're
becoming and unless it's leashed here
the world could be in real trouble
