today on the philosopher zone a special
guest on some unfinished business
we're very strange species in many ways
and the language capacity seems to be at
the root of a good deal of this
uniqueness from 25 or 30 sounds that
have no relation to anything in our
minds we are somehow capable of
producing an infinite number of thoughts
that express anything that we can
imagine and all as they put it all the
movements of our soul anything that's
happening in our mental life what our
Wordsworth well they are worth thinking
about and that's what Noam Chomsky has
spent a lifetime doing he's held firm to
his theory of hardwired grammar even
though it's tricky to prove and he
doesn't buy the story that language
emerged because we had to talk to each
other to get things done simply this is
not where words came from but rather for
an adequate explanation we need to look
inward rather than outward and that's
not so easy today Noam Chomsky on the
hard questions of mind and language
[Music]
professor Chomsky welcome to the
philosophers a very blurred do with you
now you've pained an elegant little
summary of the hard questions that still
confront us I noticed that language is
still in the middle of it
why is language such a difficult nut to
crack we can start with what you might
call the Galilean challenge and the
earliest days of the Scientific
Revolution Galileo and other great
scientists and philosophers that they
were intrigued in fact awed by the fact
that as paraphrasing as they put it from
25 or 30 sounds that have no relation to
anything in our minds we are somehow
capable of producing an infinite number
of thoughts that express anything that
we could imagine and all as they put it
all the movements of our soul anything
that's happening in our mental life and
how is this amazing achievement possible
Galileo regarded it as the greatest
invention in human history greater than
the achievements of Michelangelo Raphael
or Titian and so on so the Galilean
challenge is to try to answer the
question first of all what mechanism of
mind brain makes this possible how did
it evolve
what's its nature and so on wasn't
really until the mid 20th century that
tools became available intellectual
tools for one to be able to at least
formulate clearly some crucial elements
of the problem and to address them and
to identify the parts of Galileo's
challenge that we can make progress with
and other parts that remain total
mysteries complete mysteries no
conception of how to progress with them
yes just what the white language is
being viewed
in recent times that it is actually
something to do with communication as
opposed to other functions where do you
think that leads us do you think that
evolutionary notion that we had to
communicate because we had to cooperate
and hence we have the language that we
have now how do you see that well there
is a modern doctrine believed
overwhelmingly that in some sense the
essential nature and function of
languages as a means of communication
but there's mounting evidence that's
just false that language is primarily an
instrument of thought and it's mostly
internal to our minds in fact we all
more or less know that intuitively you
can't go five seconds without thinking
to yourself that language takes a
amazing act of will to prevent it and by
now there's even considerable evidence
that a good deal of the internal use of
languages unconscious and probably
inaccessible to consciousness but the
empirical evidence that is increasing
indicates that the externalization of
language to some sensory motor system to
articulation which is the usual one
that's not the only one that this is
kind of peripheral to the core nature of
language which remains an instrument for
pretty much as Galileo and his
colleagues believed an instrument for
the creation and expression mostly
internal expression of thought
instrument of thinking and that means
that communication is even more
peripheral it's of course true that we
communicate with language but we
communicate with just about everything
we do with gestures with the style of
clothes with how you comb your hair and
so on and language is of course a very
rich means of communication and we do
use language for communication but it's
not its primary use source by any means
and it's nothing like the sense
hmm it sort of turns Aristotle's saying
on this on its head that's not sound
with meaning but meaning with sound
that's correct I think that's a better
way of looking at it it's meaning
usually with sound but really that's
only for convenience the acquisition of
language would that have been you say
that's actually quite an abrupt and
recent event which to a large degree
goes against the evolutionary story of
adaptation over time well actually
that's a common misinterpretation of the
theory of evolution of there are many
well-known events by now in the in
evolution that were sudden and radical
changes and so for example the what's
called symbiosis the the creation of
water called eukaryotic cells the cells
that constitute all complex organisms
apparently happened once with one
bacteria that kind of ingesting another
and out of that structural constraints
were broken and whole range of enormous
consequences developed so the idea that
it might have happened very suddenly
doesn't break at all with evolutionary
theory it's a question of fact and the
facts just do seem to indicate that we
have limited empirical evidence about
the timing of appearance of language but
what there is is highly suggestive so
for example recent work on genomic work
demonstrates that a particular groups on
groups are called in Africa separated
from the rest of Homo sapiens and
probably around 120,000 years ago well
as far as we know they have the same
language capacity same cognitive system
generally which means that the origin of
language must be prior to that and
furthermore it has not evolved since as
far as we know there are no group
differences among humans
the language capacity here in fact in
general cognitive capacity so it's been
it emerged before roughly 120,000 years
ago and has not evolved since well Homo
sapiens is only two hundred thousand
years ago so there's an evolutionary
time there's a tiny window in which
something this system emerged
furthermore it is increasingly clear
that the language capacity is a true
species capacity not only common to
humans but also unique to humans there's
nothing remotely analogous elsewhere in
the animal world that's very rare in the
whole biological world and there's
nothing similar in animals as far as we
know we're a very strange species in
many ways and the language capacity
seems to be at the root of a good deal
of this uniqueness and it does appear to
have originated in a very brief period
that raises a question of what happened
that was going to be my next question
well that's Galileo's challenge and
there are several aspects to what
happened some of them we can get a grasp
of and investigate and make real
progress on others remain quite
mysterious so there are basically three
questions one is what's the nature of
the combinatorial system so called
generative system that yields an
infinite array of structured expressions
each of which expresses a thought with a
finite base what's the nature of that
system that's one question that's the
one that we can make real progress not
another question is any combinatorial
system begins with certain atoms you
know things that are on animal izybelle
from the point of view of the
combinatorial system like basically word
like elements that have meaning words
like River tree house
person so on and so forth now these pose
an enormous mystery they're completely
unlike anything known in animal systems
we have no idea how they evolved when
they evolve where they came from they're
common to all humans they have very
complex meanings there's a kind of a
belief which is false that the simple
words like this just pick out things in
the world so you have kind of classic
books called a word an object or a word
an thing and so on but that doctrine is
just unacceptable the words of language
unlike animal symbols don't pick out
extra mental objects that's critical
we know that I mean there's good reason
to believe it's true but we don't know
how it works and as far as their
evolutionary history is concerned it's a
complete blank not only there's nothing
known about it but it's hard to imagine
even how you could investigate it and we
obviously don't have tape recordings
from 200,000 years ago and there aren't
any other known avenues to enquire the
comparative work with other primates or
even any other organisms just doesn't
get you anywhere because they don't have
these systems that's the second question
the third question which is actually the
one that was salient for Galileo for
Descartes and in the parts of the
tradition that at least faced the
challenge is how we can use language in
the innovative creative way that we do
to put it in cartesian terms we are
incited or inclined to say particular
things but not compelled to do so so for
example right at this minute I could
start talking about the weather outside
or you know a baseball game that I saw
50 years ago or a million other things
but I'm not
I'm incited or inclined to give the kind
of discussion that we're entering into
this is and here we have a total mystery
and not just for language but for
voluntary action altogether is an
interesting recent review of the state
of the art and the study of voluntary
action by two very leading
neuroscientists Emilio beatsie and
Robert Jimmy on and they discuss what is
understood and they end up by pointing
out rather as they put it fancifully
that we're beginning to understand
something about the puppet and the
strings but we have no idea whatsoever
about the puppeteer what makes it happen
that's a total mystery Noam Chomsky on
those hard questions today on the
philosophers own to that question of
some things remaining mysteries one of
the things you write about in what kind
of creatures are we is that some things
will just remain mysteries and that is
just a truism and it's because we are I
guess biologically caught in our Forman
in our shape and in what we're able to
actually perceive yeah we're assuming
that we're organic creatures and not
angels we have certain fixed capacities
which yield the range of abilities that
we have but they impose limits as well
that's true of all of biological nature
so for example the our genome human
genome directs us to develop arms and
legs not wings mammalian visual system
not an insect visual system that gives
us scope enormous scope but also by the
very logic of the situation imposes
limits and there's no reason to doubt
that that's also true of our cognitive
capacities they give us enormous scope
but the very mechanisms that provide the
scope also determine certain limits and
it's just an empirical question whether
the kinds of things we would like to
understand fall within the limits of
cognitive capacities that we are endowed
with and that provide us with the
remarkable abilities that we have so the
fact that there are limits shouldn't be
regarded as a kind of a deficiency it's
just as the fact that we can't grow
wings is not a deficiency it's because
we can grow arms and the same is true in
the cognitive domain and as this lead
and attach to the question of the hard
problem of consciousness
well what's called the hard problem of
consciousness actually if you look
through history there were other hard
problems so in the 17th century the hard
problem was motion and that problem is
one that really was not settled within
the framework of intelligibility that
animated modern science from the point
of view of Galileo through Newton that
problem remains a total mystery that's
interesting things to say about that
consciousness is a problem and my own
view unconscious
what is inaccessible to consciousness
but enters directly into the fragments
that reach consciousness is probably
even a greater and a suspect harder
problem can you elaborate on that what
does that name well for example take
language which we understand better than
many other aspects of cognition so when
you do what we call at talking to
ourselves when we think in language what
actually happens if you think about it
is that bits and pieces and fragments
come to mind and you can sometimes put
them together into a meaningful complex
sentence but something's going on
unconsciously which created all of this
generated at all and we can't penetrate
by introspection into what that is
actually that should no longer really
surprise us very much there are for the
last about 30 years ago there was
experimental work that
famous livid experiments which showed
that again for simple voluntary action
alexei lifting your finger it turns out
that a couple hundred I think maybe five
hundred milliseconds before maybe three
hundred milliseconds before you make the
conscious decision to do it there's
already activity going on in the
relevant parts of the brain which
there's been much discussion about what
this means but what I suspect it means
is that the decisions are being made
unconsciously and inaccessible to
consciousness though they then sometimes
not always reach consciousness and then
we may implement the decision or there's
not - it seems very likely that in the
case of the creation of thinking which
is basically what language is about that
same thing is happening and I think
there's pretty good evidence for just
for the reasons I mentioned that the
very acts that you and I are now
performing do rely on computational
processes which we have some grasp of
now from the outside the way you study
you know the laws of motion we know from
the outside but they seem to be going on
on the inside and they're entering
critically into what I'm producing and
what you're interpreting but we can find
out nothing about them by introspection
in fact if we could introspect into them
the study of language would be really
easy we would just think about it and oh
yes all these principles would come out
they don't and in fact the principles
are pretty surprising when you look at
them and is this why it looks like it's
an act of radical emergence to have mind
from body or mind from material or mind
from Brian yeah but I think since the
17th century we should really formulate
the matter differently there was a
classical approach to body mind it's
clearest perhaps in Descartes and that
was straight science it wasn't nothing
mystical of
it's a straight scientific approach that
they could we have to begin with the
conception of natural science that was
held in the early modern period said
Galileo through Newton the idea was that
the world is a machine and by machine
they mean you know things that push and
pull each other years and levers just a
more complicated version of the
fascinating automata that were literally
being constructed by great artisans at
the time the world was that kind of
machine and in fact created by a super
skilled mechanic it's called the
mechanical philosophy philosophy just
meant science so mechanical science the
Cartesian dualism body-mind dualism was
based on that principle Descartes
believed that he had given at least an
outline an account of the machine and
his account was supposed to have dealt
with the entire inorganic world the
entire nonhuman world and a large part
of the specifically human world like
perception up to sensation and
perception for example but he noticed
that there were certain things that
could not be accounted for in these
terms a crucial one was the creative use
of language that I mentioned that's what
he brings up in the discourse and that
as he recognized simply lay beyond the
capacity of any machine that is correct
but what happened is that Newton in the
Principia demonstrated that Descartes
system simply doesn't work and in fact
went beyond and showed that there are no
machines
that's his invocation of a principle of
action at a distance which was central
to Newtonian physics that was could not
be implemented in mechanical terms now
Newton himself regarded this is a total
absurdity
they said no person of any scientific
understanding can believe this because
of course can't be true and in fact he
spent the rest of his life trying to
find some way out of this conclusion he
failed later generations also tried that
pretty much was kind of given up over
time and the whole approach to science
has changed in a subtle way instead of
seeking to show that the world is
intelligible to us the goals of science
were implicitly lowered to trying to
construct theories that are intelligible
to us so for example the recent
discovery of the demonstration that
Einstein was correct and predicting
gravitational waves that theory is
intelligible to us but the conception on
which it is based of curved space-time
you know that quantum principles
involved heard a Galileo through Newton
and human Locke and so on that would
have just been outside the framework of
science because it's not intelligible to
our conceptual systems which is their
goal of intelligibility so we can
understand the theories but that's their
intelligible but the world isn't and
it's not a machine well with that
development at de cartes mind-body
problem disappeared not because there's
any problem with mind but because
there's no body if there's no body
there's no machine there can't be a
mind-body problem and this was pretty
much recognized so for example john
locke mediately after newton in fact you
know having read newton's work concluded
that just as attraction and repulsion
the properties of motion are
unintelligible to us but are
nevertheless true as the judicious mr.
Newton has demonstrated he went on to
say in the theological idiom of the time
that just as God and
a matter with properties that are
unintelligible to us inconceivable to us
so God may have superadded to matter the
capacity of thought meaning thought is a
property of some organic a structure of
whatever the world consists of and that
concept was pursued extensively through
the 18th century that culminating
finally in the work of Joseph Priestley
famous chemist philosopher late 18th
century it leads us to the scientific
study of what properties of organized
matter
Yool thought and that brings you to the
modern cognitive sciences and study of
language and so on in today's conception
so it's not a number we can call it mind
if we like but that just means an aspect
of matter just as electrical properties
are an aspect of matter hmm well that
pretty much brings it up to date and I
think that's where we'll leave it I know
you're very busy man professor Chomsky
thank you for being on the Philosopher's
Zone I suppose the provisional answer to
what kind of creatures are we is that
where are the mysterious we are very
mysterious at least to ourselves maybe
somebody else understands thanks very
much thank you professor Noam Chomsky on
what kind of creatures we might be see
you next time on the philosophers own
