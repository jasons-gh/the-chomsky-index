wait this is what I call a good audience
I'm not going to regale you with what
happened since 8 o'clock this morning my
time which is because I want to forget
it myself and I also I think it seems to
me that in view of the you know lateness
of the hour it would make sense if
you're willing to do what I often do do
in places that I go to a lot and where
they're used to it and that is just
dispensed with the talk and starting
with the discussion which is always a
lot more interesting and it's more key
to your interests I mean I could start
talking about any number of things but
since it's another cube invasion I don't
think so for a number of reasons the
main reason is that the guys who I mean
the the the American business community
is not in favor of it at this point and
they have plenty of clout no you know
it's conceivable that jingoist
fanaticism will overwhelm sort of the
interest of those who really run the
country but I it doesn't look likely I
mean they what's happening around the
case of Cuba that's kind of like what
happened in the case of Vietnam the the
US policy toward Cuba or Vietnam or
Nicaragua was completely understandable
I mean you simply have to think in terms
of state some neighborhood in Chicago or
Vancouver where the local mafia done is
running the thing and some storekeeper
says he's not gonna pay his protection
money his protection money well you
don't just you send your goons in and
you get the money but you don't stop
there so you got to break its leg or
kill him or you know make sure that
other people understand that that's not
the kind of thing you do and that's
what's been driving us policy it's what
drove us
music basically won the war in Vietnam
by the early seventies and any
reasonable sense but I think it maximal
goals but they got the main ones but you
have to show other people in the
neighborhood that that's not the way you
behave so you have to really torture and
they continued to torture them as long
as they could one excuse after another
each excuse more ridiculous than the
last one until something happened other
people in the neighborhood stopped being
intimidated and started going in you
know the Japanese is slowly moved in and
then the Europeans slowly moved in and
pretty soon the American business
community things got to the point where
they recognized that well it's kind of
useful and maybe even fun to torture
people and kick them in the face it's
much more important to make money and
when you pass there comes a sort of
transitional point when you switch and
when that transition point came all of a
sudden it turned out that Vietnam was
being forthcoming on the Mis and making
great progress and human rights and so
on and so forth so therefore American
businesses could go in and get their
share that take and that's pretty much
what's happening in the case of Cuba I
think I've got a suggestion we're
constantly being bombarded by somebody
yeah I make can I make a suggestion
yeah we're constantly being bombarded by
the media it's almost you it's almost a
complete and total one line and that is
we have to pay back
I'm sure you're having the same thing in
your country there's the same thing in
Western Europe and in Eastern Europe I
you know rarely in my life I'm over 50
now have I seen such a universal you
know chorus that has you know no
dissenting voices and I quote it if you
might come through that yes actually
there's no descending I mean I I don't
want to talk about Canada you you know
you know much more than me but let me
talk about the United States where
there's is a dissenting voice like you
know the overwhelming majority of the
population and you see that right now
simply have a look at what's going on in
primaries a couple of months up to a few
months ago the top priority for both
political parties was getting rid of the
deficit and you know getting balancing
the budget and so on that was the top
priority for both parties the only
difference was whether you do it in you
know seven years and for seven years in
two months or something like that the
you know the government kept being
closed down over this for a couple of
months I was and in the press you know
had a lot of gotta balance the budget
Americans voted for a balanced budget
and so on anybody had been looking at
the polls knew that this was total
nonsense the public was overwhelmingly
opposed to this on any realistic grounds
if you yes in fact he looked at the
polls they were always kind of that too
kind of questions there was one question
for the headline writers and that
question was would you like to have a
balanced budget and on that everybody
says yes I mean I would say yes it's
like asking would you like to have your
household this magically removed sure
you know but then when people were asked
would you like to have a balanced budget
if and then becomes any realistic
assumption you know cuts in education or
health or environmental protection or
you name it it's quickly became
overwhelmingly no and he couldn't it's
so that the first question was for the
guys who write the headlines or
National Public Radio and so on but the
questions down at the bottom they were
for the people who have to keep their
finger on the public pulse like the
public relations industry and the
propaganda system and everyone else they
have to know what people are thinking
you know you're gonna try to control
minds you have to know where they are
so there is so if you look at polls
carefully they give you a pretty
realistic picture I mean as much as can
be done of because the business
community needs to know that and it was
very clear what what the attitudes were
so contrary to what you're saying
outside of elite circles the articulate
intellectuals the political class and so
on most people were closed to it and on
very solid and you can see that right
now as soon as the primary started the
minute the primary started and people
had to face the voters the budget
disappeared nobody's talking about it
take a look at any of the campaigns it
is never mentioned and the reason that
it's never mentioned is well you know
these guys have to face angry voters so
they better talk about something else
not what they're doing in fact nothing
that they're doing ever reaches the
voters if you compare the campaign
that's going on now with the
congressional you know the Gingrich army
proposals they don't even overlap
there's no contact between them and the
budget is one dramatic example if this
takes a lot of discipline for
journalists and others not to notice
this and to see what it means but you
know there's been like a sea change
within as soon as the primary season
started the budget dropped off the
streams and you might ask a different
question who's right you know there's a
question of fact like is it important to
balance the budget so who's right the
instincts of the general population or
the business community which does want
to do it but of course they want to do
it for very simple reasons balancing the
budget is a weapon against social
spending so that's kind of irrelevant
you know but if you ask about the
very it's not even hitting me you know
for example although all that talk about
the budget balancing some parts of the
budget are going up in fact to clark's
they're going up pretty fast
in fact one is the Pentagon Pentagon
budget is that basically cold war levels
actually it's higher than it was under
Nixon and there's no Russians around so
that tells you how seriously they took
the Russian threat but it's going up and
it's going up under pressure from the
far right the Heritage Foundation you
know Gingrich Republicans and so on they
wanted to go up the public has an
attitude on that to the public is
opposed to that by about six to one but
the difference between public attitudes
and public policy which is always
significant has just become like a chasm
the so that's one thing that's going up
the other things going up is the other
aspect it's like that's going up because
it's a the the main function of the
Pentagon its main domestic function has
always been to transfer public funds to
high-tech industry like that's not my
salary gets paid to be honest I MIT is
part of that funnel where I work it's
part of the funnel by which the public
unwittingly pays the costs of high-tech
industry and the whole of the modern
economy if you look through it is
crucially based on this so the Pentagon
has to darn stave and in fact go up the
other part of the federal budget that's
going up state budgets to is the other
part of the security system jails the
crime hasn't changed in about 20 years
if you can believe the FBI but the
perception of crime has gone has changed
radically and that's propaganda that's
you can given it's the effective
propaganda to try to make people of
crime is serious but you know it's no
more series and it was 30 years ago
right and the people who were scared are
not the ones who heard
but crime mostly harms the poor it's
mostly poor people harming each other
and they're not the ones who are saying
let's build more jails the propaganda
that crime like the propaganda about
drugs is a technique of population
control for one thing it targets a
superfluous population it targets people
you want to get rid of like the kind of
people who wouldn't say Colombia you
send the death squads after their kind
of superfluous and in fact it's very
carefully shaped the whole crime story
to attack black males primarily so if
you look at the population of black
males they're being devastated by by
this and it was specifically targeted
for them there's virtually no doubt
about it all right so on the one hand
has that effect and and the race class
correlation is close enough it's not
perfect but it's close enough from the
United States hero also going after poor
working people this way people you
really don't want around like you know
the people you send out to the into the
desert or kill or something in less
civilized countries in the nares and the
the so while crime is and the other
thing is doing is scaring everybody else
well that's a technique of population
control if you're kicking people in the
face you're harming them and most people
are getting harmed by social policy you
want them to think about something else
and what you want to be afraid of
something that's like like the Jews that
the homosexuals or somebody rather
everybody hits the same technique
because there aren't a lot of techniques
around and in this case one way of
terrifying the population is crimes the
other is crazed arrows and you know all
sorts of other things but crime right at
home is there's a good one so since
nineteen eight around nine if you go
back to 1980 the US was kind of at the
high end of the industrial world and
incarceration but now it's off the
spectrum if the during the Reagan years
the number of prisoners tripled without
any change in the crime rate and under
Bush and Clinton announced going up even
faster we long ago left South Africa
behind Russia was left behind a long
time ago actually Russia caught up for a
while after the reforms started and it
began to understand how to behave
but now we've passed Russia again and
it's we just off the scale in terms of
per capita incarceration it's still
going up well that's this that has a lot
of effect and it's gotten to this it's
gotten to the point where instantly
crime rates in the United States are not
particularly are their high but not
unusually high so if you compare the
United States with other industrial
countries again the u.s. is kind of it's
a high hand but not I don't even think
it's first in any into there's one crime
in which the United States really is
totally by itself and that's a homicide
with guns but that is not it was crime
you know that's because of the crazy gun
culture but so like if this domestic
where it would be domestic you know like
a domestic problem and some other
country ends up somebody getting
murdered in the United States because
their guns all over the place but if you
take that aside you look at you know
robberies rapes you know car thefts or
whatever the u.s. is at the high end but
not unusually so on the other hand the
rate of incarceration which was not very
different from other industrial
countries around 1980 is now radically
different and that's another that's
really a reflection of social policy
it's kind of comparable to the fact that
say inequality in the US was which was
at the high end of the industrial world
but in the spectrum around 1980 is now
off the scale as all these things are
aspects of the same kinds of social
policy know why the crime the security
system is going up very fast
you hear a lot of talk about
I'm a little off your topic but I'll get
back to you hear a lot of talk about how
if you project health expenses it'll
bankrupt the country well you know
that's mostly nonsense but the fact is
if you want to play that game if you
project prison building that'll bankrupt
the country even faster in fact the RAND
Corporation did a study a year or two
ago in which they pointed out that at
the rate at which California was
imprisoning people by some year 2000 or
something like that they would have
nothing left in the state budget for
education everything would have to be
going to prisons and that's the kind of
projection you get well let's come back
why is this going on well it's not like
the Pentagon for one thing it has a it
has a function it does have the function
of use of force I'm in the case of the
Pentagon you know keeps the world under
control in the case the security system
it kind of like the sky like social
cleansing in Colombia as well as
controlling the rest of the population
by frightening them but like the
Pentagon it has another function it is a
significant our rather significant
Keynesian stimulus for the economy I
mean it's gotten to the point where
areas they're put rural counties which
is where most of the prisons bills are
competing for prisoners because it you
know money for the construction industry
and the security guard is the fest was
maybe still it is the fastest-growing
white-collar profession in the United
States plus there's big money involved
the
running a they're getting privatized and
running a federal prisoner it can be
very lucrative I mean some of these
companies are now you know quite wealthy
in fact it's gotten to the point where
even high-tech industry is noticing they
figure they may have another scam
alongside the Pentagon to feed off
public funds so it got to the point
where The Wall Street Journal and buddy
two years ago there's though had an
article discussing the opportunities for
high-tech industry to get into the
security business you know even plant
electrodes and people and you have
supercomputers of having them under
surveillance and so and it's not crazier
than you know shooting down missiles in
outer space or something like that these
are all kind of covers for getting new
technology funded and while this is
nowhere near the scale of the Pentagon
its noticeable the big investment firms
like Merrill Lynch and so on are
floating tax-free bonds for prison
construction so it's part of its into
big business so here's two part these
are the two parts of the state system
which are in fact growing which again
tells you thing about how much they want
to balance the budget well the budget
balancing if it has to be very carefully
honed it has to be used as a weapon
against any part of the government
system that goes to other than the rich
the part that goes to the rich that goes
up you know or the part that's there for
population control that part of the
budget goes up well coming back to the
first question who's right from an
economic point of view about the effect
about balancing the budget like just how
important is it should one think it's an
important thing to do the public thinks
it isn't the business world thinks it is
but for reasons that are irrelevant
I mean irrelevant on economic grounds at
least but if you ask on economic grounds
is the right thing to do what's the
answer well first of all a qualification
has to be made right off on any such
question almost nobody knows anything so
almost everything that said is guesswork
any honest economist will tell you that
if you tell them the
answer you want he'll construct the
model to give you that answer and if
within a pretty big range and in fact
most most of these questions are sort of
large I'm there is some knowledge but a
large part of it is historical evidence
and you know sort of judgment questions
and so on so whose judgment is right
well there's something first of all is
the text of the United States is the is
the debt high well not by historical
standards in fact it's about what it was
in the late 50s and considerably let
relative to GNP GDP you know the
national economy which is the only
relevant measure it's less than it was
say in the early 50s in fact it's much
less than it was during the biggest
growth period after World War two and
historically that's about what it's been
the US has always run a big debt that's
kept turning over it used the debt to
invest and pay off the debt through
growth and also cutting it back through
inflation up until throughout the whole
19th century during the really big
growth periods u.s. had very high higher
debt than it has now
so you can't argue that somehow the debt
is out of sight I mean it didn't grow
very fast during the Reagan years in
fact most of the debt is Reagan did but
that was again to cut social spending
and it's substantial because of the
Reagan years but not by historical
standards certainly not outlined by
historical standards in fact I think the
u.s. deficit deficit is not dead
remember the u.s. deficit is now the
lowest in the OECD relative to the
economy that's right launched at Japan I
forget which one is lower but the u.s.
and Japan and I think are the two lowest
and in the industrial world relative to
the economy so it's not you know
not no major just like some catastrophe
or something but it's well within
historical range and not even noticeable
particularly furthermore there's also
evidence about the effect of running
deficits there have been a couple of
times I think about half a dozen times
in American history when there has been
an attempt to balance the budget and in
fact every single one of them has led
pretty quickly to either recession or a
deep depression on the other hand there
here it gets tricky but there are some
studies the only studies that have been
done as far as I know most of them done
by an economist named Robert Eisner to
the Northwestern where which have been
attempt to estimate to try to work out
the effect of a deficit on things like
investment growth you know anything in
measure it turns out there's a not huge
but somewhat positive effect to running
deficits and the reason is not very
surprising after all every business runs
deficits all the time every business is
in debt every household is in debt
everything that functions is in debt all
the time you're in debt because you're
trying to you know do something now of
course if you use the debt is be there
good nor bad I mean if you use the debt
to you know gamble with Las Vegas it was
a bad day if you use the debt to you
know to send your kids to college or you
know buy a car or start a business or
something then be good okay from the
point of view of economic gain and other
things it depends what you do with it
and if the if the borrowing is used
intelligent for example if if government
borrowing goes into building
infrastructure and improving education
and the health and so on so is a more
viable society down the road there'll
also be more growth more income you pay
off the debt that's what matters
what matters is why is investment in
people's lives and
the way they live and what's produced
and so on and so forth and of course
wise investment is going to read his no
Naknek off debt public spending is in
fact a major way in which the any
economy grows you know sometimes the
healthy ways on those a destructive way
it depends what you do with it so as far
as we know at least there's nothing
there's no big imperative about cutting
the debt I mean obviously that depends
he despite the Reagan years which didn't
you know I mean they did turn the United
States very quickly from the world's
biggest creditor into the world's
biggest debtor very fast but that was
because of a combination of massive
spending the massive state spending and
tremendous bar there was kind of like a
borrow-and-spend
abandon in the Reagan years and mainly
as David Stockman said right at the
beginning though there's no secret the
head of the budget because if they
figured if they get deep enough into
debt they'll be a straightjacket and
I'll be able to kill social spending
well okay if that's your goal and that's
a good thing and if you can use cutting
the debt to achieve that goal then
that's fine but for the general
population that doesn't make any sense
at all and even on narrow economic
grounds it's very dubious that makes any
sense probably harmful and narrow aiken
on the narrowest economic ground now
different you know in canada the answer
to that may be different remember the
take take the talk about how the debt is
a burden on future generations well in
the united states that's simply not true
the debt is mostly owned by americans
which means that the payments on the
debt stay right in the country and now
it may have a redistributed effect like
it's probably the case all of even this
is pretty hard to show because of
pension funds and everything else but
it's you know yes that it's the case
that richer people hold more the debt
than poorer people portion of income but
if that's true then the debt will indeed
have a redistributive effect and
aggressively distributive effect or even
that's challenged but if but but that
you take care of a nut by other means
like say more progressive taxation so
those are not big social problem I mean
there's nothing unworkable about the
social problems the debt it does the the
payment on the debt just stays almost
all stays inside the country just gets
reshuffled around and should be shuffled
around in complicated ways so there's no
burden on future generations I mean the
burden on future generations is if you
don't leave them with a viable Society
like if your children and your
grandchildren are gonna go into society
with which doesn't have roads and
bridges and people aren't educated and
people are dying of diseases and so on
and so forth yeah then everything going
exactly it's not gonna be a nice life
for them and in fact they won't be able
to maintain anything like the lifestyle
they haven't people I'd know but in
order to achieve those goals to create a
viable society public spending is
absolutely assassinated
furthermore the business meeting knows
it that's why they insist on the
Pentagon staying high because that's the
form of public spending they like and
they'll call it public spending but
that's a method whereby the general
public pays the costs of research and
development and so on and basically you
know creates the creates the high-tech
system which is then handed over and not
just the engineering and so on same
improved biotechnology and everything
else
hard to find the dynamic sector of the
economy where that hasn't been a major
factor so yeah there is that kind of
public spending but what about the other
kind I mean what about you know creating
and helping helping develop a society
and with the human being we want to live
would one live and would want to work
and we want to work productively and so
on and so forth well that's public
responsibility now how that in you know
I don't know I think it's not a great
idea to have that public responsibility
fulfilled through
powerful central government in fact I
think the rotten I do but under current
circumstances it happens to be the only
alternative to having private tyrannies
rent if everything which is far worse so
given the options that's the best one I
think but that means but I think most
people kind of sense this and that's or
at least at some level sense it which is
why you don't have support for balancing
the budget and think about your original
question it's why as soon as candidates
have to face the public they drop it
like a hot potato so it's only the
business world and it's various flags
who say that we have to balance the
budget not many other people do
