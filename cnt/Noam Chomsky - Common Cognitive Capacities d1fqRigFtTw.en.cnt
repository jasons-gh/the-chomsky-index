as far as we know human cognitive
capacities have not changed for at least
50,000 years
when humans are some small group of
hunter-gatherers left Africa and spread
all over the world where all their
descendants I mean maybe a little more
complex than that but not a lot more now
we know that pretty well the certain
moments is like you know it's not that
anyone understands the biological nature
of it but there's very strong evidence
so for example if you take an infant
from some tribe in Papua New Guinea that
hasn't had other human contact for
40,000 years and that's a possibility
and you take that infant and you bring
it to Oslo and raise it from infancy in
Oslo it will be indistinguishable from
the people studying physics and Oslo
University it has the same cognitive
capacities and conversely you take a you
know an infant from here and put it in
that drive in Papua New Guinea you'll be
able to do all the complex cognitive
tasks that they can solve that that you
and I couldn't possibly solve we
couldn't survive there for a week so it
looks from evidence like I'm in the
young from evidence like that which is
maybe not conclusive but it's certainly
powerful it seems that cognitive
capacities just haven't changed in fact
humans are genetically very much alike
as compared with other species and it's
not surprising because is apparently a
common origin not very long ago the
50,000 years is nothing in evolutionary
time it's a I've linked so chances are
that whatever the cognitive capacities
were 50,000 years ago they still are of
course they have to be brought out like
like other innate capacities they have
to be elicited by experience but they're
there and I think that's you know human
wasn't thinking about evolution of
course but when he talked about the
common
faculties that are given by the original
hand of nature I think must be what he
meant these were real problems in the
17th and 18th century remember that at
the time of the early Scientific
Revolution that was also the time of the
first real explorations and explorers
were finding all sorts of creatures that
didn't look like Europeans like Negroes
and orangutangs and so on and they
weren't sure how to distinguish them so
which ones are some of them human are
not if you if you are a Cartesian
rationalist there's a sharp distinction
between human and non-human this
Cartesian rationalism is incompatible
with racism to a point that historian
philosophy Howard Harold harry Bracken
is discussed at length you can't be a
rationalist and a racist you either have
a mind or you don't have a mind and if
you have a mind it's the same as only
one you know so that's it you can't
empiricist on the other hand couldn't be
racist because there's there's different
properties and these were hotly debated
issues in the 17th and 18th century they
couldn't figure out what those other
creatures were where the humans are
weren't they as they were did they have
rights and if so what rights and so on
but of course that's long passed and now
there's just humans were apparently
essentially all alike and what we could
there could be a study of what our
common cognitive capacities are in fact
it's studied quite a lot so when you
study what the way say infants determine
continually continuity of objects on the
basis of very scattered data you're
essentially asking the kinds of
questions that the Dakar test the court
actually below you know unfortunately
philosophers these days tend only to
read the meditations but that's
decart in fact I was kind of propaganda
even pointed that out he the same as
letter he wrote to his friend Marcin
where he said that the point of the
meditations is to try to convince the
Jesuits to take his physic seriously
that's what he really cared about when
he worked principals philosophy that
means principles of science that's the
real stuff and in that work and in the
optics and other things he posed are
interesting questions he didn't carry
out the experiments but he carried out
the thought experiments very much the
way Galileo did and he carried him out
they'd probably come out his way so like
one one was to ask the question I said
imagine an infant who has had no
experience with geometrical figures okay
which in fact is every infant because
geometrical figures don't exist in
nature just some other things but so
take an infant with no experience with
geometrical figures present that infant
with a triangle drawn on paper is that
what the infant will perceive is a
distorted triangle not a perfect
instance of whatever crazy figure it is
you know with the two lines not quite
coming together one of them somewhat
curved and so on and he regarded that as
kind of paradoxical why should that be
true and if you're a thoroughgoing
Imperial empiricist you shouldn't permit
that conclusion in fact it's a sense of
conclusions almost certainly correct
it's a easy refutation of standard
empiricism and his conclusion de cartes
conclusion was well we must have some
innate system of he was some Euclidian
geometry which we impose on data to
yield our understanding in fact their
perception and there's quite a lot of
work in the speculation and through the
18th and 17th century on how this could
be and basic ideas are probably correct
there's no a lot of experimental work
and
with infants and comparative work
investigating it and that is at the
beginnings of work trying to find out
what our cognitive capacities are
there's also work on something like
rudimentary science for me how to
children develop a concept that the
world lacks on some rational fashion a
lot of this developed out of PJ's work
even though doesn't stand up as it he
presented it that kind of work has been
pursued
