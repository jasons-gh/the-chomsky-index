i'm julian assange baggage-train editor
of WikiLeaks we've exposed the world
secrets these documents belong the
United States government being attacked
by the PAL the United States strongly
condemns I quit asking quantity both
them all illegally shoot the son of a
for 500 days
I've been detained without charge but
that hasn't stopped us today we only
quit years that can change the world
tomorrow during the last two years new
forms of revolution have been forged
today I speak the two giants of the
intellectual left Noam Chomsky Durov now
on linguist and rebel finger Tara Kelly
street fighting novelist and military
historian I want to find out what these
two activist stalwarts think where is
the world going where should it go
no Tarek 2011-2012 has been a historic
year for liberation movements in many
places across the world did you see it
coming I didn't see it coming I don't
think most people saw it coming but
what's interesting is that you have
these Arab uprisings in a part of the
world which commentators were saying
people aren't interested in democracy
the Muslims are genetically hostile to
their cuisine and you have these up
surges and then they spread because it's
the occupation of their each square in
Cairo that inspire activists all over
the United States even in Russia who
would have expected these movements
suddenly to come up in Russia and
challenge Authority so the the the the
Arab Spring has been very infectious and
it's still going on in different ways
no Chomsky no I can't say I predicted it
I assume that sooner or later there
would have to be a popular reaction to
the better class war that's being been
fought for the past generation a very
conscious class war which has of the
always quite class-conscious business
classes but really felt they were on a
roll so in the United States for example
well we all know the facts over the past
generation there's been wealth create
but it's gone into very few pockets the
extreme inequality in the United States
is weighted very heavily by literally a
tenth of a percent of the population
mostly hedge fund managers CEOs of major
corporations and so on we're talking
about the United States but the
phenomena are basically worldwide that
takes a Egypt one of the most exciting
places the the movement that started off
the Taher Square at demonstrations a
year ago is called the April 6th
movement there's a reason
April 6th 2008 was the day of
large-scale labor protests at the major
industrial installations in Egypt
supporting demonstrations and so on the
there was a small group of tech-savvy
professionals who tried to who wanted to
participate and help help them out with
social media and so on it was crushed by
the dictatorship but that group of
professionals is the April 6th movement
they kept the name that's one indication
of how deeply rooted these protests are
yes the there were people ready a lot of
people for many it was just a moment of
an opening which we can somehow do
something but there were there was
plenty of preparation for it and
something similar in Tunisia you asked
if I predicted it no I didn't but it's
now happening worldwide in one form or
another
I think Nome is right and I think
essentially what we've been witnessing
together with the neoliberal economy is
a contraction of politics in the sense
that I've been arguing now for some time
that what we have in Western politics is
neither the extreme left nor the extreme
right but an extreme centre and this
extreme center
encompasses both center right and center
left which agree on fundamentals waging
wars abroad occupying countries in
punishing the poor pushing through
austerity measures it doesn't matter
which party is in power either in the
United States or in the Western world
things you know carry on like before
this continuty from one regime to the
next which affects the functioning of
the media which has become more and more
narrow so there's very little diversity
very few debates constructed within the
mainstream media and that is a big
characteristic now it's a form I it's a
dictatorship of capital which is
exercised through this extreme center
the Arab countries had dictators backed
by the West for some time and the speed
and scale of those uprising certainly
took everyone by surprise none of us
could have predicted it do you think
that the lack of predictability in fact
is part of why they were successful
without any that if that if they could
have been predicted mechanisms would
have been put in place to stop it
happening yeah
and pretty extreme mechanisms they would
have tried to arrest people crush people
torture people lock activists up but it
went out of control very rapidly and the
United States and the French in Tunisia
and Egypt for instance couldn't control
it I mean they were datin by surprise -
I mean they only got their act together
to try and subvert the process when they
had a six-month bombing of Libya by NATO
thing so they could exercise some
control on the entire world again but
it's still incredibly volatile and you
know sometimes people say but nothing
much has changed this is true but one
thing has changed is that the people the
masses have realized that in order to
bring about change they have to move and
become active and that is a big lesson
from these uprisings I want to consider
how
much choice there really is is the
choice illusory or do new regimes have
to deal with the situation that is
around them the basic constraints in
dealing with other nations would you for
example knowing that Cuba was 90 miles
away from Miami 91 miles away from
aggressive superpower that is
broadcasting propaganda into Cuba the
introduced censorship would you
introduce state police as a way of
preventing the removal of independence
from Cuba because it seems to me that
these are the questions that are going
to have to be faced by nations that are
struggling not only to overthrow their
rulers but to be independent as a nation
from Western powers afterwards well
Cuba's a very special case so I don't I
mean to some extent it has
characteristics like other small
countries but it is unique for 50 years
the United States has been dedicated to
strangling and crushing Cuba yeah and
the Kennedys a Latin American adviser
said the problem is the Castro idea of
taking matters into your own hands which
might lead others in similar
circumstances to try to follow that path
and pretty soon the whole system of US
control would erode so for those reasons
which persist the United States has
carried out first of all a massive
terror campaign that cube has been the
victim of more terror than probably the
whole world combined in international
terror and the beyond that economic
strangulation
I would extraordinary sort if you are a
population that wants to be independent
that wants an independent state we might
talk about other forms of Independence
later but an independent state in
defiance of NATO or if you need China in
defiance of China or
for some of the former Soviet states
then they're kind comes at a cost and in
the in the case of Cuba
perhaps that cost is the Jurina state of
war being in a state of war you look
around the world there are similar
problems but not as dire as the one that
Cuba faces so go a little bit to the
south South America and one of the most
dramatic and important of developments
of the past decade is that South America
for the first time since the European
conquerors came for the first time in
five hundred years has made a very
significant move towards independence
towards integration there isn't a single
US military base left in South America
it's pretty remarkable wait what do you
think Terrace well I think that over the
last decades the most significant
changes we've seen have come in from
South America I mean I visited Venezuela
Bolivia Brazil and the mood is just
different and many people say it's the
first time ever we feel really
independent there whatever the
weaknesses might be of these regimes and
there are some they are sovereign states
and they act as such and when Chavez for
instance says something to the United
States he's very blunt and open about it
and he told me once he said you know I
gave a speech in the UN and a lot of
other countries who can't say the same
public come and congratulate me and say
thank you you're speaking for all of us
and he says I say to them but you can
speak to no one can stop you but you
know the gorge they obviously think they
can't they think they can't and this is
now a mode in most of South America I
mean with the exception of Colombia
Mexico and partially Chile elsewhere
people are feeling we're independent for
the first time ever I think this is
going to be a huge problem for the
United States I mean they're obsessed
with the Arab world in China and now
Iran but in South America for for for a
decade or a bit
all the united states is not in control
worries an enormous Lee in fact and the
National Security Council top Planning
Organization warned that if we cannot
control Latin America how are we going
to impose a successful order on the rest
of the world meaning rule the rest of
the world so if we can't control even
our backyard how are we going to control
everything else now as a deeper point
now moving over to the Middle East the
deep concern in the United States and
the other and traditional imperial power
it's Britain and France particularly
concern is that now they may the Middle
East might get out of control and that's
serious much more serious than South
America I agreed that's why they invaded
Lee be a gnome I have no doubt about it
was to re-establish control I agree but
I think it's all over so for example if
you take a look at what's happened in
the Arab Spring the countries that are
crucial to Western imperial power the
oil producers they have been under a
very tough hand in Saudi Arabia equate
the Emirates the major oil-producing
regions it never got off the ground the
intimidation of the security forces
backed by the West was so enormous that
people were literally afraid to go into
the streets and reaiize the West mainly
France in Tunisia the United States and
Britain and Egypt are following a very
traditional pattern there's a playbook
that you pursue that you gives you a
kind of a game plan when some favored
dictators lose the capacity to rule what
you do is support them until the last
possible minute when it's impossible any
longer maybe the army turns against them
you get your intellectual class to issue
ringing declarations about democracy and
then you try to restore the old system
as much as possible that's what's done
with Somoza
Marcos Duvalier
puttu Suharto I mean it's routine it
takes genius not to see it but I think
the real problem Julian is that
democracy itself is in very serious
trouble because of the corporations when
you have two European countries when you
have Greece and Italy the politicians
abdicating and sing let bankers on earth
yes I mean where is it going to go you
know so what we are witnessing is that
democracy is becoming more and more
denuded of content it's like an empty
shell and this is what has angering
young people who feel whatever we do
whatever we vote for nothing changes
hands all these protests and do you
think it's you know this problem is it
is it the media is it structural is it
is it the increased ability of the
center to control the periphery as a
result of more sophisticated
telecommunications it is what's what's
what's driving it
what's writing it is a democracy that
has become petrified but the media has
become a pillar a central pillar now of
the establishment much more than it was
during the Cold War at that time they
were proving to the Russians and the
Chinese our system is better than yours
now they don't feel the need to prove it
so they operate as they won't be all
that they are using freedom of
expression as a stick to beat the Soviet
Union and now there's no need for that I
think you have this like alliance
between liberals and military and the
elite in the West all coming together
for mutual interests to demonstrate the
superiority of the West compared to
Soviet and that that sort of very
unnatural alliance is now split apart
its split apart and be within the
Western world they have now got things
controlled to such an extent that they
literally get away with murder I mean
Obama has now signed a law according to
which the American president has the
right to authorize the killing of an
American citizen without any recourse to
law at all no due process which no other
US president in history is done they
even during the Civil War the people who
try to kill Lincoln or killed Lincoln
the conspirators were tried in a court
however faulty it was no longer you can
order someone to be killed and this
attack on civil liberties is of course
extremely disturbing because it really
affects democracy
do you think these social movements that
are happening in Latin America if you
look at the sort of the technological
adoption in Latin America it's somewhere
like the u.s. walls in the 1970s and and
is that is the political and social
interaction that is occurring in those
states as a result of the technological
interactions that are occurring so
perhaps it is simply not possible for a
more industrialized country to adopt the
model of a less industrialized country
would we have to throw away the
industrialization to do it I don't think
so I mean most of these western states
are very happily become D industrialized
and made China into the dominant
economic power in the world like the
British were in the 19th century in
China is the workshop of the world
there's been a huge increase the the
actual the workforce while declining in
the West has trebled from 1 billion in
the 70s and 80s to over 3 billion today
because of what's happening in China
India parts of South America so I think
the so-called advanced powers have a lot
to learn from the good things that have
been happening in South America why not
that knowing is is there a model a
practical functioning model well I think
I agree with Tarek there's many models
but the I don't think that the popular
force is concerned with changing their
own societies should be looking for
models I think they should be creating
the models well so and that's exactly
what's happened
so models in South America let's say
there's been a lot of progress there
developing models in take say in Bolivia
mentioned a couple of times one of the
most striking things that's happened
there is that the most repressed part of
the population in the hemisphere of the
indigenous population has moved into the
political arena has in fact taken
political power and it's pursuing its
own concerns it's also happening in
Ecuador and to an extent in Peru well
they're developing new and significant
models and some of the aspects of those
models the West had better pick up
pretty soon or else sold on me over we
always had this claim that capitalism
and democracy goes together and China
seems to be the great example that it's
it's even more efficient at being a
capitalist state than a democratic what
I never believed that capitalism and
democracy go together
the Chinese demonstrate that today that
the most successful capitalist country
in the world is not an ounce of
democracy in the way it functions but
even historically for hundreds of years
of its existence
capitalism function without democracy
till the beginning of the 20th century I
mean women won't be given the vote of
the First World War so either no
democracy or a truncated democracy suits
capitalism perfectly in this notion that
capitalism and democracy go together was
a Cold War construct designed to hammer
the the Russians and the East Europeans
and the Chinese it has no basis in in
historical fact though first of all we
don't have capitalist societies we have
one or another variety of state
capitalism and that's true wherever an
industrial system functions so for
example in the United States the state
role in the economy is enormous I mean
let's take what the three of us are
doing right now this is based on the
IT revolution computers internet
satellite micro electronics and so on
most of this was developed at the state
sector in fact exactly where I'm sitting
at MIT was one of the places where these
things were being developed in the 50s
and the 60s under a pentagon funding
mostly it was both funding subsidy
invention creation also procurement that
in four decades this was in state sector
before it was handed over to private
capital for commercialization and profit
and if you go back this tecnique
illogical progress you know in the 1930s
you would you from literature from that
period you often see the Soviets talking
about how their system is simply more
efficient and therefore as a fission
system of industry it will dominate and
you also saw the Nazis speaking
precisely the same terms that this
massive technological investment
producing an efficient industry will
simply dominate other forces around it
is isn't this a basic ideological
constraint that regardless of what
system that you want the grants for
people desire
maybe we all be nice to each other for a
change something very very basic simple
human decency if that system is not
efficient compared to another system the
other system will simply grow in scale
until it dominates well um it will but
only if it grows militarily you see the
United States is weak economically at
the moment you know it's hugely in debt
as normos pointed out it's real
structural crisis but it is very
dominant militarily and it uses its
military strength to dominate other
parts of the world which might be doing
well economically they don't have that
strength that's the problem we face so
this this conflict between the desire to
do something for ideological reasons and
then a sort of practical reality that
say
totalitarian capitalism may simply be
the most efficient system and therefore
will dominate it's not an efficient
system if I take a look at China a
Chinese growth has been spectacular but
China has grown largely as an assembly
plant it's primarily the assembly plant
for the advanced industrial countries on
its periphery Japan Taiwan South Korea
so for example take say Foxconn this
huge hideous Factory in China where
working conditions are utterly grotesque
it's a Taiwanese own Factory
it produces a Apple computers iPods Dell
computers and so on what's happened over
the past years is that China has been
the assembly plant for the advanced
industrial state capitalist countries on
its periphery and for Western
multinationals now of course sooner or
later China will begin to move up the
technology ladder in fact in some
respect it's already happening that
China has actually begun to innovate
with solar cells that surpass those
elsewhere and that will begin to happen
elsewhere that's a long slow process
Tarek Tarek both both UN no have had a
long long life as activists so when you
look at this generation of activists now
in the West that is that is just
starting to be politically rather
radicalized I think the internet
radicalize youth is probably the best
way that I would describe them what what
do you want to tell them what experience
that you have had through these multiple
battles over over dozens of years can
you give to them because it seems to me
that there was a moment perhaps during
the 80s and 90s that there was no
continuity from this tradition of
dissent in the West Tarek I try avoid
giving advice to younger generations
generations are so different from each
other and given the world has changed so
much the only Universal advice to be
given is don't give up you'll live
through bad times and you feel you know
that everything is lost and many people
become passive but passivity which is is
usually leads to despair and I think
it's extremely important to realize for
young people growing up today that they
need to be active an active activity is
something that leads to hope and that
unless they're active themselves no one
is going to hand them anything on the
plate that's the lesson of the last few
years with this new radicalization don't
give up have hope
remain skeptical be critical of the
system that dominates us all and sooner
or later if not in this generation in
generations to come things will change
hello well a lot of things have changed
over the years and they've changed it
often to the better they've changed
because lots of dedicated people
committed themselves to it and that
history has mended those changes ahead
and we can do something about them and
in fact there are there are very serious
problems so for example if if the
species continues on its present course
we probably will be facing destruction
of the possibility for decent survival
simply because of things like fossil
fuel use that's extremely serious issue
and it's kind of like you know the
lemmings going over the cliff
