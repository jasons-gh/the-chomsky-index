chomsky dot info is his website and
professor chomsky welcome
uh welcome to our program i i'm
wondering if
uh if first of all thanks so much for
joining us today i i hope all is well
with you
yeah that's fine okay thank you
um i'm curious your thoughts on
the movement toward fascism in the
united states if you if you want to
share with us your
understanding of an operational
definition of fascism
and to what extent our overall political
systems and our
two major political parties are moving
in that direction and why
well first of all it's not the two
political parties
it's uh the democrats are pretty much
what they used to be the eu
they're split between a kind of a stab
clintonite establishment which is not
very different from what used to be
called
moderate republicans and uh popular base
which is
much of it under the sanders umbrella
which is moving well to the left
the republicans have gone way off the
spectrum
they're now ranked in international
rankings
with some of the european parties that
have
neo-fascist origins
if even the mainstream commentators
describe them as a
radical insurgency which is abandoned
parliamentary politics this has become
very extreme under trump
but it's been going on for some time uh
the term fascism i think is
thrown around much too loosely
there are many symptoms that
are common to what we saw in the fascist
states
like resort to violence
calling in troops to repress
protesters things like that but it's not
fascism
i mean to uh it does too much credit to
trump
to call him an incipient fascist
fascism was an ideology a conception
a way to organize society but this is
way beyond his bakery he's
a ten-pot dictator trying to maintain
control for himself and for the
groups that he serves with the
passion and the dedication ultra wealth
and corporate power
now fascism was very different the
fascism meant
that the powerful state
under the control of the dominant party
at the maximal leader
which control all of society uh
it would indeed including the business
world they would be under the control of
the
maximum leader in his uh the party with
uh
you know brown shirts and black shirts
in the streets enforcing it
that's not our system we're nowhere near
that
in fact we're closer to the opposite
where the business world
basically control pretty much controls
the government
so there are very ugly and dangerous
signs
but they i think they should be regarded
as like
kind of what's like happening in a small
third world neocolony
uh where there's a a harsh dictator or a
country who
which has a military coup over a couple
of years and is
falling apart that's not fascism
of course the united states does have
resilient institutions which can't
overcome this
it's a phenomenon that's taking place it
doesn't have to
be it doesn't have to prevail
so when trump called in
federal troops to impose his
rule over washington and dominate
the protesters with fierce vicious dogs
and so on
he tried but he failed the pentagon
wouldn't accept it and withdrew the
troops
uh in the case of portland i think he
realized he can't use federal troops the
military won't agree with
it so he is paramilitaries
of the border patrol which functions not
far from where i live in tucson which is
basically a wallace or a military
militia
do what they like in the border areas
and
they can go wild in portland too but
they had to be withdrawn
so these are very dangerous signs and
there are more things to worry about
trump's latest uh pentagon appointment
which he made by an executive order
yesterday
top official in the pentagon tata
couldn't pass congressional reviews so
he just appointed him
that's very much like the his purge of
the executive branch
if inspector generals are coming too
close to investigating
his swamp that a swamp that he's created
in washington
then fire them all and the senate
republicans
are called they don't raise a word of
protest
charles grassley made a mild protest and
that was about
it uh this is it's a very
there's a dangerous signs and we should
be wary of them
but they are not in a situation where
they can
get out of control we're not in germany
in 1932.
where did this in your opinion professor
chomsky begin
was this is this the the the logical
outgrowth of the power memo
or out of the supreme court's buckley
and bloody decisions that basically
said it's okay to own and and bribe
politicians it's now legal
or was this the consequence of the nixon
administration
or is this all the child of reaganism i
mean you know the these
we've seen this kind of authoritarianism
floating around in american society
you know throughout our history
certainly but in the modern era uh we
have a a
little more just a little short of two
minutes before we're going to hit our uh
our first break here yeah
well we've gone through 40 years
of a neo-liberal assault on the society
and in fact on much of the world it
began with late carter took off under
reagan
the effects are very clear and explicit
and it was pretty obvious what's going
to happen
uh when you the the system has been
designed there's no time to go
through the details but it's been
designed so that
there's tremendous accumulation of
wealth
in a tiny percentage of the population
0.1 percent of the population has
20 of the wealth that's about twice as
much as before
reagan for the general population it's
been
mostly stagnation or decline majority of
the population that can barely get by
from
paycheck to paycheck the corporate power
has
greatly increased there's been a process
of monopolization
of the society across the board
it's part of the whole system very
damaging to
consumers uh very
beneficial to the corporate sector
at the top of the corporate sector and
the ultra rich
it's left people angry frustrated
resentful contemptuous of authority
it's a fertile ground for demagogues to
come and say
i'll save you the year
and we've seen this happening here
brazil uh turkey hungary
india uh here is the most important
but it can be controlled meanwhile there
are popular forces developing of a kind
you said that there are are ways to
fight
back that that we have institutions that
have some resilience
relative to this what how
well first of all the basic institutions
are still functioning
trump is trying to destroy them and the
republican party
if it's you want to call it a party
anymore it's basically going along
but there's a chance to overcome this
furthermore let's not overlook
the real politics that's taking place
in the streets take a look at what's
happening in the country
the black lives matter protests are the
largest uh mass social force that's
developed in
probably in american history very
rapidly
enormous popular support two-thirds of
the public supports them
that's way beyond the support that
martin luther king had at the peak of
his popularity
and there are not and there it's it's
recent
it's just coalescing the programs are
being formed
some of them go deep into
institutional crises of the society
uh with engagement
participation commitment
serious attention to what has to be done
unwillingness to be diverted this could
turn into a
major popular force connecting with the
groups that have coalesced under the um
sanders umbrella others that have
developed the
environmental groups and others that's a
period of
enormous ferment lots of options for
constructive and positive change just
to give one example of many of the
sunrise movement which has been at the
forefront of environmental activism
uh pretty much succeeded in getting the
democratic party campaign
to pick the most uh
the most significant program they've
ever taken
on global warming uh two trillion dollar
commitment to uh devote
a resource to the problem a
plan to move net zero emissions forward
by
over a decade all of this is important
this continues it can create a new
america based on a green new deal
which will create a new economy very
beneficial to the general population
and to saving the world from disaster
all of these options are open to us yes
there's a wrecker in the white house who
wants to destroy everything and save
himself
and these and the forces he serves
those that have benefited from the
neoliberal soul
there are counter forces and it's a
question there's
a kind of class struggle on a major
scale
and serious chances for victory
uh professor chomsky you are a professor
linguistics this is your
your background and i'm wondering your
thoughts on
the way that authoritarians um
both in in in the republican party in
the in the political structure in the
united states and
in the media i'm thinking fox news
right-wing hate radio but i think it
probably goes beyond that
the way that authoritarians are using
language as
part of their their uh systematic as uh
you know attack essentially on american
democracy
well you don't have to be a linguist to
see this and linguistics tells you
it's just ordinary common sense so take
the trump campaign
he's now focusing on
the radical left revolutionaries who are
planning
to take over the country to destroy
everything we have
to turn it into a you know some
extremist communist dictatorship
this is use of language if you like but
it's
that's the kind of thing you heard from
joe mccarthy from uh
let's go back to my childhood to
father coglin the anti-semitic racist it
was very popular much other things
through history nothing about language
what we should do is just look at the
facts that are developing
so take the radical left that
uh trump is trying to energize his
based about what is it exactly
is it bernie sanders take a look at
sanders's main programs
universal health care free higher
education
can you think of another country that
has
universal health care can you think of
one that doesn't have it
what about free higher education founded
rich countries like germany finland
france elsewhere
poor countries like mexico and it's
almost everywhere
so what sanders is saying let's try to
rise to the level
of other countries that's radical and
revolutionary
quite an insult to the united states to
claim that
uh he's calling for basically
new deal style policies of his social
democratic character
which most of the country supports the
uh ultra rich the corporate sector the
financial sector
they don't like it and they shouldn't be
permitted to rule the country
we have it within our power to prevent
that easily
these are developments that have taken
place
primarily during the neoliberal era of
course they have roots beyond
which can be reversed overcome and
turned in quite different directions so
within our power uh
corporate sorry go ahead
i was going to say that the corporate
sector is
well aware of the fragility
of their control we should be aware of
it too
it depends on consent and the consent
can be withdrawn i'm sure you've seen
that the
statements by a couple hundred corporate
executives saying
to the public we realize we've gone
wrong
we have to change course from now on
we're going to be
dedicated humanists concerned with your
welfare
uh so put your trust in us that's a sign
of how scared they are
every january there's a meeting of
people who
modestly call themselves the masters of
the universe
in davis switzerland a ski resort in
switzerland
wealthy ceos top media figures
and people from the entertainment
industry congratulating each other on
how
wonderful they are and so on this last
january was different
the team last january was what i just
described
we have to recognize that we've
done things that are harming the public
and are now harming us and we have to
tell the general
public that we're sorry for the mistakes
we've carried out
we've now changed you can now put your
trust in us
that we'll take care of you now this is
something we've heard before
in the 1950s the line was
that we're moving towards what we're
called soulful
corporations not corporations that are
not committed to
greed but are soulful working for the
benefit of humanity
okay we've had half a century or more
to figure out how well how that message
turned out
now we're hearing it again and it's a
sign
of the recognition that the control
and domination is fragile it can be
taken consent can be removed we have
the possibility of moving towards a
far more constructive benign
future which will deal with the
existential crises that we face
and will create a society that's based
on mutual support
a concern for people's needs
uh development for progress
not profit all of this is possible
