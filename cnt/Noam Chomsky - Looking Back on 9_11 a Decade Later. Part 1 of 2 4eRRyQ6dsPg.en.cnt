these are some of the headlines this is
democracy now democracynow.org the war
and peace report I'm Amy Goodman as we
continue to mark the decades since the
September 11th attacks in the United
States today we spend the hour with MIT
professor world renowned political
dissident linguist and author Noam
Chomsky in the months after 9/11 as the
Bush administration attacked Afghanistan
and geared up for the invasion of Iraq
Noam Chomsky released a small book that
provided the definitive counter
narrative to the jingoism of the time
the book was called simply 9/11 a
collected series of interviews Chomsky
had given on the roots of the 9/11
attacks and his prescription for a just
response at a time when lawmakers from
both sides of the aisle joined together
to authorize endless war Chomsky's was
the leading voice to call for a look in
the mirror for a rethinking of US
actions in the Middle East and across
the globe
9/11 went on to become a surprise
bestseller
ten years later professor Chomsky has
just released an updated version it's
called 911 was there an alternative was
there an alternative refers to the u.s.
assassination of Osama bin Laden and the
continuity Chomsky sees between the Bush
administration's foreign policy and
President Obama's today we'll speak with
Noam Chomsky about the decades since
9/11 at a time when the u.s. is at war
in several areas at home and continued
economic turmoil Noam Chomsky's just
returned from Iceland and Norway he's
joining us from Boston Massachusetts and
I'm joined here in New York for this
interview by Democracy Now producer
Aaron mate' who covered the forted Gaza
bound aid flotilla in Greece welcome
Aaron joining me in the center view it's
good to have you with us thanks Amy and
thanks so much Noam Chomsky for being
with us so soon after you've come back
from your trip you know why don't we
begin with this new book you wrote 9/11
ten years ago the what became the canoe
fin ative counter-narrative at the time
did you feel was important to understand
then and now with was there an
alternative well as you mentioned it
wasn't really a book it was a collection
of interviews the ones that we were able
to get transcripts were some of them we
couldn't the there were a number of
things that I thought had been pointed
out by now I think they're hardly and
controversial but the one was that the
the claim that the US was being attacked
because as the president put it they
hate our freedoms was completely
untenable they hated our policy the fact
it would be more accurate to say we hate
their freedoms there's plenty of
documentation about that you know going
back to the 1950s shortly after the
President's speech the Pentagon had a
study of this and they concluded yes
it's not that they hate our freedoms as
they hate our policies and as I say the
evidence about that is enormous back to
the 50s so for example in 1958 President
Eisenhower in internal documents long
since released asked his raised the
question with his staff about why
there's a campaign of hatred against us
in the Arab world
he said not from the government's but
from the people and the National
Security Council major planning body had
just released a study on this in which
they said that they concluded that
there's a perception in the Arab world
that the United States supports harsh
oppressive dictatorships and that the
u.s. blocks democracy and development
and that we do it because we want to
keep control over their energy resources
and I went on to say that this is fairly
accurate and that's pretty much what we
should be doing
as long as the populations that kept
quiet and it's so it goes on I won't run
through the details but so it goes on
until the present the in fact right at
this moment
Obama has succeeded in descending even
below george w bush and approval in the
our world it's minuscule few percent and
it's the policy same policy the policies
change but they're hostile so one thing
is we should understand where atrocities
come from they don't come from nowhere
and if we're serious we should try to do
something about what is the basis for
them that's been the other issue which i
was important i think we have a lot more
evidence about it now is that there
there probably were a much more
constructive alternatives it appeared
the attack the attack on the the 9/11
attack was pretty harshly criticized in
the throughout the muslim world but
particularly in the jadi movement you
know fought was from leading clerics
harsh condemnation it would have been
it's it's very likely that it would have
been possible then to split the jadi
movement to isolate al-qaeda to move to
apprehend the suspects and of course in
our system of justice theoretically
people are suspects unless they're until
their sentence so to apprehend the
suspects treated as a criminal action
try to make use of the fact that there
were that there was tremendous
antagonism to this even among the jihadi
movement and move on to much more
constructive relationship with the
general muslim arab world
well that path wasn't taken the path
that was taken was the lash out
first in Afghanistan then in Iraq that
simply was kind of following Osama bin
Laden's playbook after that was pointed
out pretty quickly by people like
michael Scheuer the he didn't identify
himself then has since the CIA head of
the CIA task force that was tracking bin
Laden he has ended up concluding the
United States is in Botton's best ally
we're helping his goal was to mobilize
the Muslim world around the fear that
the United States was attacking Islam
was carrying out a crusade they have to
defend themselves and we helped the
invasion of Iraq particularly was gave a
big shot in the arm to the jihadi
extremists it was predicted by US and
British intelligence agencies that's
been really since that the attack on
Iraq would increase terror and it did by
a factor of seven in the first year
according to RAND Corporation
quasi-governmental statistics well
that's that's what happens when you lash
out violently without seeking to
understand the nature of what's
happening and pursuing the options for
diplomatic peaceful negotiated
settlements and treating crimes as
crimes when there's a crime you try to
identify the likely perpetrators and
apprehend them bring them to bring them
to a fair trial I mean that it's very
likely that that could have been done at
the Times we don't know there were
tentative offers from the Taliban to
allow a try
I love bin Laden it was not pursued it
was for the u.s. just dismiss that we
don't talk to you well could that have
succeeded we can only speculate it
surely could have been done on May 2nd
when the US
commandos Navy SEALs apprehended bin
Laden defenseless was with his wife no
arms no apprehended him and assassinated
him then dumped his body at sea now
that's kind of an action which is just
bound to increase speculation cynicism
doubt they're quite different from what
what in fact has sure been done actually
one of the leading British legal
specialists civil libertarian who
incidentally approved of the action
nevertheless pointed out that that the
way it was carried out was criminal and
in dangerous and his implications he
compared it to the treatment of the far
more horrendous war criminals after the
second world war he pointed out that the
British government want to just kill the
Nazi leaders but the US government
Truman insisted that they be tried they
followed and in fact then came the
Nuremberg trials which had their flaws
but at least did bring out the in public
the nature of the crimes it they also
led to a quite an important conclusion
by the chief prosecutor u.s. chief
prosecutor Justice Robert Jackson he
informed the tribunal in another
eloquent words that we as he put it
we're
these defendants a poison showers and if
we ever sip from it if we ever commit
such crimes as aggression one of the
major crimes
then we must suffer the same punishment
or else essentially the trials of forest
and that's a choice we've had to make
sense not the right answer in my opinion
