you have mostly half of and save iPhones
or something like that in your pocket
take a look at them they for example
they have in the GPS where the GPS come
from it's created by the US Navy the
Navistar program that has micro
electronics and software hardware
created almost all created for decades
mostly in the state sector under often
in the u.s. Pentagon funding here the
counterpart taxpayers pay for this
because they think they're protecting
their security that's what they're told
but in fact the government doesn't care
about your security what it cares of is
about its own power and security for
corporate power and the way the system
works is the taxpayer takes the risks
carries out the investment for decades
literally decades finally something may
come out which is profitable and then
the profit goes to the private sector if
if we had anything remotely like
capitalist systems we don't they would
they would adhere to the capitalist
principle that if an investor takes
risks and you know invests and waits and
picks risky steps and if something comes
out of it the profit goes back to the
investor that's not the way it works
here the profit goes to people who had
nothing to do with it the risks are
taken by you often through the Pentagon
and comparable systems and if anything
comes out the profits go to Microsoft
and Apple now they didn't create it as a
bar they take it it's given to them and
it literally is decades so computers
were the first the computer market
personal computer market became viable
in 1977 I think it was Apple was the
first that was about 30 years after the
development of computers almost all in
the state sector like in the building
and it's the same if you buy
pharmaceuticals let's say as a research
the basic research and development is
pretty much done in the state sector
places like probably the biology lab
right here probably gets government
funding grants and that's all across the
board when you look back at these I
mentioned the trans-pacific partnership
one part of that was leaked by WikiLeaks
it's secret except for the corporate
lawyers and lobbyists but one part was
leaked it was under the part on
intellectual property intellectual
property is a polite term a kind of a
euphemism for government instituted
monopoly pricing rights that's what it
really means
it means extraordinarily high
patent rights which have never existed
in history for the pharmaceutical
corporations and some other corporations
that's to keep the price of drugs up and
make profits astronomical now there's a
pretext of the pharmaceutical
corporation say look we need that for
research and development that's been
investigated turns out but it's probably
at least half of the RMD it's not done
by the pharmaceutical corporations at
all stunned by the state sector and so
on and that's an underestimate because
if you take a close look the part that's
done by the pharmaceutical corporations
is towards the marketing end like you
know flip around a molecule to get a new
drug but the basic research the hard
costly risky research that's done by
people like you you pay for it through
your taxes and the pharmaceutical
corporations rip off the profit
