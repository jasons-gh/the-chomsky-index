there were also people who lived through
a childhood of immense inundation visual
propaganda you know number of hours that
they were brought up watching television
as long as all that's
[Music]
where's folks especially
[Music]
are much work
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
that was something wrong way the iris
comedy get real want me to disregard the
camera thank you hi and thank you for
tuning in I'm Jay and I'll be your
bartender and my name is Bea I'll be
your editor and no Chomsky Noam Chomsky
the yeah it was in town here to speak
with us and and while he's here he's
also going to speak to be speaking of
EIU on tour him but he came to see us
teacher them at the working language
philosophy yeah cognitive psychology
large part of my life is devoted to
what's called politics yeah I think we
should I think we should introduce the
show out here okay um just because I
thought that that what what happened in
that studio was kind of lame okay so so
hello and welcome to J and B on the
rocks I'm J and I'm the bartender of
this program yeah and my name is B I
actually edit things and that's why I'm
able to just oh snap my fingers say and
you'll see something else any any number
of bodily noises can be used to segue to
something for example well noam chomsky
for example uses this uh this cough of
his
had this thing for three months really
interested in a theory that you have
called the propaganda model and I was
wondering if you could explain what that
is yeah I would theory that's more like
a truism everything in the social sense
there's what are sometimes called the
agenda-setting media the winners who set
the framework that other is adhere to
and they're the ones with the big
resources and the big outreach it's on
and then there's the general media's
local newspapers television and so on
much of what they do is sort of a
diversion they keep people out of
trouble you know sort of pay attention
to something that doesn't matter
the agenda-setting media are aimed
especially as journals like The New York
Times The Washington Post and so on at
the sort of decision-making sectors you
know educated sectors it's sometimes
called the political class
so the agenda-setting media kind of set
the framework and that's kind of fit
here's to it so the local newspaper
whatever it is doesn't have reporters
all over the world all the news bureaus
and so on and without looking at it I
can you can obviously predict that it's
going to pick up its decisions as to
what's the story of the day and from
what came across on the AP wire so
anyway there's the mainstream media
there's the what Chomsky talked about
the general media and the agenda-setting
media okay the agenda-setting media are
kind of up here right and they set the
agenda the general media is kind of
underneath and they just follow the
agenda and then under that there's the
alternative media kind of is doing their
own thing but no one's really paying too
much attention and then under that is
Jay and be on the rocks this TV show
that you're watching now not only is no
one paying any attention but even we
don't know what we're talking about
but if we might look you know they're
relatively insignificant compared right
exactly their influence
they are huge corporations parts of even
bigger ones very profitable ones they
like other corporations they have a
product in the market the market is
other big businesses mainly advertisers
no time keeps me going
the product is audiences and in their
case fairly privileged audiences I'd
like to show you something that I think
Jane has sitting over there this is an
ad from a broadcast TV which is a it's a
magazine which is selling TV shows to
different stations trying to get them to
make it up and now this is a particular
show called time to generate which is
targeted to Generation X that's why the
X is so big and I see in the next
generation and I would call your
attention especially to where is it the
oh they're the 18 to 34 demographic that
advertisers advertisers are buying yeah
that seems strange when I when I read
that I mean how can uh that's exactly
right
how can you buy a demographic will you
by people I mean what the media cell is
audiences that's their product and
advertisers buy it that's exactly the
correct description okay that almost
makes it sound like they're not there in
the paying I mean they're paying the
producer for the product so like if
you're whoever you know it's producing a
whatever I know what they're selling but
let's say it's a sitcom tell
somebody's producing it they've got a
product the the product that they're in
fact I mean they're actually making the
signal but what they're selling through
the advertiser is not the city code
they're selling the Watchers ya know
they're selling the audience to the
advertisers who are buying the audience
and effect than paying the guy who
produced it some advertising fee so
they're terminologies quite accurate
yeah and it seems like a very simple
common-sense thing but I think that most
most people don't say television I mean
the the guys who CBS doesn't make any
money when you turn the tool on anything
what they get money from is if
somebody's giving them advertising
revenue so the propaganda model simply
suggests a truism namely that the media
product should reflect its institutional
nature that isn't written reflect it
expect it to reflect the interests and
concerns of the business community
primarily big business government which
is closely linked to the corporate
interests power it's not about a deep
profound philosophical conversation it's
just about fun it's about relationships
so what about this Noam Chomsky guy he's
a character hey Jenny Beasley why don't
you transition for us into this next
scene okay relationships what
relationships for example our
relationship to you the camera operator
Chris Maron in fact if you turn the
camera around Chris you'll be able to
see yourself see yourself you wanted
Terry I'm right here I'm the camera guy
right now yeah I had a great time yeah
and they're really the necessary
illusions are everywhere just look
around you and wonder what could have
been if it wasn't this way right now
necessary illusions this is something
that uh Noam Chomsky talks about a lot
I'm not sure if he mentioned it really
in our interview but I think maybe I did
accidentally so what what and there are
certain necessary illusions that the
government or the ruling class and must
maintain in the
of the people in order to continue
fucking them up the ass as they do yeah
like the illusion that that the American
government has any reason to be the only
government for example and you know
there's been an increasing
federalization of of our government
there's less local control these days
than there then there has been in the
past and as a result people are are
under the control of a distant ruling
class in Washington DC that has very
little to do with them it's a big
problem deficit too much money too you
know and the children and so on there's
another whole welfare system nobody ever
talks about the that's the the fiscal
measures which essentially give you tax
tax deductions for various expenditures
so it's a home mortgage loans get tax
deductions or business expenses you know
take your colleagues afterwards or
charitable expenditures and hold massive
stuff which are by fiscal measures
reduce your taxes well that's the exact
equivalent of welfare payments the exact
equivalent I mean it's no difference if
you you know if you take a hundred
dollars this guy doesn't pay a hundred
dollars in taxes that's exactly the same
that make me pay everything given $100
come down and say yeah but so there's a
huge welfare state sometimes called the
hidden welfare state goes overwhelmingly
to the welcome you know we'd have to
think about is the mother with dependent
children you know
supposed to think about the executive
who's written you off from the other
thing some other fashion oh that's the
same kind of thing except that the
welfare state for the rich is much more
extensive I mean take say the health
thing the other big issue well you know
there's one very striking property of
the all the plans that are being
considered to striking properties click
Cooper unveils what is and this is being
discussed to a certain extent that the
vest authority and the hands of huge
insurance companies and the other is
that the the other factor which nobody
talks about is it they're radically
regressive so if you haven't say a tax
based system like Canada it's as
progressive as the tax system is you
know the richer you are the more you pay
all of these systems are regressive oh
you're the chairman of the board of
General Motors and you and the secretary
and the janitor all in effect pay the
same amount for health care in fact it's
even worse than that that's how I heard
it
that's is it everybody names name of
that of taxes well you know as a tax
system that would be outlandish but this
time they didn't every disco I mean you
try to find a word about it yeah well
same is our story
don't want people to think about the
things that better do them yeah and
they're a couple of ways of doing that
one is to tell them morality plays about
figure skating in order to watch the
Super Bowl or something rather just
divert that's one way the other way is
to shape the discussion and presentation
of issues that people just know see
there has been a very significant
indoctrination campaign since the bit
more since the 60s some in the 60s were
a period of sort of breaking out of
controls and it scared people as well
this is a periodic thing in American
history
I think there was nothing Louisville no
everything there has been public Fuhrman
there has been a major attempt to drive
people back into their holes well you
know the sixties began to permit
developed again and then came the
inevitable effort to regress and it's
been less successful so there's much
more I think probably the activist
movements of growth since the sixties
there was an article that I read
somewhere recently an interview with you
where you argued that the Gulf War was
in a sense success for the peace
movement why did you send him well it's
the first time in history that I know of
that there were huge demonstrations
against the war before the war broke out
a comparative in the case of a Gulf War
it was before the body that's never
happened we kind of wanted to shift
gears and talk a little bit about the
drug war which is in essence a war of
the government against its own people
why is this war being waged I think it
was one of the techniques of social
control it was the drug war that Bush
launched in 1989 was not the first
several and if you look at them they're
always I think they're always time with
relation to issues of social control
so take the 1989 what was on the new
crisis and try the snow on the country
in fact hard drug use had been declining
and part of the reason why they could
launch the drug war and expect favorable
results was that if the tendencies
continue they did we'll say two years
later well you know look at the figures
see what great things we did there was
no new crisis in 1989 but there were
there was another crisis namely the
Saudi Navy was collapsing now the major
technique of social control for a long
time since the First World War had been
communists are coming well getting very
hard to say that not Bush's speech
announcing the drug war was in early
September and at the time of his speech
public opinion studies showed that the
drugs were concerned over drugs way down
you know but if you looked at the
numbers no but if you looked at the
range of issues it was quite low we did
about two or three weeks it had zoom to
learn the parallel level you know the
measures undertaken to the drug we're
had nothing to do with reducing drugs
mm-hmm and he trying to reduce drugs
which he'd go after is first of all
tobacco and second law alcohol which are
the biggest killers by a long shot
he takes a marijuana and you know crack
well marijuana was you know it's been
the main target of the drug war you know
repression and it's when it's I'm sure
it's not good for you but it's not
terribly harm I don't think there's a
single overdose known after
millions of users and then why it's
tobacco legal and marijuana illegal
matters much more harmful my guess is
that tobacco is a basically an
industrial crop make money on it right
whereas know why your backyard at least
wouldn't make any money in it on the
other hand when you knock out the less
harmful drugs like marijuana each drive
people for the more harmful ones to the
industrial product you know the the OP
if you really want to stop drunk you
know the drug hold drug industry the
thing you would target its first of all
the banks what you're doing the money
laundering and then just you know the
chemical corporations on the US chemical
corporations the DEA has pointed out
over and over again they're shipping to
Latin America chemicals way in excess of
any industrial use and exactly the
chemical to go into drug reduction mmm
well okay you heard of any Delta Force
operations taking over the executive
suite you know yeah of course have you
ever been a psychedelic experience
yourself very square okay that must be
one of the few people is never smoke
okay so we've come out here to see her
Cedar Bluff outside of Bloomington
because it's such a beautiful day and
you know we're rebelled we're all taking
the day off we've decided to say fuck it
to our jobs and drink some beer on Cedar
Bluff because you know it's important to
have daily acts of rebellion in your
life
I think chomsky kind of implied that and
and so do we
every day well actually today Saturday
and I don't work on Saturdays and Joe
doesn't have a job I don't have a job
actually I'm unemployed so but I'm
rebelling unemployed what rebels we all
are yeah yeah Cedar Bluff one of
nature's many wonders here in Indiana
you see it there behind me what this
Bluff is this are we in the Bluff yeah
no no we're headed towards the bluff
we're in the bluff area now how did they
decide to call it Cedar Bluff
well probably from the cedar trees
really I don't see any so who was the
governor he was the prow
this back cool Wow must be spring coming
off yeah you can see it it's very bright
wow that must open your eyes
it's almost intoxicating yeah look at
this Wonderland back there cos less you
look with the light soon
Wow yeah yeah so that's kind of our
roles really in this in this program
here yours and B and me and all these
other people that were hanging out with
they're just so long it's kind of
through this otherwise incomprehensible
mess but not if you've been drinking oh
yeah man fuck the revolutionary songs
look at this J and B on the rocks J and
B at the bluffs Cedar Bluff in fact here
in outside of Bloomington it's on the
southwest side of Bloomington it's a
really cool place to come and it's a
lovely day here in southern Indiana so
what about this noam chomsky guy um he's
a character in the film manufacturing
consent you say and this is a quote an
attack on the fundamental structure of
state capitalism isn't horror why do you
believe this and how would such an
attack why do I believe it I think it's
a fundamentally wrong with state
capitalism it's an authoritarian system
with
absolutist institutions that are immune
to public control and I think that's
wrong you know I think that every
institution should be under public
democratic control and that includes the
central institutions in society
furthermore if these not corporations a
fascist this new system basically I mean
you can you know the structure of power
within it strictly top-down if you're
outside it you can whip yourself to it
or not you know a star but you have
nothing to say you know I got if you're
not part of it you can nothing no it's
it's pure absolutism now that's why the
traditional classical liberals were
opposed to corporations joint-stock
companies are it denounced by Adam Smith
and Thomas Jefferson who floated so many
beginnings of the modern corporate
system was appalled by it because these
are just absolute system power I mean
they were given their power by a court
nobody ever voted for it no there was a
change in the legal structure in the
19th century which vested more and more
power and authority supremacy in these
systems of absolute power either you
give me in and you say ok you know those
guys will run my life you know our life
will decline which is what's happening
for what a lot of people are doing is
you joined some fanatic cult neo-nazis
are
or something that's kind of irrational
but understandable answer or you try to
move towards really radical change it
was a scripture refreshment no magic
formula I mean you have you have to
begin with the self education which
usually means working with others
because you know no individual sitting
alone somewhere figure out what's going
on you know the resources at the time
anything else
so it requires organization education
you know political action if you can get
the right scale dismantling with
oppressive structures that's been done
successfully in some areas in the United
States there's been an attack on lots of
structures of domination and authority
and the feminist movement or the gay and
lesbian movement civil rights movement
multicultural movement sort of feminity
environmental movements which are
essentially protecting the rights of
future generations right but they never
got to the core which is the system of
control over production
distribution you know investment capital
essentially I figured to the core these
other tendencies are just going to
continue do you have a favorite mixed
drink big stream i like my bourbon
straight okay from the profound to the
stupid so in but a breath oh my god it's
the tree man with this big scary eyes
yeah but Jenny Beasley will save me she
has come to save me from the tree man
and well I just feel very happy about
that it's just so soft and green look at
that and I can't remember if I heard it
when I was young or if it's true that
women used to use this as maxi pads and
I was thinking it sure would be soft but
what about the bugs
[Music]
as I sit here in my little nature's
hippie cushion or what have you
hey what's that in your hands for you oh
thanks it's my favorite Oh put it over
the lens and we'll see what it does okay
wow look it's you you know I could give
Chomsky sat in this thing his audience
we're up in the bluff maybe you'd have
more success you don't have to be
reclining well we were thinking it'd be
nice if the Bloomington was able to free
itself from some of the bullshit you
know that that exists in our society in
other words if Bloomington were able to
become independent from all the things
that we've been talking about and for
that reason we wanted to found something
I don't know exactly what it would be
maybe we call it the Bloomington
independence Network which would just be
a oh I don't know some kind of loose
touchstone a place a way for people to
make contact with one another as they as
they work to establish the necessary
organizations that would allow us to
achieve independence as a community and
break free from the rigid capitalist
bullshit yeah as Jay says the rigid
capitalist bullshit the yeah yeah you
know the stuff that we consume the stuff
that we need is produced largely in
places that are far far away from
Bloomington well why not have it happen
here just a thought if you're interested
in something like that write to us at
the address that you're seeing on your
screen and if you are doing something
anything really that has some kind of
bearing if you're working in some way to
make Bloomington independent then we'll
gladly give you some kind of media
coverage so that other people can know
what's going on perhaps become involved
or well who knows what let's we just
like to try to explore the potential
that exists here in access television or
whatever it is actually that you're
watching
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
so noam chomsky who the fuck is that you
may be wondering well he's this guy he's
written a bunch of books one of them was
called necessary illusions another one
was called what manufacturing consent
there was a movie actually that was in
the rider festival which comes through
Bloomington sometimes called
manufacturing consent noam chomsky and
the media and it was about him and
actually we found something interesting
out about that movie and Noam Chomsky
Noam Chomsky is in fact never seen that
movie and we asked him about that
just kidding people may take somebody
else's
that's a good point
[Music]
how's your beer in why my beer is very
portable portable your beer on the other
hand B D is not very portable portable
the hell it isn't
yeah it's just an empty keg the hell it
isn't
[Music]
that's just an empty keg you weren't
supposed to tell well you weren't
supposed to get all macho and shit
either
[Music]
