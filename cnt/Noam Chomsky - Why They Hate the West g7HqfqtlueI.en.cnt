why is there hatred against us there
George Bush's famous question well
everyone knows the answer to this a
couple of days after the I mean they
have to distinguish two things here
there's a category of people called
intellectuals their task is to make up
fabrications that protect power and
divert attention from what's obvious and
indoctrinate people and so on they've
concocted all sorts of complicated
stories about globalization and you know
failure din to the modern world and this
that and the other thing okay we and
they envy us because we're so wonderful
etc etc are we put all that aside that
standard propaganda let's talk about
what is plainly the case and it is in
fact discussed by serious people like
say the Wall Street Journal so a few
days after the September 11th the Wall
Street Journal to it began running
serious stories in which they
investigated opinions of the people in
the Islamic world who they're interested
in what they called money Muslims the
ones with the rich ones important ones
so bankers international lawyers
directors of multinational corporations
people who are right inside the US
system who certainly have no opposition
to what's called globalization in fact
that part of it who certainly hate in
Laden because he's trying to kill them
you know but who nevertheless agree with
much of what he says and what they say
is their opinions are that the United
States supports brutal and corrupt
regimes which block democracy and
modernization and development they
oppose particular policies like the
decisive us support for the 35-year up
military occupation of Palestinian
territory which has been harsh and
brutal and realized crucially on us
military and diplomatic support you read
in those papers that Israeli helicopters
and jets are attacking Palestinians
that's total fabrication
US jets and US helicopters which
happened to be piloted by Israeli pilots
are attacking those concentrations
that's what oughta be said Israel
doesn't manufacture helicopters and wear
f-16 and they understand all that they
know that the US has been blocking any
diplomatic settlement for active for 30
years since dot offered 1 1971 it's not
reported here and in the West's not
talked about much but they know it the
and they know what's going on there they
also know perfectly well that the US and
Britain are carrying out operations
against Iraq which are devastating the
civilian society and strengthening said
on the saying and they also remember as
Westerners like to forget that the US
has no and Britain and France and
Holland and so on have no opposition
objection to that the Saddam Hussein's
crimes we know that for sure because
they support supported Saddam Hussein
right through the period of his worst
crimes gassing the Kurds unfollow
chemical weapons they continue to
support him very happily remained a good
favoured friend an ally of the West
which helped provide him with the means
for developing weapons of mass
destruction when he was really dangerous
so they listen when Tony Blair and
Madeleine Albright condemn Saddam
because you know the ultimate monster
even gassed his own people they listen
but they add the words that are excluded
in the West they say yeah he committed
those crimes with your support okay
rather crucial omission which you never
hear from Tony Blair and the rest but
they are not that indoctrinated so they
remember that
those elementary truths and those are
other reasons why if you want there's
hatred against us furthermore there's
absolutely nothing new about this
anybody who wants to understand any of
it that's exactly where to go you go to
the Declassified US record us a very
open society we have Declassified
records of internal deliberations from
the past all these questions came up
decades ago so in 19th and had the same
answers in 1952 58 personal year for
many reasons look I'm not talking about
internal record the u.s. so the
Eisenhower administration discussed
three major crises for the United States
one was Indonesia one was North Africa
third was the Middle East all Islamic
countries all oil producers the question
arose whether the Russians were involved
that was dismissed as ludicrous no
Russian involvement
it's just independent nationalism in the
three countries which was the main
crisis then Eisenhower pointed out with
regard to the Middle East
his words approximately he said there is
a campaign of hatred against us not by
the governments but by the people and
that was an issue that was discussed no
globalization you know no they hate us
because we have McDonald's and none of
this stuff why is there a campaign of
hatred against us well the National
Security Council have discussed it
that's the highest analysis and planning
body and they said the problem is that
there's a perception among the people of
the region that the United States
supports corrupt and harsh regimes which
prevent democratization and development
and does so because of its interest in
controlling near-east oil and they said
it's hard to counter this perception
because it's true and furthermore it
should be true because we should support
those regimes in order to maintain our
control over Near East oil so therefore
it
campaign of hatred against us by the
people who see that we're robbing their
resources and preventing democracy and
development but you know we can't do
much about it because that's what we
ought to be doing well you know like I
say no McDonald's no and being us our
magnificence no globalization just
perfectly obvious things same reason why
there was a campaign of hatred against
England from the people of India or
against Holland from the people of the
East Indies and so on and so forth now
you crush people under your boot they
don't like it so this campaign of hatred
against it in fact what they what they
were discussing internally in 1958 is
the same as what the Wall Street Journal
found and in nineteen in 2001 you know
and for the same reasons because the
policies haven't fundamentally changed
so that's so we understand I mean the
Wall Street Journal only was concerned
with a lead opinion if they'd gone down
to the slums of Cairo there was gotten
stronger opinions but of the same kind
and more different ones also because in
the slums of Cairo they wouldn't like
the fact that the wealth of the region
is going to the west and not to the
people of the region the ones who The
Wall Street Journal was talking about
are quite happy about that because they
are part of the ruling elite and they
enrich themselves while the resources go
to the west so they're part of the
Imperial system so you get different
opinions if you bother to ask people in
the so-called streets but fundamentally
it's the same so there's a camp so there
are so bin Laden's messages certainly
resonate and people agree with a lot of
the things he's saying about 80 percent
of Egyptians for example I say that the
most important issue to them is the
crushing of the Palestinians so when
they hear bin laden say it they agreed
as night to it with a like him or hate
him
on the other hand there is a clique of
Terror radical Islamists who were
organized and trained and brought
together by Western intelligence for
their own purposes and I've continued to
do for 20 years just what they've always
said they were going to do so while some
things are obscure I don't think the
skewer the answers are quite transparent
