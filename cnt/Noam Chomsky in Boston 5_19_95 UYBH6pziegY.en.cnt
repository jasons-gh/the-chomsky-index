Chomsky's career his writings and honors
here are some highlights
he has three degrees in linguistics from
the University of Pennsylvania ba ma PhD
he lectures frequently and has been
honored in this country and abroad he
has taught at MIT since 1950
five he is a perceptive critic of the
media and of American farm and domestic
policy mr. Chomsky we are delighted to
have you here this evening
[Applause]
[Music]
is this the one for the current yeah can
you hear me through this one yeah trying
to figure out the mics are right
what can't hear up is it that I'm not
speaking into it or what yeah
are these gonna be okay they're all full
up alright yeah okay I trust the techies
over there well I'd like to say a few
things about where the country is going
or more accurately where it's being
driven by quite conscious and deliberate
social policy the policies that are
being followed Our Strength strenuously
opposed by a substantial majority of the
population that's demonstrated quite
conclusively and unambiguously by
regular polling however the policies are
by and large supported by a lead opinion
so what we read is that they're an
expression of the public will you
constantly read that the contract with
america is poll-driven
the result of careful soundings of
public opinion and so on and so forth
you have to get down to the footnotes to
discover that even now that even now on
less than 40% of the population has even
heard of it and when they're asked about
its specific terms virtually without
exception they are overwhelmingly
opposed but that's you know just the
facts
the preferred story is the kind of thing
that you get say in less Sunday's Boston
Globe from their business correspondent
David Warsh who assures us that quote
'i'm the a great preponderance of
americans want a balanced budget even
with far-reaching cuts and spending for
education and health well there's a way
to discover what a great preponderance
of Americans want and the way is to look
at the very regular and extensive
polling that's done to check the pulse
of the country mostly for business
interests and for PR interests but
there's a lot of data on it and people
have been asked what they think about a
balanced budget if it entails not
far-reaching but any cuts in education
and social spending when people are
asked whether they want a balanced
budget with accompanied by cuts in
spending 22% say yes when they're asked
do they want a balanced budget with cuts
for health spending 25% say yes and
similarly for other kinds of cuts but as
that's transmuted into a lead opinion it
becomes a great preponderance of the
public wants a balanced budget even with
far-reaching cuts in social spending
spending for education and health well
he gives evidence not polls but the
evidence that he gives is that that's
the proof is that that's what Congress
is pushing and since we live in a
democracy if Congress is pushing it it's
got to be with the great preponderance
of the public once the Congress that
he's talking about is one that is so
comically subordinated to business rule
that it doesn't even conduct the usual
pretenses of concealing the fact that
legislation is written by corporate
lobbyists in fact it's been bringing the
corporate lobbyists who write the
legislation right into the press
conferences to tell the press what's in
the bills that they write instead of
having them hide behind the curtains in
the usual fashion and this has been so
transparent it's become a joke in the
Washington press corps even the New York
Times has had stories about it well
that's reality again this morning the
Pulitzer Prize winning correspondent
Washington correspondent of The Boston
Globe David Sriman tells us of what he
calls Newt Gingrich's content
for the corporate lobbyists that is the
ones he spreads the red carpet for so
that they can appear and explain to the
press the legislation that they wrote
and tell the congressman what they're
signing the in general without
proceeding there's a world and there's a
picture of the world and they may not
necessarily have much to do with one
another if you want to see about the
real world there are places to look to a
good place to look to see where the
country is going is the issue of Fortune
magazine that came out this week it's a
kind of a special issue every year
Fortune magazine comes out with a
special issue on the fortune 500 you
know 500 richest corporations this year
it's both industrial and what they call
service corporations remember service
doesn't mean people who clean the floor
and so on it means insurance companies
and investment banks and so on and so
forth so the five top 500 insurer
industrial and service corporations all
right and this is an unusually fat issue
because they're celebrating their 40th
anniversary so you know a lot of hoopla
and so on and also because they're so
excited they point out that the profits
this last year this last year in 1994
were up they say a stunning 54 percent
over 93 and that's on virtually flat
sales growth 8% sales growth and
virtually no employment growth 2.6
percent employment growth the fortune
500 controls sixty-three percent of
gross domestic product US gross domestic
product and in in addition they control
an unspecified amount of the world
economy well that's a degree of
tyrannical control over the world that
is rare and probably without any
precedent in human history and remember
that the word tyrannical is exactly
accurate these are unaccountable
totality
our institutions run from top down about
which public have nothing to say so the
more control they can be given over the
decisions that affect ordinary life the
better things are because the less
danger there is that the the Great Beast
does have Alexander Hamilton once
described you folks that the Great Beast
can get involved and disrupt things that
are none of their business like public
affairs well that's where the country is
going if you look more closely you see
even in greater detail where it's going
one of the the biggest one of the
biggest gainers last year was manpower
incorporated 35% increase in sales
another one was Kelly twenty one percent
increase in sales remember that these
are the people who sell as they put a
temporary employees who are that
increasing temporary employees is part
of the strategy of devastating the
workforce in the United States by
undermining worker rights benefits the
gains that have been won in a very long
and hard struggle over well over a
hundred years
we just passed Mayday
which everywhere outside the United
States is is the commemoration is
celebrated as a labor day in in memory
of the inn's originally in support for
the struggles of American workers for an
eight-hour day this is the one country
where nobody even knows what it is it's
a day when you're supposed to wave flags
the president gave patriotic speech and
so on and so forth
Labor Day in the United States is at the
end of the summer that is when you go
back to work you know not when you worry
about the days in Chicago when workers
were getting killed because they were
struggling for an eight-hour day and the
rest of the world celebrates it like
Mexico and so
well that's Kelly in manpower during
this all of this is part of the part of
the general process by which the United
States is taking on or is being driven
more accurately towards a kind of a
third world character pretty consciously
in fact quite consciously a third world
typical third world country has a sector
of extremely wealthy people big mass of
people living in utter misery and a
large number of people who are basically
superfluous they're the ones you send
the death squads out for through social
cleansing or whatever and that is the
goal the goal is to try to make the
United States look like that in fact to
try to make the world look like that
makes a lot of sense if you happen to be
within the sector that's going to become
enriched by this process while profits
went up 54% last year wages continued
the decline they've been declining since
1980 the latest according to the latest
figures they've dropped over seven
percent since 1989 right through the
Clinton recovery that's unprecedented
for what they call unskilled workers
meaning people with a high school
education and the wages have dropped
somewhere between 20 and 25 percent
since 1980 those are the angry white
males people real a bit worried about
people whose lives are falling apart on
the any hope for providing for families
or having a decent wage and life is
basically disappearing the anger is
perfectly understandable if not the
reactions in fact the reactions are
understandable too in the absence of any
organization or understanding or
direction as to what a constructive way
to respond might be for college-educated
people
wages did stay up until 1987 by then the
Reagan Reaganite changes had succeeded
in hitting college-age educated people
too and wages start stop start to
decline for them in 1987 our canoeing
that's
that's the other side of the story so
profits booming wages dropping the the
facts are reported it's not that they're
a secret especially in the business
press they're regularly reported so in
1992 when the effect of the Reagan
policies actually Carter Reagan policies
was already evident The Wall Street
Journal had a story in which they hailed
what they called a welcome development
of transcendent importance the welcomed
development of transcendent importance
was that in 1985 before the effect of
these reforms had hit the United States
had the highest wages technically
highest labor costs per unit output of
any industrial country which is pretty
much what you'd expect this is by far
the richest country in the world it's
completely unparalleled advantages but
by 1992 it was the lowest in the
industrial world except for England
where Thatcher had done even a better
job of smashing up who are in working
people actually in 1990 the United
States actually went below England then
was world champion but then England fell
even further so the welcome development
of transcendent importance is we were
now the had the lowest labor costs in
the industrial world next to next to
Thatcher and the end of the Cold War was
held in the business press precisely
part largely because it provided weapons
to extend and accelerate this process
and that was pretty explicit so the
London Financial Times which is the main
International Business Journal had ran a
story on Poland called with the headline
green shoots and communism ruins
communist you know everything's a
horrible wreck and so on and so forth
communism destroyed everything but there
are some green shoots and good things
are happening the green shoots were that
thanks to the as they put it thanks to
the capitalist reforms the pauperization
and unemployment of the workforce has
reached such a high level that now
Western corporations can move there
and yet workers for 10% of what they
called the pampered Western workers and
Businessweek chimed in and warned the
pampered Western workers that they were
gonna have to abandon their luxurious
lifestyles before GM could only move
through say Mexico or Brazil or
Indonesia but now they can even move to
East Europe where incidentally they get
a demand and receive high power tariff
protection and subsidies and so on under
the usual free-market doctrines which
mean you know for the e but not for me
that's what it's meant for a couple
hundred years so it's reported or right
it's reported with great Glee and indeed
it sort of tells you what the Cold War
was about just take a look at who's
cheering and who's complaining and you
learned quite a lot about what was about
incidentally among those were cheering
the forum former rulers of the conve of
the communist countries Communist Party
hierarchy who are now now that it's
being driven back to the third world
they are the wealthy sector the
super-rich sector which beyond their
wildest dreams cooperating with Western
capital while the country sinks into
ruins so they're among the victors of
the Cold War the people in Eastern
Europe and the people in the West the
formerly pampered Western workers are
the losers well all of this is expected
to continue it's not over
fortune last issue before this one had
an article headline why profits will
keep booming 93 1993 was described as a
dazzling year for profits with virtually
stagnant stay out sales growth at 1994
as I said was as they put it here even
more splendid that's the fourth straight
year of double-digit profits quite a
profit growth not profits of
double-digit profit growth she's pretty
extremely unusual than they expect it to
continue for another couple of years at
least earnings per share have doubled
since 1991 the return on capital
more than doubled since 1980 and other
things are rising too they didn't talk
about it along with profits working
hours are going up the number of
temporary percentage of temporary
employees is going up jails are going
way up jail population more than tripled
in the 1980s and still increasing and
expected to increase further the level
of starvation is increasing nicely
mainly among children and elderly people
but also others people without medical
insurance is going up the disintegration
of families is improving more and more
of that a result of the 15-year war
which is what it is against families and
children and women that has been
conducted under the banner of Family
Values it takes
take some a really properly functioning
propaganda system to get away with that
one the there are also some things that
are going down wages are going down the
trickle of welfare for the poor which is
all it ever was we have very miserly
welfare system by world standards that's
been going down AFDC when everyone talks
about aid for families with dependent
children that's dropped around 50% in
real terms since 1970 mid 1970s and
several years after the decline in
funding for families poor families you
can see the disintegration setting in
there's a cause and effect relation
though just the opposite of the one
that's usually claimed and for obvious
reasons taxes for the rich are going
down way down labor costs are going down
as I mentioned they have now reached the
lowest level since 1981 that's the
welcome development of transcendent
importance so the right things are going
up and the right things are going down
from the point of view of the of the
masters the people who own and run
things so what should be done in the
face of this had a these catastrophic
consequences for the general population
catastrophic consequences of
contemporary state capitalism well
that's explained to so the New York
Times last week had a front-page story
on it with a headline reading New York
is simply not wealthy enough to afford
services to the general public they're
really in trouble the source for this
information is expert to whom they turn
and the expert is a JPMorgan executive
JP Morgan ranks fifth among American
banks in the fortune 500 it's part of
the sector of the country that has money
coming out of its years the country is
absolutely awash in capital all the talk
about lean and mean times and so on is
complete nonsense corporate corporations
don't know what to do with the capital
that's flooding through them so JP
Morgan executive explains that New York
is just not wealthy enough to offer
services to poor people and there's a
solution that times goes on to explain
the solution is to cut taxes but that
means cut taxes for the rich again you
sort of look down on a continuation page
in the inside section and you notice
that all the taxes without exception or
for the benefit of business and while
you're cutting taxes for the rich what
you do is increase taxes for everyone
else except and here comes some free
advice for those of you who are hoping
to make it into a leat circles you don't
call them taxes you have a different
name for them what you call them is to
quote the New York Times multi-million
dollar reductions in subsidies for the
cities mass transit system and in aid to
education and higher education those
these are subsidies like if taxpayers in
New York use their funds to pay to have
transportation that's a subsidy by
definition sort of illegitimate so you
cut down those subsidies to transport
eight mass transportation like subways
and education and higher education which
is precisely equivalent taxes somebody's
going to
except highly regressive taxes cut down
you know funding for taxpayer money that
goes to pub to the subways and the
subway fares go up cut down funding for
City College and community colleges and
the costs go up and somebody pays those
costs to the city
meaning attacks namely poor people it's
tax but a highly regressive tax not a
tax on the guys who drive their
limousines through the streets you know
to LaGuardia Airport where plenty of
subsidies keep going because you have to
make sure that the jet planes keep
flying overseas and so on plenty of
subsidies for that one but subsidies for
the subways money for the subways that
goes down and for higher education goes
down so we have taxes but we call we
don't call them taxes so therefore and
that's pretty general if you think
through the whole look at the whole
array of fiscal measures and you see the
taxes are going down for the rich and
going up for the poor so it was already
a pretty regressive system it's got to
become even more regressive the the
mayor finally of New York finally came
clean and said what everybody could see
was happening he said the idea is Mayor
Giuliani he said the idea is to drive
the core people out of the city that
they don't belong there
you know it's not it's not their place
New York City is for the meritocracy for
people like the JP Morgan executive who
says they don't have enough money for
services for the poor only services for
the rich of course there are people who
have to do the dirty work but they can
live in favelas they'd be called if they
were in Brazil you know miserable
suburbs around the edge where they can
sort of find their way into work somehow
to clean the streets you know do laundry
and whatever has to be done but
meanwhile New York will be for the
meritocracy the guys with the good
salaries
so therefore the policies are as
Giuliani and The Times explained to
deprive people of rent of heating of
money for heating their houses for food
transport home care for the disabled and
elderly and so on just cut all that
stuff and then they can just go
if they can find somewhere else to go
the the headline for all of this is
reads as follows welfare cuts provide a
chance to move okay so in other words
the poor are no longer trapped by
welfare dependency
thanks to their Liberator who they now
have a chance to move the compassion
really brings tears to the eyes there's
a technical name for this it's called
tough love which which is sort of
appropriate it means love for the rich
and tough for everybody else another
term for that is the free market you
know which means plenty of protection
for us but you guys accept market
discipline and all of this passes
without any pretty well I wouldn't say
with no common it passes with some
comments so here's an example of the
comment notice that's New York they get
tough love for people in New York
what about to go to the other extreme
say Cobb County Georgia interesting
place represented by Newt Gingrich so
there's no tough love for Cobb County
Georgia not at all well maybe there
shouldn't be if you read again Pulitzer
Prize winning correspondent of the
Boston Globe
David Friedman he explains that Gingrich
is really a pretty nice guys not like
these bad guys who think we were to get
rid of government and so on Gingrich he
says is the nation's leading champion of
Independence and of the solitary the
solitary entrepreneur okay that's new
English she didn't notice and Sriman
points out that Gingrich would be quite
happy to he's not one of these guys who
just wants to destroy the government you
know he's not a crazy doesn't love
federal buildings and if I can't be very
happy to have a government he'd even
take government funds Friedman explains
and he would use them for laptops for
the poor he wouldn't use them for rich
people because he's a real populist type
but he would use them for laptops for
the poor well as I said Newt Gingrich is
the representative Cobb County Georgia
so we
and check how many laptops there are for
the poor there are actually a percentage
of poor people there who have laptops is
probably quite high because poor people
can't get into Cobb County it's what he
calls a Norman Rockwell's world of jet
planes and fiber optics which is pretty
correct annoy who has asked where jet
planes and fiber optics come from and
the answer to that is well they come out
of taxpayer funding that's why Cobb
County is very wealthy one of the
reasons not the only reason another
reason it's a suburb of Atlanta which is
pretty wealthy city that's a very
wealthy city because of enormous federal
funding which is poured into Atlanta to
make it a big you know transport hub
with you know Center for Delta airline
one of the biggest air traffic centers
in the world in fact huge federally
funded meaning taxpayer funded highways
leading to Cobb County but barriers to
make sure that the wrong people don't
get in very racist County everyone
concedes that and in fact Cobb County
gets more federal subsidies than any
suburban county in the country with the
except with two exceptions two
interesting exceptions one is Arlington
Virginia which is part of Washington DC
that part of the federal government
itself and the other is like that's
where the Pentagon is and that sort of
thing the other is Brevard County
Florida where which was set up during
the Kennedy administration as another
cash cow for the rich that's the home of
the Space Center which is another one of
those techniques by which the taxpayer
funds rich people that's one of the
funnels for taxpayer funding of high
technology industry so with the
exception of and that's basically part
of the federal system you move out of
the federal system itself and you
discover that Newt Gingrich the leading
champion of Independence and the
solitary entrepreneur happens to have
managed to receive more federal
subsidies than anybody else extorting
money from the taxpayer as he puts it
his words when somebody else is trying
to get their hands on it
well the biggest
solitary entrepreneur in Cobb County is
Lockheed Martin very high up on the
that's the highest employer way high up
in Fortune 500 that's a recent merger of
two major taxpayer-funded corporations
some of the private in the sense that
the profit is private but they're public
in the sense that the payment is public
and the it's known as conservatism sort
of thing
they were merged recently Lockheed and
Martin Marietta were merged into an even
bigger corporation and in order to help
expedite the merger the Clinton
administration gave him an extra billion
dollars of taxpayer funding and then to
kind of sweeten the pain for the you
know executives who were involved in the
merger they gave them 30 million dollars
in an extra subsidy including eight
million dollars for the new CEO kind of
tough to undergo this merger so you need
a little bit of love taxpayer love on
the side the there they are now the
intended recipients of 72 billion
dollars the new merged Corporation in
funds taxpayer funds to construct the
new f-22 stealth jet fighter bomber by
Lockheed and we needed that's explained
that we're needed we need it because
Lockheed tells us that as they put it
it's a dangerous world in which
sophisticated fighter planes are being
sold elsewhere and therefore we need the
f-22 to defend ourselves well who is
sending those who is selling those
sophisticated fighter planes elsewhere
well Lockheed here's the way I'm
continued this is just reading lockheed
propaganda you know like lockheed
brochure ism
making this up Lockheed explains
dangerous world sophisticated fighters
out there we've sold they continue we
have sold f-16s all over the world and
what if a friend or an ally turns
against us okay the United States in
fact now sells approximately
three-quarters of the arms to the third
world
maybe that's taxpayer driven again you
know because of the populist character
of Congress in this case ninety percent
of the population ninety six percent of
the population is opposed to it so it
does have a bit of support in there if
you look carefully the so we over the
objection of ninety six percent of the
population
we're supplying three-quarters of the
world third-world on market and you
never know these guys might turn against
you sometime the official US defense
Milt what they call defense posture is
that we have to maintain the Pentagon
that basically cold war levels because
of the growing technological
sophistication of third world powers and
to fend off that threat which we are
busily creating as much as we can we
have to not only get that builds put 72
billion dollars into the pockets of Newt
Gingrich's constituents and the others
work for them but we also have to here
and other taxpayers also have to upgrade
the f-16s to make them more dangerous so
other Pentagon funding is going into
upgrading the f-16s which are being
what's called sold the third world
country sold means basically given with
export-import bank loans that the
taxpayer again pays for and in order to
defend ourselves from this great threat
that's growing this technological
sophistication we've got a 22 well
that's the nation's leading champion of
independence and the solitary
entrepreneur the Air Force director of
Science and Technology general Richard
Paul explained that all of this is going
to enhance
their Economic Security by spinning off
dual use technology that means that the
taxpayer is paying Lockheed Marietta but
the point is for the money to go into
what's called civilian production then
you know others can sell computers and
electronics and avionics and you know
Boeing can get its next plane into the
skies is just advertising thanks to
taxpayer funding and huge profits for
the private entrepreneurs and the deeply
conservative spirits who are want to
make sure that nobody is exporting any
money from the taxpayer well that's the
way it works welfare for corporate
America way beyond what anybody calls
corporate welfare this is the real stuff
and it's corporate America as General
Paul says is going to transition our
work meaning they'll take care of
carrying out this policy of using
taxpayer funds to build the f-22 with
dual use technology meaning the rest of
the fortune 500 can milk the taxpayer
too to keep those profits high that's
the main reason why the Pentagon is
staying at cold war levels it's now in
real terms actually above the spending
of the Nixon years and roughly 85
percent of the Cold War average which
incidentally gives you a pretty good
measure of how seriously they took the
Russian threat if you think it through
but there is a point I mean there is of
course the need to keep the world under
control but the main point is to ensure
that the rich keep wealthy thanks to
taxpayer funding that's why the Heritage
Foundation you know real conservative
Foundation which is planning the big
budget cuts wants pentagon funding to go
up and that's why in the Pentagon budget
that was just in the balanced budget
proposal that just was ran through the
house if you have a look you'll find the
Pentagon
funding does not that's one thing that
doesn't get cut because you can cut
money for starving children but not for
newt gingrich's constituents please they
have to feel good and conservative and
independent and you know their
entrepreneurial values have to be
maintained by making sure that plenty of
taxpayer funds go into their pockets
well that's the free market the money
that goes to Cobb County and other super
rich folk those that's not subsidies
that's not like money that's going to
mass transit in New York in fact that's
security and the that framework you know
not subsidy but security that was
established very explicitly perfectly
publicly you don't have to go to secret
documents to find it out in the late
1940s the first secretary of the Air
Force Stuart Symington good liberal
incidentally when he became a senator he
usually called the senator from Boeing
Stuart Symington and his explained that
his job as Air Force Secretary was to
make sure that Boeing the biggest of the
publicly subsidized private profit
corporations that Boeing gets the proper
share of military procurement with dual
use technology so it can then become the
country's leading exporter which it is
and therefore when Bill Clinton went to
Seattle Washington for the APEC
conference asia-pacific economic
conference back in 1992 he gave a speech
in which he presented what the press
called his grand vision of the free
market future and he gave it a hangar of
the Boeing Corporation pointing to
Boeing as his model for the grand vision
of the free market future and that's
quite accurate the free market future is
the public pays and the rich profit it
was so transparent it takes a really
good education to miss it and you have
to people say that the edgy people say
the educational systems in trouble in
the United
but you know there's overwhelming
evidence that that's false the Harvard
education is as good as it ever was
and the New York Times and everybody
else didn't bat an eyelash when Clinton
presented his vision of the free market
future in the hanger of the Boeing
Corporation to a cheering crowd noting
that they're the biggest export civilian
exporter thanks to dual use technology
just as nobody laughs no be respectable
at least laughs when Newt Gingrich is
described as the leading champion of
Independence and the solitary
entrepreneur just dying to get his hands
on a little federal funds to give laptop
computers to the poor so real populist
well that's Symington when he was
Secretary of State the Secretary of Air
Force first secretary the air force's
1948 he pointed out that as he put it
the word to use is not subsidy the word
to use is security that's the way we'll
get the public to pay the subsidies for
industry and it was well understood at
the time again no secret all over the
business press that the that the
industrial system the private profit
privately run industrial system cannot
survive as they put it in an
unsubsidized competitive free enterprise
economy and therefore the government
must be the savior this business week
put it and if government spending
continues it'll be the meaning through
the military because they immediately
turn to that for a free clear and well
explained reasons that'll be the formula
for endless good times that's the free
enterprise system that you're supposed
to extol and that system has to normally
remain intact but even grow while the
little trickle of you know sort of food
for schoolchildren that is cut off
because like New York the rest of the
country just can't isn't wealthy enough
to afford services to the poor only
services to the rich for which we're
is more than wealthy enough as the
fortune 500 latest issue describes very
accurately well that's tough love that's
free markets that's what they've been
all through their history there's going
to go through it but if you go through
the history of free market ideology and
of development way back to the British
then us then the rest of the countries
always been the same thing double aged
always plenty of protection for me if
I'm rich and powerful plenty of state
subsidy but market disciplined for you
you go back to the 18th century and what
is now the first world and what is now
the third world were not very different
in fact in India for example the steel
technology in India was more advanced
than in England the British were still
sending engineers to India into the
1820s to learn techniques of making
steel they had cotton textiles Egypt who
start a Industrial Revolution the
there's a lot of you know there's no
simple reason for the tremendous
difference between the first and the
third world today but one leading
difference
surely simply is that as a result of
violence colonization and power Britain
later the United States later the other
European countries and later Japan were
able to depart from to abandon the in
fact never even to try so you can't say
abandoned did not play games with
free-market ideology but to resort the
ample protection and subsidy while the
third world was compelled rammed down it
throat to follow it what is now called
structural adjustment neoliberalism
free-market ideology major reason for
the radical difference and exactly the
same thing is now happening at home
subsidies and protection for the rich
free market discipline for you know
children with for poor children
tough-love in other words just bringing
it home well the if you look at what's
going on say in Washington it
illustrates this historical pattern
which is now hundreds of years old it
Hill it illustrates it in fine detail
you know to just perfection when you
look closely so takes a the
congressional debate a couple months ago
over school budget other school lunches
you recall that they were talking about
cutting six or seven billion dollars a
year from school lunches for school
children in the midst of that debate one
representative david obie i think of
michigan introduced a an amendment he
proposed that they keep the six or seven
billion dollars for school lunches and
pay for it by delaying for five years
the deployment of F twenty-twos not
cutting back the subsidy but just
delaying a little bit stretching it out
well Newt Gingrich the champion of
Independence and solitary
entrepreneurship he took care of that
proposal by not even letting it come to
a vote it was so ridiculous because the
solitary entrepreneurs standing in their
glorious conservatism they need that
seventy two billion dollars tomorrow not
spread out over five years and if
children have to go to school hungry
well or maybe not to go to school just
too bad that illustrates dramatically
exactly what's going on everywhere and
indeed so does everything else takes a
deregulation deregulation is a huge gift
to the fortune 500 and corporate America
generally
it means they're free to do anything
they like but remember this is Eric's
this is free market in the traditional
sense meaning free market with a
security blanket the deregulation but a
guarantee that if anything goes wrong
the public bails you out that's part of
the contract which isn't right up front
but happens all the time in fact we saw
a dramatic example of it right here in
New England right at the peak of a
discussion of the regula of the debate
over deregulation notice the way that
deregulation is being done it's not
specific regulations that are being
drugged this is an across-the-board
phenomenon the idea is to make
regulation impossible the technique for
making it impossible is to impose
cost-benefit analysis meaning if
somebody proposes a regulation they've
got a demonstrate
that the economic costs don't outweigh
the gains well any economists there
scientists can tell you right off that
that's a complete impossibility a
corporate lawyer who has even half of
his brain functioning can drag out those
discussions for 20 years you know
there's no way to get those calculations
they don't even mean anything so that
essentially dismantles the whole
apparatus right in the middle of all of
this while it was being rammed through
Congress the maritime and Fisheries
administration closed down most of
Georgia's Bank the big fishing grounds
off Cape Cod that's one of the riches
maybe the richest fishing areas in the
world now mostly closed the closing was
extended again and is now for the
indefinite future why did they have to
close down the richest fishing area in
the world well during the Reagan years
free-market policies were followed in
the usual fashion meaning they
deregulated fishing and subsidized the
fishing industry
well combination of deregulation and
subsidy has pretty predictable effects
they just fished out all the ground fish
so now it's destroyed will it recover
well nobody knows Cape Cod is now
importing Cod from Norway where they
have what's called a different
philosophy as they put it when this was
described namely they regulated their
fishing grounds so they sell up some
fish well remember this is our sense of
free market and we have a conservative
governor here governor will so a
governor weld quickly went hat in hand
to Washington to ask the public to bail
us out to bail out the fishing industry
from the combination of subsidy and
deregulation he went and asked for
George's bank to be declared a national
disaster which means the public has to
pay for it why is it a national disaster
well a natural disaster sorry it's a
natural disaster had nothing to it
deregulation and overfishing rather he
got
some guys I suppose called scientists
almost everybody laughed about it to go
and claim that there's some strange form
of predatory fish previously unknown and
for the moment invisible and the
predatory fish had wiped out the ground
fish you know the ground fish and the
cod and so on and Georges Bank so it's
like a natural disaster what can we do
and therefore the public has to come in
and pay for it that's standard
free-market
techniques essent the saving and loans
institution were perfectly simple
example early in the Reagan years and
here it's both the Democrats and
Republicans this isn't on party lines
the SNL's were deregulated but granted
more insurance so you know the idea is
make the worst loans most risky loans
you like we're gonna insure you anyway
and then what it all collapsed as it did
pretty soon public is called upon to pay
it off free market we just saw the same
thing in Mexico with the Goldman Sachs
bailout that Mexico was going to
collapse was completely obvious to
anybody outside the World Bank I suppose
it was thing was built on sand it was
completely transparent everybody knew it
my question was when and when it
collapsed yeah yet you know forty fifty
billion dollars of taxpayer funds to pay
off the investors and make sure that
they don't suffer too much and that
their spirits stay up and you know tough
love as usual during the Reagan years
the biggest nationalization in American
history was carried out the
nationalization of continental Illinois
bank when it as a result of deregulation
got into trouble so the public moves in
and bails it out in fact during the
Reagan years you really saw you know
tough love and free-market ideology
almost to perfection it's pretty typical
over the years that free-market rhetoric
escalates while protection goes up along
with it for the rich and that happened
during the Reagan years you know
ODEs to the free market and
neoliberalism and you know
entrepreneurial values and so on
meanwhile when they were talking to the
business community they talked a
different line that was to the public
but when Secretary of Treasury James
Baker spoke to the business community
he took credit for the fact that this he
put at the Reagan administration had
increased had given the business
community here more protection than any
post war present which is true but
overly modest it was actually more than
all post war presidents combined they
had essentially doubled protection by
either tariffs or non-tariff barriers up
to up to about 23% doubling it from
about 12% which where it was when they
came in so along with creating huge debt
and you know they also doubled virtually
doubled protection which had its effects
if they hadn't done it if the United
States had been had played the kind of
free-market games we impose on others or
the kind that are now imposed on who are
in the general population we wouldn't
have a steel industry we wouldn't have a
computer industry we wouldn't have an
automobile industry no chips no nothing
as throughout our history we relied on
the powerful weapon of protection and
state subsidy to maintain a private
power of private profit economy and
there's no other way to do it and so it
goes down the line
well another process underway in
Washington is to dismantle the legal
system there are many aspects of this
and they're really worth looking at one
of them in fact is being a petition I
think is going on around about it one
crucial part of the dismantling of the
legal system is the elimination of
competent of the right of compensation
for corporate crime now that's kind of
important when a corporation likes to
take a classic case Johns Manville
conceals for decades the fact that it's
knowing it knowingly conceals for
decades the fact that it's poisoning
people by production of asbestos there
had been recourse plenty of people died
you know nobody knows how many were sick
and so on but ultimately after several
decades it was possible to go through
the courts and ask for compensation and
that's got to be cut out these solitary
entrepreneurs who are being amply fed by
the public they have to have the right
of Defense from any kind of crime that
they conduct so the next Johns Manville
you got to make sure that nobody Sue's
them so there were no constraints on
corporate crime and that is to be made
free you know free society after all
there's a reason why Philip Morris is
the leading industrial funder for the
new Gingrich army they are the leading
corporate killer and therefore they need
to make sure that they are protected
from any crime the tobacco is I'm sure
you know one of the most lethal drugs
around
it's killing plenty of people here but
that's not enough people here there's
some reduction in smoking so no Philip
Morris but the other major corporations
have turned to the nanny state as usual
to use its power to force open other
markets so right at the same time that
George Bush announced the famous drug
war and you know warned about how we
have to you know protect ourselves from
Colombian and at that time Panamanian
narco traffickers preparation for
invading Panama same time you know
within days the US Trade Representative
announced that the u.s. was hearings
which led to the threat of sanctions
against Thailand for trying to protect
itself against us lethal drugs namely
tobacco the markets in Japan and Korea
had already been forced open by the
threat of sanctions and now Thailand had
to be open so we could kill plenty of
people there and the purpose was made
very explicit it was to improve the
trade balance about all we can sell
these people's lethal narcotics so
therefore we got to make sure that they
have no barriers to import of lethal
marcotte X or of advertising for them I
mean it's as if the Medellin Cartel was
powerful enough to force us to
advertising aim the children and women
which is what the advertising is to use
more and more cocaine and if they if we
didn't do it they'd threaten us with
trade sanctions well of course that's a
joke because we're the big guy but other
than that the logic is identical so
under the threat of trade sanctions
Asian countries have to accept lethal
drugs from the United States highly
lethal drugs way worse in terms of their
consequences than hard drugs and they
have to accept not only the drugs but
even advertising for them aggressive
advertising aimed primarily at the new
markets the opening new markets women
and youth and it's and indeed as soon as
they they agreed you know you do what
the boss tells you when they did open
the markets there had been a decline in
death in smoking meaning in deaths from
smoking and that shifted instantly in
each country as soon as the markets were
open and the advertising was open to the
American multinationals smoking which
had been going down and started going up
and within a couple of years when the
statistics come in you'll see the deaths
going up as well one estimate by an
Oxford University epidemiologist is that
in China people kids under 20 now about
50 million will die of tobacco-related
diseases that's pretty impressive toll
even by 20th century standards and you
need state power to ram through
consequences like that because you have
to make sure that nobody defends
themselves from aggressive advertising
aimed at improving our trade balance not
for American workers but for
corporations making profit so they can
stay away high up in fortune 500 well
take the matter of democracy that's also
under severe attack and it's by now kind
of irrelevant as I mentioned the
population strongly opposes just about
every element of the contract and the
rest of the policy is going through but
it doesn't make any difference
civil societies and pretty much eroded
people are isolated there
they may be desperate and angry and so
on but they don't have anything to do
about it
there is a traditional method for poor
people to get together and try to
protect their rights and increase
democratic rights and so on that's
unions and there's others but that's a
major one the major one in fact in
modern industrial society that's why
unions are under tremendous attack
there's a major strike going on right
now in Decatur Illinois it's the most
important labor conflict in the United
States since the 1930s three the three
major corporations one owned by British
transnational one regional Firestone
another one Caterpillar are trying to
destroy the last major industrial unions
in a good old you know an old
working-class town and they've already
succeeded with one last week the United
rubber workers capitulated because they
could not deal with what's called
permanent replacement workers scabs in
English which who are brought in to
destroy the strike well that's illegal
at least by it's in violation of
international labor standards the United
States has already been condemned by the
International Labor Organization for
resort for allowing the resort to scabs
to break strikes at this at the time
that the ILO made this ruling in 1992
there were two countries in industrial
countries that were in violation of
these standards United States and South
Africa South Africa has defected from
the cause and now the United States is
in splendid isolation in violation of
international labor standards on this
issue
it also has the worst record in Europe
or the Western Hemisphere in observing
international standards with two
exceptions lithuanian el salvador a
little bit worse but apart from that
we're worse but that's not going to be a
problem for you soon in case you're
worried Jesse Helms announced that the
new foreign relations act will under it
the United States will withdraw from the
ILO so it won't matter that we're in
violation of international labor
standards on the
and other issues the United rubber
workers capitulated the remaining
workers are going on a hunger strike in
a couple of days or maybe have already
started hope with church support and
public support trying to get some kind
of international national attention and
domestic attention it's not going to be
easy they don't have any resources the
press won't cover it if you're not right
in the cater Illinois or you happen to
be on one of the Nets that knows about
it you won't know end result is people
are angry desperate hopeless alone don't
see any constructive way to respond to
what's going on about them you end up
with with a pretty ominous prospect well
to see how far all of this has gone take
a look at the Wall Street Journal which
either yesterday or the day before had a
story with the following headline it
said Republicans take aim at
left-leaning groups that get federal
grants for assistance program and then
it programs that explains how they're
going to try to defund the left-wing
groups that are getting federal funding
the top left-wing go to the list the top
one that that is Catholic Charities
that's the top left-wing group has to be
defunded and the reason is that nuns and
priests this explain are running
programs for low-income heating and Head
Start so therefore they have to be
defunded because they're dangerous
lefties the second left-wing group that
has to be defunded is the American
Association of Retired people the AARP
and the reason is that they're running
programs to help elderly Americans get
jobs an earlier Wall Street Journal
story pointed out that 16 percent of the
elderly are starving but you want to
make sure that the left-wing left that
these you know and dangerous radicals
the AARP aren't getting any funding to
help them get jobs and it goes on like
without comment you know and nobody's
gonna write a letter yeah I mean we the
spectrum is such that Catholic Charities
and the AARP are now way off on the left
and we got to stop that business
actually it's rather flattering to the
left I should say it means anybody who
has any concern for human beings is
defined as the left
on the other side we have the
entrepreneur's of entrepreneurial values
and so on well it's obviously important
to protect people in the United States
from left-wing propaganda so therefore
you can understand why the press as far
as I know uniformly has suppressed the
results of the latin-american Bishops
Council remember that's the top of a
left-wing organizations they meet
regularly in Latin America they just had
their last meeting on May 1st the
latin-american Bishops Council met and
they quoting from the National Catholic
Reporter issued scathing condemn nations
of neoliberal capitalism and the United
States and the drug trade which they say
is sponsored by neoliberal capitalism in
the United States here's what the new
elected president of the of the Latin
American bishops says the Bishop of gusu
Papa the Archbishop of Tegucigalpa
Honduras he says neoliberal capitalism
carries injustice and inequality in its
genetic code in the concluding statement
the Latin American bishops the 70
bishops from around Latin America said
they made a judgment against neoliberal
capitalism you know what we call free
market meaning double-edge free market
which they said has caused the
impoverishment and misery of millions of
Latin Americans they proposed an economy
at the surface at the service of
humankind rather than at the service of
groups of powerful people and they
called for a regional solidarity to
overcome the economic social corruption
narco trafficking and migration problems
which neoliberalism has caused the
Archbishop of Venezuela said that the
the Bugaboo for many years was communism
but which is worse communism or these
neoliberal bandits without conscience
who have the dollar as their God that's
us
and they go on and on with that well you
know kind of important that it's not the
right sort of thing for American years
so you can understand why all of this
stuff is suppressed just as Catholic
Charities has to be defunded as a
left-wing group and indeed all the Latin
American bishops congress's are always
suppressed I have never seen any
reference to any one of them anywhere
near the time when it took place well
these things are not laws of nature the
things that are going on
these are human decisions you know made
in human institutions they're not graven
in stone corporate tyranny for example
is pretty recent in its modern form it
goes back to the early part of this
century actually if you look at it it
grows from the same intellectual soil as
the other two major forms of modern
totalitarianism namely Bolshevism and
fascism they come from the same pretty
much the same roots to have gone one is
greater and strength and power than ever
but it's no more you know
immutable than the other companion forms
of tyranny and totalitarianism work it's
never been easy to try to defend or
extend the range of freedom and justice
now it's mostly a matter of defending it
it's never been impossible either it's
not certainly not easy now but it's also
not impossible and I think there's
rarely been a moment in history when the
choice as to whether to do so has
carried such enormous human consequences
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
mic up therefore anybody wants to talk
it's down the middle of aisle for
anybody you responded to a question
about the 25 most sentence story
indicating that we're not exactly
pleased with the process of how they
choose their stories you indicate at
that time that stories that you have
submitted were not accepted can you give
us an idea of two or three of the
stories you've submitted in the last
couple years for the 25 most censored
stories well you know I the Rogers there
is this project that he was talking
about called most censored stories which
comes out of one of the California state
universities pardon Sonoma State yeah
Carl Jensen professor communications
there has been running it it's been a
useful project I'm sort of glad it
exists I've been on the panel but I've
objected to almost everything they've
done that's what I was saying I'm always
in a minority of almost one on the panel
and the but I stay on I don't know for
how long because it's sort of good to
have it around I just have very
different judgment than most of the
other people and I have submitted plenty
of stories I'd have to you know check
back my correspondents to see exactly
what they were but they were things like
for example the bishops council I mean
that's a typical story that I would
suggest you know that I think ought to
be covered or for example the Georges
Bank story that's one that I would
suggest over the years I've suggested
plenty of stories on their national
affairs so for example if I were I don't
even try to submit him anymore cuz I
know it's not gonna work but I would
have submitted for last year what I
think is one of the biggest stories of
the year to my amazement almost totally
suppressed I wrote about it at once but
I write for a journal that's going where
it's going to come out six weeks later
so I wrote as if everybody knew about it
already this was the story that didn't
come out the day before the day of the
sending of US troops to Haiti
the baby that was Monday if you recall
that US troops went into Haiti to defend
democracy on Sunday the day before I
happen to be monitoring the AP wires
because sort of interested you know sob
that something's going on going on and
if you ever look at AP wires you know
the kind of stuff pours out but they
pick stories that are the big stories
you know they focus your attention on
the big ones and the big story that they
were running that day was that they had
a leak from the Justice Department
pointing out that who apparently sick of
what was going on from somebody in the
Justice Department giving them evidence
on the fact that the Bush and Clinton
administration's had authorized the
shipment of oil to the military Hunta
and its supporters right through the
whole period in the embargo well in a
way it wasn't a big surprise if you'd
been watching Haiti you knew the oil was
getting through because it's you know
the biggest the richest family there the
meb's family which was supporting the
who was building a big tank farm and
they weren't doing it for milk you know
so oil was somehow getting through but
it turns out it was authorized by the
bush and never and the Clinton
administration's that is they informed
Texaco that it was illegal but they also
told them they weren't going to
prosecute it and then when Texaco went
to the Justice Department and proposed a
scam by which they could you know fake
corporation that they could set up as a
cover to send the oil the Justice
Department gave them a ruling saying
that's illegal but don't worry about
where I'm gonna do anything and this
went right on through the Clinton
administration in other words there
never was an embargo it was like tough
love again there was an embargo for poor
people but no embargo for rich people so
therefore we had to move in to defend
democracy and you know restore president
re steed but with his with a with a you
know a kind of a noose around his neck
making him follow a World Bank written
economic proposal which states here's
another thing I would have added that
the that the international funding
that's coming into Haiti has to be used
for I'm quoting it now
Haitian civil society the primarily the
business community and foreign investors
so US investors are part of civil
society but not those peasants in the
hills in Haiti well you know when this
appeared I was certain
maybe I figured maybe they'll miss it on
Monday but on Tuesday it's got to be the
biggest story of the week
you know Haitian American troops coming
it was the biggest story so nothing
happened so I wrote an article that's
gonna come out and Z magazine like I'm
six weeks later so I wrote it in past
tense you know saying well yeah as you
all know but well Monday nothing came
out Tuesday something did come out we
have a free press I did it finally did a
data search you know a nexus search on
this had a friend in the library do it I
don't I'm a Luddite I don't know how to
do it but somebody did it for me
and it turns out on Tuesday there was a
story in Platts oil Graham which is a
professional journal of the oil industry
on Wednesday there were about ten lines
hidden in The Wall Street Journal and a
couple of stories small stories and
newspapers around the country you know
like Akron Ohio and stuff places where
editors aren't clever enough to know
what's supposed to be totally suppressed
it still hasn't made the New York Times
or The Washington Post or as far as I
recall the Boston Globe or most of the
major newspapers
well you know that's the kind of story
that I would have given them and same
things on the so called peace process in
the Middle East and you know the
undermining of the Central American
Accords and just story after story which
nobody else in the panel thinks they're
interesting apparently because they
never get in there but those are typical
examples
[Music]
you expressed by dr. ravi batra southern
methodist university concerning the
impact of free trade is having on our
working conditions in this country and
the fact that NAFTA and gap is something
that's being rammed down our throats and
to to pop variety of spaces Lee and I'm
just wondering this seemed to there's so
little focus on the left about the issue
of doing something about NAFTA and why
[Music]
well I don't know anything about that
[Music]
well you know when you say there was no
focus on that that's a little surprising
because that was the major issue for for
the popular organizations and groupings
at the time of NAFTA effect it was such
a big to my amazement a combination of
unions and popular groups and grassroots
organizations and so on actually
succeeded in putting the issue on the
agenda the intention in NAFTA remember
was to ram it through without anybody
knowing about it that's another one of
those stories that was suppressed the
NAFTA which is obviously a major story
the NAFTA agreement was signed by the
three executives Canada United States
and this was Bush and Mexico on I think
was August 12th 1992 that's right in the
middle of a presidential campaign
you know everybody talking about policy
they signed the NAFTA agreement not a
peep you know nobody knew about it
there's a law in the United States 1974
trade law which requires that the Labor
Advisory Council that's a union based
organization be involved in consultation
and advice and you know decisions about
any trade related legislation well they
weren't informed
actually they were informed 24 hours
before a deadline to give an opinion
they were cold on I think it was
September 15th like a month later you
have 24 hour here's the 22 hundred page
text they'd even give them the text they
just said here we have a twenty two
hundred page text
tomorrow is your deadline for giving
your opinion about it so they couldn't
even meet actually they did publish
quite a good analysis which was also
none of this was ever recorded nor was
the they're quite good analysis ever
reported and in fact the idea was that
the whole thing would just ran be rammed
through without anybody knowing knowing
about it
well that didn't quite happen and it
didn't happen precisely because there
was a lot of popular agitation which
made it a big issue and it meant it
continued to the right through the whole
business with not with the public's
pretty strongly opposed and after I mean
over the part of the public that had an
opinion you know wasn't a lot of people
didn't know about but of the people who
had an opinion it was roughly sixty
percent were opposed right through till
the end and that was because of the
public agitation and you know the labor
movement and others and on GATT you know
there's been a huge mobilization fifty
years is enough you know block yeah
block change the World Bank and so on of
course it doesn't get any publicity but
it's substantial incidentally as to the
consequences of NAFTA you can get them
straight at in the mainstream press very
straight the day after the NAFTA and
they're very revealing the day after
NAFTA was passed finally big you know
the the press was a hundred percent in
favor of it in fact fanatic about it you
know they were hysterical this goes all
the way over to the left
you know what's called the left anthony
lewis some people absolutely hysterical
you know bitterly attacking labor for
what louis called its crude threatening
tactics and it's you know unenlightened
attitude because it was opposing this
obviously great thing the no way no
everybody an exception to this all the
way across maybe
you can find one if you look but it was
close to a hundred percent hysterical
advocacy not just advocacy the day after
NAFTA was passed the New York Times ran
its first story on the expected impact
in the New York Region the day after it
was passed
well the story was euphoric it's going
to be really terrific and then they
described what would happen they said
that it'll be really great for corporate
law firms and investment banks and the
pub the publication's industry like the
New York Times and capital intensive
industry like chemical corporations and
you know all the nice people they'll do
fine then it said there'll also be some
losers and the losers are women blacks
Hispanics and semi-skilled workers
meaning 70% of the workforce okay so
women blacks Hispanics some 70% of the
workforce they'll be losers but you know
there's always got to be winners and
losers so therefore it's terrific it
wasn't a secret also this was known in
advance like if you read The Economist
so we're advocating NAFTA like say Paul
Krugman who was in at MIT who were
saying is a great thing there was always
a line there somewhere saying well yeah
semi skilled workers or lose income like
70 percent of the workforce but it was
never really a secret you know I mean of
course in a sense it was a secret
because you really had to be searching
to find it and had to wait until the day
after it was passed to get the New York
Times analysis of what it was going to
do to the region but they understood and
the same is true of Mexico exactly the
same effect on Mexico you there's a lot
of talk about is it good for the United
States or is it bad for the United
States and that's just totally
meaningless you know you have to ask who
in the United States and who in Mexico I
mean it's great for rich people in
Mexico it's great for rich people in the
United States and it's bad for everybody
else but that's the purpose of social
policy after all and pretty much the
same is true yeah and certainly these
things are not free trade agreements
these are investor rights agreements
which are
located combination of protection &
Liber liberalisation one of the things
that the times for example approved of
most was the protectionist elements in
NAFTA which they call intellectual
property rights which radically extend
protectionism in completely new and
unprecedented directions to ensure that
the technology the future will be
monopolized by major corporations and
that say India can't produce cheap drugs
or its population and so on those are
the things they really were enthusiastic
about these are not free trade
agreements and and this is another kind
of story which like I would have
suggested for them if I had still bother
suggesting stories I don't
with the amount of small on circulating
on the United States with the corn
economically there is a significant
possibility of us
[Music]
well you know I'm not repeated
contingency plans but we have plenty of
leaks oh the question was whether there
is a possibility of a popular uprising
with you know people with guns and so on
who upset enough in the United States
nor their contingency plans about how to
suppress it that you know I have no way
of knowing but it's very likely in fact
be pretty crazy if it wasn't now we know
some things like for example there's one
that one of them in the Pentagon Papers
are frankly not terribly interesting but
one I was involved in them and I wrote a
lot about him and so on there's very
little in them that's new but there were
a few things that were new and one of
the things that was new and interesting
and has never discussed I suspect
because it's too instructive is the
description of what happened at the very
end depending on papers end around 19
mid 1968 and you recall what was going
on right after this is very exactly what
you're talking about right after the Tet
Offensive the Johnson administration
wanted the joint chief one of the
military to send another 200,000 troops
that would have raised the troop level
around 700,000 and at that point Wall
Street you know business big business
just decided look this isn't worth it
anymore and they carried out a very
unusual power play very open and unusual
power play simply they sent down a
delegation to Washington called the wise
men and they basically told Johnson you
know get lost
it's over you know you're not running
anymore time to whine
down and so on which is pretty much what
happened more or less but what about
this troop decision
well the Pentagon Papers has they
decided not to send the troops and the
reason was the milk more the main reason
was the military was strongly opposed
because they said they thought they
would need the troops for civil disorder
control in the United States they said
there's so much opposition to the war
among women and young people and you
know blacks and others that if any more
troops were sent they simply would have
an uprising on their hands and therefore
they had to keep the troops here well
that's part of the reason why the war
was won down you know they did not want
to have to face a war at home a civil
war which could tear apart the society
and I don't know if it would happen but
that's what they were afraid of
resistance to the draft you know civil
disobedience all sorts of things and you
know that's one of the ways in which
just you know the plain disruption which
was overwhelmingly nonviolent I should
say a lot of it taking place right here
in this church was a factor in limiting
the massive destruction in limited
before they had managed to kill five
million people approximately but at
least limited it it wasn't 60 million
people so yeah I assume the same kinds
of plans are around today and someday
maybe we'll find out about try to see if
you can liberate some documents isn't
that where Jeffrey Sachs was just went
yeah
what your opinion is what they're
developing do they do what they call
overseas development foreign governments
yeah what your opinion is of what
exactly their version of development is
and secondly what you know about and
what you think about this up-and-coming
part of overseas development which is
environmental environmental especially
in Eastern Europe well I I you know I
wouldn't want to comment on the
Institute without looking at in detail
at what it's done but we do know a lot
about its new director jeffrey sachs who
became very harvard economist who became
a big star because he carried out a
great he had a great achievement in
bolivia that was his big achievement and
he went on from bolivia to poland we had
another achievement and the russia worry
another achievement what he succeeded in
doing and believed any became big star
and i assume that's the kind of thing
they like and want to do well okay what
happened in bolivia bolivia was a mess
you know like most of the former
colonial world and sachs moved in there
and fixed it up for him the bolivia is
considered an economic miracle actually
it's now under a state of siege
incidentally the bolivia is and at one
of those economic miracles if you look
at the numbers the macroeconomic
statistics they look pretty good
you know like inflation is down you know
the budget is balanced all that stuff
looks nice and it was done by the
structural adjustment by standard
neoliberal techniques you draw you get
the peasants to produce for the agro
export market and pour in you know you
subsidize US food to replace what
they're producing cutback services the
usual business and it worked there's
only one little footnote the peasants
are rational and when they are driven
off the farms and stop producing food
for local markets because they can't
compete with subsidized US agribusiness
and told your job is to make money
producing for export you produce what
pays and what pays happens to be coca
so cook cocaine production shot up it's
now one of the two leading cocaine
producers in the world cookie leaf
producers in the world
the other one is Peru we're exactly the
same thing was done with exactly the
same consequences and as a result of the
effect of neoliberal that's what exactly
what the bishops were talking about
remember what I said what I quoted I was
quoting their talk about the neoliberal
economics which has driven people to the
drug market that's the way it did it you
force people to stop producing for a
local consumption and to go into the
agro export market and to integrate with
international capital and you produce
drugs so now it's just pouring out of
there
people say you know Colombia and so on
but there was just a study by the OECD
the rich countries of the narcotics
traffic and you know they don't have
exact numbers cuz so technically illegal
but they gave some rough numbers they
estimate about half a billion dollars a
year of profit of which 7% goes to
Colombia that tells you their role and
about over 50% goes to US banks okay
that tells you who's involved in the
drug racket and it tells you why the
bishops made the statements that I just
made well that's the major effect of the
policies in in Bolivia what about in
Eastern Europe well you want a picture
under the the effect in of the policies
in Eastern Europe was to destroy the
economies they shot way down they are
turning directly into third world
societies with the usual characteristics
including crime Poland is now one of the
main exporters of narcotics illegal
narcotics the Western Europe now Poland
had under the Soviet Union whatever you
think about them they had developed the
societies this was part of the third
world that developed so they produce
more advanced technically advanced
narcotic
you know amphetamines and stuff like
that not just coca leaves they the for
the population it's a complete disaster
there was actually Harvard press is
pretty good book that just came out on
this the if you want a some measure of
what happened during those years not
only in Poland but in Russia and the
rest UNESCO put out a study about a year
ago estimating just the human cost
simple human cost like deaths of the
what they call the capitalist reforms
which incidentally UNESCO approved of
and they estimate the well for Russia
for example they estimate about half a
man extra deaths a year just as a result
of the reforms Poland's a smaller
country so it was a smaller number but
proportional so sure these things sort
of work in a way I mean like if you walk
down the streets of Warsaw you find nice
stuff in the shop windows and so on it's
like a third-world country plenty of
wealth very narrowly concentrated
poverty starvation death huge inequality
and so on the kind of thing you find
when you go to any place that we've had
our control of for you know 50 years so
yeah I suppose that's the kind of
policies they like since he's appointed
as the head of it I'm sorry about the
environmental economics I'd be careful
you know I mean they're make it makes
sense if it's done seriously but the
question is how it's done and you got to
look and see how it's done
well first of all yeah they are taking
their job seriously it's just that their
conception of their job is not your
conception of their job as to how you
can influence what they do you know
there are a lot of ways first first of
all there are people inside the
mainstream media both the globe and The
Herald who would be sympathetic to what
you're doing some of them fairly high up
but you know I don't know you were there
I wasn't most of the time they don't say
I'll lose my job but they know that
there are limits that they can't go
beyond unless they have public support
now the more public support they have
the wider those limits are and regular
constant pressure on major institutions
that will even include the wall street
journal' will change the spectrum within
which they do things how much it'll
change it you don't know there's limits
obviously but it will change it the
other thing is they'll change it is
alternative there is no law of nature
that says that there has to be a
complete monopoly over information in
the hands of huge corporations that's an
institutional fact not a law of nature
and you don't have to go back very far
to see that a much more democratic
society like in in the 1950s there were
I think 800 independently
newspapers which were reaching about 20
or 30 million people weekly well that
was destroyed by concentration of
private power right but and that's you
know that's nowhere near the power the
corporate press but it's something the
the the communication networks like
radio and television in the United
States are a private monopoly corporate
monopoly but they certainly don't have
to be they aren't in or they weren't
they're becoming that but up until now
they haven't been in other societies
very much like Aires they're public you
know and whether these things happen or
not depends on it like everything else
on labor rights and you know medical
insurance and every other thing it
depends on how much functioning
democracy there is how much popular
organization how much activism how much
pressure how much dismantling of
oppressive institutions and those are
choices you know doesn't happen as a
gift you have to fight for it but you
fight for everything
Oh
the wrong was that well the talk is to
the u.s. is doing this in corporate
interest for four reasons one reason of
course the US government wouldn't say
are the executive branch wouldn't state
of the population we're doing this for
economic reasons that's why we're in
Vietnam or we're doing with doing
himself any place else in the world they
essentially said we're doing it because
we're stopping Soviet aggression across
the face of the earth like for instance
in every major military conflict Kennedy
there Truman Johnson Iranian going
national television the Seder now that
the Cold War is over and every major
official in Soviet Union is free to say
anything you want
I was wondering you find it like that
nobody needs something to position the
u.s. the current US position
[Music]
you mean saying we did we weren't trying
to carry aggression right well first of
all they don't have to because one of
the nice things first of all they're not
gonna say much because remember this is
the new third world elite you go to
Brazil and you go to the you know the
whatever club the rich bankers hang out
in Brazil they're not going to be
criticizing American imperialism they
think it's great you know it's terrific
for them it makes them rich it enables
them to crush everybody near them and so
on and so forth and the ex nomenklatura
the former leadership of the Communist
Party that's what they are they're the
guys who run the franchise's for the
Western corporations and you know run
the crime system and so on so why should
they criticize it I think it's terrific
but you don't have to go to them because
one of the one of the sort of nice
things about the end of the Cold War is
that it a lot of the pretexts just
collapsed
so by now even if you look at pretty
mainstream scholarship they've pretty
much concede what was said by the
critics all along of course they justify
it in fact there's a new what's called a
new paradigm in diplomatic history about
the Cold War which everybody adheres to
it has the same bottom line but that's
given you know if your respectable
intellectual the bottom line is whatever
we did it was right but you can change
the argument that leads to that bottom
line so now the arguments been changed I
mean nobody pretends anymore that there
are nobody sane you know that there was
a Soviet aggression was threatened
there's just too much documentary
evidence about all this and they know
that they never expected Soviet
aggression so that's sort of given up
but the long the bottom line stays the
same you know like Truman was right and
NSC 68 was right but the reason was and
the reason is interesting the reason was
because the United States had to
maintain what's called preponderance now
preponderance means that we had the
guarantee that no matter how far down
the line you go there would never be a
threat to the United States now that
explains why Atchison was justified in
condemning neutralism you know we call
the suicide of neutralism because if
some country was neutral say India
there's no guarantee that sometime in
the future they might not associate
themselves with the potential and enemy
right so therefore neutralism really is
suicide and in order to maintain
preponderance we really had to run
everything in other words what
mainstream American scholarship you can
read this in journals like International
Security the Harvard Journal what
mainstream American scholarship is now
saying and taking pride in incidentally
is attributing to the United States
exactly what the most extreme Hawks
attributed to the Soviet Union that that
you know you read Kissinger they say
well their concept of security is
they're not secure unless they run
everything
well now the line is we're not secure
unless we run everything and that's
right because we were by definition
perfect and therefore and everything we
do is correct so therefore it's right
for us to run everything so it was right
for us to have preponderance and - you
know dominate everything and control
everything even though we now recognize
what of course obvious that it wasn't
done out of threat of Soviet aggression
because it never wasn't it in fact this
is even official policy so you know one
of the most recent the recent the
government military the things that I
was quoting before about the
technological sophistication of third
world powers which is now the reason for
keeping everything the way it always was
also point out that say in places like
the Middle East in the 1980s say the
threat to our interests could not have
been laid at the Kremlin's door so that
was all wise in other words we now
concede that because it's useless you
know the threat was indigenous
nationalism and we now concede that if I
could get a little piece of this and
mcnamara's ridiculous book that just
came out the line in McNamara's book and
the one that's repeated in all the
newspapers you know globe editorials
times editorials and so on is we made a
mistake we
Vietnamese nationalism we didn't realize
they were nationalists we thought they
were communists hacks
well McNamara may actually believe that
he seems to be the book has a kind of
ring of sincerity to it I mean he seems
to be totally ignorant of everything
that happened you know there was like a
millimeter away from his assignment but
if he even knew what was in the Pentagon
Papers that he commissioned he would
know that they never underestimated
Vietnamese nationalism they always knew
from the very beginning way back in the
40s that this was the Vietnamese
nationalist movement and they had to
destroy it because it wasn't under
control it was independent that was
always understood and always perfectly
well understood there was never any
doubt about it except on the part of the
most extreme in the souls like maybe
McNamara and they and it was known all
the way through you know and so but but
the point is it's now gotta be sort of
conceded an effect if you look at the
you know Morsi and in fact that
something is kind of refreshing you read
journals like foreign policy you
actually find one or two main foreign
policy journals is there's actually an
article in there which I couldn't really
believe when I saw it it's jointly
written by a guy from the RAND
Corporation and German Schwartz you know
that's the air force research
organization and Christopher Lane who's
from the Cato Institute no kind of ultra
write Institute and it's very straight
article about American foreign policy it
says look let's put aside all the
nonsense about defending ourselves from
the Russians and so on let us simply
recognize as he puts it that there's a
lot of truth to what he calls the
Leninist critique of imperialism namely
we had to do things to control markets
and resources and so on and of course
we're right to do so because we're
perfect but let's just recognize it so
by now as I say that clouds are kind of
lifting on those issues
and you don't have to go to the Russians
to find it out we got plenty of
documents here
yeah absolutely yeah in fact very clear
new grill as you move towards the third
I'm gonna remember what a third-world
society looks like a third-world society
has a lot of superfluous people people
are just useless they have no human
rights and no human value because they
don't contribute to making profit and
enriching the rich you know they don't
even clean their floors they're not even
needed for anything well in in one of
our third-world domains that's why we
fund security forces like we half of our
military aid more than half for Latin
America goes to Colombia and the reason
is it has the worst human rights record
on in the hemisphere it's slaughter the
security forces have killed maybe 20,000
people or so in the last few years you
know political organizers and union
leaders and peasants and so on and
that's the way you make sure you keep
this perfect list people under control
you slaughter them well we haven't quite
reached that level here though we're
getting to be a third world Society so
what we do with the superfluous people
the ones who don't contribute to wealth
production for the rich and therefore
have no aren't human really what you do
with them is first of all try to coop
him up in slums which are sort of like
concentration camps and if that doesn't
work you put them in jail
which is the equivalent sort of the
counterpart in a wealthy society to
death squads and a poor society and so
they're naturally zooming and they are a
shot in the arm and certainly crime is
not going up at least as far as any
evidence is concerned I mean if you can
believe the government you know FBI
statistics and all this other stuff
crime is a fairly level you know I mean
story went up in the 70s since then it's
probably them even declined but the
perception of crime has increased but
that's because it's it's not that it's
not a serious problem especially if
you're a poor person it's an extremely
serious problem because crime is mostly
people preying on each other so you're a
poor person you know living down in
Roxbury yeah crime is a problem but
they're not the ones are calling from
our prisons no the to put you know their
own sons in jail the in fact there are
now more black males in the prison
system and in the education system in
the you know relevant ages in fact what
the criminal system is simply being used
as a war against literally a war against
an unwanted part of the population a
part of the population that used to be
industrial workers or at least have the
opportunity to and maybe work themselves
up but now just have no rights because
you don't need that anymore you can get
them cheaper somewhere else so you got
to get rid of that's a large part of
what the drug wars about drug war has no
effect on drugs in fact as I mentioned
the large part and it's well known
outside the United States is in the
bishop statement that a large part of
the drug policies are fomenting the
production of drugs and in fact if
anybody wanted to do something but the
drugs they go to wherever those 260
billion dollars of annual profits are
being laundered namely US banks you know
you don't see many bankers in jail the
drug program is designed and implemented
to criminalize an unwanted population
black males Hispanic males and so on so
you know you take a look at that chain
gangs in Alabama and it'll be somebody
who had a joint in his pocket you know
that's what I think so that's what you
do it as for the the system has a side
benefit its state spending so it has a
stimulative effect on the economy firms
like say Merrill Lynch you know and
Prudential and so on they are putting
out bonds tax-free bonds for the
building of prisons and making a lot of
money on it it's a growth it's part of
it it's it's part of the growth system
you know it's come it's not the scale of
the Pentagon but it's sort of you know
it got the same function in fact the
military corporations are all like
Lockheed and so on they're already
realizing it so they are now exploring
the possibility of entering on you know
climbing on that gravy train
and selling developing high tech now
high tech methods of surveillance and
control which the public will pay for
and it will be dual use technology and
you able to use it for something else
actually is a big story in the Wall
Street Journal about it a couple months
ago so you know you can your good
engineer you can figure out a way to
implant an electrode and somebody's have
been some supercomputer somewhere I'll
have them under surveillance and if they
go the wrong place you send out a shock
or you know drug you know chemicals or
something or other and that way you
could have very efficient monitoring of
and control of large parts of the
population which would be quite
cost-effective except of course for the
technology which the public is paying
for anyway prison construction alone is
a booming industry and the security
personnel has been maybe still is the
fastest growing white-collar operation
for some you know profession for some
years so all of this stuff goes on with
pouring money into the hands of the
wealthier sectors Merrill Lynch
construction also the prisons are being
privatized I don't remember the figures
but the growth of the privately run
prisons is far higher than the state-run
prisons and that's just another scam
privatized prisons is like privatized
health means the public pays the costs
and one or another technique but there's
private profit and you have a lot of
techniques of you know you can cut down
costs by pouring putting more prisoners
into a cell and you don't have to give
them any care and no rehabilitation none
of that stuff so I think the whole thing
is is a very natural consequence of the
policies designed to create a third
world type society you know when I say
third world I don't mean the United
States gonna look like Mexico you know
much too rich for that but it's going to
that structure you know that kind of
structure at a richer level and yeah
that's prisons are a part of that just
as death squads and the terror of the
security forces is part of Mexico in
Colombia
well we mentioned earlier there talked
the angry white man syndrome I know I'm
gonna take some heat for this violence
isn't there some benefit to these people
experiencing the same kind of repression
that people of color and women
experience throughout the history of
this country because then they get a
chance to instead of point the finger at
the victim get a chance to point the
finger at themselves the same question
is can you give your opinion like
affirmative action the recent attacks on
well first of all you know when you say
that they have to feel that oppression
that kind of suggests that they haven't
felt it in the past which just isn't
true if you go back let's go back a
hundred years when the big immigration
was coming in from well when the
immigration was let's say Boston when
the Irish immigration was coming in here
Irish were being treated like blacks you
know in fact if you read the writings of
fancy you know Cambridge intellectuals
100 years ago like Charles Francis Adams
he was warning that pretty soon if we
didn't watch out we were going to have a
Celtic proletariat on the east and a
Chinese proletariat in the West and you
know our great Anglo Saxon civilization
would collapse and so on they were just
like blacks okay and treated like blacks
right here in Boston in faith and for a
long time you don't have to go very far
from here you know they go to western
Pennsylvania where the you know big
steals where Andrew Carnegie was
building his billion-dollar corporation
with federal aid the people who were
there were some black workers but the
ones who were worse treated with what
they called the Huns Huns men sort of
anybody from Eastern Europe you know and
they were intervention you know real
slime and you gotta smash him and so on
effect was only the organization of the
labor movement that brought people
together to just exactly is what
happened with blacks into knowing I mean
during the period of formation of the
CIO the color lines were either blurred
or eliminated in common struggle for
something else and the same thing had
happened for Irish for
you know Eastern Europeans and so on now
you're right when you say the treatment
of blacks was always worse I mean at
whatever level you mention it treatment
of blacks was always worse for perfectly
obvious reasons they were the only
enslaved population so yes it was always
a cut below but the answer to this isn't
to make you know the Irish and the you
know and the Huns and the rest of them
suffer like blacks the answer is the
answer that was given during the
formation of the labor movement at
Homestead Pennsylvania in 1892 and the
you know bill steel strike in the late
30s and so on and that is to break down
the color lines because you're fighting
a different struggle instead of all we
have a one-sided class war going on
there's one sector of the United States
that's really deeply Marxist fanatics
they are fighting the very vulgar
Marxists you read their literature reads
like malice texts with just the words
inverted they're always fighting a
bitter class war and they never stop
have plenty of resources and they have
people to do it for them and they put
billions of dollars a year into
propaganda and so on and if they're the
only ones who are fighting it you know
exactly how it's going to turn out
if the retin you know the other 90% of
the population get into the ACTA can
turn out differently and that's the
answer not making these guys and
Michigan suffer like blacks because
that's just gonna lead them to Nazism
you know we we've seen where that goes
I mean that's the ground you know that's
a groundswell that could lead to
American knots ism fact it's the most
likely outcome something like that
Oh affirmative action well you know this
was a method for trying to overcome some
of the extreme inequities for women and
for blacks and of course in a period
when you're trying to extend inequities
and to make the society even more
unequal and to concentrate wealth and
power even more narrowly obviously
that's gonna be under attack so it's
just part of the general attack on a
commitment to some sort of not even
equality just you know rights for people
when you attack rights you're also gonna
want to attack access to right so I it
just follows and we ought to be
defending it for the same reason we
defend right well you know it's I don't
know exactly how much hope I have but
whatever hope there is is exactly where
it's always been I mean there have been
worse period so if you go back to I mean
let's say during the early part of the
century what's happened take say what's
happening Decatur Illinois it's pretty
ugly I mean they may succeed in
destroying the last part of the
industrial workforce on the other hand
look at what happened say up until 1935
I mean you know nobody knows how many
because nobody counted but at least 700
American workers were simply murdered by
the security forces during the period of
labor struggles in the United States to
try to gain just an eight-hour day
that's why May Day is celebrated all
around the world as day of solidarity
with American workers in fact you go to
the right-wing British press and then
like the London Times in the 1920s and
so on they were just appalled at the
treatment of American workers American
workers getting murdered straight out by
security forces into the late 1930s you
know right through the Roosevelt theory
so you know things have looked bad
plenty of times and there has been
recovery by popular struggle in the
1920s it looked as if the labor movement
and independent thought and so on had
been totally smashed
it was worse than now it looked like
there's complete euphoria after the
Wilson Woodrow Wilson's Red Scare which
smashed up the unions and you know
kicked out four thousand people from the
country and put the leading labor leader
Eugene Debs in to jail for ten years and
so on and so forth and the business
community and the they were supported by
a lead opinion including liberal elite
opinion I should say and it looked as if
they'd won no they were terribly
surprised when the depression came and
they're not they hadn't won so you know
what hope is there well you know things
change so in fact in many ways the
country is a lot better even now than it
was thirty years ago you wouldn't have
this many people thirty years ago
listening to talks on topics like this
in fact he wouldn't have four people and
I know that very well having been
involved in giving talks to four people
in churches not very long ago you know
thirty years ago so things change but
they sometimes change for the better but
it doesn't you know like it doesn't
happen by itself I mean it changed from
the 1960s because an awful lot of people
dedicated themselves to it
[Music]
[Music]
well you know neither the United States
or Japan believes in a free market of
course we have all sorts of
interferences with markets here as I
mentioned in the 1980s the Japanese and
you know the South Koreans and Taiwanese
would have just wiped out American
industrial production if we'd opened up
their markets so therefore we closed
their markets that's the 1980s not long
ago the Japanese have their own systems
for controlling you know for for
supporting domestic producers and so on
and the United States wants to very
selectively break down barriers while
keeping other barriers in the end but
you might think real question you should
be asking yourself is in whose interest
is this being done for example will
there be in effect suppose that they
manage to sell more of our was it this
battering-ram which is in violation of
GATT rules and has condemned around the
world I should say suppose that it
succeeds in breaking open the Japanese
market who's going to gain like will
American workers gain no American
corporations have already told us the
answer to that one again read the Wall
Street Journal you know yesterday a
couple days within the last couple days
there was an article in which the
manufacture parts manufacturers in the
United States pointed out that if they
get greater access to Japanese markets
they'll be delighted because their
profits will go up but they're going to
supply them from overseas production
which makes perfect sense if you think
about it you know like if you're a
manufacturer based in Boston and you
have to supply Japanese markets makes a
lot more sense to supply them from super
cheap labor in China or in
Asia than from Decatur Illinois so
that's what they're gonna do so the
results of opening up the Japanese
markets if it had and it's a
battering-ram
in violation of GATT rules nobody doubts
then if it works it will improve the
profit ratings for some us-based
corporations but it's owning it's not
going to have a no effect or maybe a
harmful effect for American workers
because these things are not United
States versus Japan
that's mythology what it's a sector of
the United States and a sector of Japan
versus another sector you know there's
no simple answer first of all
nationalism is has always been a myth
and it was recognized to be a myth
centuries ago
I mean you can read about it and Adam
Smith you know who he wrote a book as
everybody knows called wealth of nations
but he also pointed out that it's
nonsense there's no such notion that the
policies that are he was speaking mostly
about England and he said look the
policies that are carry out in England
of the English government are determined
by what he called the principal
architects who in his day with the
merchants and manufacturers of England
and he said they doesn't use state power
to enrich themselves to ensure that
their own interests are most peculiarly
attended to as he put it however
Grievous the impact on the people of
England so in other words it's a class
policy I mean yes the nation is
mobilized but in the interest but in
class interests the interests of the
people who are on the society well you
know what was obvious to Adams
I thought it'd be obvious to us and and
it would be if we didn't have it beaten
out of our heads because it's a truism
you know I mean a ten-year-old would be
able to figure it out if they just
thought about the world for a second so
it takes again a good education to drive
these things out of your head but it's
obviously true what Adam Smith regard he
didn't make a big fuss about this
because so obviously true we just
mentioned it but it was obviously true
then it's much more obviously true now
for the exactly the reason you mentioned
I mean since the 1970s there's been a
considerable acceleration of the global
is of the internationalization of the
economy how considerable you can argue
it's not so obvious really when you
compare it with say a century ago or two
centuries ago but yes it's gone up and
so like when you have corporate
headquarters and you know Boston and
production facilities in Indonesia and
you know banks offshore and the Cayman
Islands so you can launder drugs without
any drug money without anybody bothering
you and the rest of it then of course
the concept of national entity erodes
and you can see it in figures for
example you know we're supposed to have
a big trade deficit right one of our big
problems is this twin deficit one of
them being the trade deficit and it's
true if you take a look at the US
borders and you look at the stuff that
goes across the borders there's a trade
deficit on the other hand the Commerce
Department recently recalculated the
trade deficit under a proposal by the
National Academy of Sciences and they
calculated it so as to take production
exports by us-based corporations
overseas were counted part of our
positive part of our exports and you
know imports would be say if they
imported capital goods from somewhere
well it turned out that we now have a
big trade positive trade balance and the
business press like The Wall Street
Journal pointed out that's the right way
to do it because the United States
from their point of view point of view
of their constituency doesn't mean the
geographical borders
it means the rich guys in the United
States and for them there's a
to create balance for the for the
country there's a negative trade balance
and in fact what's called trade isn't
trade anyway because about 40 percent or
so of US trade is actually internal to
corporations so it isn't even trade you
know it's just moving things around
across borders within a corporation
centrally controlled so sure if you
really did an honest analysis of the
International economy you wouldn't use
notions like nation or trade or any of
these things because they're all pretty
deceitful but it's true that populations
are mobilized in support of the
interests of the principal architects of
policy you own the societies constantly
that's why countries go to war you know
that's why they follow destructive
domestic policies and you know
constructive nationalism can react
against a it can in fact it doesn't have
to be hostile to other nationalisms it
can be cooperative with it you know
people do fall together and one or
another kind of groupings nothing wrong
with that there's no reason why one or
another those groupings has to be
hostile to another one they can
recognize that there are interests that
cut across them and they can try to
cooperate with those who have the same
interests within another grouping
another nationality you know for common
like American workers and Mexican
workers have basically the same
interests they can both work within
their national entities you know to
develop policies which will be
cooperative and supportive the other
side of the class work I mean there's
nothing good or bad about nationalism
and how its use it tenses of concealing
the fact that legislation is written by
corporate lobbyists in fact it's been
bringing the corporate lobbyists to
write the legislation right into the
press conferences to tell the press
what's in the bills that they write
instead of having them hide behind the
curtains in the usual fashion and this
has been so transparent it's become a
joke in the Washington press corps you
the New York Times has had stories about
it well that's reality again this
morning the Pulitzer prize-winning
correspondent Washington correspondent
of The Boston Globe David Sriman tells
us of what he calls Newt Gingrich's
contempt for the corporate lobbyists
that is the ones he spreads the red
carpet for so that they can appear and
explain to the press the legislation
that they wrote and tell the congressman
what they're signing the in general
without proceeding there's a world and
there's a picture of the world and they
may not necessarily have much to do with
one another if you want to see about the
real world there are places to look to a
good place to look to see where the
country is going is the issue of Fortune
magazine that came out this week it's a
kind of a special issue every year
Fortune magazine comes out with a
special issue on the fortune 500 you
know 500 richest corporations this year
it's both industrial and what they call
service corporations remember service
doesn't mean people who clean the floor
and so on it means insurance companies
and investment banks and so on and so
forth so the five top 500 insurer
industrial and service corporations
alright and this is an unusually fat
issue because they're celebrating their
40th anniversary so you know a lot of
hoopla and so on and also because
they're so excited they point out that
the profits this last year this last
year in 1994 were up they say a stunning
54 percent over 93 and that's on
virtually flat sales growth 8% sales
growth and virtually no employment
growth 2.6 percent employment growth the
fortune 500 controls sixty-three percent
of gross domestic product US gross
domestic product and in in addition they
control an unspecified amount of
world economy well that's a degree of
tyrannical control over the world that
is rare and probably without any
precedent in human history and remember
that the word tyrannical is exactly
accurate
these are unaccountable totalitarian
institutions run from top-down about
which public have nothing to say so the
more control they can be given over okay
a few things about where the country is
going or more accurately where it's
being driven by quite conscious and
deliberate social policy the policies
that are being followed our strength
strenuously opposed by a substantial
majority of the population that's
demonstrated quite conclusively and
unambiguously by regular polling however
the policies are by and large supported
by a lead opinion so what we read is
that they are an expression of the
public will you constantly read that the
contract with America is poll-driven the
result of careful soundings of public
opinion and so on and so forth you have
to get down to the footnotes to discover
that even now that even now on less than
40% of the population has even heard of
it and when they're asked about its
specific terms virtually without
exception they are overwhelmingly
opposed but that's you know just the
facts the preferred story is the kind of
thing that you get say in less Sunday's
Boston Globe from their business
correspondent David Warsh who assures us
that quote IAM the a great preponderance
of Americans want a balanced budget even
with far-reaching cuts and spending for
education and health well there's a way
to discover what a great preponderance
of Americans want and the way is too
at the very regular and extensive
polling that's done to check the pulse
of the country mostly for business
interests and for PR interests but
there's a lot of data on it and people
have been asked what they think about a
balanced budget if it entails not
far-reaching but any cuts in education
and social spending when people are
asked whether they want a balanced
budget with accompanied by cuts in
spending 22 percent say yes when they're
asked do they want a balanced budget
with cuts for health spending 25 percent
say yes and similarly for other kinds of
cuts but as that's transmuted into a
lead opinion it becomes a great
preponderance of the public wants a
balanced budget even with far-reaching
cuts in social spending spending for
education and health well he gives
evidence not polls but the evidence that
he gives is that that's the proof is
that that's what Congress is pushing and
since we live in a democracy if Congress
is pushing it it's got to be with the
great preponderance of the public once
the Congress that he's talking about is
one that is so comically subordinated to
business rule that it doesn't even
conduct the usual pre good evening
friends wonderful we have such a full
house the Lucy Parsons Center welcomes

American foreign and domestic policy mr.
Chomsky we are delighted to have you
here this evening
[Applause]
[Music]
is this the one for the burn yeah can
you hear me through this one yeah trying
to figure out the mics are right
what can't hear up is it that I'm not
speaking into it or what yeah are these
gonna be okay they're awful low all
right yeah okay trust the techies over
there well I'd like to eighty-nine right
through the Clinton recovery that's
unprecedented for what they call
unskilled workers meaning people with a
high school education and the wages have
dropped somewhere between 20 and 25
percent since 1980 those are the angry
white males people real a bit worried
about people whose lives are falling
apart on the any hope for providing for
families are having a decent wage and
life is basically disappearing the anger
is perfectly understandable if not the
reactions in fact the reactions are
understandable - in the absence of any
organization or understanding or
direction as to what a constructive way
to respond might be for college-educated
people
wages did stay up until 1987 by then the
Reagan Reagan ID changes had succeeded
in hitting college-age educated people -
and wages start stop start to decline
for them in 1987 or end you mean that's
that's the other side of the story so
profits booming wages dropping the the
facts are reported it's not that they're
a secret especially in the business
press they're regularly reported so in
1992 when the effect of the Reagan
policies actually Carter Reagan policies
was already evident The Wall Street
Journal had a story in which they hailed
what they called a welcome development
of transcendent importance the welcome
development of transcendent importance
was that
in 1985 before the effect of these
reforms had hit the United States had
the highest wages technically highest
labor costs per unit output of any
industrial country which is pretty much
what you'd expect this is by far the
richest country in the world it's
completely unparalleled advantages but
by 1992 it was the lowest in the
industrial world except for England
where Thatcher had done even a better
job of smashing up who were in working
people actually in 1990 the United
States actually went below England and
was world champion but then England fell
even further so the welcomed development
of transcendent importance is we were
now the had the lowest labor costs in
the industrial world next to next to
Thatcher and the end of the Cold War was
held in the business press precisely
part largely because it provided weapons
to extend and accelerate this process
and that was pretty explicit so the
London Financial Times which is the main
International Business Journal had ran a
story on Poland called with the headline
green shoots and communism ruins
communist you know everything's a
horrible wreck and so on and so forth
communism destroyed everything but there
are some green shoots and good things
are happening the green shoots were that
thanks are the decisions that affect
ordinary life the better things are
because the less danger there is that
the the great beast does have Alexander
Hamilton once described you folks that
the great beast can get involved and
disrupt things that are none of their
business like public affairs well that's
where the country is going if you look
more closely you see even in greater
detail where it's going one of the the
biggest one of the biggest gainers last
year was manpower incorporated 35%
increase in sales
another one was Kelly twenty one percent
increase in sales remember that these
are the people who sell as they put a
temporary employees who
or that increasing temporary employees
is part of the strategy of devastating
the workforce in the United States by
undermining worker rights benefits the
gains that have been won in a very long
and hard struggle over well over a
hundred years
we just passed Mayday
which everywhere outside the United
States is is the commemoration it's
celebrated as a labor day in in memory
of the ins originally in support for the
struggles of American workers for an
eight-hour day this is the one country
where nobody even knows what it is it's
a day when you're supposed to wait flags
the president gave patriotic speech and
so on and so forth
Labor Day in the United States is at the
end of the summer that is when you go
back to work you know not when you worry
about the days in Chicago when workers
were getting killed because they were
struggling for an eight-hour day and the
rest of the world celebrates it like
Mexico and so on well that's a kelly in
man power during this all of this is
part of the part of the general process
by which the United States is taking on
or is being driven more accurately
towards a kind of a third world
character pretty consciously in fact
quite consciously a third world typical
third world country has a sector of
extremely wealthy people big mass of
people living in utter misery and a
large number of people who are basically
superfluous they're the ones you send
the death squads out for you do social
cleansing or whatever and that is the
goal the goal is to try to make the
United States look like that in fact to
try to make the world look like that
makes a lot of sense if you happen to be
within the sector that's going to become
enriched by this process while profits
went up 54% last year wages continued
the decline they've been declining since
nineteen
the latest according to latest figures
they've dropped over seven percent since
nineteen
