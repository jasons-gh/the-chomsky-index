Chomsky: I have things that I think I can do and I
think are worth doing. That's what I devote myself to.
If people want to describe it the way they do,
that's there decision.
Bolkestein: In a deeper sense, I think, if I would be able to
convey something like that to you.
Would it be very nice not to be an intellectual
with all the responsibilities that go with it?
Chomsky: Would it be nice to be a human being without
the responsibilities of being a human being?
Well, I can imagine that. For example,
if you're a human being and you're a citizen of a relatively free society,
and you're relatively privileged, you have responsibilities.
Moral responsibilities are basically measured by what you are able to do.
I don't have any responsibility for things that happened in the 16th century
because I can't do anything about them.
I do have responsibility for things I can influence.
In a totalitarian society,
where you've got -- say, extermination camps,
there isn't much you can do.
In a free society, there's a lot you can do.
For people like me who are relatively privileged,
there's even more you can do.
So that assigns you a responsibility that you cannot escape.
You can say "I don't care," you know, you can do that
but you can't say "I don't have the responsibility."
You can say "I refuse to execute the responsibility"
that's a choice.
In some ways its easier and in some ways its harder.
Don't forget you have to look at yourself in the mirror every day too.
And people make the choices.
Nobody's a saint, I'm not, I don't spend 24 hours a day trying to help people.
I do other things.
But I adjust my life in some fashions so that I spend a fair amount of time, in fact a lot of time,
doing things that I think contribute to
meeting a very substantial moral responsibility.
And I think many other people do
also and that's what's led to human progress.
Otherwise, we'd be still, you know, living in slave states.
And I think it's important
Bolkestein: Do you recall what the biggest mistake in moral judgement was you ever made?
Chomsky: The biggest mistake in moral judgement I ever made
was waiting so long to getting involved in protests against the Vietnam War.
I should've started it 19 -- the early 1950s.
Bolkestein: Does it still weigh on you?
Chomsky: Very much. I mean look at the effect on Indochina, which was virtually destroyed.
I don't know if I could've made any difference, but one [himself] could have tried, at least.
