so in it what it said in the case of
conflicts with much weaker enemies of
the United States must win rapidly and
decisively because otherwise political
support will erode like it's not 1960s
any longer we can go on for a year after
years smashing up a country of
destroying it and nobody even bats an
eyelash that's the problem they're
facing in Iraq I mean if it was the
1960s early 60s I know they just send
the b-52s and destroy the place it
wouldn't be any problem but they can't
do that anymore they don't have the
options of Kennedy and Johnson had
theirs you have to win rapidly and
decisively or else political support
disappears well that's change I mean
it's not utopia you know but it's a
significant change and these I agree
exactly that's what you say these
trajectories are very optimistic don't
you got to make sure they go on
there's not very much time to talk about
this but there is some very good working
on it for example the recent book by my
husband Donny Ugandan scholar Colombia
exactly on this topic just came out and
what he points out is that what the West
Coast terrorism is political Islam I
mean it was secular it it was a secular
political movement for a long time but
the secular political movement was just
smashed and it was partly by outside
force partly by internal corruption I
mean whatever the reason the secular
political Islam just didn't succeed and
people don't just give up hope
religious extremist Islam which indeed
was fostered by the same people who
destroyed political Islam so the United
States and Britain and others destroyed
political Islam by the deal of violence
wasn't the only cause with a significant
one and they also foster the sector
religious fanatic Islam I mean be the
obvious case is al Qaeda and that's not
a big secret who organized the Islamic
Jihad ease in the 1980s CIA bridge
intelligence
Pakistani intelligence they scoured the
world to find the most radical Islamic
extremists they could find and brought
them to Afghanistan and trained them in
our
gave him Stinger missiles and the rest
of it the purpose was not to defend
Afghanistan which could have been a
legitimate purpose in fact the brig
doing it probably prolonged the war in
Afghanistan delayed the russian of
departure russian archives now show the
purpose is quite different it was to
bleed the russians that's not legitimate
and in fact they were carrying out
terrorist acts inside russia in the
1980s serious ones it almost led to a
war between russia and pakistan which
would have been a nuclear war after they
had done their job of bleeding the
russians the West figured okay well
forget about him but they didn't go away
they went back to their own countries or
other places and that's what's become
the al-qaeda style phenomena it finally
turned against the West for reasons of
you know and it's a form of political
Islam and that's happened in country
after country
I mean take say the israeli-occupied one
of the arguments against that part of
the Syria Accountability Act didn't have
time to go into it is the claim that
Syria is allowing Offices of Hamas and
Hezbollah Lebanese Hezbollah to stay
there where is Bala and Hamas come from
come from Israel I mean is rail created
both over in the case of Hamas it did it
consciously I mean in the occupied
territories Israel was supporting
religious extremists in order to
undermine the secular PLO political this
list it wasn't even Islam very much it
was political secular movement seeking
dependence for the Palestinians well
that was the real threat Israel
preferred secular expected religious
extremists one of the only I think maybe
the only University in the West Bank
that Israel sort of allowed to be funded
funded was the Islamic University at one
point they were busing students from the
Islamic University that the birds ate
the secular university to break up
strikes protests with Hezbollah come
from you ever hear them before the
Israeli invasion of Lebanon now they're
the result of the Israeli invasion of
Lebanon in 1982 backed by the u.s.
otherwise they can't do it
the I was a vicious invasion killed
about 20,000 people you know destroyed a
large part of southern Lebanon led the
resistance and the resistance ended up
being Hezbollah which drove him out 11
and is now becoming a kind of political
organization in the Lebanon
well those are the the purpose of the
invasion of Lebanon it was pretty open
it was you know it was expressed by the
highest political military Asha logs the
purpose of the invasion of Lebanon was
to eliminate
PLO efforts at negotiation and political
accommodation which were just becoming
embarrassing it was very hard to fend
them off so they want to drive now 11 on
so they can forget about I think it was
called by the chief of staff and others
11 or what was called a war for the West
Bank I mean this is kind of a pretense
in the West that Israel was reacting to
a PLO you know rocket Katyusha of
bombings of northern Israel and so on
that's a complete lies I mean total lies
I mean if you read the Western scholarly
literature but what they say is that for
a year before the Israeli invasion of
Lebanon the border was quiet okay the
statement the border was quiet is a
racist human euphemism for the fact that
the border was anything but
quiet except that the attacks were
coming from south to north
I mean Israel was bombing Lebanon it was
sinking ships and harbors is murdering
people and so on and an effort
increasingly desperate effort to elicit
some Palestinian reaction that could be
used as pretext or invasion when they
can get a pretext invade it anyway
that's called the border is quiet
meaning our guys aren't getting killed
the but the actual reason was to try to
undermine political a political secular
most not even it was Islamic and
Christian movement just calling for
Palestinian independent end-result
Hezbollah in the occupied territories
and result Hamas in Iraq and result
muqtada al-sadr you know in Algeria was
his name kind of development I mean in
Algeria you know after the French left
Algeria they didn't go away I mean they
penetrated the Algerian security
services the government and so on
and probably they are responsible for a
large part of the massive atrocities of
the last ten years and one result of all
of that is Islamic fundamentalist
radical is administered in Algeria and
this happens all the time not just in
the Islamic world elsewhere - and people
do not just say okay I quit when you
destroy some political option they find
some other way and often the other way
is not very pretty
and often it's fostered by the those who
ultimately suffer from it so yes I think
political Islam is the right word for it
well first of all it doesn't matter I
mean whether you have hope or despair is
it kinda like a personal matter between
you and your wife and children or
something maybe not even that it just
doesn't matter you do exactly the same
thing whether you're optimistic or
pessimistic okay so really doesn't
matter it's a subjective question but I
think there's reason for hope for the
reason that he pointed out before there
is you know there is a very definite
trajectory which is positive I mean
there's plenty of you have plenty of
things that are horrible we can talk we
should talk about them you know we're
not trying to compliment ourselves and I
wonderful we are so you pay attention to
what's wrong try to fix it there's
plenty but the fact of the matter is
that there's tremendous improvement in
the general just the general level of
civilization in the in Western societies
things that were simply taken for
granted not many years ago are now
intolerable literally intolerable it's
not just in the International Affairs I
would take something like domestic abuse
okay I mean 30 or 40 years ago you
wasn't meaning yeah that's life what's
there to talk about so it was not an
issue and now it's a very big issue and
there's a protection and understanding
and so on well hasn't gone haven't
disappeared a lot better than it was and
the same is true of everything else
across the board no there's there's now
awareness and understanding of things
that were just taken for granted as the
way life is I mean I I don't know this
University but I suspect it's a
Manchester but I imagine it's kind of
the same
as MIT it emic my own University if you
walk down the halls at MIT today it's
50% women about 1/3 minorities people
are casually dressed which reflects
informal relationships among people
without deference to Authority and so on
if you'd walk down the same halls 40
years ago white males well-dressed
obedient maybe two or three women and a
couple of thousand people and so on well
that's this is more than symbolism you
know these are changes in the nature of
the society and those changes are going
on and we can foster them they make it
they mean that today there is a basis
for education than organizing there's
much more advanced it was not many years
ago and still plenty of problems but
it's a you could start from a higher
plane and there are plenty of
opportunities I mean just to finish take
something like say the world Social
Forum I mean this is again completely
unprecedented in history
I mean there were attempts to develop
what we call the internationals but they
were very narrow and they collapsed for
reasons you know this is the first
organization which has the prospects
perhaps of being a genuine international
as I'm sure you know it's meeting in the
South like it meets in Brazil and indeed
the reason is because that's where the
activism is these things were initiated
in the south and very successfully being
popular movements lots of activism
finally the North sort of was drawn in
on the periphery and if you read about
when you read about it you said do you
read well it began in Seattle that's
because if half-a-million people
demonstrate and India didn't happen but
if something happens in a northern city
it happened you know
so therefore Seattle is talked about as
the beginning that's not it's the end
you know the but it's important that the
northern countries were drawn in and now
there is an international network of
activists it's a hundred and a hundred
thousand people show up of all kind you
know every imaginable kind of activist
you can think of the it's now spawned
regional and local social forums all
over the place which are at the same
general conception of what the world
isn't where they're going but are
looking at local problems which is
correct they should be looking at what's
right next to them those are all very
healthy development
they've never happened before or in
anything like them and it does give a
basis for moving on
you
to say I'm impressed with this college
it's the first I know how many college
they've talked out over the years but
this is the first one I've ever heard of
it has enough money so that the police
can actually tope eople who are
illegally parked that's got to be
impressive yeah well I was at a talk
that Title I was given I guess it's the
one that's on some and that you have is
the onslaught against freedom and
democracy led by the Bush administration
reactionaries it's always nice to have a
nice neutral title makes no
presuppositions or assumptions would
have been interesting that maybe they'll
be time later to talk about the main
concerns of the any corporate Clearing
House which are my view at least a much
greater threat to democracy than the
topic I'm going to talk about which is
bad enough the well this topic there can
easly for convenience break it up into
two aspects the domestic and the
international aspects of the assault on
freedom and democracy called the defense
of freedom and democracy the domestic
side the first thing that comes to mind
is the recent legislation that's been
enacted in the last couple of years and
the
new additions that are being planned
the main one being Patriot Act hatred
one which was rammed through very
quickly without any scrutiny exploiting
the circumstances immediately after 9/11
and the next one which isn't past those
texts was leaked you've probably seen it
often called Patriot 2 so far Patriot 2
has been blocked by rather extensive
protests John Ashcroft as I'm sure you
know has been had been a couple of weeks
ago traveling around the country almost
surely his intent was to build up
support for the Patriot to act but to
his surprise he found he was greeted
with so much protest and opposition
about Patriot 1 that he had to spend all
of his time trying to defend the Patriot
1 and Patriot 2 as far as we know it was
still on the back burner but they'll try
to sneak it through in some other
fashion the as for Patriot 1 your I
won't
I won't try to review the content of it
I'm sure you know instead of reviewing
the content I'll just quote a comment on
it by one of the heroes of the bush
Rumsfeld Cheney Wolfowitz and the rest
in his words the power of the executive
to cast a man in prison without
formulating any charge known to the law
and particularly to deny him the judge
of his peers is in the highest degree
odious and the foundation of all
totalitarian governments whether Nazi or
communist that actually is a virtual
pretty exact description of the content
of Patriot 1 the man who wrote the words
George Bush looks at every morning he
has a bust on his desk of this revered
figure given to him by his friend Tony
Blair the man's name is Winston
Churchill and he was warning about
abuses of executive power for
intelligence and preventive purposes the
year was 1943 when England was facing
annihilation at the hands of the most
murderous brutal regime in history but
nonetheless Churchill warned severely
against the odious practices that are
the foundations of all totalitarian
governments whether Nazi or communist
and that are enacted in Patriot 1 under
far less onerous conditions so
Churchill's works placed the Bush
administration in its proper historical
context as their great hero perceives it
I think quite accurately
well the act has been implemented but
there's been so much resistance to it
that the implementation so far is
against vulnerable weak people that's
bad enough could be a lot worse but
they've been able to make it worse it's
been upheld by the courts to a large
extent the lower courts at least who
have agreed with the administration
claimed that the court that the
executive that shall have the right to
cast amount a man in prison without
formulating any charge known to the law
that than I am the judgment of his peers
and Churchill's words and to do it
indefinitely without charge without
access to family and lawyers including
American citizens and at the whim of the
executive lasts as long as the executive
branch agrees as long as we have an
executive that is committed to the
policies that are in the highest degree
odious and the foundation of all
totalitarian governments whether Nazi or
communist the that's serious enough but
we should also look at it in the
perspective I mean it's not by far not
the most severe attack on civil
liberties by the executive in US history
so for example it doesn't begin to
compare with what happened during
Woodrow Wilson's Red Scare at the end of
the First World War when thousands of
people were kicked out of the country
many arrested labor movement completely
smashed independent so I've almost
terminated many people jailed among them
the leading figure in the US labor
movement ever Eugene Debs also a
presidential candidate he was charged by
Woodrow Wilson with having given a talk
in which he questioned the nobility of
Wilson's war so he was tossed into jail
and in an exercise of what's called
wilsonian idealism Wilson refused even
amnesty I'm a couple of years after the
war when
that was a general amnesty well we're
nowhere near that I mean that laid a
pall over the next decade and started
coming out of it for till the middle of
the depression it's also what's
happening now nowhere near as severe as
the COINTELPRO operations that were
carried out more recently from through
the Kennedy Johnson and Nixon
administration's these were secret
operations carried out by the National
political police the FBI which primarily
is concerned with crushing political
dissent and has been since its origins
when it was established during Wilson's
Red Scare the these operations were non
not at all trivial the in part they were
aimed at destroying a legal political
party small therefore vulnerable about
just as legal as the Democrats of the
Republicans namely the Socialist Workers
Party two offices were raided by the FBI
file stolen the names distributed to in
efforts to keep people from gaining
employment various other forms of
harassment the it went on to target the
women's movement the all the black
movements the entire new left actions
went as far as outright political
assassination the most extreme case was
an FBI organized really Gestapo style
assassination of a black organizer for
it Hampton killed somebody else Mark
Clark in a staged attack by the Chicago
Police under FBI direction for a.m.
murdered in his bed
both of them and it wasn't wasn't
trivial by any means this was exposed in
at exactly the same time that Watergate
was exposed and the comparison is quite
interesting and tells you a lot about
the operative values in the educated
sectors the intellectual classes and the
society and the press as well so if you
do a poll and ask how many people have
heard of Watergate and how many have
heard of COINTELPRO know what the answer
will be Watergate was simply a tea party
as compared with COINTELPRO it was
triviality the almost nothing happened
bad shouldn't have happened but should
be a minor footnote in the history of
repressions however it was dealt with as
if it's destroying the foundations of
the Republic
whereas COINTELPRO which wasn't
comparably more serious in fact the
actions against the Socialist Workers
Party alone were far more serious than
the entire Watergate incident and that
was the least of it that it was stopped
by the courts theoretically it may still
be going on but it was formally
terminated by the court and it's of no
interest in anyone so what's the
difference between COINTELPRO and
Watergate well in the case of Watergate
the people who were targeted nothing
ever happened through them that the
people who were targeted were powerful
in fact the Democratic Party is roughly
half the power in the country and you
don't call powerful people bad names if
you do that you get thrown out of office
which is exactly what happened to Nixon
for nothing on the other hand the
Kennedy Johnson Nixon actions leading
all the way to political assassination
on the Nixon's beat is of no concern to
anyone because the people who are
targeted aren't powerful people so
everything you like to them and
that does tell us a lot about the
operative values and that remains so
that's the way history is written it's
about Watergate you don't hear about
COINTELPRO well Cohen top row is
incomparably worse than what's happening
now and it helps to put it in
perspective part of the reason is that
the society is just more civilized now
as a result of the activism of the 1960s
and the aftermath people just act
differently see things differently don't
accept things that used to accept which
is good that's true in all kinds of
domains makes organizing a lot easier
than it was then and it makes repression
a lot harder that's to the good and we
should bear that in mind well we should
also bear in mind that whatever happens
here whether it's the Red Scare
COINTELPRO or Patriot 1 or Patriot 2
which I should mention that if patriot 2
sneaks through it's gonna be a lot worse
Patriot two goes all the way beyond
anything that's ever been proposed in
any remotely democratic society at for
example grants the executive the right
to remove citizenship without charge
just on the decision of the Attorney
General who doesn't even have to refer
to actions he just has to as the text
puts it infer from a pattern of behavior
that the person is of deserves to have
the citizenship taken away nothing like
that's ever been dreamt of and anything
that calls itself a Democratic Society
and it almost went through my suspicion
is they were trying to sneak it through
under cover of the Iraq war
more or less
'we paid route 1 was sneak through but
there was enough resistance so they had
to back off but we'll hear from it again
anyway all of these things whatever they
may be
or don't amount to very much as compared
with what people face in other societies
and it's important to bear in mind that
including for example just to illustrate
just take the society the countries that
are the leaders and received the receive
in US military aid
I'll put aside Israel in Egypt which are
totally separate category but outside of
Israel in Egypt right through the 90s
through the liberal period of the
Clinton period and today the leading
recipients of US military aid were
Turkey and Colombia Turkey because it
was carrying out a murderous
counterinsurgency campaign against it's
miserably repressed Kurdish population
with millions of people driven out of
their homes the countryside devastated
tens of thousands of people killed every
barbaric form of torture you can imagine
I've actually visited some of the
indescribable slums and Istanbul where
refugees are trying to survive and
virtually demolished buildings or in the
caves of walls and towns in southeast of
Turkey actually the latest terrorist
activities in Turkey are traced to that
region so far which is possibly true if
you treat people like that long enough
all kind of awful things happen as the
terrorist atrocities state terror
increased US military aid increased
until the point where Turkey became the
world leader in the year 1997 alone
sent as much military aid to Turkey as
the entire Cold War period combined up
to the onset of the counter insurgency
campaign it's pretty brutal and
furthermore the laws of the country are
harsh and brutal as well but
intellectuals there are very different
from those in the West completely
different
they not only constantly leading writers
journalists publishers artists academics
not only constantly protest the laws but
are engaged in regular sister civil
disobedience about against them and are
facing and sometimes enduring quite
severe punishment State Security courts
don't even have a resemblance to court
in fact the but they do it and they do
it unpretentiously simply daily always
at it that's the kind of thing that
people face in the world the second
leading recipient of US military aid now
the first leading one since 1999 is
Columbia by far the worst human rights
record in the hemisphere by far the
leading recipient of US military aid
under the during Clinton years
correlated by now let's reach the level
of they claim about twenty political
assassinations a day again a huge number
of people well over a million one of the
biggest displaced populations in the
world driven off the land into urban
slums a lot of it's done by chemical
warfare under the guise of drug
eradication which we have absolutely no
right to do in the first place even if
that were the goal and it's not the and
people there are facing really severe
dangers like the danger of political
assassination constant danger but they
keep at it
in priests maca dynamics human rights
activists lawyers journalists they're
there every day doing the same things we
should bear that in mind
when we think about the threats that
people are concerned about here they're
not trivial by any means but by
international standards they don't
amount to much and that's particularly
true in the countries we were
responsible for imposing those
conditions which everyone would know
about if the in fact people he
intellectuals here would be should be
humiliated by the regular behavior of
their counterparts in countries like say
Turkey and Colombia and they would be
humiliated by it if they knew about it
but fortunately we have a free press so
nobody knows about it and that's not
insignificant
well there are other facts that nobody
knows about thanks to the Free Press and
the educated community in general of
which the press is a pretty fair
representation
so everybody's knows George Bush's
famous statement that right after 9/11
that we are going to treat any nation
that harbors terrorists as a terrorist
state meaning we'll bomb and destroy
them oddly Bush was not sent to
Guantanamo for making that statement
because he was calling for the bombing
of the United States clearly and
explicitly there is not the slightest
doubt that the United States harbors
terrorists instantly about two-thirds of
the population agrees with Bush that we
should bomb the United States two-thirds
of the population believes that we
should bomb any country is a right any
country not just the United States as a
result to it
a country that is harboring people who
are planning or executing terrorist
attacks against it
well that means quite a long list of
countries should be setting off bombs in
Washington and New York
according to 2/3 of the population who
are the terrorists or harbored here
begin right at the top the
administration is almost entirely
recycled from the Reagan and Bush one
administration they have the honor to be
the only administration in the world
that has been condemned by the World
Court for international terrorism in
their war against Nicaragua which of
course they dismissed the court judgment
and immediately escalated the war in
fact officially directing their forces
to attack what are called soft what they
called soft targets undefended civilian
targets vetoed a Security Council
resolution affirming the court judgment
then calling on all states to observe
international law and I think that's
sort of the least that's the least of it
that's one case so yes there's
terrorists directing continuing to
direct policy but let's just keep to the
people who the FBI and the Justice
Department call terrorists
just that category are we harboring them
well all over the country in fact most
dramatically though not only in Miami
the scene of recent state terror
activities which you probably know about
I in so it takes a Orlando bus who
according to the FBI and the Justice
Department is responsible for they
identify about 30 terrorist act some of
them quite severe like blowing up an
airliner and killing 73 people the and a
lot of others the ANS was planning to
deport him as a threat to the United
States the Justice Department proved
supported that they said that leaving
him in the
this day in this country is a threat to
the national security of the United
States but they were overruled by George
Bush number one who granted him a
presidential pardon at the request of
Jeb Bush governor of Florida so he's
living happily in Miami which of course
gives and continuing to be involved
quite openly in planning of execution of
terrorist actions which have been going
on for it's now on 245 years in the
early years directed open young directly
run from Washington especially during
the Kennedy administration more recently
run by terrorists who we Harbor here
which surely gives Cuba just as it gives
nicaragua others the right to bomb the
United States according to George Bush
and two-thirds of the population the
terrorists were against Cuba is not at
all trivial it's quite apart from what
it's done to Cubans it almost led to a
nuclear war came very close it was a
major factor behind the missile crisis
Kennedy renewed the terrorist attacks
right after the Missile Crisis correctly
up to the day of his assassination all
of us is pretty serious and it's
continuing and the aftermath is
interesting up till today
I mean humiliating for us but
interesting you should know about it so
a couple of years ago the Cubans decided
to try to infiltrate the terrorist
organizations in Florida to figure out
what they're up to what their plans are
they do carry out regular constant
attacks the and they did they found got
a lot of information the FBI was invited
by the Cuban government to go
they did they send some of their top
agents to the Vanna Thomas I think the
second highest person in the FBI went to
Havana where they were provided with
detailed information about a thousand
pages hours of video tapes and so on on
planning of terrorist actions in Florida
mainly Miami and they thanked the Cubans
for having given them this information
about terrorist acts being organized and
implemented from US territory and they
acted on it they a couple of weeks later
they did jail send people to courts and
finally prison namely the ones who had
infiltrated the terrorist organizations
and they were brought to trial the
government insisted on trying them in
Miami because in Miami is a certainty
that you can't have a fair trial they
look at the jury it was all mad Cuban
nattie Cuban terrorists the prosecution
case was so awful that the judge
instructed the jury to disregard it but
they they sentenced them anyway to
sentenced to life imprisonment three
others the long prison sentences the lot
of the time in solitary confinement the
US government won't allow visas for
their families to visit them so for the
crime of exposing terrorist actions on
US soil they are now in jail many people
know about this know Cuba they certainly
know Latin America everybody knows and
the United States and nobody knows
except those who were involved in the
support committees for the Cuban Five as
they're called again triumph of the
freedom of the press particularly ironic
that case and in this case given the
fuss about terrorism and the
talk about harboring terrorists well we
could go on but instead let's continue
to something else
still keeping to the Free Press the most
serious violations that Churchill
condemned are not carried out on home
soil but rather in Guantanamo that is
really a major atrocity and scandal and
bitterly condemned all over the world
it was condemned very harshly by the
Justice Department's own Inspector
General of course that was dismissed
human rights organizations have report
after report about it I won't go on
because you can easily find it out if
you don't know already as you should
that's extremely serious what's that
about well the most important aspect is
not so much what's happening to the
people detained there without charge
permanently so on that's bad enough but
more serious is another fact namely
what's the United States doing in
Guantanamo Guantanamo is illegally
occupied territory it's part of Cuba
which the United States simply stole
when it conquered Cuba under the guise
of liberation in 1898 technically Cuba
agreed to give the United States a
permanent lease to Guantanamo which is
about as valid as the Vichy government
giving the rights to the Nazis to a
permanent military bases in France when
they were under military occupation but
it's considered quite legitimate here
the grunt the holding on to Guantanamo
means that the US has keeps the best
port in Cuba and prevents any
development in the eastern part of the
island that's part of the effort
economic strangulation of Cuba which has
gone on also for almost 45 years and
that's also been bitterly condemned
every relevant international forum has
condemned that the only reason the World
Trade Organization didn't condemn it is
because the u.s. refused to allow a
European Union case to be heard just
walked out said we're gonna listen to it
so that was the end of that one
everywhere else it's been condemned even
the Organization of American States
which is very it's very careful they
don't want to offend the Mafia Don who
runs the hemisphere it's too dangerous
but in this case they went as far just a
few months ago as refusing to allow the
United States to serve on the Human
Rights Commission of the OAS symbolic of
course but significant as indication of
the anger about both this and other
things like the Cuban Five and more and
that's all over the world the same
except here where nobody knows about it
so virtually nobody here knows again you
can try a poll just two weeks ago I
guess the General Assembly of the United
Nations once again condemned the illegal
economic warfare this time by a vote of
a hundred and seventy nine to three the
three were the United States Israel
which votes reflexively with the United
States and Pacific Island there was an
abstention Morocco Morocco abstained
because although all the come most of
the countries of the world all the
countries of the West condemned
Morocco's illegal occupation of the
Western Sahara
Cuba's the only country that does so in
a principled way so therefore Morocco
abstained in the vote this was barely
mentioned in the United States just as
it is almost always barely mentioned
because we're not supposed to know
