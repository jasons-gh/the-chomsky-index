now we're interviewing professor Noam
Chomsky pressure medicine Department
linguistics and philosophy at MIT one of
the most cited sources in history of
course the among his many famous books
is manufacturing consent recent books
are making the future power systems and
a pamphlet on occupy media presence on C
great to have you on The Young Turks
thank you clearly with again all right
uh well I want to start with this very
simple question is Obama a progressive
is he what a progressive progressive
well the way the term is used I suppose
the answers more or less yes but if so
it's a comment under the word
progressive amazing uh is what used it
would have been called uh uh several
decades ago a moderate Republican kind
of a mainstream centrist with some
concerns for um liberal ideals and
conceptions but not much in the way of
principle or commitment and on some
issues he's pretty reactionary civil
liberties for example that goes the
question of how much American politics
has changed in your lifetime you know
you sees a moderate Republican and
that's a point I often make on The Young
Turks except that actually when I was
growing up of Ronald Reagan had used
drones or any other kind of bombs
execute US citizens abroad without a
trial I imagine that there would have
been a tremendous uproar
so isn't he in some ways much further
right and then that even Republicans
were a couple decades ago and then what
does that tell us about our current
political environment well that's why I
said he's kind of him what used to be a
moderate Republican moderate Republicans
have more or less disappeared
the Republican Party's by overwhelmingly
so extreme that it's hardly a
traditional political party anymore and
the mainstream
rats have become pretty much what used
to be called moderate Republicans a
couple of exceptions around the fringe
you know people like Dennis Kucinich and
a couple of others but it was not there
anymore but basically it's it's we have
two parties one a moderate Republican
party and the other some phenomena
that's so extreme you can hardly call it
a political party and the country the
elite system has more or less shifted
with them I mean it's not uniform I said
I think you're right that if Reagan had
been carrying out a global assassination
campaign there could have been there
might have been a human try but not much
that take a look what Reagan was doing
okay so this morning for example was
reported that in Guatemala a General
General Rios Montt
is being brought the trial that's
everyone's surprise he's being brought
to trial for crimes that he committed in
the early 1980s under Reagan they were
the Guatemalan army under his command
was committing a virtual genocide in the
Guatemalan Highlands among the Mayans
meanwhile Reagan was praising him as a
man a good man a man totally dedicated
democracy's getting a bum rap from the
human rights organizations who accuse
him of various things but basically a
good person we got to keep supporting
him go back and try to find out how much
protest there was there was some there
was a solidarity movement which was
significant and important and courageous
in fact in many ways open new paths and
opposition to state violence it's
actually the first time in the 1980s of
the first time in the history of the
Imperial societies Western Imperial
societies
that people from the Imperial aggressors
the Imperial Society and people from
right in the mainstream you know their
rural Kansas and places like that we're
going to live with the victims of the
attacks in order to try to help them and
even to try to protect them with just a
white face that's never happened before
uh well I was really important and was
plenty of people but by a large protest
over the atrocities that at the end
Guatemala's only one example were pretty
slight I mean for example how many pages
to a small census in your you know study
in your own group of friends or in
wherever you are now and ask them uh can
you name the Latin American
intellectuals Jesuit priests who were
assassinated in 1989 in El Salvador and
the and how were they assassinated just
ask people I mean said it happened in
Czechoslovakia we'd probably had the
clear war what happened in El Salvador
uh was done by us trained forces under
the UH under the Pacific orders of the
High Command close touch of the American
Embassy uh six leading Latin American
intellectuals Jesuit priests had their
brains blown out at the University which
was attacked by the Army will say I know
atraxi that gives you a sense of how
much purpose there was it was real but
limited presence key that goes to the
role of the media in this country
because it was not talked about very
much back then and today President
Obama's signature strikes the double
taps execution of US citizens without a
trial is also not talked about very much
so that leads to two final questions why
does the media not talk about it much
and what is the system that gets them to
all somehow agree without presumably
going into smoke-filled room that there
shall be this as you call it in some
ways and manufactured consent well first
of all notice that the media do report
it so for example the drone killing
which attacked a lackey in Yemen
American citizen which killed him and
also killed another American citizen who
happened to be in the car with him and a
couple of weeks later killed his son
also an American citizen that was
reported attacked looked back at the
report so the New York Times had a
report and the headline was something
like West celebrates death of radical
Muslim cleric okay so we celebrate the
death of this radical cleric by a
targeted assassination which happens to
be a crime and he happens to be an
American citizen as does the guy sitting
next to them so it's not that it's not
reported on the same the same with many
other cases they're kind of reported but
the report is if they're just and right
and then we turn to the next topic now
that's not you can't blame the media for
that they are reflecting I'm talking
about the liberal media incidentally not
Fox News that's a different story
but it's much more interesting to look
at what are called you know whether you
like the term or not what are called the
liberal media the ones who are kind of
at the outer limits of critical
discussion they're much more interesting
do they tell you something about the the
framework of discussion that's imposed
internally without coercion by the
educated sectors of the population and
they those are the beliefs you can't go
beyond these beliefs
well okay there's the way it was the
same with the drone attacks all together
there was um you probably saw the long
article in the new york times by scott
chain and someone else forget probably
based on leaks from the white house who
are proud of it about the drone
assassination campaign long detailed
discussion of how it works he'll then
basic remember that yep yeah well okay
it was it was there wasn't hidden on the
morning obama on his national security
advisor John Brennan former priest get
together and you know read a couple of
chapters of st. and st. Augustine on
just war and then decide who they're
going to kill that day and maybe that
criteria for killing them are this is a
group of men gathered together somewhere
will presume that they're terrorists and
killed them with a drone attack and
they're guilty unless it's proven later
that they were innocent than we concede
that they were innocent but first we
kill them and then it's their you know
the task of survivors to prove that they
were innocent that was described there
was some protest about it mostly because
of what you mentioned before killing
Americans of killing other people didn't
matter that much but there was some
protest and in fact the Eric Holder the
just Farben Secretary was asked whether
this kind of killing doesn't violate our
sacred principles as embodied in the
fifth amendment that no person can a
person is presumed innocence unless
proven guilty as with due process in a
court of law
six and six amendment that goes back to
the Magna Carta 1215 Holder said yeah
this is this is consistent with it they
do have due process because it's
discussed within the executive branch I
mean
you know it King John of England the
back of the 13th century who was
compelled to sign the Magna Carta
charter of liberties he'd be delighted
that due process means we talked about
it among ourselves uh well it's reported
but there's barely any reaction and you
don't expect reaction from the general
public because they probably know about
it and not everybody read said long
stories in The New York Times but
educated people read it and they don't
react I mean very few of them to
actually Scott Scott Jane had an
interesting article afterwards
responding to the limited criticism and
that justified the drone attacks and the
last he ended up his article an
interesting way he said well even if you
think there's something wrong with these
it's a lot better than Dresden after all
uh so in other words the choices are
between you know wiping out some city in
killing tens of thousands of people or a
targeted assassination campaign those
are the choices are there some other
choices you can imagine not you know not
for any time I want to excuse any action
of mine I've now got the line better
than Dresden so it's right yeah
now the wonderful line professor Chomsky
what I'm really curious about though is
how they set the boundaries of what you
call acceptable thought what is the
process by which that happens they seem
to all magically agree but yet there is
no I don't believe there's a
smoke-filled room where they all got
together and said okay wit now these are
the boundaries and is what you're
allowed to say what you're not allowed
to say how does that happen but I think
you know you went to school you went to
a university mmm this is what you heard
all your life from teachers from fellow
students what you saw on the newspapers
and how did they do it well you know you
just get you internalize the doctrines
that are convenient it's it's very easy
to come to believe thing
that it's convenient to believe actually
we all know this from our personal lives
you know everybody's done something that
they know some wasn't really right but
you make up some justification for it's
much easier to live with yourself if you
can find a framework that justifies what
you're doing uh and the people fall into
it pretty naturally those they're not
everyone so some people kind of object
to it you know maybe their kids in
school who object to it them uh but at
college they object to it and then the
professions the objective they're
usually marginalized in some fashion
they're uh anti-american they're
sympathetic to terrorism as a whole
series of the vilifications that you can
use to be their pro-communist the
Marxist you know uh and so they vilified
and marginalized not in the united
states not killed they're not sent to
prison to free country but it's just a
lot easier to conform and to obey and to
repeat and I'm sure he's been through it
your whole life everyone is me too well
uh I've had a notable case of it at
MSNBC where I apparently was challenging
the Democratic Party in establishment
too much and hence you know got moved
out in some way and uh I think that's
it's those subtle Menace that's exactly
right right level pick the people you
were who were there and how today
internalize that you're supposed to
support the Democratic Party well you
know it's just uh easier that way mhm so
then let's go back to the political
system here because you know we talked
about earlier here that the system seems
have shifted even more right so the
Democratic Party has now become the
moderate Republican Party what do you
think is the main underlying reason for
that shift why is that shift even
further right uh happening well I I
don't think it's really I think it has
it's a reflection
of the redesign of the economy since the
1970s in from the 1970s for all kinds of
reasons
there was a real reshaping of the
economy and the design is correct there
were alternative policies these are the
ones that were taken there were two
major elements of it one was a shift
towards financialization you go back to
actually before the 1980s banks there
weren't even many interstate banks
banking was mostly a local phenomenon
banks were what banks are supposed to be
in a state capitalist system they take
your deposits and you know lend them to
somebody who wants to buy a car send his
kid to college start a business or
whatever it may be that's what a bank
was and they operated essentially
locally starting in the 1970s
particularly since the 1980s they began
to grow enormously by the time you get
to the latest crash 2007 the financial
institutions were making about 40% of
corporate profits well at the same time
manufacturing this is related
development manufacturing was moving
towards offshoring you know producing
things in northern Mexico or
southeastern China instead of the United
States it's more profitable if cheaper
labor you have to worry about limited
environmental constraints and so on see
how these two tendencies getting started
and they have consequences the one
consequence was a very sharp
concentration of wealth not a big secret
that since then wealth in the United
States has concentrated an enormous lee
if I now you know it's like an atop
tenth of 1% of the population is
absolutely fabulous wealth well for the
rest of the pop for the majority of the
population
it's been a period of stagnation and or
sometimes decline now people get by by
longing longer working hours people here
work many more hours than in Europe
reason Japan by debt and but you know
benefits are very weak and they've been
weakened even further that's the you
know in the Occupy imagery that's the
99% the 1% a very sharp concentration of
wealth along with the concentration of
wealth leads very quickly to
concentrations political power
I mean it's by now it's no so obvious
you can't even debate it but it's always
been true that money was a major factor
if not the major factor in winning an
election you go back a century and the
great party manager in propagandist Mark
Hanna was asked what's in this a century
ago what's what's important in an
electoral campaign and he said there are
three things the first is money
the second is money and I forgotten what
the third one is that's a century ago by
now it's so dramatic that we hardly have
to talk about it the last election was
just a president was over two billion
dollars it's unheard of well as as a
campaigns are increasingly bought the
political figures become more and more
have to climb deeper and deeper into the
pockets of those who are funding them
and we'll all the talk about small
contributions if you look closely the
funders are highly concentrated on the
very wealthy and among big institutions
and so sure you become beholden to them
and that leads to legislation which
drives the vicious cycle onward
deregulation
no the too-big-to-fail uh legislation
the bailout so which be on under reagan
and you know on and on uh rules
corporate governance were changed to
essentially allow ceos to pick their own
uh the the the the panels that would set
their own salaries that leads to uh
changing business decisions so that you
try to aim for the very high profits in
the next quarter don't worry about what
happens next and and you get a big bonus
and so on and so forth that leads to the
one of the effects of this is what you
describe both parties just right uh they
set part of the you know that's part of
the UH shredding of the democratic
system uh by the increasing power of
extreme wealth I mean now it's to the
point that you take a look at the
political science literature over but
which has some pretty careful and good
studies and one of the things they study
is a intensively is polls you know at it
people's attitudes and it and then you
can compare that with policies and the
figures are pretty striking so for
example a pair of good studies that show
that about seventy percent of the
population have no influence on policy
whatsoever than our what they think
that's the lower 70 percent and Wilson
income as you move up the income wealth
ladder you get a little bit more
influence and at the very top which is a
tiny group you basically what you want
so as the political system gets shredded
wilf gets concentrated uh other policies
change accordingly you get a driven
natural drift of the parties to the
right so you know as you stated you know
we've had this problem money in politics
for over a hundred years but yet FDR for
example managed to represent the will of
the people to some degree in a lot of
issues in a way that when you look back
now at what he said it would be
unimaginable for a politician today to
say those things and and to get
was bills past etcetera so is it the
fact that money in politics has become
instead of sometimes illegal bribery a
legalized form of bribery that has
actually made it more efficient and made
it more powerful in politics today as
opposed to the past and first of all
it's even if you look back at Roosevelt
it's not which things correct I mean
Rosa would be off the spectrum today but
so would Nixon
you know Nixon's views were would be far
too liberal today for the Republican
Party and maybe for the Democratic Party
Eisenhower's even more so that's part of
the drift of the right but that's but
even in Roosevelt's time the best work
on this topic if you really want to look
into it is the work by Tom Ferguson is
very good political scientists done the
major work on the role of money in
politics and he points out that
Roosevelt was supported by a big sector
of an important sector of private
capital and mainly a capital intensive
internationally oriented industry like
say General Electric they supported
Roosevelt or kind of reasons for that
so he he was opposed by the labor
intensive more domestically oriented
capital like you know a little of
manufacturing a little of a
manufacturing or service so on small
businesses but so there was a quest
split within the business class in the
Roosevelt time but nevertheless the
important point is that there were mass
popular movements like the labor
movement was picking up it had been
pretty much crushed by Woodrow Wilson by
the 1920 was almost dead but it picked
up in the 1930s and when you started
getting CI the organizing of the CIO you
know big industrial Union and militant
labor actions and you know
down strikes and things like that then
everybody had to take notice and that
plus other kinds of popular activism
were a major force that Roosevelt could
rely on to pass progressive legislation
well you know since the Second World War
after the moon as it was over there was
a major business offensive launched to
try to destroy the union's to try to
destroy the labor movement they
understand perfectly well that that's
the core part of a Democratic popular
constituency it's not the first time in
American history goes way back but
they've been a major campaign since the
Second World War and my now it's been
pretty successful the labor movement has
been defined labor in private sector
unions unionization is you know like
below 7% it's still there but it's much
weaker and being attacked constantly by
a very class conscious business class
who are able to dominate public
discussion and media discussion let me
take for example the one extremely
striking development just in the last
few months in the state of Michigan
you know labor stronghold from way back
where they were able to pass something
called a right-to-work law well you know
that's that's good propaganda a
right-to-work law is in fact a right to
scrounge law it's not a right to work
law it's a right to get the benefits of
a union without paying union dues
that's what right-to-work means but of
course you describe it that way you're
not going to get any support for it on
the other hand if you call it a
right-to-work law and people are pounded
with propaganda about people should have
a right to work well yeah then you get
you can get even get even a good part of
the labor vote that's the kind of
propaganda that's
propagated by the media kind of
unthinkingly they not on purpose
particularly it's just kind of
internalized like repeating patriotic
propaganda and it's overtime has an
effect big effect and this is very
sophisticated and quite conscious class
war by a highly class conscious business
community the United States has always
had a very class conscious business
community always fighting a bitter class
war and with a lot of success that a lot
of influence now you don't have if you
have the popular movements to oppose it
then it's possible for a Roosevelt to
appear but without them it's going to be
very hard especially because of the it's
magnified by the changes of the last
couple of decades towards the extremely
high concentration of wealth and the
what I described before the kind of
shredding of the political system so
hard Kent and it's not impossible it's
hard work so that leads that critical
question professor Chomsky how do we
fight back how do we win we fight back
the way they did in the 1930s the way
the populist movement did in the 1890s
and the labor movement then finally
defeated but not without a lot of
victories the way the civil rights
movement worked again with significant
victories so certainly not what Martin
Luther King was trying to achieve you
organize you try first you have to
educate like what you're doing on you
know on your activities then you have to
which includes educating yourself and
then you have to try to organize get
people mobilized to do something as say
the Occupy movement did and has done it
might continue to do
and then carry out actions of the kind
that threaten power and require a
response like say CIOs it down stat
strikes and their play of other things
you can do so for example some things
are going on kind of quietly in the
country which have potentially a kind of
you know even revolutionary implications
the growth and development of
cooperatives and work around enterprises
for example it's not on a huge scale but
it's on a significant scale and
spreading and those are what could be
germs of a new society in very different
society undermining capitalist social
and economic relations well all this on
all sorts of fronts there are things
that can be done and sometimes they're
successful I mean for example that you
know the nineteen sixties sixties
activism had quite a civilizing effect
on the country it did evoke tremendous
backlash from the nineteen seventies and
were living in the midst of that
backlash but their private events many
of them were carried forward uh some are
being carried forward right now I say
the advance of gay rights or much too
limited at least some concern about the
environment all of those things are
developing they can go further so
there's no shortage of things to do do
the kinds of tasks that have always been
in front of people who wanted to make a
better world not easy ones but but not
impossible either there's successes in
the past that we can build on if there
is one thing that we could do to get
help from the top so for example of
President Obama came to you said our
professor Chomsky i'ma grant you one
wish
but you tell me what to do on this one
issue and I'll do it what would it be
well well first of all yeah on the
unimaginable circumstances
this could happen right if I told him
what I thought and he even agreed to do
it he would very quickly be shot down by
powerful forces either literally or
not well you know maybe even literally
big you know there was an attempt to a
business attempt to kill Roosevelt was
stopped but I don't mean literally but
though that could happen too but just
beaten back by forces much too powerful
in the president that concentrated
economic power for example but there are
things that really should be done like
there has to be you know vit the human
species if you look at it in a broader
you know from kind of you know imagine
you're on Mars watching what's happening
here you can see the human species
marching toward self-destruction moment
for the first time in history human
history we're now at a point where we
can destroy the possibilities for decent
human existence and in fact we're
marching towards exactly that in part
there's two major issues one of them
have both been around for a long time
one is the threat of nuclear war which
is quite serious in many ways is getting
worse and we know how to deal with it if
the proper measures are taken and I
could be a time I could go through some
of them but they're real the other is
the threat of environmental destruction
you know we're coming to a point where
we may be past the point where it's even
possible to do anything you know we
don't know when but it's getting worse
and very serious and we're not we're
doing very little in fact in many ways
going going backwards
well okay these are these are two
extremely dangerous processes which if
the President had the power and wanted
to do it he could deal with but those
are two big IFS and it would take a lot
of popular
pressure and activism to bring the
country to the point where something
really significant could be done on
these issues all right and I wanted to
ask you on an unrelated note to the
political scenarios and circumstance
that we've been discussing it you're of
course longtime professor at MIT MIT now
involved in this Aaron Swartz saga of
course that's the young man who
committed suicide when MIT pursued
charges against them have you put
thought into the culpability of MIT
there and do you have any thoughts on it
well to be precise
MIT didn't pursue charges against him
MIT was culpable in my opinion but for
what they didn't do
MIT didn't intervene to try to block the
charges but the charges weren't coming
from MIT MIT did provide the police with
the information someone broke into the
computer system but you know that you'd
expect
then came these extremely harsh charges
by the prosecuting attorney here and
what MIT should have done I think is to
have taken some initiative to protest
the severity of the charges and they
didn't and I think they're culpable for
that but it's not quite accurate to say
that they pursued the charges against
him that they kind of left in the hands
of the prosecutor mm-hmm and is there
any action that they should take now
yeah there later
yeah there's in fact the Institute it's
been there's been pressure on the
administration to do something from the
faculty from students from others and
there are several things underway there
plans for teach-ins the president of the
Institute has already made statements
saying we've got to look into what we
did and what we did wrong and think
about it take some steps there's there
is a faculty inquiry underway led by a
good person
so all of these things are in process
and they may lead to some serious
thinking of the issues involved not only
in this particular case but the
underlying issues there's some serious
issues involved so just it let's pretend
if we can that this terrible tragedy
didn't take place okay and just ask what
Aaron Swartz was trying to do he was
trying to liberate a JSTOR JSTOR makes
scholarly articles available to
subscribers mostly universities
University Libraries okay suppose you
liberate JSTOR so everything they have
is now publicly available well you know
in our society that means they go out of
business and that means they don't like
anything available well suppose you take
the next step and say okay let's
liberate the journals and the publishers
let's put all of their stuff in the
public domain well that sounds good but
in our society in the world we live in
that means they're going to go out of
business and nothing will be available
so the end result of these efforts is to
make nothing available well there are
ways around this but you have to break
out of the constraints of our kind of
the pathologies of our society the
obvious way out of this is to have a
creative work subsidized by the general
community which means by the government
that's how creative work ought to be
subsidized the same with music so you
know liberating music from the internet
sounds you know radical except for the
fact that musicians aren't going to be
able to survive if creative work is paid
for is subsidized as part of our social
obligations which means you know as
current current institutions that means
working through the government then you
can deal with these problems but you
have to go at least that four and
were quite concrete proposals do that
just saying well okay let's make
everything free that doesn't deal with
the problem I actually totally agree
with you on that but you know you
mentioned the pathologies of societies
of our society there I want to ask you
one more broad question in that light
now do you think we're ever going to get
to that point where we've gotten beyond
those pathologies in and get to a state
that in your writings you would prefer
do you think we're ever going to get
there or is that human nature and the
greed involved in it too strong and will
always block it well I think we you know
in many ways made a lot of progress
towards getting there not in this
particular domain here there's
regression but a mutual aid mutual
support solidarity concern for others
these are parts of human nature and very
often they've been realized in very
successful ways so like take say the
labor movement the one reason why the
business world and elite elements in
general or so anti labor is that those
are precisely the values that the labor
movement sponsored at its best not at
its worst when it was run by you know
mafia gangsters and so on but at its
best
it was based on the on conceptions of
solidarity and mutual support he's an
international solidarity that's why the
unions are called internationals
now you can talk about all the
limitations and trying to achieve those
objectives but that's what lies behind
it and that's what lies behind the
successes of the labor movement which
we're quite real like the New Deal
legislation but so it's not beyond human
nature it's a part of our capacities in
many respects we've moved forward in
these dimensions and other respects not
sometimes backwards but I don't see any
reason to think that if you look at the
trajectory over the past couple of
centuries
I think it's been basically towards
progress towards expanding the domain
of Rights and justice so I'm gonna take
say it takes a woman's right you know
half the population when this country
was founded time the of the Constitution
women were considered literally
considered to be property a woman was
the property in law a woman was the
property of her father and then of her
husband that's British common law
codified by Blackstone you know what
back at the time the Constitutional
Convention one of the arguments given
against allowing women to vote was that
it was unfair to married men to
unmarried men because a married man
would have two votes his own and his
properties and he couldn't have that and
in fact if you look at American law that
goes up till pretty recently in one form
or another so for example it wasn't
until the 1970s and that's under the
impact of the activist movements was
until the nineteen seventies that women
had a guaranteed right to serve on
federal juries because they were
considered peers okay this all extra by
now think the other things by no means
perfect is plenty wrong but there's been
a very substantial progress slow but
significant and growing and the same has
happened in other respect I mean the
concern of the environment animal rights
gay rights uh uh global justice issues
which really just become uh and them you
know is part of the mainstream activism
at least in the nineteen in the last
decade or so these are all steps forward
that I don't see any reason why they
should stop so improve this regression
yeah so in our country you've been to
the mountaintop and see the glory of the
coming of the Lord
well I think as Martin Luther King put
it they are at the arc is bending
upwards you know slowly and not without
