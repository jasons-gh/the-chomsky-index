welcome to another live broadcast from
the intercept with me Mehdi Hasan I'm
coming to you from my home in the
Washington DC metro area where we're
still locking down and socially
distancing in this time of crisis no
long intros from me today we are where
we are and where we are is pretty bad
more than 35,000 deaths from the virus
here in the US more than four and a half
thousand deaths yesterday alone a
dysfunctional health care system a lack
of mass testing a criminally incompetent
and sociopathic president and a very
weak Democratic opponent to talk about
all of this and more I'm privileged
excited to be joined by a unique guest a
world-renowned voice laureate professor
of linguistics in the Department of
linguistics at the University of Arizona
professor emeritus at MIT where he
taught for more than five decades writer
historian philosopher a dissident voice
Noam Chomsky joins me now from his home
in Arizona known thanks so much for
joining us
pleased to be with you first question
got to ask you this a lot of people I'm
sure are wondering all of your well
wishers around the world how are you how
are you doing right now how's your
health are you and your family safe and
well in this time of crisis you mean it
yeah very easy I'm looking live in a
place where it's American my wife the
area is very strict
we're isolated of course very strictly
but pretty easy for us matter or other
people so we're fine locally then right
outside it's much of lying of course and
you are 91 years old you have lived
through I think 16 presidencies just
give us a sense of how unique this
moment is in your view in US history in
world history the global pandemic the
lockdowns the surging unemployment the
rising death tolls and all of it
presided over by this proto-fascist
carnival barker in the Oval Office
Donald J Trump how does it how does he
compare to anything you've lived through
before
while the this probably compares with
something before I was born the
so-called Spanish flu which according to
Trump's reasoning should be called the
Kansas flu since it originated in Kansas
but during my lifetime when my childhood
memories are Hitler's the spread of
fascism over Europe first article I
remember writing was 1939 about the
inexorable spread of Cataclysm that
surely I remember listening to if
there's no longer rallies over the radio
I couldn't understand the words but the
mood and the crowd reaction was
unmistakable and I have to say I get
memories of that when I listened to it
would watch some of trumps Bible always
today I think you should draw to clusen
analogy that Hitler had an ideology the
Trump's ideology is very simple me okay
well the ideology for Hitler was for the
Nazi Party to control every aspect of
life including the business community
and of course to expand over radio
that's not our situation it's closer to
the opposite the business community
control in the govern but nevertheless
the the memories are hardly suppressed
not as much of the field of the fascist
dictatorship without the institutions
and they may be coming we see them being
torn to shreds they build a as to how
this compares with other moments in
history it's the most dangerous ever the
most dangerous in human history not
because of the pandemic which is bad
enough I will have a very severely cause
but to what is looming rightly high yes
we're
I get over there pandemic we're not
going to get over the melting polar ice
caps and just today this morning there
was a scientific report about where I
live
Alchemist the United States which is
undergoing a mega drought probably
certain it's exacerbated of course by
global warming and that's the kind of
thing that still we're going to be
happening massively it will make
organized human life impossible so so
you mentioned how dangerous this moment
is which obviously makes the election
that's coming up in November perhaps
even more consequential than previous
elections if we are indeed living in the
most dangerous moment in modern human
history and Joe Biden the former vice
president is now the presumptive
Democratic presidential nominee his main
rival Bernie Sanders has suspended his
campaign and earlier this week endorsed
Joe Biden saying it's time we get
together to get rid of Trump from the
White House what did you make of
Bernie's endorsement of Biden
I can't second-guess his choices I think
you can find a reasonable rationale for
it that's important to remember that
right now the issue of greatest urgency
is to get rid of the malignancy in the
White House if we don't do that
everything else pales into
insignificance to keep this for another
four years means racing to the abyss
global warming possibly reaching
irreversible tipping points sharply
increasing the threat of nuclear war
stuffing the judiciary with young the
ultra-right the mostly unqualified
lawyers who will guarantee that anything
to the left of the
to the home can't survive for January
when anima this is this is top priority
perhaps sandwich concluded that the best
way to end this malignancy now is to
join to try to unify the opposition
which was not much to write home about
beside Union but to unify it to try to
overcome at least get us through this
immediate crisis so you've talked very
eloquently there about what's at stake
you summarized some of the issues from a
second term of trump you say it's time
to get rid of the malignancy in the
White House what do you then make of
this very boisterous very on line never
Biden movement that we're seeing from
some on the left from some former Bernie
people including his own former national
press secretary some left-wing social
media stars what do you make of the
never Biden movement it also brings up
some memories the early thirties in
Germany the Communist Party following
the Stalinist line at the time took the
position that everybody but us is a
social fascist so there's no difference
between the Social Democrats and the
Nazis
so therefore not we're not going to join
with the Social Democrats to stop the
Nazi play we know where that play okay
there are many other cases like that and
I think we're seeing the rerun of it so
let's take the position never buy I'm
not gonna vote for Biden
well there is such a thing there's a
thing called arithmetic and debate a lot
of things but not arithmetic failure to
vote for Biden in this election in the
swing state amounts to voting for Trump
takes one vote away from the opposition
same as adding one good drum
so you decide you want to vote for the
destruction of organized human life on
earth for the increase a sharp increase
in the threat of nuclear war for
stuffing the judiciary with young
lawyers will make it impossible to do
anything for the generation and do it
openly okay yeah that's what I want but
that's the meaning of never abide by my
friend and intercept colleague glint my
friend and intercept colleague Glenn
Greenwald who I know is a good friend of
yours too he's among those who makes the
argument that if you just vote for black
Biden because he's the quote-unquote
lesser of two evils you give up any
leverage you have over the candidate
over the Democratic presidential
candidate and the Democrats have taken
the left's votes for granted for far too
long and that's why endorsements and
even votes for the Democratic
presidential candidate should be
withheld do you recognize any logic in
that argument you see do you see where
they're coming from with that argument I
have enormous respect for Glenn close
friends I think nificent work agreed on
this issue at a very abstract level I
agree there are times in the past where
I haven't voted it voted for Republicans
in effect
but this is not one of those times
this time the future of humanity is at
stake this is a unique moment the idea
of trying to change the viewpoint of the
DNC today is meaningless too much is at
stake we just have to get rid of this
malignancy or everything else's as I
said it just pales into the shadows
barely Menton really know what I am
sorry Carly take a look at this idea of
influencing the Democratic Party
leadership the half the population
doesn't vote does that influence them
take a look at what you're snapping in
England sure
you know about eight hundred page report
showing how the the parliamentary Labour
Party team there right New Labour Party
pulled out all the stops to try to
prevent the Corbin from winning they
were even willing to lose elections
indeed but I think the same is true here
in three DNC management would prefer to
lose an election than to lose the party
if Sanders was nominated they basically
lose the party just as if Corbin was
nominated the right wing Blair rights to
lose the party they want them they'd
rather lose you like you're not I want
to come back to the Bernie Sanders
phenomena in a moment which is
definitely worth getting your take on
just sticking with the election itself
and this this kind of argument on the
Left especially the online left you and
I when we spoke in 2016 I remember
speaking to you ahead of the Trump
Clinton faceoff and you made the point
there as well you said look you know you
would point another you'd said this
under Obama - you said the lesser of two
evils and moral philosophy teaches you
to pick the lesser of two evils when I
quote you two people and say look Noam
Chomsky says lesser of two evils even
gnome says it they say a lot of some of
them say you know what no voting for the
lesser of two evils is still voting for
evil it's still evil same thing same in
2016 it was pretty obvious in 2016 that
Trump is for a cause enormous damage now
you know it's even a worse damage than
we thought it's not the lesser of two
this is not the right way to talk about
it should we try to prevent the
devastating catastrophe okay there's one
way to do it in the short term go to the
spending ten minutes going to the voting
booth vocally opposition what pay
attention to
Bernie Sanders is withdrawal speech
said something significant at the end he
said that this campaign is over but the
movement continues now we are trained in
the official ideology to think that
politics is a matter of showing up every
four years and pushing the lever and
then going home okay that's the official
policy doctor and those who are saying
no we had can't vote for the lesser to
lift of evils are trapped by that doctor
we shouldn't be Sanders is correct
what's important is what the movement
continues to do yes we can take off a
few minutes and try to stop the
catastrophe then go back to work okay
that's the importance what do you make
of the argument from Glenn and others
that says a Joe Biden an Iraq war hawk a
Russia hawk like Biden is more likely to
start new Foreign Wars and kill innocent
people than a reelected Trump it's not
an argument that I agree with but I'm
wondering what you make of it it's
pretty much empty speculation Trump is
escalating the threat on the Russian
border right now there are major
maneuvers taking place on the Russian
border both in the Arctic very
provocative there's a trumps tearing to
shreds the arms control agreements the
last remnants of them which have offered
some protection from terminal nuclear
war last one was August destroyed the
INF treaty which was Reagan Gorbachev
treaty the nuclear weapons control
treaty and not only that but immediately
pleaded with the Russians to try to
destroy us by instantly that's carrying
out a missile test which violated the
treaty
anybody can hear that they say okay
you're violating the treaty and from
trying to destroy us we won over yet so
he's asking them to destroy us let's get
new weapons more destructive weapons and
so on right now the Open Skies treaty is
on the chopping block
Eisenhower year that's another tree that
has offered some respite against the
threat of nuclear war the New START
treaty is coming up that's the last one
early next year the Russians have been
Virgin have been virtually pleading with
the United States to negotiate a renewal
an extension of it so far Washington
said we're not interested if that goes
it's the last barrier against nuclear
war this is are we now comparing this
with the possibility that Biden might do
worse I mean first of all I don't think
it's likely and if you compare these two
options I think it's very clear Lillian
but frame it's worth bearing in mind
that with a Biden presidency the
activism of a popular movement will make
a big difference
Trump's probably immune with Biden would
be open to it
right this is exactly what's an empty
vessel there's an opportunity to
influence a Democrat in the West the way
you're talking fluid movement but that's
the thing that listen to Sanders is
message the move must go on so I just
want to just before we I do want to just
we wrap up this this part about voting
that's when I just nail down one thing
and one one of your quotes that always
stands in my mind and you've been
talking about it here today
small differences in a system of great
power can have enormous consequences
you've said I think you've you've out
learned that here even though you're not
a fan of Biden you're making clear even
the small differences between him and
Trump will make a difference so just to
be clear for everyone watching in the
past you have said and you said at the
start of this interview if you live in a
swing state and you
don't vote for Trump you know you're
basically handing him a vote you've said
if you don't live in a swing state it
makes no difference you spent most of
your life living in Massachusetts a
solidly blue democratic state so it did
make a difference right now you live in
Arizona so will you be Arizona Biden's
nine points clear it's a potentially in
swing snake suddenly will you be voting
for Biden in Arizona in November of
course wouldn't hesitate for a second
because the alternative to voting for
Biden is voting for Trump okay and I am
NOT going to vote for the destruction of
organized human society nuclear war
ending the possibility of any going back
influencing Biden if Joe Biden were to
call you up tomorrow and say no I'm
trying to reach out to the left I want
to try to make some overture do
something to get the left on board to
show I'm sincere what would you tell him
to do what one piece of advice might you
give him what what priority should he
say I think what the priorities would be
should it take the basic elements of
Sanders program and to commit himself to
them and then leave it to the popular
movements to keep his feet to the fire
when he gets in okay that's what do you
should do he doesn't need my advice is
not going to ask me but living to take
your advice buddy yeah
I spent my life in assist safe state and
there were times when I voted for
Republicans as they were better like
during the Vietnam War the local
representatives the Republican ones
happened to be the best ones I voted for
them I had them over to my house to talk
to neighbors and that got in touch with
them when there were demonstrations were
the state police were going insane and
Mississippi and stuff like that but
there used to be two parties you know
now there there's one semi party but the
other one who's just going off the rails
since
Engrish at least the Republican Party is
just abandoned any pretense me
parliamentary party if you look at so
that these choices don't exist anymore
do you think do you think I'm just
wondering given given that it's gonna be
a close election that the sad fact is
despite Trump being all the things
you've said he is he still commands 35
to 40 percent of some you know support
in the country he still has a loyal base
ninety percent approval among
Republicans it's gonna be a close race
especially in the swing states there's a
lot of talk about who Biden's vice
presidential candidates should be he
said it's gonna be a woman there's a big
debate should it be a progressive to try
and get lefties who have doubts about
Biden off the fence and behind him do
you think an Elizabeth Warren as his
vice president would keep him at least a
little more honest a little more
progressive because again there are some
one left who say no she would just be
progressive window dressing in a
neoliberal Biden White House the answer
to that is how popular movements will
react if they remain engaged active
forceful bang at the doors they can
achieve something if they're not it
doesn't matter who he elects for vice
president who he chooses replace prison
we have to keep our eyes on that that's
what's happened all through history
that's going to happen a month we
shouldn't be trapped by the propaganda
system which tells us all that matters
is one day in November it matters right
now it happens to matter a lot at a
level that it had never existed before
in history but when it's over the work
continues yes it's not let's take a look
at the that way at what Sanders didn't
win the nomination it's not just the
manipulations of the DNC
you know they didn't like him they hated
him it's like Corbin and so on it's also
something else the left didn't appear he
was Sanders was hoping for a surge in
the popular vote especially among young
people who're very strongly in support
of him didn't happen
wasn't important enough to take a few
minutes to it happened in some places
not others obviously happened in say
California but not in a Michigan
California where it basically didn't
matter that yeah the places where it
mattered didn't happen we should take a
lesson from them take a look at the
afro-american and women's whoo I mean
there isn't detailed data of what it
looks like from the exit polls and other
analyses is that they basically
supported Sanders as policies yes didn't
think that he would be able to put
together a coalition broad enough to get
rid of the malignancy which is the top
priority
well maybe here's a question for you
know during the race up until the South
Carolina primary and especially the eve
of Super Tuesday when the party came
behind Biden a couple of days later
basically the start of March up until
then with Bernie having won a lot of
those first primaries the popular vote
or the number of Delegates in the first
three races leading in the national
polls being called the front-runner what
were you feeling at the time were you
amazed were you surprised that a
self-declared socialist could be leading
in the race for the Democratic
presidential nomination in 2020
surprised and I've always been a little
skeptical about using the term socialist
you don't think Bernie is a socialist
Bernie take a look at his policies but
what are his main policies universal
health care that free higher education
can you think of some other countries
that have universal health care can you
think of any countries that don't have
it
free higher education at practically
every country the ones that do best in
the international competitions Finland
with Germany right south of the border
where I am Mexico poor country high
quality higher education free so what
CERN Sanders is saying let's rise to the
level of
other society is that a radical position
it is it wise to use what in the United
States alone in the world is a scare
word when you advocate those positions
remember this is the United States I
don't know of any other country where
the word socialism is regarded is any
different from Democrat or something
like them the United States is off the
spectrum in this useful the world as it
exists okay given as you be given as you
say the United States is off the
spectrum socialism is a dirty word here
and no socialist has ever come close to
winning the presidency given Bernie
Sanders was leading in the race and was
one of the final two candidates left
after something like two dozen Democrats
originally ran from the nomination that
said that's a positive development for
social and that must have had you
smiling when you saw him leading in the
polls nationally yeah but notice that
the argument among if the date of so for
a correct among major blocks after
Americans women seems yes we support his
policies but he's not going to be able
to create a broad coalition so we can
use the word use the word socialist in
the United States comes back the gulag
you know the Chinese famine and so on
you have to deal I mean I don't think
this was a major issue but if anybody
had asked my opinion that's what it
would have said back instead of three
years you have to try I mean there are
important things to achieve like getting
rid of Trump very important rising to
the level of other societies with a
decent healthcare system with the free
education and other reforms we have to
do that we should you far beyond that
and that can be done by organized active
popular movements we have to be in this
system which were locked into for them
should change but right now we're locked
into it it's a two-party lock indeed you
know given we're locked into it
give him a lot to do one last question
before I let you go give away locked
into it you have the left therefore
running for president via the Democratic
Party Bernie Sanders an independent ran
for the Democratic presidential
nomination in 2016
lost but surprised a lot of people by
doing a lot better than they thought he
would in 2020 he lost again became oh so
close at least made it to the final two
and was leading for the first few
contests where does that leave the left
in the u.s. at least in presidential
politics going forward AOC will turn 35
the age needed to run for president I
think a month before the November 2024
presidential election what is your what
is your prediction or prognostication
for the future of the u.s. left first of
all I don't agree that the Sanders
efforts in 2016 in 22 and you were a
failure I think there were enormous
success we should recognize the success
and a building a good way to build on it
is exactly the way he said in his last
words the movement continues if it does
candidates will emerge and say I'm your
leader if you have a popular movement
that's active now somebody will show
welcome say ultimately maybe they
deserve maybe they don't but you have to
make them live up to what you're
demanding and that can be done but even
with people like Reagan it can't be done
with Trump because he's off the spectrum
to is off something about some of the
world but take Reagan when Reagan
responded to a massive popular movement
calling for end to nuclear weapons they
didn't respond in the way I wanted but
he did respond that's the background for
the INF treaty
okay and that'll be true with any quasi
human
is in office okay
and especially true wealth it happens to
be in the Democratic Party which is
moving to the left and it's popular base
Sanders I have symbolized it but
remember Sanders didn't invent it he
brought together movements that were
around black lives matters that was to
be the Occupy movement the environmental
movements they came under this umbrella
and he inspired a unified poverty
movement which said great successes
that's what will determine what happens
in 2020 if we get that afford another
Trump term and it's not certain we'll
get them literally that is deeply
depressing to hear let me ask you last
question I've asked you this before but
I'll ask again for our audience today
are you an optimist or a pessimist look
we have two choices we can say hopeless
it's all over we can thereby contribute
to assuring that the worst will happen
or we can say accurately there are
opportunities will grasp them whatever
the possibility probability their
success maybe will help make a better
grade that's not a very serious choice I
hope you're right Noam Chomsky thanks so
much for taking time out to join us on
this intercept live broadcast we're
gonna have to leave it there these are
dark times but has known pointed out
it's not a serious choice you have to
kind of fight you have to stay positive
you have to look and see what can be
done through popular movements but right
now unfortunately there's no space for
any popular movements outside we need to
stay indoors I hope you're able to stay
indoors I hope you're staying safe and I
hope you'll join me again for another
live broadcast next week thanks so much
