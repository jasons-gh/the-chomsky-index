well my I mean I've been involved in
this all my life since the 1930s so it's
a big issue for me but what has happened
if you take a look at what's happening
with Israel and Israel in the world it's
pretty dramatic if you go back say 40
years Israel was one of the most admired
countries in the world today it's one of
the most disliked feared the hated
countries in the world and what's
happened what's happened was perfectly
predictable I don't say that in
retrospect I was writing about it in the
early 70s completely predictable Israel
would after the 67 war which you
mentioned was in a position where it
could take several choices one and the
choices were stark and clear in 1971
Egypt the major country in the region
the only military force outside of
Israel Egypt offered Israel a full peace
treaty full priests reading no problems
with one condition withdrawal from
Egyptian territory actually they said
Palestinian territory but they meant
Arab territory but they meant Egyptian
territory the Sinai that was considered
by the Israeli cabinet they rejected it
they wanted to expand into the Sinai and
ever since then Israel has been facing a
choice between expansion or security and
it's selected expansion that's happening
right to the moment and we're
responsible you know in large measure
for that it's largely because of the
unique unilateral u.s. rejection ISM
that this continues that the u.s. is
standing virtually alone and has for
years
in preventing a diplomatic settlement
it's happening right almost of the
president the like a lot of it is vetoes
of Security Council resolutions it's not
all the most recent one was by President
Obama who went so far as to veto a
resolution calling for official US
policy official US policy is there
should be no settlement expansion
actually that's a pretty small issue the
issue is the settlements not there
expansion but the the official policy is
they shouldn't expand that was the UN
resolution Obama vetoed it in fact there
was a much more significant case just a
couple of weeks ago a couple of months
ago the every five years there's a
review the conference of the
non-proliferation treaty that's the most
important arms treaty in the world if
that breaks down we can kiss each other
goodbye it's putting some brake not a
enough of a break but some break on the
development of means of destruction
which will obliterate us very quickly
the non-proliferation treaty is actually
conditioned on an agreement 20 years ago
that there be steps towards establishing
a nuclear weapons free zone in the
Middle East it was because of formal
acceptance of that condition that the
non-proliferation treaty was able to be
extended comes up every five years at
the review conference the u.s. blocks it
Obama just did a couple of months ago
the last meeting and of course it's
always the same reason to protect
Israel's nuclear weapons
so this u.s. rejection ISM is not only
maintaining severe instability in the
region and in my view is
in Israel severely but it's also may
break down the non-proliferation treaty
and open the way to a further expansion
of this you know curse the little
destroy us it's kind of ironic in the
context of all the flurry about Iranian
nuclear programs Iran is in the lead in
trying to establish a nuclear weapons
free zone they are calling for it
constantly their foreign minister just
repeated it again he said okay we made
this nuclear deal now let's go on and
and bring them and take a real step
forward make this one of the region's
free of nuclear weapons in fact all
weapons of mass destruction u.s. blocked
it and the media that cooperated by not
even barely and reporting it practically
not at all well these are things that
are happening all the time we have a
significant share of responsibility all
of us we can influence policy that's
it'll go on like this unless we do and
for Israel having exactly the
consequences you describe it's becoming
a very right-wing very racist
very oppressive all predictable from the
choice forty years ago to choose
expansion over security
