the counterpart to the plutocracy the
super-rich the 1% is diffic Ariat
working in very precarious conditions
including those who part-time comes at
short term contracts migrants that are
quite you seniors without a pension you
see institutional improvements for them
on the horizon those conducting the
class the best thing would be to have a
population which is living and
precarious existence and this is not a
secret incidentally it's very well
understood but it was waging war sort of
one of the clearest statements of it was
by a man who used to be called Saint
Alan before 2007 when the system he
carefully constructed crashed totally
Alan Greenspan
when he was testifying before Congress
late 80s at the time he was late 90s he
was testifying about the marvels of the
terrific economy that he was running he
explained frankly that it was based on
what he called the growing worker
insecurity from the point of economists
that's a very healthy thing because it
workers are insecure
they're not going to ask for benefits
though they're not going to strike
they're not going to call for increasing
wages and you get a more healthy economy
that is an economy which is here to
what's called efficiency it's an
ideological about economic term and
concentration of wealth concentration
our marginalization of the population so
yes it's rowing worker insecurity is
very healthy for the state of the
economy but also the society but if you
had a global precarious say that then
it's possible for the others
there's another term that corresponds to
precariat which should be brought at
that's plutonomy backed around the 2005
I think Citibank produces a manual for
investors
good advice for investors that described
the way the world scene is changing it
said the world has been divided into a
flute economy and everyone else that
everyone else is the carrier so the
economies of small stature concentrated
in the United States the plenty of other
places but now China indeed so that even
the poorest countries in the world or
rich beyond extraordinary so there is a
global economy with forcibly
concentrated then this is the precariat
who live under conditions of insecurity
like say very useful for those who run
the university whether it's the
legislature or the trustees whatever
happens to be they you've had a large
number of attempts doing the word very
low salaries no hope of advancement most
possibility possibility
there's actually much it's very easy to
control would you get higher efficiency
of the ideological sense so the world
was divided into autonomy and precariat
with the world
