separation stops I accept the table
agreements Paris what a gyp we're gonna
focus on this next question you are yes
hi my name is Abraham Riesman I'm a
sophomore at the college question for
both of you but I guess I'll ask
professor Chomsky just because was just
spoke it's sort of funny that we're all
here given that a lot of us have never
been to Israel never been to Palestine
and it's long been one of the sort of
strange paradoxes in world politics that
Americans and people the world over can
get so enraged about either side when
it's a conflict that many of us will
never firsthand experience specifically
how you like to see young people
envisioning the conflict in the future
because a lot of us have a tendency to
internalize it to a degree where it's
not about people anymore on both sides
there are people I know who are ardent
scientists who never go to Israel who
believe in it because they're very
religiously Jewish and all of a sudden
that becomes attached from the realities
on the ground and there are people who
are very Pro Palestinian who are
strongly in favor of social justice and
economic just okay thank you how do you
professor Chomsky well I my feeling is
you should you should approach as an
American and for them as for an American
it is one of the lead issues in the
world you know Israel is able to do
these things to dismantle and destroy
the West Bank to disintegrate the
community because the United States
gives it massive aid unparalleled in
international affairs not only military
and economic but also diplomatic by as I
mentioned for the last 30 years
unilaterally blocking the two-state
settlement which Israel also totally
rejected alone the two of them and as
long as you the American tax there it
goes on supporting this yes it will
continue and it'll lead to exactly what
the ban to stand style
illusion that benveniste and others
described right on the ground and yes so
therefore it's enough of enormous
importance to Americans as for a
solutions pretty straightforward there
they were coming close to a solution at
Taba
until Israel called it off if
negotiations continued leading to
several proposals of which the most
detailed were the Geneva Accords you can
find out what I thought about all of
those in print you can ask mr.
Dershowitz where he supported them in
print the Geneva Accords in December
2002 were accepted by essentially the
whole world Israel rejected them the
u.s. refused even to send a message to
the Geneva meetings but they're still
potentially alive an American citizens
can compel our own government to reverse
its program to accept the international
consensus for the first time and then
we'll be on the way to a solution thank
you I too have written about the Geneva
Accords and in Chapter six of my book
and I generally support many elements of
the Geneva Accords I do not support the
right of return that is the idea that
700,000 or now 4 million Palestinians
can demographically destroy Israel which
is rejected in the Geneva Accords it is
not accepted or rejected it is left for
future negotiations accepted when it's
left open
it's not explicitly precise ok did not
say anything about that because the
Palestinians had already at Camp David
Ana Taba accepted the so-called
pragmatic settlement which would not
affect the demographic character and is
reeal if you want to learn about the
real the serious scholarship like is
simply head of the sponsor I can tell
you that President Clinton told me
directly and personally that what caused
the failure of the can't David Taub
Accords was the refusal of the
Palestinians in our fought
to give up the right of return that was
the sticking point it wasn't Jerusalem
it wasn't borders it was the right of
return well you believe if you believe
that the United States has unilaterally
rejected the two-state solution that's
what we heard from professor Chomsky
that it's the United States that is
rejected a two-state solution when every
modern American president has favored
the 2-step solution I say welcome to
Planet Chomsky here's a simple exercise
you can believe one of two things the
extensive published diplomatic record
which I give you a sample of and you can
find in detail in books of mine and
others or what mr. dersh oh it says he
heard from somebody no diplomatic that's
address let's go check the map sir
your question and read Dennis Ross's
book which contains appendices which
have the diplomatic records what Chomsky
is telling you to do is read the
available record in Esperanto he
constantly tells you to read sources
he knows you can't read because he knows
if you check his sources they are false
that's the reality how many of you are
capable of reading English you don't
find it in the press his answer is it's
not in the press it's part of a
conspiracy to keep it out of the press
thanks very much the documentary record
okay it's in the documentary record
which happens to be quite different from
the same not only important gentlemen I
think it's important that we take
advantage of your expertise there are
many years of wisdom by hearing a couple
more questions please you are hi my name
is tal silverstein and I was campaign
manager and later on special advisor to
Prime Minister Barak and Camp David so I
think I know at least no less than there
on poun talk my friend about
Eponine Kim Devine in Java and in Taba
I'm saying it only because I think that
what mr. professor Chomsky said here a
lot of things are inaccurate
even though do you have a question yes
please no but I think just before the
question because it's very important to
go directly to your question Nick you
know there was a question before that
had about a seven-minute prerequisite
this is it this is an expert who was
there who was an eyewitness I think he
should be permitted to we see this
question with a one minute corner
I don't I don't want to go I don't want
to go into history and I'm a little
excited because you have to understand
one thing I believe we have only one
last opportunity to which piece and this
is this coming party and this coming
direction now my question to you
professor Chomsky and I and I agree with
you is well has done a lot of crazy and
terrible things to Palestinians and
Palestinians done a lot of crazy
terrible things to Israelis but let's
say that this new party after the
election guided by sean is to offer the
palestinians a deal it doesn't matter
which thing a deal that will be accepted
by most Palestinians would you support
this deal even if it doesn't reflect the
views or your ideological views well I'm
glad to see that you I assume you
endorsed run conducts expert expert
knowledge correct I therefore recommend
to all of you who read English that you
read the summary of his review of all of
this in the Journal of the Institute for
of strategic security studies in England
and the for those of you who read Hebrew
like you I presume you read the much
longer study that run kun duck and I
really wrote it's on the Paris Center
website which describes in detail if you
like I can quote it from you as to what
I would because that was nothing pardon
one conduct was not he was one of the
negotiators in the background he was one
of the negotiators in the background
and he was wrong he was from Oslo and
his study he wasn't studying he was one
of the advisors as you know read you're
the one who told me you Evert you agree
with him you say if you think not tell
these human Paris entered a firearm is
director those are the basic Israeli
documents furthermore they're supported
by plenty of others if you want to know
more about Taba you can read the
European Union report accepted by both
sides which says exactly what I said as
to your question yes I already told you
the answer there is a very good solution
on the table it's the solution that they
came close to in Taba before Israel
cancelled it and that was then carried
forward by high-level Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators informally
leading to the Geneva that's why only
it's leading to the December 2002 Geneva
Accords which are right there you can
read them in English you can read them
in Hebrew there on the web
no problem look up the gue show em so
long website that's a pretty good
solution and most Palestinians pardon
even if it wasn't the plan that you
think is optimal oh hi what are you a
list in Ian's because I know most
Israelis probably would vote for it if
most Palestinians would vote for it even
if it's not optimally it's not going to
be optimal let me tell you if most
Palestinians would vote for it would you
accept it is not up to me to accept it
you asked what I thought it what I
thought is what I think is if there's a
very simple creative solution which has
been very close to the international
consensus that I've been supporting for
30 over 30 years and that the United
States and Israel been unilaterally
blocking it was reached by high-level
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators and
the
hasn't been a vote about it I my guess
is that if there was a poll on both
sides majority on both sides would
probably accept it but that's totally
different from the proposals of of the
Sharon Paris party the Kadima or
incidentally of Paris's Labor Party so
far so far he simply endorsed the
expansionist program that breaks up the
West Bank in two Canton's perfect
perfect selective use of shimon peres
you know the Shimon Peres Peace Center I
want to read you a quote from Norm
Tomsky he described Shimon Perez he
described Ronald Reagan at one point as
the semi-divine Reagan as one of the
iconic group of mass murderers from
Hitler to Idi Amin to Perez so on the
one day of the week you find norm
Chomsky describing Perez this great man
of peace as an iconic mass murderer and
on another day he's quoting the
authority of Shimon Perez to make peace
I mean where do you stand on Shimon
Perez is he a man of peace or is he an
iconic mass murderer he is a an iconic
mass murderer and I've given plenty of
evidence for it and he is not a man of
peace what I didn't I did not refer to
Shimon Peres
I referred to the director of the Shimon
Peres
Peace Center not FEMA and Peres you
stick for the argument that Shimon Peres
the man who just joined in to make peace
is an iconic mass murder a woman not a
man of peace I think that says it all
okay want me to run through his record
and I'm noting the fact that as late as
1996 he informed the press that a
Palestinian state will never happen and
in 1997 he said maybe we can ultimately
tolerate it somewhere but we're not
saying where that's not a man of peace
okay thank you
you are my name is Amy Levin I'm a first
year at the Kennedy School my question
is for professor at gerschwitz you had
said that one of the steps in your plan
for peace in the future what's for the
Palestinians to stop their terrorism
activities so my question would be if
you were advising the Israeli government
is there anything about their current
strategy and how they respond to these
terrorism tactics that you would advise
them to change to move forward yes I
would I do not favor
for example house destructions on the
other hand I do think that targeted
killings of ticking bomb terrorists
leaders and terrorists has been quite
effective hundreds perhaps thousands of
terrorist acts have been prevented
including an attempt to blow up a gas
tank outside of Tel Aviv including an
attempt to blow up a port in our code
tens of thousands of Israelis probably
would have been killed but for the
intelligence activities and the
preventive activities of the Israeli
government I have a book coming out in
January called preemption where I set
out all the parameters of where I think
pre-emptive acts are justified where I
think they're not justified I think
Israel gets a C+ or a B minus in its
compliance with human rights in fighting
terrorism which is higher than any
country ever has gotten comparably
facing any external threats and I
challenge in fact anybody in this room
or professor Chomsky to name me any
other country which has faced comparable
threats of terrorism comparable external
threats which has ever had a supreme
court and an Academy which has been more
sensitive to the human rights and civil
rights of those who would destroy it I
say C + D - if I were in Israeli I would
demand much more I would demand that it
get up to the B+ range but surely a much
better standard than the United States
has followed in Iraq
surely a much higher standard than Egypt
or Jordan surely a much higher standard
in France followed when faced with
terrorist threats and at least
comparable
probably better than England when it was
facing terrorist threats from Northern
Ireland so when you make comparisons and
you argue that Israel is the worst human
rights violator in the world which is
the mantra on planet Chomsky one always
has to look at comparable factors in
comparable countries it's not enough to
single out Israel and say Israel isn't
perfect if in fact you wanted to have
divestiture which Chomsky before he
opposed that favored it if you wanted to
have divestiture I'd favor it if you
listed all the countries in the world in
terms of their compliance with human
rights and did divestiture in order of
their compliance you would never even
get to Israel on that list professor
John if you would like to here's an
exercise there's an exercise for the
reader I won't waste your time on it
write a letter to Alan Dershowitz ask
him to cite the source where I described
Israel as the worst human rights
violator in the world or even anything
remotely like it if he had ever if he
would ever look at a word that's written
so he would know for example that I was
supporting the two-state settlement in
the early 70s when he was saying nothing
about it and hasn't until recently he
would also know that I described in
detail how the us-israeli record was
considerably better than the US record
but to answer his challenge there are
certainly cases that are much better
than Israel's record countries that have
suffered far worse terrorism and have
not done anything let's take to the to
take an obvious case Nicaragua
uncontroversial case uncontroversial
because much as you hate the World Court
the World Court ruled that the United
States was carrying out what it called
unlawful use of force against Nicaragua
that's international terrorism in lay
language the case was run by one of your
distinguished colleagues the and ordered
the u.s. to stop the terrorist attacks
and to pay massive reparations the u.s.
rejected the court judgment vetoed
surety Council resolutions supporting
the court judgments went on to
practically destroy the country the
number of people killed in that
terrorist attack translating to per
capita equivalents here it would be
about 2.25 million that's more than the
total in all US Wars ever there were no
targeted assassinations and unlike
Israel Nicaragua didn't even close
newspapers I mean Israel has repeatedly
closed newspapers even in Israel but
mostly in the occupied territories
because it claims that they have some
connection with terrorists the leading
newspaper in Nicaragua right to the end
was owned by a supporter of the u.s.
terrorist army and was openly on its
front pages calling for the overthrow of
the government occasionally they reduced
some of its newsprint they never closed
but that's one case an obvious one take
an even more obvious case Cuba the
United States launched since we're at
the Kennedy Center I can point out that
John F Kennedy launched a major
terrorist attack against Cuba in 1961
right after the failure of the Bay of
Pigs was a very serious terrorist war
plenty of documentation about it from
the best sources you can you like Arthur
Schlesinger Raymond Gard cough all of
you can read that major terrorist warts
going on right to the present based in
Florida
Cuba has not carried out terrorist
actions in the United States so Cuba has
a better human rights record than Israel
non Tomsky on the issue nowhere else in
the worry on the issue of preemption
which is the one you've raised yes you
raised the challenge of a preemption and
I told you that there are many much
better cases no I didn't say that there
let me be very about now Israel and the
United States are both threatening Iran
with destruction well you know
preemption according to Dershowitz would
require that Iran be carrying out
targeted assassinations in Israel in the
United States will hold there we're
gonna go this is going to be our last
question of the
um my name is Laurie crassula I'm a
second year MPP student thank you for
this lively debate what I have a
question kind of directed at both of you
but Professor ardour Chris near book you
said you hope to have a win-win
situation where everyone had to give
something up and what's clear to me
after this debate and just looking at
history that no one's able to come to a
resolution where they're willing to give
up enough to the other person so it
seems to me that the only way to win is
to have everybody lose so I'd like you
to comment on a proposal where maybe if
you all lost we'd actually come out
winning well I think there is a win-win
possible situation Israel has been
giving up much it gave up the Gaza it by
the way offered to give up the Gaza to
Egypt way back in the early 1980s Egypt
wouldn't take it back there was no
international outcry over the occupation
of the Gaza by Egypt for 20 years no was
there any international arc and I'm sure
there must be a long record check
Chomsky's writing he must have in print
large opposition to the occupation of
Gaza by Egypt and strong opposition to
the occupation of the West Bank by
Jordan funny I never came across it in
my research but I'm sure it must be
there if you check at least the
Czechoslovakian version of one of his
writings and and so I I do think there's
a win-win solution the win-win solution
is the one I proposed starting in 1967
and that is Israel make territorial
adjustments necessary to secure its
boundary and Security's consistent with
Palestinian rights no occupation of
Palestinian cities a two-state solution
that is a win-win situation and and let
me tell you why I consider myself pro
palestinian I am pro-israel and pro
palestinian because I favor a viable
healthy economically strong politically
democratic Palestinian state that will
be good for Palestine it will be good
for is
it will be good for the world Israel has
a major stake in the success of
Palestine whereas the Palestinians have
never had a major stake in the success
of Israel and so I see a successful
Palestinian state a viable largely
contiguous Palestinian state as a
win-win situation not only for Israel
and the Palestinians but for the United
States and the rest of the world I only
hope that professor Chomsky can join me
in agreeing that we're not going to get
a perfect solution and let's just
advocate a solution that's acceptable
the question that was asked before was
to me the key question if the
Palestinians accept the solution that
professor Chomsky finds unacceptable
will he use his enormous resources as
the most influential intellectual in the
world today to turn the palestinians
against this peace proposal or will he
lend his great prestige to urging the
palestinians and his academic supporters
all over the world to accept a pragmatic
compromise solution professor Chomsky a
lot turns on you you are a very
important and influential person and
therefore you were to understand your
power and use it in the interests of
peace
just before I asked one of the most
influential intellectuals today to
respond to Laurie's question just to
tell you where we're headed professor
Chomsky will respond then in accordance
with our rules of procedure and decorum
for this evening I will ask professor
Chomsky to offer a two-minute summary
for the evening to be followed by
professor Dershowitz professor Chomsky
well with regard to my opposition to the
jordanian egyptian occupation there is
ample material in print and there has
been for 35 years
ever since i publicly and openly and
very prominently supported the two-state
settlement with mr. Dershowitz says he
now supports I'm glad to hear that I
don't know if the background evidence
let's return and that means of course
opposing jordanian egyptian occupation
let's turn to the question we were asked
to address where do we go from here well
we actually have two fundamental choices
one choice is to support Washington's
continued dedication to the road the
catastrophe that's outlined by Israel's
four former security chiefs namely
watching in silence as Washington funds
the canonization of the West Bank the
breaking of its organic links to
Jerusalem and the disintegration of the
remnants of Palestinian society that
choice adopts the advice of Moshe Dayan
to his cabinet colleagues in the early
70s
Diane was in charge of the occupation he
advised them that we must tell the
Palestinians that we have no solution
you shall continue to live like dogs and
whoever wishes may leave that's the
solution that is now being implemented
don't take my word for it go check the
sources I cited very easy all English
there's an alternative the alternative
to is to return to the spirit of the one
break in us Israeli rejection ISM that
is the weak
in Taba in January 2001 before Israel
called it off and to take seriously the
follow-up proposals from high-level
negotiators on both sides of which the
Geneva Accords are the most detailed
there is overwhelming international
support for taking them as the basis for
a political settlement it does come
close to the long-standing international
consensus that the United States and
Israel have barred and that I've
personally been supporting for the last
over 30 years that's the road away from
catastrophe towards an end to violence
and towards eventual reconciliation
either choice is within our reach from
that point on it's up to us the best
adversely we do seem to have a
remarkable point of agreement I think we
both do agree that the proposals made at
Taba do provide a useful basis for a
peace process now Taba didn't end
because Israel left Taba ended because
our fought rejected Camp David thereby
causing the election of Sharon over
Barak there was no government
essentially that could carry out the
table of proposals which were favored by
a very very large number of Israelis
that's why Prince Bandar are said to
Arafah at Camp David
Anna Taba if you reject the proposals at
Camp David you're gonna get your own
instead of Barack you're never ever
gonna get a better deal thankfully he
was wrong Sharon emerged as a man of
courage and a man of vision and I myself
although I never did support her own in
the past strongly support the efforts
made by Sharon in Paris a great great
man of peace a man who has vision a man
who imagines the future a man who can
bring about peace in the world and peace
in the Middle East and I think the
prospects for a peace based on the table
of proposals are quite realistic I think
that if this party wins the election and
invites the Palestinians to the table
and the Palestinians don't again miss an
opportunity to miss an opportunity there
will be a real prospect for negotiation
a real prospect for a peace based on
pragmatism one final word about the
sources please the other area where
professor Chomsky and I agree check his
sources take him at his word go back
tonight and Google and read the sources
read them in English read them and
whatever language you can and then email
us both as to what the sources show and
finally in a constructive and positive
way
I urge you imagine peace imagine the
peace dividend that will come to the
world if finally a pragmatic solution
based on peace comes to the Palestinian
people and the Israeli people I'm hoping
for Shalom for Salaam and for peace
thank you thank you
just before we conclude and I thank our
speakers I want to share with you in a
very few seconds what I have heard
tonight standing between these two
scholars the first the first is that in
looking around this room it is clear to
me that being members of the
international community to which we all
belong whether we have been to Israel or
Palestine or to other conflict arenas or
not that people can care deeply about
people in conflict and understand that
there needs to be a way through secondly
as we heard from some of our questioners
the parties themselves Israelis and
Palestinians seem to be post
disengagement and then there are two
election processes quickly approaching
across roads perhaps a tipping point
where some form of acceptable solution
that will involve some part of loss of
the dream - both sides will make
pragmatism rain
the third thing in which I've been
honored to be a part of this discussion
tonight is that a khadeem and the
scholarly community matter in this
discussion I have read a great deal of
the works of both professors Chomsky and
Dershowitz and in both of these readings
whether you agree with points of view
challenge their sources is beside the
point
what you have been treated to tonight is
to individuals who have spent a lifetime
thinking there
very hard about some of the most
difficult problems in international
public policy and on behalf of this
group here tonight to my scholarly
colleagues I am eternally grateful thank
you for coming
