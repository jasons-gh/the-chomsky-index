we have a landmark show for you today
our guest for the whole hour is
pioneering linguist and internationally
recognized public intellectual Noam
Chomsky this is the first time that
Ralph and professor Chomsky these two
titans of progressive thought and
activism have had a public conversation
and for that reason we're gonna get
right to it
for most of our listeners he scarcely
needs an introduction but we're going to
give him one anyway
David Noam Chomsky is a political
theorist and activist and professor of
linguistics at MIT
along with his pioneering work in
linguistics professor Chomsky is a
critic of both American foreign policy
and global capitalism is one of the most
frequently cited scholars in history and
has authored more than 100 books on
topics such as linguistics war politics
and mass media including manufacturing
consent along with Edward Herrmann which
was also made into a documentary film of
the same name
his most recent works are a collection
of commentary on various socio-political
topics in titled because we say so and
is updated critique of American Empire
entitled who rules the world
welcome to the Ralph Nader radio hour
professor Noam Chomsky very pleased to
be with you yes welcome indeed you heard
Steve mention how often you're cited as
a public intellectual around the world
you go to auditoriums around the country
and they're jammed standing-room-only
from California to the East Coast you've
written dozens and dozens of books
you're one of the leading linguists of
our generation and I've always viewed
you as a person who confronts propaganda
with fact and what's interesting in my
questions there I'm about to ask is that
when propaganda is institutionalized it
systematically obstructs the generation
and distribution of factual knowledge
historical knowledge contemporary events
so let me ask you a few quick questions
here professor Chomsky have you ever
been invited to testify before the
Congress yes and 1917 Senate
Fulbright who was the head of Erie
McCullough of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee was extremely
disillusioned with the war in Vietnam
with the a lot of government activities
and so on and he was being sidelined and
despite the fact that he'd been a
influential and distinguished figure
sideline because of his critical
attitude so he turned his Senate Foreign
Relations Committee into a kind of a
seminar and I was one of the people
invited to testify have you been invited
since 1970 not that I can recall
I'm enough occasionally talk to people
in Congress but never never invited to a
session how often have you been on the
op-ed pages of the New York Times I can
recall one in 1985 or sbrefa around then
if they actually invited me which
surprised me to write something about
the maybe probably 2005 to right about
the Israeli what's called the separation
wall actually an annexation wall that
runs through the West Bank and breaking
apart the Palestinian communities and so
on condemned as illegal by the world
court and so on and they did ask me to
write about that they may have run I
think they ran an excerpt from my
testimony at the Fulbright committee
back on in T 1970 which is 46 years ago
the sunday talk shows NBC Meet the Press
ABC CBS CNN every week they have guests
have you ever been on those shows they
cover topics that you've written
intensively on no I've never been
invited okay how about NPR and PBS
partially taxpayer support it's supposed
to be more free thinking and more
tolerant have you been on NPR's programs
or PBS such as Charlie Rose or I said
I'm Charlie Rose that two or three times
and in the Boston I'm in Boston there's
a Boston outlet for NPR based on Boston
University and they have a discussion
program in the morning 10 o'clock in the
morning Tom Ashbrook I've been on that a
couple of times I've had some funny
areas whistle I could tell you if you
want but prettier mine well for example
what they used to have a program in
their primetime news program all things
considered some years ago at 5:25 they
had a maybe once a week or so a
five-minute discussion with someone who
had written a new book and there's a lot
of pressure and especially around Boston
on the statistics Boston base to have
the station allow me to be on and
they're pretty resistant but they once
agree there's a book of mine I think it
was a book called necessary allusions
possible that propaganda and I did have
the interview recorded with Robert
Siegel five o'clock they announced that
it would be played at 5:25 I got a call
from the publisher telling me it's going
to be played I should tune in I never
listened
so I tuned in and met 5:25 there were
there was five minutes of music around
five thirty five thirty one I started
getting phone calls from around the
country asking what happened to the
piece it was supposed to be on and on it
said I didn't know then got a call from
the station manager in Washington who
told me that she'd been getting calls
and she didn't understand it because it
was listed so she didn't understand what
happened later she called back saying
kind of embarrassed saying that some top
bigwig on the system had heard of the
announcement at five o'clock and had
ordered it cancelled and she was pretty
upset because it was over her head sort
of went on from here there was one other
case that was also quite amusing they
during the first Gulf War in 1990 the
coverage was just a uniform like a
totalitarian state one position
constantly mentioned over and over how
horrible they are how wonderful we are
the usual thing and there was a little
embarrassment that nothing else was
being heard so in fact for the first
time ever I was invited for a few
minutes on the
so as you look at school what hour did
you our yeah in fact there was a lot to
say but then there was pressure again on
NPR to allow made it beyond for two and
a half minutes to say something to break
hundred percent uniformity and they did
agree but they recorded an advance and
then told me it's going to have to be
exactly two minutes and thirty seconds
so I carefully planned that and first
time I read it it was two minutes and 36
seconds so we had to redo it that was
two minutes and thirty seconds and then
they they made sure to vet it so I would
say exactly what was written that
wouldn't go off that textbook it was
quite funny in the station because the
engineers in the back room were laughing
hysterically they understood what was
happening but I did get on for two
minutes and thirty seconds you're
hearing listeners what censorship is
like in our country and that any one of
the former Bush Cheney war mongers like
Paul Wolfowitz and John Bolton and
others have gotten far more press after
they've left federal positions in the
New York Times The Wall Street Journal
the Washington Post op-ed pages they've
been on television public television NPR
and they have a record of false
statements they have record of deception
they have record of pursuing policies
that are illegal under our Constitution
under international law and under
federal statutes such as the criminal
invasion of Iraq and other adventures
around the world now a society that
operates in a way where propaganda is
not only emanating from the major media
but it gets into our schools the kind of
courses are taught the content of the
history is a society that's not going to
be mobilized for its own survival much
less the survival of other countries
whose dictators we have for decades
supported to oppress their people
now our listeners are fairly familiar
professor
with your writings I want to take it to
the next step
we have Empire here we have both parties
pursuing attacks Wars subversions drones
special forces supporting dividing
sectarian conflicts all over parts of
Asia and Africa and the question I want
to ask you is what do you think can
start turning this around in terms of a
the citizenry the institutional
turnarounds maybe the Congress see
electoral challenges from third parties
or insurgent primary challenges like
Bernie Sanders if you have to describe a
scenario of how we can turn around from
Empire from imperialism from colonialism
from the military industrial complex
having a vested interest in war rather
than peace what scenario would you urge
on the public or what scenario do you
see well I think the crucial word that
you mentioned was citizenry that
underlies all of the options that you
mentioned electoral third parties
lobbying demonstrations activism and I
can't have an effect it's happened over
time a lot of things wrong with the
country we agree on all of that but
there has been progress over the years
in some ways it's a more civilised
country than it was say 50 years ago
actually in many respects like women's
rights and gay rights even opposition to
aggression the public activism did
manage to there's pretty good reason to
believe that the mass demonstrations in
1969 about the Indochina war may have
actually averted a nuclear attack it's
not certain but there's evidence to that
effect they certainly did lead to a
retrenchment what happened after that
was horrible enough that it could have
been a lot worse but let's move on a
couple of years in the early 1980s when
Reagan came in his administration tried
to
follow and almost exactly the playbook
of the Kennedy administration in the
early 1960s when they escalated the war
in Vietnam
almost point-by-point but there's a big
difference when Kennedy did it there was
no reaction and they went on to build up
a huge war when the Reagan
administration started there was
immediately a major public reaction and
protests all over the place
popular groups church groups activist
groups and they backed off in fact
within a couple of weeks exposures
started to appear in the mainstream
press Wall Street Journal of the
falsehoods and the white papers that
they produced and they backed off what
happened again what happened and sent
they were trying to launch a major war
in Central America well what actually
happened was awful enough but it wasn't
as bad as what happened in Indochina in
the 1960s and it could have been let's
go on to the Iraq war a lot of people
claim believe I think falsely that the
protests had no impact I don't agree
with it this is the first war in
imperialist history that was massively
protested before it was officially
launched and I think it had an effect
again what happened was horrible enough
but it was nothing like what could have
been done and in fact was done in
Indochina in the 1960s so again I think
not the best consequence we would like
by any means but there is an impact and
I think it continues and the war the
citizenry becomes active and engaged in
all of the dimensions that you mentioned
from protests to electoral politics and
on the more that we can see significant
changes in the country yes
once you describe how nuclear arms
control treaties came about from citizen
demonstrations that seems to be another
good example doesn't it under Reagan and
else yes very much so in the early
eighties there was maybe the biggest
mobilization
history opposing the Reaganite plans to
develop to expand nuclear arms actually
we know now things that weren't known
then they're pretty scary in fact new
information has just recently come out
in the early 80s the Reagan
administration was carrying out military
operation to probe Russian defenses was
called April Archer
they were simulating an attack on the
Soviet Union even simulating a nuclear
attack this was a very tense moment
Reagan was talking about a huge military
buildup they had placed Pershing two
missiles and Western Europe even in
Germany with a few minutes flight time
to Russia there was a lot of tension
when the Russian archives began to be
Declassified some years ago it was
discovered that not to surprisingly they
took it very seriously just recently
last few months in fact the National
Security Archives in Georgetown has
succeeded in obtaining Declassified
information from the United States about
how Washington perceived it and we now
know that Washington recognized right
off that we were on the verge of war and
it came very close could go into the
details but right in the midst of this
there was an immense public opposition
demonstrations of their activism and the
Reagan administration did back off
not enough again but significantly and
that led to some steps to reduce the
terrifying threat of nuclear weapons and
if you want to know how people should
understand how terrifying it is so for
example right in the midst of able
Archer there was at one point an
indication from US intelligence that the
Russians were mobilizing and planning an
attack protocol is for the officer who
receives this Leonard Carruth his name
was in a general to transfer the
information to fire authorities he
decided not to the way the documents
read he did nothing
that may have saved us about a year
later on the Russian side the Russian
automated response systems did detect
that what seemed to be a massive u.s.
nuclear attack the information went to
again an officer a stanislav petrov its
name was protocol required that he
transmitted to higher authorities who
might have launched a retaliatory strike
he decided not to that's why we're still
around things like that have been
happening all too often quite apart from
recklessness on the part of political
leaders it's kind of a miracle if you
look at the record that we've escaped
the nuclear age and survived and it's
getting more serious there are mounting
threats of nuclear war very respected
mainstream and nuclear analysts
strategic analysts people like William
Perry node of former defense secretary
have recently argued that the threat of
nuclear war today is greater than it was
during the Cold War and he's not alone
The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists runs
what they call a Doomsday Clock
intense 1947 midnight on the Doomsday
Clock means terminal disaster and they
keep moving to have a group of experts
who moves with a minute hand of the
clock several editions from midnight in
the midst of Abel Archer they moved at
three minutes to midnight the two years
ago they moved it forward two minutes up
to three minutes to midnight the highest
it's been since the war scares of the
early eighties and what's interesting is
the mass demonstrations under Reagan had
some well-dressed Republicans in them in
New York and Washington and I know from
the sources inside the Reagan
administration that they took serious
note at that which was a significant
effort along with groups like sane to
get Reagan to the bargaining table or a
negotiating table with this counterpart
in the Soviet Union but there are no
mass demonstrations
the race to build more nuclear weapons
accidental release from either side
proliferation here we are in an Internet
age when it's easy to contact all kinds
of people and say let's go in March and
let's go and rally and it's not
happening do you read that as a
increasing phenomena that we call apathy
or enemy in our society well I mean if
you look back over the record I think
there's probably more activism today
than there has been for a long time I
mean take the Indochina Wars again the
war really began to escalate in 1961-62
now that's when Kennedy ordered the US
Air Force to start bombing South Vietnam
South Vietnam of course the main target
of the attack they did it under South
Vietnamese markings but didn't blow
anyone he authorized users napalm
chemical warfare to destroy crops and
livestock programs to drive ultimately
millions of people into what amounted to
concentration camps and urban slums all
this was going on in the early 60s and
as you remember very well there was no
protest it was almost impossible to get
anyone to even listen to it a protest
didn't really take off until about 1967
let him really substantial but by that
time South Vietnam had practically been
destroyed
hundreds of thousands troops had been
around Beijing around the country there
were saturation bombing both heavily
sell various by b-52s and virtually very
little protest finally it took off well
you know it's unfortunate but it does
take time now let's come to the present
we're in the midst of another electoral
extravaganza every four years there are
critical issues absolutely critical
issues the most significant questions
that have ever arisen in the history of
the human species questions literally of
survival the one is nuclear war
others climate change simply asked how
often do these issues come up in the
political discussions or in the
commentary about the political issue
what you discusses you know vulgarities
trivialities these things simply don't
arise so which of the public think
they're deluge dwith commentary on an
ongoing political actually extravaganza
supposed to be serious it's pretty hard
to take it seriously and the two major
issues in human history
barely receive a mention so people are
confused they don't know effect many in
the United States so unfortunately there
are other problems we the United States
says the public is to some extent
concerned about these issues not
anywhere near as much as it should be
and in fact less than in other countries
and there many reasons for this which
have to do with all kinds of American
exceptionalism if you like but the most
remarkable fact astonishing fact even
more amazing that it's not reported is
that one of the two political parties
republican party is literally dedicated
to destruction of organized life on
earth that may sound extreme but think
about it for a minute in the primaries
every single candidate denied that
global warming is taking place there was
one exception disposed moderate Tom
Kasich who said yes it's taking place
but let's not do anything about it which
is arguably even worse so you have a
hundred percent rejection of
overwhelming scientific evidence more
comes out every day that we're facing
real disaster and the candidate who is
actually the winning candidate Donald
Trump his position is it's not happening
we should use more fossil fuels more
coal plants eliminate regulations
refused to tear up the Paris
negotiations which were at least
something which is too
support other developing countries that
are trying to move sustainable energy
and in general just race to the
precipice as quickly as possible
two things are utterly amazing one is
that it's happening the second is this
not mentioned no it's almost impossible
to find words yet well this gets us back
to decision sory again and I've often
said if 1% of the citizens in
congressional districts organized around
a whole variety of issues some of which
you've just mentioned and they're
supported by a reasonable base of public
opinion a majority public opinion that
they could turn Congress around
regardless of the lobbyists on the other
side so you see Congress as pathetic now
it's gridlocked and all that but under
our Constitution it's the most
accessible and the most powerful
instrument of democratic society that we
have in our country
why aren't commentators focusing more on
laser-beam mobilization in each
congressional district it doesn't have
to be that many people if they reflects
what Abraham Lincoln called was the
public sentiment on 535 members of
Congress Warren Buffett once said there
are only 535 members of Congress were
300 million people why can't we control
it well because 1500 or so corporations
have been able to maneuver it in other
directions but do you find an inadequate
attention to focus on Congress which has
huge leverage the war declaring power
doesn't use and gives to the white house
the Appropriations powers the tax bar is
the investigative power you name it why
in progressive circles is there's so
much in attention to mobilizing in each
congressional district around a major
agenda to deal with Ollie's momentum
toward disaster and reverse them yeah
you're absolutely right and in fact one
encouraging sign which may have an
impact is one of the outgrowth of the
rather really quite impressive sanders
mobilization
and then we the brandman Congress group
which is trying to do just what you
suggested to work at the local level to
begin to change the nature first of all
of state legislators which is not a
small point that has a long term impact
but also Congress and to hold their feet
to the fire and it could be done I mean
they say suppose Clinton gets elected
and there are elements of her program
which can be the basis for intensive
popular mobilization so take say the
nuclear issue which we were just
discussing three so a couple days ago a
leaked discussion of with Clinton and a
couple of strategic analysts and others
in which he did say I know if she means
it or not but she said that we have to
reconsider Obama's trillion dollar
modernization program of nuclear weapons
and rather crucially she came out
against the most dangerous element of
this modernization program a new nuclear
missile which is quite dangerous because
it can be scaled down to battlefield use
of tactical nuclear weapons which is a
temptation for any commander in a time
of conflict and could easily escalate
the terminal nuclear war well does she
mean it you know who knows so
politicians is what people want to hear
but popular mobilization could hold her
feet to the fire say yes we have to do
this and more and better do it and the
same is true on other aspects of the
formal Democratic program so calling for
a public option in the health system and
the health system as if court said total
international scandal you views amazing
work on this over the years and a
majority of the population for a long
time today as will prefers to move to it
system here it's called single-payer
something like Medicare for all the kind
of system that other developed side is
with hafla per capita costs that we have
and mostly better outcomes that's a
majority of the population even with
virtually no articulate support well
okay the Democratic program does call
for the public option good hold their
feet to the fire with mass mobilization
and maybe push it through the same with
free tuition same with the community
health centers one of the elements of
the program is a shift to solar power to
renewable energy for all households
within four years fine make them do it
and the way to do it is mass popular
activism and I might add a lot of
left-right support for these the forces
of plutocracy always like to divide and
rule we're talking with professor
Chomsky of MIT and they've done this for
over 2,000 years and so they focus on
polarization and how divided left-right
are blue state red state certainly she
certainly reproductive rights and gun
control and school prayer but on many
transformational issues some of which
you've just mentioned this left-right
support for higher minimum wage is
left-right support for full Medicare for
all there's left-right support for more
budgets to crack down on corporate crime
fraud and abuse of taxpayers consumers
and workers there's more left-right
support for a lot of consumer protection
measures you know conservative families
bleed too they want their children to
drink clean water and eat safe food and
breathe clean air so this is what I
would add to your list professor Chomsky
a major national public works program to
repair and upgrade America's public
facilities roads bridges public transit
public buildings libraries community
health clinics schools are in a state of
disrepair and deferred maintenance and
if the people could mobilize to cut that
bloated military budget and require the
Pentagon to obey federal law which has
been violating since 1992 by not
presenting an audited budget to the
Government Accountability Office the GAO
of Congress there could be a huge
support base on the
look at in every community you have
Labor Chamber of Commerce professionals
they all want to repair their community
that's a huge left right support that
can become redirecting the grotesque
distortion of public budgets into
military squandering and what precise
are warned about the military-industrial
complex devouring the country eventually
all empires devour their countries of
course so that's another one let me just
move on to a big area of lawlessness
we're a country dedicated to the rule of
law and yet there is such massive
corporate crime massive official
lawlessness whether it's Wall Street
whether it's Wells Fargo more recently
whether it's military and foreign
practices you can make a list of
measures that are illegal under federal
law state law under our Constitution we
don't declare war from Congress anymore
the president decides who he wants to
destroy as the saying goes as prosecutor
judge jury and executioner abroad you've
talked to Harvard Law School students
and faculty from time to time as my alma
mater in 2011 John Brennan asked to
speak to Harvard Law School he was the
national security advisor to Barack
Obama in the White House now he's head
of the CIA and he delivered a speech
almost an hour which is on line if you
go to Harvard Law School which asserted
again and again that everything a Barack
Obama and his administration was doing
overseas in terms of fighting terrorism
was constitutional legal and in accord
with international law for which he got
a powerful ovation by the assembled
people including the Dean of the law
school and other high officials for
which it was really a command
performance to show up a few months
later along with Bruce Fein I went up
there to try to rebut him and there were
no administration officials no the
professor's no Dean's of the law school
in attendance
now when the primary laws
one can say doesn't care about
lawlessness and it's just lawlessness
everywhere fine print contract
lawlessness that defrauds us and takes
away our rights to go to court
lawlessness in terms of billing fraud
there's a professor at Harvard who it
says that in the health care area alone
computerized billing fraud as at a
minimal is over three hundred billion a
year that's just in the health care area
how do you read these law schools and I
know that you come at it from a non
legal background but you certainly
studied enough about illegal activities
give me your views on the state of the
law schools today and the propaganda
that seems to insinuate itself in their
curriculum
well I remember first of all in the law
let's say Harvard Law School where I
have given talks pretty regularly and of
course as you say the faculty and
administrators don't show up but quite a
few students too and there is a pretty
active and quite effective human civil
rights group among Harvard Law School
students which is working effectively
even doing the research and support for
initiatives that come out of
organizations like the Center for
Constitutional Law and so on and those
people are a base for trying to change
the law schools
it's like popular mobilization within
the law schools of the students and the
few supportive faculty there are some
simply have to try to take over their
own institutions and turn them into
legitimate institutions and it can be
done can I give you an example from my
own University MIT down the street in
the late 60s were MIT at that time was
practically a hundred percent funded by
the Pentagon and not for war work
incidentally now that's us Industrial
Policy used the Pentagon funding as a
way to create the high-tech economy of
the future computers internet you know
micro electronics and so on and so forth
but in the late sixties as
small number of students maybe about a
dozen succeeded in mobilizing a student
opinion to the point where there were
large-scale protests and demonstrations
pressure on the administration about P
there are a couple of military labs that
were run by MIT folks on that the
pressure on to deal with the question of
the effect of technology and society
this is the major engineering school
science engineering school in the world
and the question of the impact of
technology on society had been barely
discussed but it became a huge issue one
event organised by students was a
sanctuary for a deserter Marine deserter
you recall in those days mostly a
churches some group would stay with
somebody who was deserting in protest
against the war until the FBI came and
picked him up
well this was at a university first time
I think and a whole campus was almost
closed for two weeks at the Student
Center where this was going on there
were 24-hour seminars theater
discussions all kinds of activities of
the 60s variety it just simply energized
the student body to the point where a
couple of weeks later the administration
did call off classes for a day and
devoted that day to the impact of
technology on society a lot of couple of
very good organizations sort of grew out
of this like Union of Concerned
Scientists but the point is that it
simply changed the character of the
institution as our laughing ring started
with a very few small number of students
as you say yeah maybe it doesn't
literally they formed a small group
called the Rosa Luxemburg organization
I doubt for that more than a dozen
members but they were very effective the
most effective is Mike Albert has gone
on to do many other things they really
did eat in particular but other student
really did wonderful work it shows that
you can change things
takes effort activism energy but there
are real possibilities and that's right
at the heart of the North Area
industrial complex
indeed the Lincoln labs for example at
MIT I want to move on and just ask you
from a different angle the situation in
Iraq and Afghanistan we know how those
countries were blown apart obviously
after 9/11 but how do you explain to the
American people that less than 30,000
Taliban fighters in Afghanistan and less
than 20,000 Isis fighters in Iraq and
Syria are holding down a massively
greater numbers of soldiers backed by
the most powerful military in the world
with air artillery mechanized equipment
naval missiles
you name it out of these anti us
fighters continue to dominate and in
some areas actually advance such as the
Taliban against our allies there in
Kabul and Baghdad backed by military
might
when these fighters are pretty brutal to
the local community themselves well I
mean take Isis in Iraq and what happened
when Isis exploded in Iraq was simply
from a military point of view almost
unbelievable there's a huge Iraqi army
hundreds thousands of people heavily
armed backed by the United States a
small number of guerrillas as call a
thousand of them simply drove out the
entire army what happened was almost
indescribable
the generals fled and after them the
soldiers fled leaving their equipment
behind what it revealed was the total
rot at the center of the society that
the US had been trying to construct and
I think something similar is true in the
case of Afghanistan foreign imperial
power which comes in and batters a place
with a sledgehammer it's not going to be
likely to develop a functioning society
which will be
organized committed to development and
progress and will easily fight off small
guerrilla groups they're just they're
going to collapse from inside I mean
even in you look at Iraq Basara which is
quite far from the fighting and it could
be you know something like Dubai it's a
middle of a big oil-producing region
access to the sea cut off in conflict
not much sectarian violence it is so
utterly enmeshed in corruption brutality
disorganization that the place is
falling apart
an outside imperial power relying
primarily on force is not going to be
able to establish functioning societies
the same thing seems to be happening in
Libya after Hillary Clinton was so
strong at the White House overcoming
Secretary of State of Defense gates
opposition to toppling the Libyan regime
now just again a few thousand
isis-affiliated fighters and other
sectarian struggles spilling over into
many African countries the point here is
that people who don't like what we're
doing around the world are learning
valuable lessons of how to keep us
occupied and throwing us into greater
Quagmire's
with poorly trained fighters but very
determined with Kalashnikovs and suicide
belts against the most powerful
mechanised modern army in the world
equipping the allies on our side in
those countries that is a very
destabilizing message in the future
wouldn't you say and in fact as a number
of analysts serious analysts have
pointed out Scott a Turin wooden pole
others it's almost as if we've been
following the al-qaeda PlayBook which is
public incidentally they made public a
long time ago what and Isis picked it up
and as a symbol and exactly what their
strategy is and it's as if we've been
following it point by point doing
exactly what they want
they want us to be drawn into a major
war against the entire Muslim world at
great cost to ourself achieving nothing
except more a conflict and disaster and
pretty much that's what we've been doing
I'm going to take a look at the
so-called war on terror
when Bush declared it in 2001 a radical
Islamic terror was localized in a small
tribal area in the Afghan Pakistan
tribal borders where is it now all over
the world every time you hit it with a
sledgehammer it expands when you don't
look at the roots of the problem and
unfortunately the same is going to be
true
almost certainly with the current
attacks on Isis strongholds in Mosul and
probably Raqqa in Syria when you look at
what's happened in the last couple of
months not so much of the Iraqi army but
the Shia militias and whatever there is
of Iraqi special forces and others have
conquered the cities of in Iraq of
Ramadi and Fallujah Sunni cities and
they're left on a total wreck that's not
recorded much but reporters like say
Patrick Coburn who actually go there
describe it as just devastated and
disaster and there are only there are
only 3,500 Isis fighters in Mosul and
they're getting ready US military in the
Iraqi military to attack them and defeat
them and take down a city that has a
million people who are going to be
largely refugees see this is an
extremely dangerous development in terms
of our own form of military policy in
the time remaining let's talk about
Congress in the Israeli Palestine issue
you've written many articles and books
on that we know that the US government
has given the Israeli government which
approaches the Palestinian people in a
very militarized occupied manner a blank
check that any time AIPAC the lobby here
wants a congressional help it can get
for
or more members of the house to sign on
to resolutions even while the Israeli
military is slaughtering civilians in
Gaza how about this for a proposal
you've heard about the Daniel Abraham
center for Middle East peace they have
put just this year six full time ads in
The New York Times with the very
pictures of retired officials who used
to head the Israeli FBI and the Israeli
CIA who are opposed to Prime Minister
Netanyahu's policies who want a more
peaceful solution a two-state solution
Israel and Palestine and who thinks that
the present trajectory of Israeli
militarism is going to be disastrous for
Israel now why don't the pro peace pro
Palestinian groups in this country and
in Israel we have the newspaper Haaretz
that writes a lot of sensible things
with Gideon Levy and Amira Hass and
others we have the civil rights civil
liberties group in Israel we have to
show them you Shalom ordinary that's
right we have Jewish voices for peace
which says it has over 150,000
supporters in this country we have a
majority of Jewish Americans who want a
two-state solution
why don't they go up to the Congress and
say we want to have the former heads of
Shin Bet and Mossad who are a very
critical of the present Israeli
government come and testify before the
Senate and the House and provide a
different view and a different horizon
whereby the US can back off from getting
into so much trouble in the Middle East
with its proxy country and AIPAC would
not be able to block these high-level
Israeli citizens who were heads of all
these security groups and and military
groups and there were former generals
and former attorney generals in Israel
who shared the same view since 1948
there has never been a hearing and
Congress
reflecting the Jewish Israeli peace
movement or the many high officials in
in the Israeli government who have a
different view as to how to make peace
with the Palestinians for the long run
can you explain how this obvious
demonstration six full-page ads in the
New York Times by the Daniel Abraham
center for Middle East peace has not had
any resonance well you could ask a
similar question about the American
peace movement go back to what you were
saying before there was during the say
the Indochina Wars worst crime since the
Second World War there were full-page
ads that constantly in the new york
times how often were there Senate
hearings that invited representatives of
the peace movement which was a huge
popular movement I mean this is a
dramatic disconnect between Congress and
public opinion actually that's been
studied extensively in academic
political science it turns out most of
the public is simply unrepresented the
lowest roughly seventy percent on the
income scale their own representatives
follow policies which are unrelated to
the riches the attitudes preferences of
their own constituency and we know whose
policies they're following as you move
up the income scale you get a little bit
more influence when you get to the very
top and a quarter fraction of one
percent basically making policy I mean
this is responsive to other voices not
those of its constituencies and that's a
problem that the groups themselves ought
to be dealing with I think it hit it
right on the nail when you say the
popular movements ought to be pressing
for this constantly and I think they're
good opportunities for change here in
the last 10 or 15 years there's been
quite a shift in public opinion
especially among younger people with
regard to the israel-palestine issue
right now I mean not long ago
earlier when I was giving talks on even
college campuses that even my own had
that police protection that's all gone
by now
Palestinian solidarity is one of the
major issues on campus among people who
call themselves liberal Democrats the
probably majority favored Palestinian
rights but something has to be done -
it's kind of like healthcare and all
these other things actions have to be
taken to turn public preferences into
public policy and that takes direct
activism electoral demonstrations and
lobbying all the options that are
available to us and just elaborate a
little more on the Daniel Abraham center
for Middle East peace
it's run by a former Florida congressman
Robert Wexler who joined the center as
president and in April 2010 Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton reaffirmed the
center's goal at a dedication ceremony
in Washington DC so listeners contact
your members of Congress and ask them if
they support a hearing we're very
prominent retired Israeli officials
mayor's Attorney General's intellectual
authors not to mention the former heads
of the Israeli FBI and Israeli CIA would
be willing to come and testify and break
this incarceration of Congress on this
mindless
support of militarism from Washington to
the Middle East I think this is a very
good way to do it because Congress could
have huge leverage in changing US policy
in this area a few years ago we were
talking with professor Chomsky a few
years ago there was a debate in
Washington you can see it on debating
taboos org debating taboo start or the
question was is there more anti-semitism
in the u.s. against Arab Americans and
Muslim Americans then there is against
Jewish Americans and there were two
prominent Jewish Americans one being the
brother of the former President of
Israel mr. Omer and two prominent Arab
American
debating it in a very civil manner and I
saw the outcome of that is that there
was recognition by the two Jewish
Americans that there is anti-semitism
against Arabs and that the Jewish people
don't own that phrase but as you know
you go up on Congress and you say well
you really disagree privately with APEC
you'd like to have a two-state solution
why don't you speak out and they
invariably say they're afraid of being
accused of being anti-semitic so it's a
very powerful charge it's a very
powerful tool and I think that given the
huge anti-semitic language in the
Israeli press against Palestinians have
been called dogs Fuhrman demographic
threats a high official of one of the
governing coalition's in Prime Minister
Netanyahu's government said that they
should all be killed and the mother
should be killed who are giving birth
quote to those snakes
end quote of it it's horrific and it
operates also in this country do you
think that this is an issue that you
would be concerned about because it does
stifle speech in Congress the use of
that word and it also is a very very
discriminatory against Arab Americans
from speaking out and there are a lot of
Jewish groups who agree that this kind
of prejudice should have no place in our
country your views well kind of a small
point the term anti-semitism contrary to
its literal meaning has come to be used
to mean repression and antagonism to
Jews not so much so we're kind of stuck
with the meaning of the term but your
point is exactly correct the waving this
flag to try to prevent discussion that
technique should be discredited and
undermined and it should be recognized
that for a long time
racist attitudes towards Arab Americans
are way beyond the traditional
anti-semitism towards Jews didn't used
to be like that and when I was growing
up anti-semitism directly enthuse was
quite real some really awful effect but
by about the 1960s that
change substantially the Jews are in
many ways maybe the most privileged
minority and there's unacceptable
remnants of anti-semitic literature and
activism but they're kind of at the
fringe on the other hand anti-muslim
prejudice and anti-arab prejudice has
been extreme for a long time and getting
worse in many ways that's a major issue
and yes it should be brought to the fore
incidentally with the question of
bringing Israeli officials and
intellectuals others to testify in
Congress one might also ask what about
Americans who are active in time to
bring about peace and justice in the
Middle East
why aren't they allowed to testify
exactly as in the case of the mass in
the Cadi war movement in the 60s the
huge popular mobilizations against the
Central American atrocities the mass
public opposition to the Iraq war which
was huge even before again Congress has
been pretty much immunized as you
mentioned much earlier in this
discussion from voices within the United
States that are critical of
establishment dinero's absent political
because yes I often have you been asked
to testify on these things not very
often but you're exactly right in the
run-up to the drumbeat for war in Iraq
the nine months before the March 2003
invasion there are over 300 retired high
officials generals Admirals former heads
the NSA CIA officials leading diplomats
retired who spoke out rode out
petitioned against Bush Cheney from
going to war in Iraq and if George Soros
who is also against the war in Iraq a
multi-billionaire had given them a
Secretariat and a significant budget to
get on the mass media multiply their
numbers get up to Congress and we might
have stopped Bush and Cheney it's pretty
hard to argue against people like Brent
Scowcroft Jim Baker security aides to
the first George Herbert Walker Bush
pretty hard to argue about against
marine general
Anthony Zinni retired or the former head
of the NSA a four-star general Howard
Odom but unfortunately they didn't have
a couple hundred million dollars to stop
a multi trillion dollar war with the
socio site in Iraq metastasizing
throughout large areas of Asia and
Africa so we are running out of time but
for people who want to know more about
the whole Middle East situation would
you recommend this magazine Middle East
report yeah that's very good America
ports is a very good source well thank
you very much I hope we can do this
again we've been talking with Professor
Noam Chomsky of MIT The Tribune of
factual dissemination and calm
evaluation of our US military foreign
policy and many other in justices that
are domestically based we hope that you
will contact your own media and ask why
isn't his voice more frequently on PBS
NPR the sunday talk shows they have to
hear from you and if they do they may
think twice about promoting a system of
censorship that is unbecoming to our
constitutional First Amendment rights
thank you very much yes and let me
congratulate you on breaking this system
with what you're doing for many years
and again today thank you I hope you'll
come on again because we have a lot of
topics we didn't discuss in the hour
that was available no sign bites here we
have a discussion back and forth as
should be on other media thank you very
much professor Chomsky thank you bye
