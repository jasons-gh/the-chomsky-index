Thanks
there's a conventional doctrine about
the new era that's opening up before us
and the promise that it holds the
official version of this was given about
a year ago by the National Security
Advisor Anthony Lake announcing what
some have called the Clinton doctrine
the doctrine is that we are now able to
move from containment so we did in the
old days to enlargement which is what
we're now going to do in his words
throughout the Cold War we contained the
global threat to market democracies now
we should seek to enlarge their reach
with the evil empire out of the way and
commentators were much impressed by this
enlightened vision the story is so
familiar that I'll spare you further
quote although when you move to the
higher levels of the intellectual
stratosphere they do have a certain
interest and maybe are worth a brief
sample so for example take say Henry
Kissinger in his recent book he repeats
the standard refrain that the world is
lucky indeed to have such a benevolent
leader but he warns that we may be a
little too angelic for our own good
altruism is okay up to a point but the
altruism of US policy is beginning to be
somewhat harmful or maybe always has
been in other words we should pay some
attention to our own needs instead of
just lavishing care and attention on
everyone else
sometimes this this point of this
conception of the tradition and the new
world order actually rises higher than
mere opinion or description of fact
sometimes it reaches the realms of pure
logic but here you really have to go
to the higher level so for example
there's a position at Harvard called the
eaton professorship of the science of
government now held by Samuel Huntington
and he writes in a prestigious journal
international security that the United
States must maintain its international
primacy for the benefit of the world
because alone among nations the national
identity of the United States is defined
by a set of universal political and
economic values liberty democracy
equality private property and markets
well since that's a matter of definition
so the science of government teaches us
evidences beside the point so you don't
waste time testing doing experiments to
find out if two and two is really equal
to four and that's a kind of a useful
conclusion because if people don't
understand it they might be tempted to
raise some rather disquieting questions
to pick just say the period of the peak
period of American liberalism take say
the kennedy administration and somebody
might want to know just how the kennedy
administration was containing the global
threat to market democracies when it
prepared the overthrow of the
parliamentary government of brazil
installing a regime of killers and
torturers and setting off a plague of
neo-nazi national security states that
spread over the hemisphere always with
firm US support and in fact direct
participation and indeed the actions
were presented at the time as a great
victory for democracy kennedy's
ambassador lincoln gordon who then
became Secretary of State for Asian
affairs he explained that the Brazilian
coup a military coup that overthrew the
parliamentary regime was a great victory
for the free world
which was undertaken to preserve and not
destroy Brazil's democracy it was called
at a democratic revolution which was the
single most decisive victory for freedom
in the mid 20th century and then he
added that also it should create a
greatly improved climate for private
investment so in that sense at least
that did contain a threat to market
democracy democracy in a rather special
sense he went on from there if my memory
is correct
to become president of a great
university not very far from here well
we also would not have to evaluate other
cases given that the US commitment to
these splendid values as a matter of
definition in fact we can put aside the
whole historical record which
unfortunately reveals a rather
systematic relationship between US
policy and democracy and human rights
and indeed markets will come to that one
example is the close correlation that's
been demonstrated repeatedly between US
aid and torture the more government
tortures its citizens the more likely it
is to receive US aid the correlation
includes military aid it's independent
of need it's not just that the torturing
countries or the needier and the
correlation remains alive right through
the period when human rights was the
soul of our foreign policy back in the
late 1970s and indeed the correlation
remains quite alive today notably in the
region that's most subject to u.s. power
and therefore most revealing about our
real values the leading human rights
violator in the hemisphere now 1st place
has been taken by Colombia where the
record is really horrendous and in fact
it is the recipient of more than half of
US military aid increasing under Clinton
now the pretext in Colombia is not
fighting communism that the
work anymore it's fighting narco
trafficking although nobody even at
least nobody even tries to conceal the
fact that the security course forces
that the United States is training and
arming and the government itself is
deeply involved with narco trafficking
which indeed has been abetted by US
policy in some quite remarkable ways if
there's time I'll give some examples but
the useful point is that any such
questions are irrelevant if indeed the
commitment to democracy and markets and
human rights and all good things is
simply a matter of definition well I
don't want to imply that everyone thinks
that facts are irrelevant that it's just
a matter of logic that's unfair so let's
say take democracy there is in fact
interesting work on democracy and human
and US policy with regard to democracy
particularly in the recent years some of
the most interesting work I know is
scholarly work is by a man named Thomas
Carruthers who's written a book and
several articles about it studies of US
relations to the democracy in the
nineteen eighty and he has the advantage
of writing is a insider he was in the
State Department the Reagan State
Department working on the legal legal
sub department working in particular on
the water cook what they call the
democracy enhancement programs so he
writes both as an observer and as a
participant and it's the study is
interesting he starts by pointing out
that he's convinced that the effort u.s.
effort to enhance democracy in Latin
America was sincere but unfortunately it
was a failure and as he points out he
doesn't point this out but as the record
shows and he presents it quite honestly
the failure is rather systemic oddly
systematic the way it works is that
where US influence was least progress
towards democracy was greatest namely in
the Southern Cone where the you know
down far south where the US had least
interest influence there there was
indeed progress toward democracy the
Reagan I'd strenuously opposed it as
Carothers accurately points out and then
of course took credit for it once it
became irreversible well that's where US
interest was least influence was least
where US influence was greatest in
Central America progress was least here
as I'll just quote you've corrupted
brothers own conclusion is the programs
he was involved in incidentally
Washington inevitably sought only
limited top-down forms of Democratic
Change that did not risk upsetting the
traditional structures of power with
which the United States has long been
ally the United States he said sought to
maintain the basic order of quite
undemocratic societies and to avoid
populist base change that might upset
established economic and political
orders and open a leftist direction in
other words we sponsor democracy as long
as it came out the way we ordered it to
come out with the old non democratic
structure remaining and the
anti-democratic elites that were allied
the US power in charge otherwise we
didn't sponsor it in fact we're
observing that again right now before
our eyes in many places Haiti's a
dramatic example if you look at what's
really happening when we turn to the
real world away from the world of
ideology I think we find that democracy
and markets and human rights are under
serious attack in much of the world more
so than for many years including the
leading industrial democracies the most
powerful of them the United States is in
fact leading the attack and in the real
world the United States has never
supported free markets from its earliest
history until the Reagan years which in
fact set new standards for protectionism
and state intervention in the economy
contrary to many illusions which in fact
are fostered by the ideological
institutions but are easily demonstrated
to be false if for an entry into the
real world I I would a good place to
start
as
with noted diplomatic historian named
Gerald Haynes also the senior historian
of the CIA so again he writes both as a
scholar and then close to the inside he
recently published a highly praised book
on US control of Brazil for the last 50
years ever since the mid 40s when the
United States as he puts it took Brazil
over as a testing area for scientific
methods of development and we've been
essentially running it ever since
including the great victory for
democracy that took place when in during
the Kennedy Johnson period that I
already mentioned Haines writing in 1989
describes this result as a great success
story for American style capitalism
that's an interesting judgment if you
happen to know anything about Brazil
where a very potentially very rich
country thought to be one of the richest
in the world
where for maybe 90% of the population
the conditions of Eastern Europe under
pre Gorbachev would look like some kind
of paradise that's actually an
interesting comparison if you ask
yourself how Brazil compared with Russia
seventy years ago actually rather
similar with similar prospect and the
you can draw some conclusions from that
but you can be safe and secure that
those conclusions won't be drawn in
mainstream discussion where the only
thing that's discussed is the comparison
of Eastern Europe and Western Europe
showing how great we are and how awful
they are which is about as rational as a
discussion of the nursery schools in
Cambridge Massachusetts showing that
there are a total failure as you can see
by comparing the amount of quantum
physics known by graduates of the
nursery schools with what's known by
graduates of MIT in fact if you want to
make even a rational compare minimally
rational comparison of these two models
of development the one we carried out in
the testing area for scientific
development and the
tyrannical command economy of Eastern
Europe the natural the only way to do it
of course is to start with places that
more or less alike Eastern and Western
Europe the last time they were alike was
about the 15th century I guess and
Eastern Europe had been declining
relative to the West ever since on the
other hand say Brazil and Russia were
more or less alike although Brazil had
all sorts of advantages the Russian ever
had well I won't pursue that as I say
that's a rational course you can find
some material on that but not in the
mainstream anyhow back to Haines he
begins by pointing out that I'm quoting
following World War 2 the United States
assumed out of self-interest
responsibility for the welfare of the
world capitalist system and as any CEO
can explain to you welfare for the
leaders of the world capitalist system
requires a dual policy with regard to
markets free markets for the poor and
the oppressed but massive state
intervention to protect the wealthy and
the privileged from market discipline to
make sure that resources are transferred
to them by a huge public subsidy and by
regressive fiscal measures and also to
increase the power of a requires
increasing the power of absolutist and
unaccountable institutions over the
international economy and society and
indeed that's exactly what policy has
been as for democracy it's a fine thing
as long as it satisfies the conditions
that Carruthers describes that is
top-down form of democracy in which the
rule is safely in the hands of elite
groups linked to the United States which
are indeed highly highly autocratic the
condition under which democracy is
acceptable was actually described rather
honestly by the London economists little
while ago they were writing this was
right after the Polish elections where
the poles had voted to against the
policies that
the London economists and its readers
favor and they said that that's no
problem they assured their readers that
that's no problem
the reason is is they put it that policy
is insulated from politics in other
words whatever games these people play
and the election booths and the voting
booth policy is going to go on the same
way so don't worry about it and the
reason is that what's happening that
much more powerful forces are going to
determine policy anyway so they can have
democracy if they like because they're
going to do what we want anyway the
tuberosum World Bank lingo policy can be
carried out in what they like to call
technocratic insulation that is with the
guys who really run the show of
following the orders of real power and
ignoring the noises that come from the
rabble in that case we can have
democracy well the current attack on
human rights and democracy and markets
is not something new but it is taking
new forms in fact qualitatively
different ones I think to show that
convincingly would be a you don't way
beyond anything I can attempt here but
what I'll try to do is just to indicate
why I think that these conclusions are
correct and then maybe we can follow
things up in discussion let me begin
with a lead story in The New York Times
that appeared in July under the headline
US corporations expanding abroad at a
quicker pace and it starts off like this
says American companies are once again
rapidly expanding their operations
abroad demonstrating that no matter what
the incentives for keeping business in
the United States the urge to spread
factories offices stores and jobs
overseas is irresistible despite a weak
dollar and falling labor costs here
which you would think would spur
investment here overseas investment is
rising at twice the rate of exports and
for each dollar earned from exports
American companies take in nearly $2
from the sale of what they produce
Saburo
well let's begin with the falling labor
costs which indeed are quite real about
ten years ago the United States had the
highest wages in the world which is what
you'd expect this is the richest country
in the world by far and it has
absolutely unparalleled advantages real
wages have in fact stagnated or even
declined for the majority the population
since their peak around 25 years ago but
in the mid 80s the effects of the double
edged so-called conservatism of the
Reaganites namely markets for the poor
and state protection for the rich that
hadn't yet had its full impact by 1993
the impact was quite obvious the Wall
Street Journal was able to exalt over
what it called a welcome development of
transcendent importance namely US labor
costs had fallen below all other leading
industrial powers
apart from England we actually did fall
below England for a while but then
Margaret Thatcher succeeded in driving
the working people and the poor down
even more efficiently than us meanwhile
profits were rising to new heights
earlier this year every year Fortune
magazine has a new big business magazine
has a review of the fortune 500 you know
the 500 top guys and this year earlier
this year they reported dazzling profits
that's their word for the 500 top
corporations even though sales were
stagnating so wages are going down sales
are stagnating and profits are zooming
to dazzling Heights sometimes called a
paradox in fact if you look at social
policy it's not terribly paradoxical in
there are other things happening - along
with decline and wages for the majority
of the population and that continues
through the so-called recovery work
hours are increasing they're now at the
highest level since the Second World War
the 40-hour week has long been forgotten
and markets are becoming more flexible
technical term which means that when you
go to sleep at night
you don't know if you're gonna have a
job next morning that's as any economist
can explain to you that's a contribution
to the health of the economy it's a
contribution of the health of the
economy when you eliminate what are
called market rigidities like job
security and contracts pensions union
laws the governing health safety in the
workplace and so on those are all market
rigidities which we want to eliminate in
the interest of the health of the
economy health of the economy is a
carefully defined term designed so that
it refers to certain factor it brings in
certain factors and not others including
not the factors that even the World Bank
concedes are major factors and economic
growth like equality it's an economy can
be very healthy by this measure while
the population is in fact suffering
miserably in fact that happens
constantly and there's even another
technical term for that it's a call it's
called an an economic miracle means the
privileged few are doing beautifully the
numbers look fine for our investors are
enriching themselves and the population
may be starving to death
well these developments are welcome to
other sectors of the world capitalist
system for whose welfare the United
States has provided as the senior
historian of the CIA puts it one
immediate effect of the free trade
agreement with Canada was the flight of
several hundred thousand jobs to the
southeast United States where labor
markets are very flexible there's no
need for concern about such archaic
ideas as unions or benefits or security
or for that matter for the rights that
are guaranteed in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights to which we
make you know proper obeisance when
there's some political gains to be made
from that and other laws and conventions
on the news of course reached Europe as
well including Germany where labor costs
per unit output were 60 percent our
sixty percent higher than the United
States according the Wall Street Journal
just at that time Germany's large
conglomerate daimler-benz established a
major Factory in Alabama where it was
offered the usual benefits that are
expected from third-world countries at a
cost to the taxpayer that was considered
exorbitant even by The Wall Street
Journal which rarely has a harsh word
for foreign investment overseas
investment is motivated by more than the
availability of cheap labor with few
benefits and rights that is flexible
market labor markets and that's
explained in the same New York Times
article that I quoted from earlier in it
The Times interviews an executive of the
Gillette company you know the razor
company and he explained why his
corporation is shifting production to 28
countries including Germany despite its
very high labor costs and here's the
reason we're concerned about having only
one place where a product is made
because of labor problems and gives an
example example is they have a factory
in Boston and if the Boston workers
strike Gillette could supply both the
European and the US markets from its
plant in Berlin and thereby break the
strike so it's quite reasonable that
Gillette should employ three times as
many workers in manufacture a broad as
in the United States quite irrespective
of costs notice that this is not for
economic efficiency so they're going to
high-cost areas rather it's just part of
class war it's a way to maintain power
and to and to ensure that the highly
class conscious business sector in the
United States will be able to beat down
its enemy namely the domestic population
this is quite apart from questions of
economic efficiency notice except in a
much longer you know something in some
other sense of the term the this these
processes these international
internationalization of productions
quote which is going on of which this is
an illustration that puts quite a
different cast on the discussion that's
underway these days the debate about
what's called American
it means that in order it indicates as
it was always true but now it's much
more true true that if you want to
evaluate the notion of American decline
you have to begin by saying what you
mean by the United States what is it if
you mean by the United States the
geographical entity and the people in it
then indeed the country is declining in
many respects but as Adam Smith observed
two centuries ago the principal
architects of state policy in his days
the merchants and manufacturers of
England have quite different interests
than those of their own of the
population of their country and they
make sure that their own interests are
in his words most peculiarly attended to
whatever the effect on their own
populations let alone others and nothing
has changed in that regard including the
need to employ the class analysis that
Adam Smith took for granted in
understanding policy choices instantly
I'm talking about the real Adam Smith
not the one who is created by ideologues
the real one is actually quite
interesting not the imbecile it sounds
like when you look at what's attributed
to him the so we have to at least begin
by recognizing what was a truism to Adam
Smith that when we talk about policy we
have to ask are we talking about the
principal architects no longer the
merchants and manufacturers but now
basically transnational corporations and
banks and so on are we talking about the
population in the country and you just
get quite different answers so for
example if you use if you refer to the
principal architects of policy it's
quite natural to discover that the US
manufacturing production is indeed
declining namely when you consider the
geographical entity but it's holding its
own quite well if you consider the share
and global production of us-based
corporations just different concepts of
the United States so all is fine in
other words if you adopt the perspective
of the principal architects of policy
and the same conclusions hold with
regard to the famous trade deficit if
you consider international borders the
United States has a huge huge trade
deficit and it's expected to go up in
fact but recently the Commerce
Department recalculated the trade
deficit on a different way they counted
profits of US companies abroad as US
exports well when you did that the
deficit turned into a huge surplus and
that recalculation was quite reasonable
The Wall Street Journal explained and
reporting it because the profits gained
abroad benefit companies domestically so
therefore they should be regarded as
like in you know exports basically the
recalculation interprets the words
United States in the terms that matter
for the principal architects of policy
and Adam Smith since not the
geographical area or its people but
rather the people who count that is the
beneficiaries of the powerful welfare
state for the rich which indeed was
enhanced under the Reagan years the end
of the Cold War provides rich new
opportunities for for increasing the
privilege and power of Western investors
partly that simply because much of the
region is being returned to its
traditional third world service role in
my opinion that's what the Cold War was
basically about but that's another topic
go put it aside in any event that's
plainly happening it's going back most
of it to where it was relative to the
west about 70 years ago and for Eastern
Europe 50 years ago also these
developments offer the principal
architects of policy and the
institution's they represent it offers
them new weapons against their domestic
enemy namely the population at home and
that's quite an important matter workers
in the East are skilled and healthy and
well educated although that in fact is
changing because of the precipitous and
disastrous decline in quality of life
standards in most of Eastern Europe
since 1989 as the capitalist reforms
were imposed and they
in fact were returned to the third world
where they're supposed to be UNESCO has
a recent report in which they try to
give some number but some numbers on
this and they estimate for example about
half a million extra deaths a year in
Russia alone as a result of these
measures which incidentally they say
they approve of though not the way
they're carried out the workers in the
East nevertheless still are they may not
remain but they still are skilled and
well educated and of course they're also
blonde and blue-eyed which overcomes
another unspoken problem about the third
world they're willing to work longer
hours than what the business press calls
their pampered colleagues and in the
West
thanks to pauperization and massive
unemployment resulting from the free
market reforms I'm quoting London
Financial Times in a kind of an upbeat
column about the East headed green
shoots in communism ruins it's pretty
awful but there's some green shoots like
the pauperization and mass unemployment
which means that they'll work much
harder than their pampered than pampered
Western workers they don't receive many
benefits nice flexible labor market and
wages are kept low by harsh labor
policies of the powerful states doing
their job meanwhile foreign investors
benefit additionally from tariff
protection subsidies tax holidays and
the other familiar concomitant of really
existing free-market policies so when GM
and VW and so on moved Eastern Europe
they expect and get massive protection
because that's their sense of free
markets well the business press has been
quite frank and warning Western workers
that they're going to have to abandon
what Businessweek calls their luxurious
lifestyle in the face of international
competition now including the
traditional third world in the East
returning to its service rule when
economists talk about this they usually
talk about jobs shift and then point out
rightly that we
I know a lot about that but that's the
least of it
the threat of jobs shift alone suffices
to make labour markets more flexible
that is to lower wages eliminate
benefits and so on in a more
internationalized economy for obvious
reasons and all of these devices provide
new methods for the powerful to enhance
their wealth and privilege which is
after all what social policy is about
and their decision-making power in all
aspects of life and indeed their control
over the general population and that's
true whether democratic forms function
or not given that policy can
increasingly be insulated from politics
well over the last century and a half
workers have won many rights for
themselves and for the general
population in long and hard struggles in
the United States they faced levels of
state corporate violence that were
unique in the West but in the United
States these rights have been eroded and
by now I have almost been completely
destroyed by a major state corporate
offensive starting right after World War
two ever since the Reagan I'd take over
the offensive simply became open
partnership and crime employers simply
violated the law frankly and openly
secure in the knowledge that they'd be
backed by a criminal state all of this
incidentally is reviewed in some detail
and quite accurately in Businessweek in
a cover story last May which you might
want to have a look at the conclusion is
that crime does pay
particularly when state power is behind
it that's a principle that's understood
very well by our clients abroad as well
as for the global social and economic
crisis it's quite real and we feel
people feel it and they feel it rightly
often it's recognized in fact and it's
usually attributed to inexorable market
forces of course it is which of the kind
that written David Ricardo called as
immutable as the principles of
gravitation
an earlier exercise of ideological
warfare when classical economics was
sort of created recognizing these
inexorable forces you then get division
among analysts about the contribution of
various factors like international trade
and automation some of the major ones
well putting aside the absurdity of
comparing human institutions with their
specific values and choices the laws of
nature should be recognized that there's
a considerable element of deception in
all of this if you look closely you find
that the alleged deficiencies of trade
and automation for example are hardly
attributable to the market huge state
subsidies and state intervention have
always been required and still are to
make trade appear to be efficient not to
speak of costs such as for example
ecological costs that are imposed on
future generations who don't vote in the
market and other so-called externalities
which are put down in footnote somewhere
well to mention merely one slight market
distortion which doesn't get mentioned
discussed much and talk about the
efficiency of trade a substantial part
of the Pentagon budget has been devoted
to I'm quoting secure flow of oil at
reasonable prices
from the Middle East which is
overwhelmingly the preserve of the
United States I'm quoting from Phoebe
more of the National Defense University
in a casual and quite great comment in a
scholarly journal if you were watching
television during the latest Iraq
escapade
you'll recall that she was one of the
main specialists called upon to give
explanations of what's happening
well the Pentagon budget which is not
slight is a contribution to the
efficiency of trade that doesn't receive
too much attention apart from other
contributions that it makes to what's
called the health of the economy and
there are plenty of other such factors
if you consider them you get quite a
different picture
let's take automation the second factor
there's no doubt that it is throwing
people out of work these days and it
does contribute to profit today however
automation was so inefficient that it
could not be developed through market
forces it had to be developed through
decades of protection in the state
sector that's what's called here the
defense system that's just the state
sector of the economy which the public
pays for until something profitable
comes out at which point it's handed
over to private power this has been
studied very extensively and very
revealingly by David Noble formerly of
my university now in Canada works very
much worth reading and furthermore as he
demonstrates the specific form of
automation that was selected was not
inherent in the technology it nor was it
picked for reasons of economic
efficiency often the choice was driven
by power rather than profit or
efficiency or anything that's in the
technology that is the form of
automation that was developed within the
state sector protected because of its
enormous inefficiency the form of
automation that was developed was
designed to descale workers and
subordinate them to management not the
contrary to give work to empower workers
and eliminate management the same
technology the technology doesn't care
which way it's used it could be used one
way or the other and questions of profit
are basically irrelevant to this
question what is relevant are questions
of domination and control like for
example Gillette's buildup of a labor
force in berlin in case American workers
get the crazy idea of striking what is
in fact happening in the world has less
to do with markets than it does with raw
concentrated power and class war of the
kind that was obvious to Adam Smith
increasingly this power is vested in
unaccountable institutions there are
changes in the International economy
that
offered real hopes for reversing and
unraveling the advances in democracy and
human rights that had been achieved in
more than a century of bitter struggle
one factor is just the
internationalization of the economy
which was which offers very effective
weapons against working people as I
mentioned as is obvious another factor
which sure goes along in parallel with
that is the huge explosion in
unregulated specula financial capital
and also which has just exploded since
around 1970 when the regulatory system
was dismantled by Richard Nixon the
Bretton Woods system and not only has
the scale grown enormously but so has
the its the composition so current
estimates are that around 1970 about 90%
of the capital of involved in
international exchanges was for was
trade related or investment related that
is related to some sort of meaningful
economic purpose and about 10% was
speculation like speculation against
currencies by 1990 those those numbers
have literally reversed 90% speculation
not anything productive and the latest
report I saw on a UN Development policy
program report just a few months ago is
that that figure is now going up to 95
percent well the difference between 10%
devoted to mere speculation and 95%
devoted to it is great apart from the
fact that the scale is has become
completely astronomical alright and that
has its consequences it creates massive
pressures leading towards low growth low
wage dazzling profit economies and it
helps insulate policy from politics and
eliminate the threat of democracy that's
what's being referred to when people
talk about technocratic insulation and
the fact that democracy isn't as much of
a fear anymore because nothing
people do better than anyone power lies
in other hands unaccountable essentially
totalitarian institutions have the kind
of power that was never dreamt of in the
past
well I think that's what's really
happening a lot of work on this
in fact without this abstract level
let's go down to earth the real meaning
of what's called free-market
conservatism is illustrate illustrated
by a closer look at the most passionate
enthusiasts for what they call getting
the government off our back and letting
the market reign undisturbed you know
those are the mantras these days as you
read every day well New York Times had a
front-page story on this interesting
phenomenon a little while ago and they
picked a concrete example and indeed the
most striking example Cobb County
Georgia the article appears under the
heading conservatism flowering among the
malls that's what's happening in Cobb
County Georgia it's a rich suburb of
Atlanta scrupulously insulated from any
urban infection so that the inhabitants
can enjoy the fruits of what is
described as their entrepreneurial
values and their market enthusiasms
their defendant which are defended in
Congress by their representative leading
conservative in Congress Newt Gingrich
next Speaker of the House I presume who
is proudly proclaiming that the
anti-government sentiments of the
American people are finally beginning to
prevail over the socialistic welfare
state well there is a small footnote to
this Cobb County Georgia receives more
federal subsidies than any other county
in the country with two interesting
exceptions one of them is Arlen is
Arlington Virginia which is of course
just part of the federal system and the
other is the Florida home of the Kennedy
Space Center which is another central
component of the system of public
subsidy of private profit but if you
move out of the state system itself so
put aside those two counties then Cobb
County is the leading recipient of
federal subsidies public subsidies
funneled through the federal government
in the country the leading employer in
Cobb County is Lockheed Aircraft a
corporation which exists thanks to
massive public subsidy most other jobs
in Cobb County where people are pursuing
their entrepreneurial values also are
based on feeding at the public trough
meaning that taxpayers paying for
meanwhile praises to market miracles are
resounding to the heavens notably where
conservatism is flowering among the
malls along with calls to get the
government off our back as long as we're
sure that its hands are pouring public
funds into our pockets well I you if you
want a very graphic illustration of how
this works I really urge you to look at
Newt Gingrich's Contract with America
parts of which are published in New York
Times this morning I could read it on
the airplane coming down if you read it
you discover not just a little bit
closely doesn't take very closely you
discover the what he's calling for is a
greatly enhanced and much more powerful
welfare state for the rich but with
punishment of the poor and in fact it's
done in a pretty brazen fashion it's
worth reading carefully and in fact that
pattern is almost Exceptionalist so one
sort of minor part of the welfare state
for the rich is just straight flat
outright welfare whether it's meant
sometimes masked and read a regressive
fiscal measures but what amounts to just
payments and what you find just read a
recent study by one economist that if
for a household with incomes over a
hundred thousand welfare subsidies front
four from the government are about
almost twice as high as for households
with income of under ten thousand now
these subsidies include things like you
know say tax reductions for mortgage
payments and so on which are equivalent
to
subsidies give people the money it's
just a way of disguising so others don't
see it and now that's the small part of
it but even there alone we find that the
welfare to the rich is well beyond
anything that goes to the poor so the
welfare system is in fact a
redistributed system upwards something
which wouldn't have surprised Adam Smith
who understood that that's what the
principal architects of policy are up to
however if you really want to see the
way the system works
you have to move from these sort of
minor parts so places like Cobb County
Georgia or say Seattle Washington where
you could observe it quite closely last
year Bill Clinton is off to Jakarta next
week or week or two for the next APEC
conference beside comment he made it
clear that he's not gonna bring up any
human rights issues Indonesia has a
horrendous human rights record if you
wanna have a look at what it's like take
a look at the latest Amnesty
International report which is unusual
I mean I've rarely seen such a harsh and
well justified report in fact in
addition to that it's carried out a near
genocidal attack on East Timor and is
still doing it I just picked up a flier
coming in here saying that on Thursday
November 10th at 5 o'clock here I guess
are at the end anujan embassy there's to
be a candlelight vigil it's the
anniversary of one of the big massacres
a couple of years ago Deeley massacre
1991 Indonesia that made him error in
case some of you are thinking of a
career in the diplomatic service I give
you some free advice you're not supposed
to carry out massacres in front of
television cameras and there happened to
be a hidden television camera there
there's a British journalist who's
hiding behind a gravestone in the
graveyard where the massacre took place
that's a bad mistake and second point
you're not supposed to practically
murder American journalists and the
Indonesian troops
practically killed an American
journalist Allan Nairn while I was he
was trying to protect a friend Amy
Goodman another American journalist
that's a bet at stake that's considered
bad for him you're not supposed to do
that and when you do that there's a
routine that you go through cover-up
judicial cover-up punishment of the
victims free the people who are
responsible and then there's another job
this is advice for those of you who want
to be journalists or academics and so on
you're supposed to praise this
magnificent display that shows how you
know human rights are improving and it's
really a wonderful place and so on and
so forth I mean this is a record that
has replayed over and over it was done
on in that case if you don't happen to
like it you can for example join the
vigil well next week so two weeks I
guess Clinton's off to Jakarta where
he's promised not to say anything about
human rights
the last APEC conference asia-pacific
economic conference or it's called the
last one a year ago is in Seattle and
there Clinton was the star performer he
offered what the press described with
great awe as his grand vision of the
free market future a lot of admiration
he gave the talk announcing this grand
vision and a hangar of the Boeing
Corporation in Seattle and in fact he
selected Boeing as his model the model
of the free market future and it said
make some sense Boeing is the country's
leading exporter and in fact civilian
air aircraft leads the way in US
manufacturing exports the world's
biggest industry the tourism industry is
of course aircraft based and it accounts
for about a third of the u.s. trade
surplus and services so it makes good
sense to pick Boeing Boeing also happens
to be a perfect example of
state-supported
industry Boeing is a publicly subsidized
Corp locky publicly subsidized
corporation which the taxpayer pays for
but the profits go to the investors
that's our system that's what we call
free
Pruss and getting the government off
your backs so Boeing was a great choice
if this never nobody seemed to notice
this when they were talking about the
grant grand vision for the future but
it's an interesting story if you look at
the history Boeing the leading exporter
pre before World War two it couldn't
could barely survive during World War
two however its investment increased
fivefold over 90 percent of it
federal money this is while Boeing was
doing its patriotic duty during the
Second World War and wages were being
held down for others doing their
patriotic duty
so after World War two Boeing was in
business
not through the forces of the market
well what happened after the war
Fortune magazine the leading business
magazine recognized write-off I'm
quoting it that the aircraft industry
cannot satisfactorily exist in a pure
uncompetitive unsubsidized free
enterprise economy and Businessweek
added that the government is their only
possible Savior and in fact the Pentagon
system was revitalized as the savior
it's sustained and expanded the aircraft
industry the leading civilian exporter
along with a lot of others that went
along with it for example metals
generally electronics computers about
85% of electronics our research and
development during the 50s was paid for
by the taxpayer the profits later went
to private corporations that includes
chemicals machine tools automation as I
mentioned and in fact just about every
other central component of the
industrial economy incidentally the fact
that the government had to be the savior
meaning the taxpayer had to pay for it
for the enrichment of the wealthy and
the maintenance of a private enterprise
economy that was completely frank and
open in the business press was never
concealed you don't have to go to secret
records to discover it all you have to
do is read the business press in the
late 40s very clear it's also supported
by released secret documents
but there's nothing much to reveal the
first secretary of except for the
general population it was not supposed
to hear any of this
the first secretary of the Air Force
Stuart Symington he put the matter quite
plainly in January 1948 he said the word
to talk is not subsidy the word to talk
is security listen to the word and
you'll learn a lot about recent history
including the Cold War Symington was
essentially aircraft industry
representative in Washington and he
regularly demanded enough procurement
funds from Congress to as he put it meet
the requirements of the aircraft
industry and in fact Boeing won the
major share and so the matter continues
until today I've written about it
elsewhere but it's no time to talk about
it and in fact it continues in pretty
much the same way in just about every
functioning sector of the productive
economy and somebody that's one reason
why the Pentagon budget remains higher
in real dollars today than it was under
Nixon while the government is and the
information system is desperately
looking for new pretexts the old one
having vanished for new pretext to
maintain this extraordinary public
subway technique for subsidizing the
wealthy and the privileged that's what
it means to get government off our back
you look at the contract with america of
Newt Gingrich you discover that a major
component is to increase to restore our
national security on our national
defense well that's an interesting
phrase you might ask who's threatening
us exactly as I read history the last
time the US was threatened was in the
war of 1812 and it now produces US
military expenditures are now great or
already greater than the rest of the
world combined including government
subsidized military sales which maintain
the private economy but we have to
increase our security that is we have to
increase the welfare state for the rich
meanwhile cutting down welfare for the
poor
this is then spelled out further but
that's the contract with America by
those who preach free-market
conservatism well needless to say
focusing on rich countries like ours is
very misleading this double-edged the
advocacy of free markets has by far its
most lethal effect in the traditional
colonial domains third-world which with
the single exception of the japan-based
area which was never properly colonized
by the West apart from that it's an
utter disaster
apart from ideologically crafted
economic measures that put aside the
effects on people when they measure
economic health and with hopelessly
inadequate apologies to the victims I'm
going to put aside this terrible story
of major crimes against humanity for
which we bear major primary and
continuing responsibility
well the contemporary attack on
democracy focuses on its central point
namely accountability the huge
transnational corporations that
increasingly dominate the global economy
they operate of course in virtual
secrecy and the same is true of what the
London Financial Times calls the
de-facto world government that's taping
taking shape around them meaning
referring to the World Bank and the IMF
and the New World Trade Organization and
the executive meetings that were of the
rich seven countries g7 and so on all of
those can function in technocratic
isolation free from interference by the
declining parliamentary institutions
untroubled by the general public who
have only the vaguest idea of what
they're doing
their machination czar can be known only
to a few specialists and in fact there
in principle secret well meanwhile
there's a growing sector kind of a
growing surplus population who don't
contribute much to profit if anything
and therefore don't have any human
rights under standard values the values
that we're trying to extend over the
world and that's that's problem
they naturally have to be kept in
ignorance like everyone else but in
addition they have to be controlled and
the question is how you do that
well that problems faced rather directly
in the third-world domains that have
long been subject to Western control and
therefore reveal most clearly the actual
guiding ideals of the leaders at least
if you apply rational standards they're
the favored devices include large-scale
terror death squads torture and other
similar methods of proven effectiveness
a dramatic example is the terrorist war
against Central America during the 1980s
against democracy and independence
largely against the church in fact
proceeding right now incidentally
Columbia is the leading example within
the United States however the methods of
choice are somewhat different the
primary message method so like we don't
send out death squads to kill the
superfluous people we do it in other
more indirect ways the primary way has
been just to keep the superfluous
population locked up in urban slums that
increasingly resemble of concentration
camps or if that fails lock him up in
prisons those are the counterpart in a
richer society to the death squads that
we train and support in our domains in
June 1994 the Justice Department
reported that the number of state and
federal prison inmates in the United
States had almost tripled since 1980
reaching record Heights under Reaganite
conservatism the u.s. left its main
competitors Russia and South Africa well
behind and locking up its population
although you'll be happy to learn that
Russia has just caught up thanks to the
free market reforms actually the highest
rate of imprisonment is under the
leading US client regime Human Rights
Watch has just pointed out in a study of
torture in the Israeli occupied
territories the largely fraudulent drug
war has been very effectively used and
indeed is crafted to imprison the
unwanted popular
in the united states and the new
bipartisan crime bill should facilitate
the process with its vast new
expenditures for prisons its sharp
increase in the death penalty and much
harsher sentencing procedures also it's
worth bearing in mind that the crime
bill gives a lift to the economy it's a
Keynesian technique of economic stimulus
a lot of big impulse to the construction
industry and so on and a lot of jobs for
just controlling people one of the
fastest-growing white-collar professions
in the United States is security
personnel including prison guards the
great increase in prisons also creates a
very cheap in fact zero pay virtually
zero pay and highly disciplined labor
force for private corporations and the
state industry so it's pretty useful for
the economy and you can see then why
Newt Gingrich's Contract for America
calls for a very rapid expansion in this
highly efficient device of increasing
state power and ridding ourselves of
people who have no rights by the simple
standard that they don't contribute the
profit-making it's worth paying close
attention to this one of the leading
American criminologists William
Chambliss at George Washington
University he discusses what he calls
the politics of law and law enforcement
and the politics of it are very
interesting as he shows he points out as
have plenty of others that crime hasn't
really changed very much in the last
twenty years in scale or even in
character but the perceptions have
changed a lot and furthermore the
punishment is going up very fast and in
highly restricted and specialized ways
targeting the most vulnerable sectors of
the population mainly blacks over half
the prisoners in federal prisons about
thirty percent in state prisons are
there for drug violations two-thirds of
the arrests in 1992 last year for which
they're good statistics were for
possession not for sale and manufactured
so take a look at your favorite federal
lockup and you won't find many
executives of chemical corporations that
provide the
materials or banks that launder the
money rather for possession like kids on
the street blacks account for two-thirds
of the prisoners convicted for drug
offensives even though studies have
shown that more whites and blacks use
illegal drugs and of course about eighty
percent of the population is white and
furthermore the laws themselves are very
carefully crafted so it happens for
various reasons that in the in the urban
ghettos crack cocaine is the favored
drug whereas in the white suburbs its
powdered cocaine have a look at the laws
for those two and you'll find that the
punishments are radically different in
fact black males are considered a
criminal population by law enforcement
officials so Chambliss includes from
quite interesting studies that are
available now this includes direct
observation in a project with the
Washington police in which you know law
students and so on travel around with
the police and just take transcripts of
what's happening he says they're treated
as a criminal population I don't think
that's exactly correct
criminals are supposed to have
constitutional rights but as his and
other studies show that's not true for
the black population which is treated
more like a population under military
occupation it's not a not a criminal
population actually the drug war goes
down that fine detail when you look
closely there's this there in Columbia
this where the situation is monstrous
there nevertheless are human rights
groups functioning the most active is
Jesuit based peace and justice group
they just came out with a report on
atrocities in the last year or in this
report but they also include an appendix
on the drug cartels which is kind of
intriguing Colombia is the main source
of you know illegal drugs here
high-technology illegal drugs and there
are two major cartels there's the
Medellin Cartel and the Cali cartel and
they've been treated quite differently
they point out that Medellin Cartel has
been destroyed
essentially the Cali cartel is
flourishing and the authors go into the
reasons the mid-eighteen cartel was
lower class and art lower
as in origins and it had something of
the character of mafia style populism
that is the guys who came up to the top
that Pablo Escobar for example I mean
undoubtedly big gangsters but they also
would like build soccer fields and for
the poor and if your kid was starving
you know dying of a disease you could go
and they give you drugs and so on this
is a familiar sort of semi-feudal
pattern that you find the son besides
they were lower-class in origin so they
were wiped out the colleague cartels are
just big bankers and industrialists so
nobody's going to touch them in fact
they're flourishing killing people as
much as they like doing anything they
want but they're the right kind of drug
peddlers the kind we like so as I say
when you look closely at the drug war
you find that in the finest detail it
conforms to the worst predictions that
one might make by following Adam Smith's
advice and asking what the principal
architects of policy are likely to
design for their own interest
Chambliss also points out the perception
of crime as important did not proceed
and motivate government crime laws as
has been claimed by James Q Wilson and
other right-wing scholars rather as
polls show which he reviews the
perception of the issue became became an
issue after it was stimulated by Nixon
right-wing Democrats and others who
share their goals and perspectives the
reasons why blacks are targeted or
obvious they are they just don't have
any clout and they can't defend
themselves or the obvious target and
furthermore engendering fear is a
standard method of population control
whether the designated victims are
blacks or Jews or homosexuals or
whatever and these it seems are the
primary reasons for the growth of what
Chambliss calls that crime control
industry it's not that crime isn't a
real threat to safety and survival it
certainly is and has been for a long
time but the causes aren't being
addressed rather it's being used as a
method of population control in various
ways and
those techniques will increase under the
contract with America
well in general it's more vulnerable
sectors that are under attack
blacks are one another's children
general in general there are very easy
targets that matter has in fact been
addressed in several recent important
studies one of the best is a UNICEF
study carried out by well-known US
economist Sylvia and Hewlett it's called
child neglect in rich societies UNICEF
usually deals with poor countries but
this one deals with rich countries and
it makes quite interesting reading
Hewlett studies the last 15 years and
she finds a very sharp split between two
different approaches to children she
calls an anglo-american model and a
continental Europe Japan model others
have found the same split the
anglo-american model Hewlett points out
is in her words a disaster for children
and families the European model in
contrast has improved their situation
considerably though the economic
problems faced or more or less the same
Hewitt like other writers attributes the
what she calls a disaster for
anglo-american of the anglo-american
model for children she attributes that
to the ideological preference for free
markets that's only half true
as I've mentioned whatever one wants to
call the reigning ideology it's unfair
to tarnish the good name of conservatism
by applying it to this form of violent
lawless reactionary statism which is
nothing much to do with markets except
for the poor well causes aside there
isn't much doubt about the effects of
the free market for the more vulnerable
what Hewlett calls the anti child spirit
that is loose in these lands speaking
primarily of the United States and
Britain this neglect filled
anglo-american model as she writes has
largely privatized child rearing while
making it effectively impossible for
most of the population and the result is
predictable a disaster for Children and
Families
in contrast in the much more supportive
European model social policy has
strengthened support systems for
families and children and it shows as
she demonstrates and it's no secret
there's a Blue Ribbon Commission of the
State Boards of Education and the
American Medical Association which
pointed out recently that never before
has one generation of children been less
healthy less cared for or less prepared
for life than their parents were at the
same age though remember that's only
true in the neglect filled
anglo-american societies were an anti
child and a family spirit has reigned
for 15 years under the guise of
conservatism and Family Values now
that's a remarkable triumph of
propaganda and a real tribute to the
Free Press and the intellectual
community a symbolic expression of this
disaster for children and families is
the fate of the there's an International
Convention on the Rights of the Child
when the UNICEF study came out it had
been ratified by a hundred and forty-six
countries but not the only one that
counts namely the United States although
for fairness we should add that
Reaganite conservatism is quite Catholic
in its anti child spirit so the World
Health Organization voted to condemn the
Nestle corporation for aggressive
marketing of infant formula which kills
many children in the third world
the vote was 118 to 1 well all that's
minor I should add as compared with what
the World Health Organization calls the
silent genocide they're referring to the
11 estimated 11 million children who die
every year as the result of free-market
policies for the poor and the refusal of
the rich to give what amounts to pennies
of Aid another symbolic expression of
the disaster is a new line of greeting
cards from the Hallmark Corporation one
of them says have a super day at school
and it's supposed to be placed under the
cereal box in the morning
the other said another says I wish I
were there to tuck you in that's
supposed to stick out under the pillow
at night the point is that parents just
aren't home
that's one effect of the anti child Andy
family spirit that's engendered by
conservatism with its respect for Family
Values in park this disaster for
children and families is simply the
result of falling wages state corporate
policy has in fact been designed to
increase inequality radically and it
succeeded in that people have to work
much longer hours to survive for much of
the population as the UNICEF report
shows parents have to work 50 or 60 hour
work weeks to parents merely to provide
necessities and the elimination of such
market rigidities as contracts and job
security means that you work extra hours
at lower wages or else that's a flexible
labor market and under those conditions
it doesn't take a great genius to
predict the consequences and the
statistics show it still going through
the UNICEF study contact time between
parents and children has is down about
40% and high quality contact time when
they're really interacting has virtually
disappeared for many families that leads
to destruction of family identity and
values leads to sharply increased
reliance on television for child
supervision or called latchkey children
with rising child alcoholism and drug
use criminality violence by and against
children and other obvious effects on
health and education and indeed ability
to participate in a democratic society
for that matter even survival I repeat
these are not laws of nature but they
are consciously designed social policies
with a particular goal which is being
achieved enrich the fortune 500 through
powerful welfare state for the rich
while conducting a what amounts to a war
against families and children and other
vulnerable sectors actually some of the
consequences is this receive a huge
amount of attention and in a very
enlightening fashion in the last couple
of weeks as I'm sure you've read major
journals have had not been lavishing
attention on several new books that are
concerned with falling IQ and scholastic
achievement New York Times for example
devoted an unusually long lead article
in the book review to this topic by
Malcolm Brown he opens by warning that
governments and societies that ignore
the issues raised by the books he
reviews will do so at their peril well
there's no mention of the UNICEF study
or in fact any others I've never seen a
review elsewhere either and or any other
study that deals with the war against
children and families in the
anglo-american societies which could
maybe have something to do with falling
scholastic achievement in IQ but that's
we're not supposed to talk about so what
question is it that we ignore at our
peril well it turns out to be quite
narrow none of these questions it turns
out that IQ may be partially inherited
and more ominously linked to race with
blacks breeding like rabbits and fouling
the gene pool now there's a real problem
one of the problems the one of the books
that Brown respectfully reviews suggests
that maybe black mothers don't nurture
their children because I'm quoting they
evolved in the warm but highly
unpredictable environment of Africa
that's real hard science you know which
we ignore at our peril on the other hand
we may and indeed we must ignore the
social policies based on free markets
for the poor and state protection for
the rich so we must and Brown does as
does everyone else ignore the fact that
in the city where the articles appear
richest city in the world 40% of the
children live below the poverty line
meaning deprived of any hope of escape
from misery and destitution poverty
level in the United States is twice that
of any other industrial country
next in the game is that true hasn't
quite saturating 'land which hasn't
quite reached us and then you get to the
European Japanese mo well could that
have something to do with the following
measures of IQ achievement or the other
consequences of the war against children
and families that's discussed in the
unmentionable studies well such
questions we have to answer we can
readily ignore them and that's a very
natural decision by the rich and the
powerful addressing one another and
looking for justifications for the class
war that they're conducting and it's
horrifying human effects well these are
examples of some of the uglier forms of
population control there are also more
benign variants which deserves some
mention and the benign variant the
rabble are supposed to be diverted into
harmless pursuits by the huge propaganda
institutions that are organized and run
by the business community they spend
hundreds of billions of dollars a year
incidentally half of it is in the United
States
with the goal of converting people into
atoms of consumption and obedient tools
of production at least when they're
lucky enough to get work crucially
isolated from one another and lacking
even a conception of what a decent human
life might be and that's important
normal human sentiments have to be
crushed they have to be beaten out of
people's heads they are inconsistent
with an ideology that's geared to the
needs of privilege and power an ideology
that celebrates private profit as the
supreme human value and denies people
right beyond with a can salvage in the
labor market I should say that this has
been going on for a century and a half
and is an interesting story in itself
and again I stress not everybody is
supposed to live under market discipline
only poor people the rich are to be
protected by an ever more powerful state
and by the global oligopoly that ensures
that policy will be insulated from
politics these contemporary advertising
onslaughts kill more than the mind and
the spirit they also kill people and on
a pretty impressive scale
one major exercise of state power under
Reagan Bush conservatism was there
updating of Britain's opium wars of 150
years ago when the British forced China
to accept Britain's exports of lethal
narcotics from its Indian colony and the
current revival relies on the threats of
trade sanctions against countries that
are unwilling to permit free import and
free advertising for today's leading
lethal narcotic leading killer namely
tobacco with just orders of magnitude
beyond illegal drugs and it's lethal
effects and the deaths from it and so on
the advertising of the US and British
giants targets primarily the most
promising new markets namely young
people and women much of East and
Southeast Asia has already succumbed the
u.s. threats these are backed by GATT
under the name of free trade of the US
Agriculture Department also trumpeting
free trade gives grants to tobacco firms
to promote smoking overseas in an effort
to stimulate the profitable slaughter
Asian countries have attempted
anti-smoking campaigns but they are
overwhelmed by the miracles of the
market reinforced by US state power
through the sanctions threat there's a
epidemiologist in Oxford University
who's really studied this and he asked
him recently study this he estimates
that among Chinese children under 20
today 50 million will die of cigarette
related diseases it's an achievement
that ranks reasonably high even by 20th
century standards well along with
democracy and rights markets are also
under intensive attack even if we put
aside the massive state intervention at
home and international economy
increasing under the Reaganites
the increasing economic concentration
and market control they alone offer
endless devices to evade and undermine
market discipline that's a long story
that there's no time to go into here but
just mentioned with one illustration
about 40% of what's called world trade
isn't really trade at all in any
meaningful sense rather its operations
that are internal to corporations which
happen to cross a border like the Ford
Motor Company sent something from one
assembly plant to another happens across
a border in the process that's called
trade those interactions are in fact
centrally managed by a very visible hand
with all sorts of mechanisms for
undermining markets and the interests of
profit and power in reality we have a
kind of quasi mercantilist system of
transnational corporate capitalism which
is just rife with the kinds of
conspiracies of the masters against the
public of which Adam Smith warned not to
speak of the traditional reliance on
state power and public subsidy there's a
1992 study of the OECD you know the rich
countries which concludes sorry for the
jargon but translated into English
afterwards oligopolistic competition and
strategic interaction among firms and
governments rather than the invisible
hand of market forces condition today's
competitive advantage and international
division of labor in high technology
industries as indeed in agriculture and
pharmaceuticals and services and major
areas of economic activity in general in
other words what really makes things
efficient is oligopoly you know big
corporations working together in quasi
conspiracies and interactions with the
state power that defends and protects
them that's what really works in today's
economy according to the organization of
the rich countries of the world well the
vast majority of the world's population
who are subjected the market discipline
and regaled with ODEs to its wonders are
not supposed to hear these words and in
fact they rarely do again some free
advice to those of you who want to make
it in the ideological institutions
you're not supposed to hear those words
or to understand them or certainly to
transmit them for the general population
be a bad mistake
supposed to talk about the miracles of
the market these tendencies are enhanced
by the free trade agreements that's just
another Orwellian term in reality these
pacts are designed to enhance investor
rights not free trade you look at them
closely there's a combination of
liberalisation and protectionism which
is very carefully geared to the
interests of the transnational
corporations that are supposed to
monopolize the technology of the future
the knowledge the future through highly
protectionist devices and of course to
rule the world economy that's very clear
when you look at them closely these
agreements including NAFTA and GATT are
neither free nor are they specifically
about trade and they are certainly not
agreements if by that term we include
the general public which by and large
has opposed them in most of the
countries however politics is insulated
from policy so it doesn't policies
insulated from politics so it doesn't
matter
these agreements these investor rights
agreements are likely to achieve the at
least enhance the basic goal namely to
accelerate the drift of global society
including the rich countries to a kind
of third world model a model where you
have islands of enormous wealth and
privilege and a growing sea of misery
and despair well to reverse this course
or at least to stem it and to restore a
bit of respect for the values of
classical liberalism as it really was
and that is an Enlightenment that have
long been forgotten for respect for
freedom and human rights to do that it's
not necessary to repeal the principles
of gravitation it's only necessary to
penetrate the clouds of deceit and
Distortion to learn the truth about the
world and act to change it that's never
been impossible it's never been easy
it's not impossible today and it's not
going to be easy today there's rarely if
ever been a time in human history when
that choice carried such enormous human
consequences
there's a mic there if anybody wants to
put their two or five or 20 cents in
here I can't but I don't have anybody
else can is this better
can you hear yeah okay twerking um
thanks for mentioning that demonstration
under member tents by the way um one
thing that's kind of interesting to
people who are paying attention to
what's going on in East Timor for me in
particular as someone who's involved in
the East Timor solidarity movement is
how it's become possible in the last
four or five six years to talk about
what's going on in Indonesia and even
the Washington Post and New York Times
had an article on Sunday
talking about these team were
specifically demographic shifts in the
population and everything else
what's conspicuously absent is any sort
of relevant context that looks at the
u.s. role in supporting this genocide
and everything else that usually talked
about in the context of you know
Indonesian annexation or whatever ignore
both the role the media and the role of
the US but the discussion exists which
seems to be something of an advancement
but removed from context seems to kind
of defeat the purpose of discussion at
all I was wondering if you might comment
on the significance that this discussion
has taken place for those who have tried
to open a discussion of these two
mourners responsibilities and what the
implications are that the discussion is
so removed from its product context yeah
actually it's an extremely revealing
case you want to learn something about
our own society and culture and values
and so on this is a very interesting
case it's not a minor one it's probably
the biggest slaughter relative to the
population since the Holocaust which
makes it not small it was mostly the
worst part of it was in the late 70s
under the Carter Administration it's
still going on I just gave the example
of one big massacre where maybe five or
six hundred people were killed which we
happen to know about for the act because
the accidents I mentioned but it's still
going on at the time in the late 70s it
was at about the scale of the pulp
massacres and relative to the population
much larger furthermore it was radically
different from the Pol Pot massacres in
one critical respect though nobody had
any idea about how to stop the Pol Pot
massacres but it was trivial to stop
this one we could simply follow a
Stanford one of the principles of the
Hippocratic oath which begins by saying
first do no harm then we'll talk about
other things in fact that massacre was
going on because the United States was
crucially supporting it the Carter the
US was providing it took the invasion
took place with the explicit
authorization of Henry Kissinger and
Gerald Ford who meet Kissinger at once
secretly although it leaked moved to
increase the sales of US arms including
counterinsurgency equipment to Indonesia
which already was 90 percent armed with
u.s. arms it's now known from leaked
documents that the British and Americans
and Australians knew all about it in
advance and followed it it was
continuing they as the before the
invasion coverage of East Timor was in
fact rather high surprisingly high the
reason was this was part of the
Portuguese Empire and there was a lot of
concern at the time that with the
Portuguese Empire collapsing
you know countries might do what's
called moving towards communism meaning
moving toward independence which is not
allowed so there was in that context a
lot of coverage of East Timor as the
invasion took place the coverage started
decline and it declined very sharply by
1978 when the atrocities reached their
peak coverage reached zero literally
zero in the United States and Canada
another big supporter in 1978 the Carter
Administration in fact rushed new
supplies of arms to Indonesia because
they're actually running out of arms and
the slaughter which maybe by then it
killed a couple hundred thousand people
where there had been any coverage well
at all it was simply repetition of
grotesque lies by the State Department
or Indonesian generals presented as news
and the front page well around the early
80s the change
that you described there began to be
some coverage although always excluding
the American role which was crucial for
example not only in providing arms and
but even diplomatic support and
furthermore it's not a secret like you
read the memoirs of our UN Ambassador
senator Daniel Moynihan who's greatly
praised for his defense of international
law
he describes it in his memoirs he was UN
ambassador when the Indonesian invasion
took place and he says something like
this is close to exact he says the State
Department wanted things to turn out as
they did and I was given the
responsibility of rendering the United
Nations utterly ineffective in any
action it might take I carried out this
responsibility with great success and
then he goes on to describe the effects
which he was not unaware of he says in
the first couple of months it seems
about 60,000 people were killed
approximately the percentage of the
population that the Russians that the
German the Nazis killed in Eastern
Europe during World War two that's what
that's Moynihan the great advocate of
international law and he's right that's
what happened SATA part wanted things to
turn out as he did and the u.s. ensured
that it did the Carter Administration
then came along and increased the flow
of arms the press did its job by
shutting up down to zero at the peak
point well there were a small there was
a very small number of people who were
found who were working on this literally
you know there probably weren't more
than a dozen I mean it was a tiny group
of activists working on it
finally they succeeded in getting
somewhere that began to be some press
coverage some conserved some congressman
is only mostly conservative congressmen
like Tony Hall got interested pressure
began to develop the coverage was
exactly as you say it completely wipes
out the record the most that the
sharpest criticism that you'll find is
the United States didn't try hard enough
to get Indonesia to stop its atrocities
or we didn't pay enough
- it just kind of like saying that you
know the Russians didn't try hard enough
to bring freedom to Eastern Europe you
know I didn't pay enough attention to it
that was their problem that's not fair
to the Russians if you consider the
comparison of what happened the by the
late 80s it was becoming real in the
United States thanks to a small and
indeed growing number of activists about
a year two ago it got to the point that
Congress actually passed legislation
banning US military training for
Indonesian officers because of these
human rights violations which that's
putting it very mildly that was kind of
embarrassing for the Clinton
administration but they got out of it or
right they announced that the law didn't
mean what it said rather what the law
meant was that the United States
couldn't train Indonesian military
officers with money from the United
States itself but if the Indonesian is
paid for it let's say with money we gave
him from some other pocket then it was
okay well Congress protested but it went
through the State Department with rare
delicacy picked the anniversary of the
invasion to announce this but things are
proceeding just to give you an example
in Boston on the first anniversary that
this something happened this week which
is relevant and shows you can really do
things there was a court case in Boston
this week where they where an Indonesian
general was brought under a civil suit
by the mother of one of the kids boys
who was killed in the dealy Massacre her
name is Helen Todd which explains why
the civil suit went through you figure
that part out she this suit what
happened is that when Indonesia was
carrying out this cover-up probably run
by some big public relations firm in the
United States after the dealy Massacre
one of the things they did was get the
generals out of the way so nobody would
see them and one of them was sent off to
Harvard to study
well some local people in Boston found
it out and went to hotly checked with
Harvard Harvard claims they've never
heard of you know but he was there he
was studying and they started protests
began to build up and then came my
favorite Boston Globe headline in
history on the first anniversary of the
dealy massacre it said in the nation
general facing suit flees Boston and
indeed that's what happened he fled
Boston and hasn't been seen since
meanwhat here the meanwhile the suit
went on there is a law which says that
you can bring civil suits against
tortures and murders and so on if they
happen to be on US soil
and he didn't show up so the the just
this week the judge heard the testimony
of Helen Todd and Ellen air and others
and was impressed and he now has a 14
million dollar fine Inc it's a civil
suit in case he ever shows up it's only
the same thing happened a year before
with one of Guatemala's leading killers
general gramacho the State Department
was grooming to be the next president
and he was shipped off to Harvard also
to refine his skills and that was
discovered he was one of the big mass
murderers from the early 80s he actually
I found out about that one from the
Central American press people approached
Harvard never heard of him you know but
Allan Nairn is very enterprising
journalist and imaginative he waited
until the Harvard graduation
commencement ceremonies which are
televised and as general gramacho was
coming up to receive his degree he raced
up in front of the television cameras
and served him with a subpoena on
television and that one he fled Boston
to and that came to court and he was
fine
ten million dollars well you know these
things are just show you can do things I
mean there's enough change so that in
the Indonesia is very worried about it
very worried they and things are getting
the point where they might actually
allow a referendum or something there's
possibility but it's going to take a lot
more pressure among the other things
that are not reported incidentally are
the fact that
I have yet to see a word about this in
the United States one of the main
reasons for the invasion of East Timor
which was well known at the time is now
completely public is that there's a big
oilfield of teamwork and the Australians
and the Western companies had been
trying to make a deal with Portugal to
exploit that oil and they hadn't been
doing too well and they figured that an
independent East Timor would be really
hard to deal with but Indonesia would be
easy because that's one of their boys
they've been running it for ever since a
big massacre that the West applauded in
1965 so in fact the Australian records
leaked diplomatic records show that they
said before the invasion we'll do better
with an in Asian takeover alright that's
been proceeding there's a treaty signed
between Australia and Indonesia to
exploit teamrees oil right after the
dealy massacre the West reacted by apart
from sending additional arms to
Indonesia by 15 Western oil companies
starting exploration in the Timor oil
fields now there are apparently some
promising strikes and were announced
just a few weeks ago there's also a
World Court case Portugal's challenging
in the World Court if you've seen a word
about this you've read something I
haven't read this is the mate one of the
major stories about teamwork so that
one's still under wraps but the point is
you know that things can be done and
this is a particularly dramatic case
because there were really a handful of
people doing and you know they're
getting somewhere maybe getting far
enough sort of policy could even change
particularly if there were parallel
efforts in other countries like Britain
is perfectly happy to take up the slack
and make as much money as they can by
selling arms Indonesia if the United
States backs off so it's got to be a
coordinated effort I just wanted to get
you to make a few comments about two
things one about how outside the
framework of the like industrial
monopolies in the United States how Cuba
has been able to survive this long and
how
can be an example for change and how
people can live a different way and also
how we can help Cuba and prevent on the
United States from destroying what
they've created by the most amazing
accident I happen to have another
leaflet in front of me
oh it's answers that question it says
that there's going to be a national
march on Washington on Saturday November
12th which is called by the end of the
end the u.s. blockade of Cuba coalition
and it calls upon Clinton to stop using
hunger as a weapon to threaten the Cuban
people and to start talks to normalize
relations incidentally those of you who
choose to go on that March and I hope
plenty will will be joining with the
entire world with the exception of two
countries namely the United States and
Israel which alone voted against the the
condemnation of this embargo at the
United Nations a few days ago New York
Times has yet to discover that fact
there was a vote the preceding year in
which the US was able to get three votes
Israel
the United States Israel and Romania but
apparently Israel you Rea need wrapped
off this year so you're not exactly in
isolation if you oppose it in fact what
the embargo and the effort to strangle
the decision the forum again
documents are available no the decision
to over the formal decision to overthrow
the government of Cuba was taken by the
Eisenhower administration in March 1960
that date is quite important had nothing
to do with Cold War to a Castro at that
time as any communist there were no
Russians around now the historians have
a different story like the court
historian of the Kennedy administration
Arthur Schlesinger had an article in The
Wall Street Journal recently in which he
opposed the embargo but he said well you
know it's a relic of the Cold War the
effort to overthrow the Castro
government became because it was
regarded as an outpost of Russian power
and it was fomenting revolution in Latin
America but now those days are over
well you know he knows that that's
complete fabrication the decision the
formal decision to overthrow the
government was long before with Russians
and there were no fomenting revolution
anywhere it was just going on an
independent path and remember this is a
country that the United States has
considered that it owns ever since the
1820s one of the earliest parts of
American history was you know foreign
relations was the decision by Jefferson
and John Quincy Adams and others that
this was the country that we had to take
Cuba the British Army Navy was in the
way at that time and they were at the
turrent so the decision in Adams words
was to wait until it falls into our
hands like a ripe fruit by the laws of
political gravitation it finally did and
the US ran in with the usual effects up
until 1959 almost immediately a tax on
Cuba began bombing of Cuba from Florida
and so on
then came the decision to overthrow the
government then Kennedy who radically
escalated the terror against Cuba and in
fact you know two levels previously
unheard of there's nothing comparable in
the history of international terrorism
and in addition came along the embargo
which was you know this is a little
country in the US sphere of influence on
him survive very long against a monster
it was able to survive thanks to Soviet
support but barely although it did you
know you can many things were achieved
it was also pretty tyrannical so it was
up in a downside but it was it was
succeeding in terms which were
meaningful to other people which is what
the United States was concerned about
the real crime of Cuba was not the
repression which whatever you think
about it doesn't come close to the kind
of repression we supported and in fact
implemented in nearby countries not even
close the real crime was that was the
successes and the threat of a
demonstration effect that as others
might try to do the same thing that's
what's known as rotten apple that might
in
spoil the barrel or virus that might
infect the region or something well in
1991 I guess the next step came along Oh
incidentally when when the Berlin Wall
fell in 1989 the Russians were out of
the game
we know that had an interesting event
take place nobody noticed it for 30
years the story had been we have to
defend ourselves against Cuba because
there's an outpost of the Russians okay
all of a sudden the Russians aren't
there so what happens well we have to
harshin we have to make the attack
against Cuba harsher and it's
interesting that the propaganda system
didn't skip a beat you know check back
and try to find that somebody noticed
this all of a sudden it turned out that
we were really we really had him under
an embargo because we're of our love for
democracy and human rights as is
illustrated for example by Columbia or
you know any other thousand other cases
so that's why we're trying to torture
them the Democrats got into the act at
that point a Liberal Democrat Robert
Torricelli who's head of the House Latin
American Affairs Committee and he pushed
through something called the democracy
and enhancement addict Cuban democracy
Act I guess it's called which makes the
embargo tighter now this proposal was so
obviously in conflict with international
law that Bush actually vetoed it
but then he was outflanked from the
right during the 1992 campaign by the
Democrats and he then accepted it it was
immediately denounced by all you have I
think every huge major US ally went
through the UN the way I described but
you know the u.s. makes its own laws we
don't care what happened the as the
Ambassador the UN said the other day in
a debate if possible we will act
multilaterally if necessary we will act
unilaterally violently she was referring
to Madeleine Albright that's the way it
is when you're the chief Mathi had done
if others will if you can get support
from others okay otherwise you do it
yourself because you don't follow any
rules that's us
in this case the the enhanced embargo
has been quite effective about 90% of
the aid and trade that had cut off was
food and medicine and that's had its
effects there are two major articles and
leading u.s. medical journals last month
October which described the effects of a
Health System which was extremely good
is collapsing there's a tremendous
shortage of medicines there's a shortage
of malnutrition is increasing rare
diseases that hadn't been seen since
Japanese prison camps in the Second
World War are reappearing infant
mortality is going up general health
conditions are going down in other words
working pretty fine we're enhancing
democracy and maybe we can ultimately
make them as well office say you know
Honduras or one of the countries that
we've been taken care of for all of
these years well that's what it's all
about
meanwhile the commissar class has to
give their version of it you know we
were defending ourselves against the
Russians and then all of a sudden we
discovered we love democracy but anyway
we got to keep crushing it's right now
the United States it's so isolated in
the world that it may not be able to get
away with it no matter how powerful we
are in fact even the US business
community is beginning to have second
thoughts being concerned that they might
be cut out of potentially lucrative
business operations if others just stop
obeying the laws imposed by the enforcer
that's another one that can be pressed
should be pressed the blockade is this
blockade is I mean sanctions in general
are free you know very questionable
operation but this one particularly when
they're not supported by the population
targeted this one is particularly brutal
and you know a real major crime in my
opinion anyway things can be done like
this march on Washington my name is
Robert Hastings and I'm live in Columbia
Maryland and I'd like to get your
comments and the irony of the fact that
this version of the talk you're giving
tonight is going to be broadcast on 100
stations community radio stations in the
United States the entire nation of
Canada by the organization that I
represent and that it's not going to be
heard here in Baltimore that this stuff
is not picked
at all in Baltimore and there's no
community radio involvement in this town
both of them somebody did tell me that
c-span is doing it true that's correct
and then of course there's Radio Free
Maine don't forget and right there's no
Radio Free Baltimore and to join me in
forming community radio station in
Baltimore and I'll be taking signups
after this event additionally I'd like
any thoughts or speculations that you
have why that in one of the richest
areas in the United States in terms of
frequency in terms of populace that
there's no community radio station where
the East Timor issue is discussed in
earnest where people with green hair
might get some time on the air and etc
do you have any speculations and why
that might be true here yeah I think so
it's not hard in fact just ask yourself
how if you were one of the principal
architects of policy and you had the
levers of power and wealth in your hands
what would you care more about a
community radio station say in Boston or
a community radio station in say Boulder
Colorado well there is one in Boulder
Colorado there isn't one in Boston in
fact the farther you get away from the
centers of power and doctrinal control
the more you find freedom and openness
not surprising like nobody cares all
that much what people think about and
say you know central Kentucky but they
care a lot what they think in places
like Washington and its environs in New
York in Boston and so on because they
have decision-making power and I think
you find that that's incidentally why
it's being you know you tell me I take
your word for it this is being broadcast
all over Canada but only in very
marginal places here but that's again
those are things that can be overcome
you know these aren't laws of nature at
all in fact you might ask yourself how
come that we're talking about community
radio why not mainstream radio well you
know the United States diverged from the
rest of the world on this issue
back around the 9th late 1920s early 30s
when radio was coming into existence
just coming along radio isn't like shoes
there's a fixed band which is going to
be rationed necessarily and the question
is how is it going to be done well as
far as I know every country in a
certainly every major country maybe
every country in the world except the
United States turned turns radio into a
public a public forum meaning it's as
Democratic as the country is like in
Russia and not democratic and written as
Democratic as England is and so on but
somehow a public in the public domain
the United States went the other way
it was privatized it was put into
private hands and furthermore that was
called a victory for democracy and and
this is unique when television came
along the same thing happened so now if
you want radio say that's not under
corporate control you have to go to
community radio stations on the Mart and
very important but of course limited
resources on the margins and so on and
they ought to be built up
thank you I agree with you on that I
want to say I'm happy to see you in
person I heard you many times on
Pacifica Network
quite a few times and just want to ask
maybe a couple quick questions I mean it
could be quick a few people also are are
waiting on one specifically is like
pertains to the coming like midterm
elections for Congress and the positions
on various congressmen and all of you
who bothered to vote actually which I
know is not many of you you better
listen up because this is probably a
most pertinent point regarding who is in
Congress and who is voting on this GATT
treaty in December and I was wondering
what is your opinion on a matter quite a
few people nowadays think that the World
Trade Organization is the de facto
government of the New World Order and
the GATT treaty they're voting on is
officially the constitution of the New
World Order government well what is your
opinion on that matter I'm wondering
well I've actually written it's a
complicated issue I don't think you
say anything simple the one simple thing
is I think there it should at least be
subjected to public discussion I mean
the idea this is something of major
significance you know and the idea of
allowing it to be rammed through on a
fast track without public discussion is
ridiculous and grotesque in fact so
whatever one thinks about it at least it
should become a topic for the general
public to become informed about and to
investigate and to look at and to think
about carefully that's point one that's
the easy part what should happen in that
public discussion well you know if that
public discussion ever comes along I'll
be glad to say what I think and I said
what I think is in fact mixed mixed I
mean like NAFTA it's a sort of a mixed
story I don't know of any major anyone
in fact who was opposed to a North
American Free Trade Agreement or 'the
american trade agreement the question is
what kind yeah okay and in fact like
take say nafta very mainstream groups
like for example the congressional
office of Technology Assessment can't
get more centrist than that that's
Congress's research organization they
came out with a very sharp and
intelligent critique of the executive
version of NAFTA the one that got passed
pointing out that in fact it was
designed as an investor rights agreement
which was going to drive both the United
States well the United States Canada and
Mexico all three of them towards a kind
of low wage low growth equilibrium they
didn't say high profit but also high
profit and they suggested very
constructive alternatives well that
never entered the discussion you know
that all the you heard was oh you know
crazy jingoist you know don't like
mexican workers and in fact the same is
true the labor movement labor movement
wasn't its proposals were nothing like
what was denounced in the press with
virtually 100% uniformity the labor
advisory committee had very which is by
law required to give its opinion on
these things but was cut out of
discussion illegally I never reported
they did come out with a report which
was quite constructive it wasn't against
an agreement it
against that agreement now when you turn
to get it's the same story you know you
take a look at these thousands of pay I
think the thing runs is huge document is
anybody in the world read that there are
two people in the world read it okay but
and in fact if you look at it it's a big
it's a mixture of many things let me
just mention one I'm the first of all I
should say that we're very ignorant
about this here but in the third world
they know a lot about it like you go to
India let's say and you get hundreds of
thousands of people demonstrating in the
streets about some of the provisions of
get which they know about maybe weird
dumb and stupid but they're not you know
like in the in peasant and understand
what's being done to them which is why
GAD has to be passed virtually at
gunpoint in countries like India well
were they upset about here's one thing
one of the parts of GATT as NAFTA is
what's called intellectual property
rights intellectual property rights is a
protectionist measure has nothing to do
is the opposite of free trade it
increases it does two things and a lot
of things but two crucial ones it
increases the duration of patents
meaning if say you know merck
pharmaceutical patent some drug thanks
to publicly subsidized work in the
universities for example then they the
they get a long much longer patent
instantly much longer patents than any
of the rich Western countries ever
accepted during the period when they
were developing it's only in the very
recent years they've him an honored
patent rights the United States never
did when it was a developing country so
0.1 patents are being much extended
secondly they're being shifted in
character traditionally up till now
patents have been what are called
process patents like if Merck going back
to that drug if Merck figures out a way
to create a drug the process is patented
but not not the product the GATT treaty
like NAFTA shifts that it's now the
product that's patent meaning in the the
Indian pharmaceutical industry or the
Argentine pharmaceutical industry can't
figure out a smarter way to produce the
same
drugged at half the cost and then get it
to their own population notice that this
is not only protectionist it's a blow
against economic efficiency and against
technological progress that shows you
how much a free trade is involved in
this actually there's historical
precedence on product patents and I'm
sure they're known that they gat
designers France for example about early
in the century had a chemical industry
but it lost it most of the chemists
chemical industry shifted to Switzerland
which is why Switzerland does big
chemical industry the reason was France
having that product patents which just
you know were such a barrier to
innovation and technical progress that
companies just went elsewhere
all right GAD is trying to impose that
inefficiency and opposition to progress
and high cost and certainly on the whole
world
now you know this means India has
already been forced to accept it a
couple of weeks ago they what they
called liberalize their pharmaceutical
industry meaning they open it up to
foreign penetration which means that
drug prices will shoot sky-high more
children will die so on and so forth
well you know this is one part of get
I'm in my opinion that's a part that
it's just absurd
I mean it's not absurd it's grotesque
it's part of the technique to ensure
that unaccountable transnational
corporations monopolize the technology
the future I don't see any reason to
push that through certainly anyone who
believes in free trade would be opposed
to that
so that's one part and you can talk at
other for about other ports you know but
I think you really have to think about
it you know like it's it can't you can't
just have a it's not you can't just have
slogans you know but one thing seems to
me clear we ought to be thinking about
it
meaning shouldn't be rammed through the
there were important considerations
there are very important questions at
stake which there is no no there is that
as a telling point there's a very big
debate on this Ghat question yeah how
your congressman or who you're gonna
vote or what you know what
they're voting for you know who knows
what they're voting for yeah another
well that's but that's part of the
hatred of democracy
I mean NAFTA was supposed to go through
on a fast track to the only reason it
didn't is because there was unexpected
popular protests which perhaps wake up
people there's a lot I mean I just
mentioned one thing there's plenty more
yeah could we okay you just make a
rebuttal to this I'm sorry I asked a
question but these people were kind of
okay on time if we if we can - yeah -
I'm told we can take two more questions
and I the innuendo is I should give
short answers to flight to say that good
you mentioned in your speech that
globalization of capital is basically an
attack on democracy and working people
give any ideas about how to organize
against the globalization of capital
yeah I mean it's different than it
there's one difference in scale which is
important in the past working people did
achieve many gains but that was within a
national framework and now the struggle
has got to be in an international
framework and that's a lot harder just
to give you an indication of how much
harder let me give an example you know
of the first shot one of the first tries
right after the NAFTA agreement the
Clinton administration was compelled by
public protests to add the NAFTA
agreement some verbiage about labor
rights and take it very seriously but
the wording is in there okay right after
NAFTA was passed two big US corporations
I think it was GE and honey will fired
labor organizers people are trying to
organize unions at plants in northern
Mexico okay normally that just happens
and it's the end of it reunions entered
UE and other Union I forget which
entered and protested with the Clinton
administration and they've got some
clout you know like they're not
corporations but they a lot more power
than Mexican either aren't Mexican Union
there's a government Union
just kind of like in Russia and there's
one independent labor union which is of
course opposed to NAFTA but it's under
terrific controls however the American
unions couldn't be completely ignored so
they called for you know the thing to go
to a panel to determine which means the
US Labor Department I think to determine
whether in fact there had been an
infringement on labor rights when these
organizers were fired and just last week
the Labor Department came out with its
decision which was that it was quite
okay because they had legal recourse
under Mexican law and therefore there
was no issue I don't know if any of you
are familiar with Mexican labor law and
the way it's implemented this doesn't
even rise to the level of polarity you
know but anyway that was the decision so
the firing goes through they're allowed
to apply for severance pay and so on
very happy
I'm sure GE is mourning the but that's
the kind of thing has to be done and
it's hard you know it means first of all
transnational popular organization and
struggling against very powerful enemies
like the national states including those
who call themselves liberal you know but
are really they have other masters so
that's by no means gonna be anything
easy but it has to be done the NAFTA for
example even its advocates if you look
closely even if its advocates conceded
that it was probably going to harm in
absolute terms the majority of the
population in both Mexico and and the
United States for example its advocates
here said well it's really good it'll
only harm semi skilled workers footnote
seventy percent of the workforce you
know New York Times had a very effed
after NAFTA after NAFTA was safely
passed they did their first analysis of
its effect it's very upbeat article
talking about how great it was going to
be for corporate lawyers and you know
PR firms and so on and so forth gonna be
really terrific and there was a footnote
there too it said well you know everyone
can't gain and I said there'll be some
losers women blacks Hispanics and
semi-skilled labor you know like most of
the people of New York you know but you
can't have everything and those were the
advocates so yeah it's this is so there
certainly are common interests across
the borders but they've got to be
mobilized and it's hard enough to do it
even in one country doing it across
borders it's gonna be extremely hard but
it just has to be done or else you can
just see where the future is gonna go
I'm there are very powerful centralized
forces which are got their own agenda
they're not making much of a secret
about it and you can see where it's
gonna lead you take a look at any
third-world country get a picture of
where it's gonna lead and the question
is that we want to live with it you
don't have to these aren't laws of
nature but they're not gonna be easy to
combat one short comment and then a
question first about Cuba I had the
pleasure of going to the Kennedy Museum
in Boston with some former Soviet Army
officers who were reduced to tears from
laughing at the film about the Cuban
Missile Crisis in which the country
Turkey is never even mentioned as a
pretext for Kennedy's for the missiles
Soviet placing of the missiles in Cuba I
just think that's an interesting part of
the ideological war against Cuba the
question I had to ask this whole I
wouldn't call it a debate but this whole
new effort in the media touting the
information superhighway is reminiscent
of the euphoria around television in the
mid-60s about the global village so on
and so forth and I tend to agree with
some of the critics of television that
who have argued that televisions main
effect has been as a medium of social
control dividing people some of the
themes you've brought up in past talks
as well what are your views about the
information superhighway is it a force
for democracy is a force for more
atomization or
what are its what are the pros and cons
well my feeling is that it's pretty much
like radio and television or for that
matter like automation you know the
Technic I mean most of the time you know
you can't you want to say 100% but most
of the time technology doesn't care
whether it's used to help people or harm
people it can be used to help people or
harm people but this very very rarely
anything inherent in the technology
which requires that one of those results
be the case and I think the information
Highway so-called is like that depends
who runs it as I mentioned back in the
1920 was late 1920s there was a battle
about who was going to run radio settle
different ways in different countries in
the case of television there wasn't even
a battle just got completely handed over
a private power here the on when this
one we're now facing another such
conflict if it gets into the hands of
private power we know exactly how it's
gonna look like they've been telling us
I remember reading an article somewhere
forget where I think you may be in The
Wall Street Journal or somewhere talking
about the wonders of the information
highway and this is from memories I mean
I have it exactly right but it was
something like this they were describing
the great things that could be done cuz
it was interactive you know it's not
just passive anymore now you can really
do things when you're sitting in front
of the test so they said well look with
the two you know they said look there's
two you know here's the way it's going
to work and then they gave two examples
one for women and another for men for
women it's gonna be an incredible
home-shopping thing like you know you're
sitting there watching some model and
she shows you some ridiculous thing and
you figure well I better have that or my
kid won't grow up properly so now it's
interactive so you can just push a
button and you know I mean you know then
they send it right over or something
like that so that's the interactive
stuff for women for men the example that
was given with something like watching
the Super Bowl which every red-blooded
male is supposed to be doing and now
it's just passive you just watch the
gladiators fighting but you know the new
stuff is going to be interactive so what
they're gonna what they suggest is that
before you know like while they're in a
huddle and getting the instructions from
that coach about the next play they're
gonna ask everyone in the audience you
know have all the male population to
which is alive you know open to to push
to make their own decision like should
it be a pass or a run or kick or
something and then after the play is run
they'll flash on the screen what people
thought so that's gonna be four men well
I may have the example a little bit
wrong but it was some story like that
yeah that's the way it's gonna go I mean
it'll be used as a technique for control
and manipulation and turning into you
know mindless consumers of things you
don't want them so on and so forth yeah
sure why should those who own the place
do anything different but it doesn't
have to be like that it depends who
controls it if it's controlled by the
public it can be something quite
different it can be a technique of you
know for example these these information
processing systems can be methods by
which working people can control their
own workplace without managers and
bosses it means that every person you
know in the workplace can have
information in real time you know like
when it counts to make decisions about
what ought to be done well that's a very
democratizing device it would wipe out
you know the core of the whole system of
authority and domination but it's not
gonna develop unless you know unless
people fight for it
in the 1920s before this whole media
apparatus got so centralized and so
capital-intensive there was a place
namely the partisan press where these
sorts of debates could go on we're in
that debate go on in the age of
television others are in small forms
look I mean I'm you're right I mean
through in fact the late 30s there was
still quite a lively working-class and
popular press and you know in ethnic
communities and labor movement and so on
and so forth fine I got wiped out by you
know resource concentration what's
called market forces so the thing is
rebuilding you know let me I think we're
supposed to end now so let me just end
with by
a genuine conservative not these guys
not the newt gingrich's who were status
you know status extremists genuine
conservative who was so conservative
that Thomas Jefferson wouldn't let his
works be read at the University of
Virginia when he created it namely David
Hume an eighteen a major
eighteenth-century figure who indeed was
a true conservative he has a book called
principles of government in or something
like that in which he discusses he
raises in it what but he has it regards
it describes are kind of a paradox of
government and it's very real and very
real today too
he said how come he said look if you
look at any government in the world
whether it's the most oppressive state
or the most free you always find one
constant namely force is in the hands of
the governed the people who are being
ruled they basically have the force if
they get together and use it so how come
they submit to Authority which almost
invariably is used to harm them that's
the paradox and then he says well of
course forces you know you can control
people by force says that's not enough
is it ultimately its opinion it's
through opinion only that the governed
submit meaning flood control it control
people's minds you can control them even
though they have the power well you know
that's what the struggle for democracy
has been all about and sometimes it goes
forward sometimes it goes backwards
recent years has been going backwards
but it can go forwards again that means
you know people can are certainly
capable of thinking the capable of
understanding things they need
information they need opportunities they
need forums they need organizations but
those are things that are created by
human will and human activity they don't
grow out of you know they don't come
from molecules meeting or cosmological
forces so you know people want to create
them they create them and that can make
the difference exactly as Hume said an
indeed feared because he
you want the public to be involved okay
we got a we got a little bit of a
release the people who are standing
there but nobody more I can't see how
many there are with the lighting for
more okay you guys get your chance if I
could just before that make an
announcement there are some there are
some response sheets that we've passed
out if before you leave I just want to
make sure we get everybody before you
leave if you could pass them in toward
the center aisle because they're
extremely important to us for scheduling
future guests okay and okay go ahead hi
my name is Bruce crit I'm a student at
the University of Maryland Baltimore
County I never fail to vote but what
from what you're describing about both
the Republican administrations and the
Democratic administrations specifically
Clinton Carter and Kennedy as well as
the Nixon administration I wonder you
know maybe my voting power my ability to
change the system by voting seems a
little bit limited and also of course
the other the other possibility is just
getting in the information out which was
something else that you suggested I mean
even if everybody knew everything that
that you were saying that you're talking
about with regard to the collusion
between the capitalists and the the
government of the United States given
the separation between policy and
politics what can we do even after
everybody in the world knows about these
things
even if we succeeded in telling
everybody about all of these things and
everybody knew what do they do what I
mean what specifically what direct
action can the population take what what
are the most important direct actions
that the population intake against this
collusion against this complex
well you know with regard to voting I
don't think there's a general principle
I mean you just make your decisions I
don't think it's it's usually not a
major decision like it's not gonna have
a affect on things it may have some
effect on things so you just decide like
is it important enough to have an effect
in this in that case and there's no
general principle but on the other
question what can be done well you know
everything can be done everything can be
done up to the point of eliminating all
structures of authority and repression
they're all create their human
institutions they can be dismantled if
you ask yourself what's the most
important well you know then you know we
it's not the kind of thing you decide in
a meeting like this I mean those are the
kinds of decisions that come by serious
thought among people are really trying
to institute change now you know
typically the I mean given the world the
way it is you start with where the world
is okay like you don't start by saying
ok let's overthrow transnational
corporations ok I think that's what
because it's just not within range No so
you start with saying look here's where
the world is what can we begin to do
well you can begin to do things which
will get people to understand better
what the source of real power is and
just how much they can achieve like you
can start by say force we can start by
getting us to stop torturing people
right like there's easy things to do or
getting you know stop killing children
and Cuba let's say stop you know
massacring in East Timor those are easy
things so let's do those first do the
easy things with regard to the domestic
scene takes a crime the crime bills I
mean they're just like I said they're
the domestic equivalent of death squads
the fact that they're targeting
vulnerable populations who are being
turned into people under military
occupation look that's not that's an
easy one to change I mean you really
just have to change opinion on that one
get you know that's it's it's the you
aren't striking at the core of private
power when you begin to have a civilized
criminal system instead of a brutal
barbaric one so that one I think is
changeable what
the war against children and families
another case that I mentioned well
that's another easy one I'm in the Anglo
you know the European Japanese model
instantly it's not pertinent I don't
want to suggest it so beautiful except
in comparison to errors but those are
countries very much like us you know
they have the same institutions the same
economy and so on and so forth they have
simply you know not been subjected to
the unilateral business power as much as
here for all kind of historical reasons
and we can certainly become like those
countries you know there's in fact a
model sitting right in front of
countries very much like us
it takes a health care well you know the
u.s. is off the spectrum on that one to
again I think for the same reasons I
mean even if you just look a couple of
miles to the north there's a country
very much like us which happens to have
instituted a semi civilized again plenty
of things wrong with it but assembly
similar civilized system of health care
not that far back back in the 1960s
under conditions that we could easily
duplicate well those are things that I
don't want to say those things will be
easy but they're within range on things
like GATT you're getting at the harder
territory because here crucial interests
of authoritarian institutions are at
stake and then you're going to begin to
face the fact which after all is a fact
that sooner or later you have to face
that may be the most totalitarian
institution in human history are
certainly close to it as a corporation
it's an institution which with power in
which authority goes strictly from top
to bottom if you're in ultimate Lea it's
in the hands of owners and investors if
you're inside the system you take orders
from above and transmit them down if
you're outside the system there are very
weak popular controls which indeed are
eroding I should say that this is not an
inside of mine that was pointed out by
Thomas Jefferson in his later years when
he warned these just the early days of
corporations he warned that if pride if
you if power was going to shift into the
hands of what he called banking
institutions and moneyed in corporations
then we then the democratic experiment
would be over we'd be back to an
absolute war form of absolutism worse
than what they struggled against Thomas
Jefferson is not exactly a figure who's
off the spectrum an American you know
American history so you know this is not
a new insight it's as American as apple
pie we should recognize what Thomas
Jefferson could see in fact Adam Smith
but when you see that you realize that
it's a hard nut to crack because there
are enormous agglomerations of power
indeed concentrating and indeed
transnational which are protected from
scrutiny or from popular action and
that's got to change
after all why do corporations have the
rights they do why are they treated as
immortal persons contrary to the
warnings of people like Adam Smith and
others it was not by law you know this
was by decisions made in courts and by
judges and by lawyers which simply
changed the climate totally and that can
be reversed two institutions can be
under popular control including the
economic institutions well you know
organizing to try to achieve that is a
much more long-term operation but it's
got to begin somewhere you know so if
yes what should be done well you know I
don't think any sane human being and
look around the world around them and
not figure out things that have to be
done I'm gonna take a walk through
Baltimore you know you'll find plenty of
things that have to be done so you know
you get started doing some other more
broader and scale so you know you think
about those but they're not going to
people you're not gonna do them alone
like if you take a walk down the streets
of Baltimore and you say oh yeah that
ought to be done nothing's going to
happen on the other hand if people are
organized enough to act about it yeah
they can achieve things and there's no
particular limit what they can achieve
and that's why we don't live under
slavery or under feudalism and so on
mention specific organizations that are
involved that they're involved in
breaking apart this collusion if you
want I know you can't I know you can't
mention specific actions but can you
mention organizations that are involved
in working on this problem specifically
the problem of collusion between
corporations and government well you
know a lot of organization
are involved from different points of
view for example I mean like take say at
one level which is important though of
course their official Nader's Public
Citizen is involved but that's important
as I say but kind of not really touching
the structure of power beyond that I
mean any you know if the American labor
movement ever recovers the insights that
ordinary working people and in fact the
labor movement had a hundred years ago
it'll be working against them you go
back a hundred years and in fact up
until much more recently than that and
the major you know the major thrust of
the labor movement was what was
sometimes you know industrial democracy
placing the workplace under Democratic
control I mean that wasn't you know you
didn't read that in Marx I mean
everybody figured it out after himselves
long before Marx and that's the he
didn't he in fact didn't say anything
much about it the this is you know it
could be the labor movement let's say
and in fact just about every you know
any there's tons of activism going on on
usually focused on pretty narrow issues
but they all ultimately they're all
talking about illegitimate authority of
one form or another and their interests
and our common and you know they just
they have to be built up and extended I
mean I you know I have my own views as
to if you want some lists you know it's
easy to find there's easy to find lots
of lists so if you write to any of the
major funding organizations Lex they
resist in Boston they'll be delighted to
give you a list of a couple hundred
groups they funded in the last couple of
years and you will find among them
groups involved in anything you can
imagine or if you go to eat some I mean
I'm sure there's some church based group
and either bought Baltimore or
Washington I don't know they're seen
well enough which is a center for you
know a coordinating center for all kinds
of peace and justice activities now
you'll find anything in the world
they're just about and that happens
everywhere
thank you very much I just have two
questions and I'm sit down do you see
the American political system hidden for
civil war and second of all do you see
the red lines of the Great Depression
rain is here again in the contemporary
stage in which we live in today speaking
of the industrial country rice of course
in the third world it's all over yeah
well with regard to the bread line first
of all the US has I mean I thought the
last I saw there about 30 million people
and then according to the studies that
have been done the best 30 million
people are suffering hunger in the
United States the take say Boston where
I live which is a very rich City and in
fact may be the world's leading medical
center there's you know there are very
fancy hospitals but there's there's also
a hospital that works for you know
that's the City Hospital so like
everybody goes to that hospital which is
not not a bad Hospital I should say they
a couple of years ago they established a
malnutrition clinic because they were
beginning and after the impact of
reaganism was felt they were beginning
to defined in boston third-world levels
of malnutrition and if that got worse
over the winter because families had to
make a choice you know do you let your
kids starve or you let them die of the
cold no okay that's you know one of the
richest cities in the world
major Medical Center I mean bread lines
are if we don't have bread lines we have
the equivalent over 30 million people's
a lot of people and that's plenty of
children and so on and it's going to
grow you know what about I mean it's not
starvation like say Haiti you know
Nicaragua Cuba or something but it's
probably worse than Cuba in many places
but it's real you know and it has
long-term effects I mean when kids are
suffering malnutrition that has a
permanent effect has an effect on their
lives you know they'll never get over
the and that that's just criminal in a
country as rich as this or anywhere for
that matter as to the Civil War you know
I'm not I think it's very much up in the
air what's gonna happen in the United
States there's an experiment going
the experiment is can you marginalize a
large part of the population regard them
as superfluous because they're not
helping make those dazzling profits and
can you set up a world in which
production is carried out by the most
oppressed people with the fewest rights
in the most flexible labour market and
production is for the rich people of the
world so this can be done
internationally now so I like the old
days when the economies are more or less
national so can you get you know I say
can you get women in China to work in
factories where they're locked in and
they die in factory fires you know
because as this happening incidentally
can you get them to produce the toys
that are sold that are sold in stores in
New York and Baltimore where rich people
buy them to give them to their children
for Christmas and that's sort of to give
an example that's a real example
incidentally can you have an economy
where everything works like that so
production by the most impoverished and
exploited for the richest and most
privileged internationally and with
large parts of the general population
just marginalized because they don't
contribute to the system in say Columbia
murdered in the knee in New York locked
up in prison you know can you do that
nobody knows the answer to that question
could it lead to a civil war it
definitely could it could lead to
uprisings you know revolts there are
other things to worry about the United
States happens to be an extremely
fundamentalist country it's kind of like
a brand sort of if you look at it it's a
deep it's a religious fundamentalist
country that's again off the spectrum in
this regard
it's not like other industrial countries
but none come close and that's a very
dangerous phenomenon my
it means that there's deep irrationality
which can be whipped up by demagogues
you know the newt gingrich's
these guys can whip up hatred fear you
know they can appeal to religious
fundamentalist urges and so on and
that's scary scaring most of the world I
should say if you recall the last
Republican National Convention it opened
with God and country rally which was
televised and I was seen around the
world and in Europe particularly it
really sent chills up people's spines I
mean they remember the Hitler's
Nuremberg rallies you know at least
older people do and it had something of
that tone and it's kind of striking you
know unnatural that the Republican I
don't mean to say the two parties are
all that different I gave some examples
to illustrate the opposite but there's
some difference between them
the Republicans are openly and
outspokenly the party of business they
don't make much of a pretense to be
anything else and that means that the
only way they can rally the public is
behind jingoism fear hatred slander you
know other techniques which have been
used quite effectively to can to
organize great masses of people and
times of real distress we don't have to
go back very far in history to find that
Germany in the 1930s was maybe the most
civilized and advanced country in the
world all right it was possible but but
plenty of problems and it was possible
to whip up hatred fear and to mobilize
people and in fact the carry out certain
you know what from their point of view
with social development even and you
know with consequences that you're
familiar with yeah that could you know
why are we different we got the same
genes and the conditions in the culture
that might be part of the background for
that they exist on the other hand there
are other things it this is you know
that there's a streak of Independence
and opposition to Authority in the
United States which is maybe also unique
in the world
that's a very healthy thing can show up
in antisocial ways like running around
with assault rifles but it could also
show up in healthy ways and the trick is
to make it show up in healthy ways like
opposition be legitimate Authority which
it could do this is maybe the country in
the world that most protects freedom of
speech I happen to think that's a very
good thing I know a lot of people don't
agree but I think it is and that was won
by centuries a struggle
I mean freedom of speech was achieved in
the United States really through the
civil rights movement which finally got
the Supreme Court to knock down the
centuries-old laws against the criticism
of state power that came right through
the civil rights movement well you know
those are gains that are real and that
offer a basis for doing things so you
know it's complicated
yeah could it be a civil war could be
very unpleasant a lot of very very ugly
things could happen they're not
inconceivable but they're also not
inevitable I don't my question is a what
question you all studied linguistics so
that means I guess language as an
extension communication one of the
biggest problems or the biggest problem
is communication most people don't
understand each other don't hear each
other don't listen to each other more
important than anything else what do you
think are some ways of getting people to
like we require how do we reach other
people because we have basic
understandings we all appreciate the
same ideas we use different words to
express ourselves how do we reach the
average person out there when the mass
media is controlled so the TV and radio
are out sure you've got the home
computer and you got more copy shops in
a little bit and Kinkos open 24 hours a
day but most of the people can't read
information and even more of them don't
understand what they have read what are
you some of your ideas because I work
with an organization that is trying to
reach people better on it on a common
level too
just to do just that thank you well
first of all let me just I think one
preliminary point I'll answer that
question is a human being and which I
have no more to say about it than you do
but I'm not going to answer it as a
linguist because linguistics tells you
it's zero about that topic and in fact
that point can generalize take any
question of human significance and the
fact of the matter is there's very
little understanding about it nothing
very little in the sciences or the you
know people pretend otherwise that's for
power reasons and career reasons and so
on but outside of a very small number of
areas like physics and mathematics and
actually linguistics is one of them
outside of extremely small number of
areas which usually with which happen to
deal not with problems of immediate
human significance the level of
understanding is fairly shallow meaning
it's as accessible that it's accessible
to everybody you know like I learned a
lot of the stuff I know from people who
never went to school you know and that's
standard because the level of
understanding is just not that profound
so you're not gonna go to the sciences
or you know to find answers to these
questions you can get pretences from you
know the educated sectors about the
answers but not the only pretenses you
know the answer your question as well as
I do so you know we you and I can talk
about what to do about it and I got no
more to say than you do and in fact I
don't think there are any tricks it
seems to me the tricks are the old ones
if there are any new ideas they've been
kept a deep dark secret
I mean organization is a hard job you
know it begins by getting people to be
willing to let's take sake places that
are much worse off than we are like take
say Latin America you know where the
suffering is much worse than here well
you know back in the nineteen sixties
and seventies elements of the church the
churches did begin to face this problem
and they began in a pretty sensible way
dealing with the culture as it existed
so you most should know the story it's
an important one they began by setting
up
comunicate going in peasant society in
among peasants or you know workers or
whatever women ending group they started
by setting up you know what came to be
called based communities where people
would do things like read the Gospels
and think talk to each other about what
it really meant you know and then work
on things no I mean I remember seeing
some of these base communities where
they were trying to get people to get to
keep S on societies are often very
hostile you know and then one that I
went through they there was actually a
very conservative order of nuns we're
trying to get local peasants to agree to
work together enough so that they could
get a common well okay you know instead
of each going out with a cup of water to
try to pick something up from the you
know stream well you know that's that
was hard and it it when it's done you
can go on to bigger things I mean it got
to a point in Central America where you
and I had to spend our tax money to have
these people murdered because that's
what happened in the eighties there was
a big war fought to destroy the people
who were trying to do that you know it's
symbolic that it but real that the
decade started with assassination of an
archbishop and ended with the
assassination of Jesuit intellectuals
all by forces arm trained and paid for
by you and me you know and what happened
in between was just more slaughters in
terror and Massacre because people were
doing we're answering the kind of
question that you're asking but under
much harder circumstances we don't face
those circumstances and what you know
organizers including priests and nuns
and others did in Latin America we don't
face those problems it's a lot easier
for us and I don't know of any tricks
that they didn't figure out or that
haven't been figured out through history
it's just a matter of going out and
doing you want to organize people fine
you go organize people I mean I somebody
the first question or raised the
question of East Timor boy if you can
think of a case that would be hard to
get people interested in that's
you know Americans by and large don't
even know that Canada exists you know
let alone that the East Timor exists but
so this went on in secret you know
nobody was interested everybody
in power wanted it to go on but a half a
dozen or so people finally managed to
break through how by the ordinary
techniques that we all know that you
know lobbying organizing pressure groups
letter-writing you know everything
that's where you do it there are no
other ways to question first what is the
political ramification of the crime bill
yes as it relates to the new world the
new crime right as we relate to the
world order and also what is the
relation of the world order to the
family value that is being charted
across America that is being traded
across America well I don't really have
a lot to add to what I said before I
mean just to summarize the I mean the
crime bill I think is a natural reaction
on the part of the people who sort of
own the society to the problem of a lot
of superfluous people around who aren't
making profits for them well a natural
reaction if you if you're living in El
Salvador El Colombia or someplace like
that a natural reaction is actually what
they call down there social cleansing
you send out the security forces to just
murder people in the streets like the
Brazilian police you know where we had
this success story of american-style
capitalism one of the parts of the
success stories and Brazilian police
just go out and murder street children
you know they murder them that's all
okay that takes care of that problem
here the crime bill I think fulfills a
similar objective it controls parts of
the population that are defenseless they
don't have to worry about them and that
are superfluous in the sense that
they're not contributing to profits oh
that's a definite part of the New World
Order because the New World Order is
turning most of the world into
two-tiered societies
you know with little sectors of wealth
and a large mass of poverty and you got
to control them so that's the crime bill
Family Values yeah it's just I think
it's just what I say it's just what the
unis I'm not me though what the UNICEF
report described in very mainstream
report I was quoting there has indeed
been a war in the United States and
England and to some extent the other
anglo-american societies like even as
far as New Zealand there's been a war
against families and against children
because human values are being as part
of the general attack on human
sentiments and human values which
remember are inconsistent with
capitalism now you know we don't have a
capitalist society as I said it's a very
you know the wealthy want a real
powerful state to defend them a
capitalist society wouldn't survive for
five minutes but we're sort of off
toward the capitalist end of the
spectrum and in a capitalist society if
it was pure your rights would be what
you can earn in the market period you
know any other right and since we're
sort of off to that end of the spectrum
and we try to impose those values on
essentially defenseless and vulnerable
people okay
children don't have the right to be with
their parents parents don't have the
right to take care of their children
because you don't get there that's
that's a human right you don't win that
right isn't conferred by the labor
market therefore it doesn't exist
so therefore ippolit the design of
policies happens to be such as to
undermine those rights kind of
irrelevant if you don't have rights
other than those you've been on the
market so the fact that these societies
led the war against children and
families is understandable and not
pretty particularly when you think that
these are the most advantaged societies
in the world I mean we're the richest
country in the world just by a long shot
there's nobody who comes close you know
you took a look take a look at the
natural advantages of the United States
in terms of resources and opportunities
and so on there's just no one close you
know I mean once the native population
was exterminated and eliminated you just
had this extraordinarily rich place you
know unparalleled wealth you know they
had slaves to build
keep cotton cheap for you you know so
you could have an Industrial Revolution
everything you know capital flowing in
no enemies I mean just happened to be
you know kind of an ideal place to
become very rich and powerful and
wealthy and we're way beyond anyone else
so the fact that we have these problems
is it's bad enough that anyone does but
you know the fact that we have them is
an absolute disgrace what it shows us
that the system is a social and economic
system is a catastrophic failure and it
doesn't have to be you know we have the
resources to make it better but of
course left alone it's going to work
towards undermining values that don't
express themselves as commodities on the
labor market on the market and that
includes like relations between parents
and children so usual question do we
decide to let it happen
