alright are you familiar with the the
book the same Society favorite for Mom
yeah in the book he's talking about the
alienation of man and depression
capitalist society
I thought those very relevant still 50
years later today do you agree with that
and make it up because I mean Marx
talked about it in the early manuscripts
in fact from edited the early
manuscripts and about alienation of
Labor and so on a he extended it and
Marx didn't and then it either comes out
of the Romantic tradition which he grew
up about how if people work at the
command of others their work and lives
don't mean anything to them if they
create themselves then it does mean
something to them it's the core
alienation and it generalizes over the
society when people are atomized
separated from one another and so on and
he was I think that book must have been
in the 50s yeah and he was he was
discussing a situation which was then
developing after the Second World War
the Great War you know Second World War
and the depression that radicalized
people if you look at the public mood by
the late 40s around the world but in the
United States too it was pretty radical
there were pressures that you inferred
workers to take over industry and so on
and that caused real fear in the
business community which pretty much
runs the country and huge programs were
initiated to try to drive the society
back to obedience massive programs this
is pretty good scholarship on it but you
know captive audiences and factories
were given lectures on you know what
they call economics or you know
Americanism and so on the that took over
they infiltrated hid infiltrated
churches schools sports leagues almost
anything you can think of at the same
time a huge social engineering problem
was in sect was instituted probably the
biggest one in world history and bigger
than anything stalin contemplated namely
suburbanization of america it began with
a literal conspiracy you know sent to
court find a couple thousand dollars by
General Motors
Firestone rubber and Standard Oil of
California - who brought up the pretty
efficient electric rail system in Los
Angeles and maybe law of California at
least Los Angeles and converted it to
use by trucks buses cars and so on
obvious to their benefit I mean disaster
for Los Angeles in my opinion but anyway
that's what happened they went to court
they were taken to court for conspiracy
and find enough for their dinner victory
dinner and celebration I think that and
that it was picked up by the government
state and federal government during the
fifties
Eisenhower instituted something which
Obama says he's taking this model namely
the what's called the National Defense
highway system if you carry out a
government program you have to put the
word defense in there otherwise people
aren't gonna pay for so it was the what
idea was well will transport missiles
around the country
some learn at the emotion like that but
it was it was simply a means along with
that when to the development of the
infrastructure for airports air dry air
Commerce and so on well and of course a
nothing for railroads they are allowed
to deteriorate well the whole point of
this is to create an economy based on
fossil fuels on the individual
automobiles not public transportation
and also to spread the country out real
estate laws were changed as an estate so
is sort of try to scatter the population
destroy this is pretty much destroy the
inner cities scatter the population
arrange it so that where people live
you're gonna have two cars because you
have to get to them all and good work
the other thing all right it's a huge
project
and one of the consequences is what from
cold alienation communities have broken
down the natural entities of Brooklyn's
own and people are kind of way impelled
to be out to themselves
okay then they're alienated from the
surroundings it leads to mls of various
kinds and that's been it's only I have
none against suburbs in fact I live in
one it's very pleasant but it does have
these consequences one of its
consequences which wasn't considered
much in the fifties is it's going to
destroy the environment but
so yes the the comments both alienation
and work of labour and of life mean more
now than they did then the site is very
atomized now people feel alone they feel
helpless it even shows have Nichole's
like astonishing 80% of the population I
think that the country the government
does not work for the people it works
for a few big interests who are looking
out for themselves but they also feel
they can do nothing about it
this even shows up in other things like
a huge percentage of the population I've
forgotten the numbers I think that the
Bush administration either was
responsible for 9/11 or might have been
responsible for it really a huge portion
it's pretty high I think it's over a
third or something like that
a lot of people you know but quite
interestingly they don't think there's
anything that you can do about it ok so
our government is a bunch of mass
murderers who are trying to slaughter us
but what can I do
that's a nation carried out to the
indescribable degree that people just
feel helpless hopeless and you can
understand why you can't do anything as
an individual and you don't have any
organizations that's part of the reason
for the intensity of the attack on
unions they really are instruments of
democratization for workers education
for exchanging ideas for making plans
for entering it the political action and
so on and I can remember from childhood
my I look to grow up in the depression
as a kid that the only answer unemployed
the seamstresses and that's everything
but they had a union and that was a
center that their life turned around
cultural life even things like a
vacation or some sense of unity oh
there's this you know the slogan the
labor movement of solidarity
the opposite of solidarity Xillia nation
so yeah these things and it certainly
has increased and it's still increasing
so if you look at Obama's budget a lot
of the money for infrastructure but very
little for a little but not much for
mass transportation which is essential
and almost nothing about trying to do
something about reconstruction social
life - under - under you know to reverse
the effects of these massive social
engineering problems that are creating
ecological disaster and alienation and
so on
