so again it seems like these giant
companies Google Facebook Apple Amazon
they work together with the government
right there there's a benefit for that
the government doesn't wear your helmet
earlier I mean they're working mainly
with the corporate chain but like in
China for example it doesn't say how are
the China is different
that's a centralized deeply
authoritarian state when the government
runs runs it controls of the
industrially my pride has a dominant
control over the private system that's
not like you're here it's more the other
way around I guess it goes into what you
often hear from right-wing libertarians
when they say that government can't
really regulate corporations because of
regulatory capture and because
government to some degree is the one
empowering these corporations to begin
with so how do people really effectively
fight back under this corporatist system
that we have well that's a strange
argument it's saying since government
regulation only sometimes works let's
get rid of it
that's a brilliant argument yes it
sometimes works sometimes there's
regulatory captured but the real problem
is look just think about it for a minute
almost every everybody spends most of
their life living in a totalitarian
system it's called having a job when you
have a job you're under total control of
the of the masters of the enterprise
they determined what you wear when you
go to the bathroom what you do the very
idea of a wage contract is selling
yourself into servitude these are
private governments there are more
totalitarian than governments or but
they can't legally
murder you or they can't legally murder
you but they can control everything that
you do okay well I gather the right-wing
libertarian argument be while you're
free to leave at any time yes you're
free to store
right you have a choice between starving
or selling yourself to a tyranny very
libertarian the right-wing libertarians
whatever they believe are actually a
deep authoritarians they're calling for
subordination to private tyrannies the
worst kind of tyrannies
