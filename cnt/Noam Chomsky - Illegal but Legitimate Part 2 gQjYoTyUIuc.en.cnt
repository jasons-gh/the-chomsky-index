the assumption of the unique moral
virtue of the United States the
assertion of its mission to reform the
world to redeem the world by spreading
its professed ideals and the American
Way of life and the faith in the
nation's preordained destiny the
theological framework undercuts reasoned
debate and it reduces policy to a choice
between good and evil therefore reducing
the ever-present threat of democracy
critics can be dismissed as
anti-american an interesting concept
borrowed from the lexicon of
totalitarianism the issue of defense
against Britain the only potential enemy
never even at rose remotely the British
Minister Minister Castlereagh was so
eager to cement anglo-american relations
they even overlooked Jackson's murder of
two innocent British citizens which
atoms defended for as he put it for its
salutary efficacy for terror and example
weeks suggests that Adams was heating
the words of tacitus his favourite
historian that crime once exposed had no
refuge but in audacity the goal of atoms
is diplomacy had named with security it
was territorial expansion to the Pacific
and I was finally achieved although in
one sense the British threat was not
overcome the British military force had
barred the intended conquest of Canada
and Cuba mr. Cuba Adams predicted that
it would drop into u.s. hands like a
ripe fruit by the laws of political
gravitation once the US had succeeded in
overcoming its British enemy and by the
end of the century the laws of political
gravitation were working and the US was
able to intervene to bar Cuba's
liberation from Spain that's what we
call liberating Cuba but in fact
was preventing the liberation of Cuba
and turning Cuba into a virtual colony
of the United States according to
respected harvard historians quite
conservative until nineteen fifty-nine
when we had turned to international
terrorism and illegal embargo to restore
this story well filling in the blanks
the picture the actual picture does
support goddesses judgments about the
precedents for the Bush Doctrine and its
implementation as for the expansion of
the doctrine to the entire world others
may judge for themselves and the world
has judged as international polls have
shown fear or and often hatred of the
United States has risen to unprecedented
Heights significantly increasing the
threat of terror and also the likelihood
of ultimate doom well to summarize
briefly there is a spectrum of opinion
on the resort to military force at one
extreme so remote from received opinion
that it's scarcely even mentioned is the
post-war consensus formally articulated
in the UN Charter the Nuremberg Tribunal
and subsequent extensions of these
principles the rest of the spectrum
being about a hundred percent of it
basically adopts the principle that the
United States is uniquely exempt from
international law and is entitled to
resort to any measures it chooses to
respond to a challenge to its power
position and prestige and to ensure
uninhibited access to key markets energy
supplies and strategic resources just
quoting again from the left liberal end
of the consensus the more honest are
explicit in declaring these rights to be
restricted to the US and its clients not
to be universalized but I have to stress
again
that the American public is off the
spectrum it keeps seems to keep firmly
to the post-war consensus which is
virtually excluded from totally excluded
in fact from the political system and
virtually excluded from articulate
opinion except at the margins now at the
margins we do find more nuanced opinions
on the resort to force one of the most
important is the independent
international independent commission of
inquiry on the Kosovo war was headed by
the distinguished South African jurist
Justice Richard Goldstone the Commission
rendered the harshest criticism of the
NATO bombing anywhere near the
mainstream concluding that the bombing
was illegal but legitimate as the phrase
I used they said it is illegal it was
illegal because it did not receive
approval from the UN Security Council
but it was legitimate because all
diplomatic avenues had been exhausted
and there was no other way to stop the
killings and atrocities in Kosovo
justice Goldstone concluded from this
that the UN Charter may need revision in
the light of the report of his
commission and the judgments on which
it's based the NATO intervention he
explains is too important a precedent
for it to be regarded as an aberration
rather state sovereignty is being
redefined in the face of globalization
and by the resolve of the majority of
the peoples of the world that human
rights have become the business of the
international community and he also
stressed the need for objective analysis
of human rights abuses actually that
last comment is good advice so let's
follow it one question that an objective
analysis might address is whether indeed
the majority of the world's peoples
accept the judgment of the enlightened
states you can review the world press
and official statements and if I do
that's totally false in fact the bombing
serve you is bitter
condemned outside the NATO countries
very little of it reported here
furthermore it's hardly likely that the
self exemption of the enlightened states
from the UN Charter and the Nuremberg
principles would gain the approval of
much of the world's population well
another question that objective analysis
might address is whether indeed the
quote Goldstone all diplomatic options
had been exhausted in Kosovo it's easy
to check when NATO decided to bomb there
were two diplomatic options on the table
there was an 80 proposal and a Serbian
proposal the latter kept from the public
here but public document after 78 days
of bombing a compromise was reached
between them indicates that diplomatic
options were indeed available a third
question is quoting again whether there
was no other way to stop the killings
and atrocities in Kosovo as the
Commission asserted crucial obviously a
crucial matter well here objective
analysis happens to be unusually easy
there is a vast documentary record
available from impeccable Western
sources that includes several
compilations big compilations put
together by the State Department
released and justification for the war
the detailed records of the OSCE of NATO
the United Nations lengthy and detailed
British parliamentary inquiry and other
similar sources they all reached the
same conclusion the killings and
atrocities followed the mommy as the
militia bitch indictment itself
indicates take a look at it it's for
crimes committed after the bombing the
marginal exception and as the NATO
command had announced at once and later
confirmed more detail it was anticipated
that the bombing would elicit the crimes
that follow how is this handled what a
huge literature
after all that was the proof of the
normative revolution handles are very
easily it ignores the enormous
documentary record entirely that try
find a reference to it and it's west of
its impeccable Western documentation
couldn't get anything more reliable and
almost invariably the literature
reverses the chronology so that the
bombing can be justified in response to
the atrocities it elicited and is
expected to elicit I have reviewed this
rather instructive record in some detail
in print and I well I'll skip it here
but check can learn a lot about
ourselves Kosovo was not a pretty place
before the NATO bombing according to
Western sources about 2,000 people were
killed on all sides in the year prior to
the invasion many of them by tail a
gorilla's Albanian guerrillas coming
attacking Serbs from albania in an
effort as they quite openly announced to
elicit a harsh reaction that could rally
Western opinion to their cause the
British government which is the most we
was the most hawkish element in the
Alliance they make the astonishing claim
that until January 1999 most of the
2,000 were killed by the KLA and Western
sources consistently report that there
was no significant change after January
99 until March of that year when the
bombing started so they are basically
saying that most of the killings were by
the by then cia-backed guerrillas
attacking from Albanian that's the most
hawkish element in the Alliance one of
the very few scholarly studies even to
consider these matters estimates that
Serbs were responsible for 500 of the
2,000 killed
it's a careful and judicious study by
Nicholas wheeler who supports the NATO
bombing on the grounds that there would
have been worse atrocities if NATO had
not bombed so the argument is that by
bombing with the anticipation that it
will lead to atrocities NATO was
preventing atrocities that such
arguments are taken seriously that gives
no slight insight into Western
intellectual culture particularly when
we recall that there were diplomatic
options and that the agreement reached
after 78 days of bombing was a
compromise between them formally at
least NATO instantly got rid of the
treaty that had signed and imposed its
own interpretation there's no time to
review the history well akasava was
actually one of the two achievements
that was brought forth to give
retrospective proof that for the first
time in history states were observing
principles and values all the rest the
second example used with East Timor that
example is far more atrocious I mean the
fact that it can even be brought up
without shame is an amazing comment on
Western intellectual culture and here
almost the entire West is complicit the
u.s. British role was the worst okay
that too is extensively discussed in
print so I'll skip it and end with what
is commonly given as the paradigm
example of selfless humanitarian
intervention and is unhappily again in
the news right now namely Haiti well
isn't it time to review the history
which is quite horrifying the two most
guilty parties are France in the United
States u.s. the u.s. role took an even
uglier turn under wilsonian idealism
Wilson's Marines invaded in 1915 they
killed thousands of people reinstituted
virtual slavery turned Haiti into
American plantation by a very simple
device the Parliament was disbanded by
genuine Marine Corps measures as the
commander reported it was disbanded
because it refused to accept what work
what was called a progressive measure
necessary to ensure Hades economic
development namely a law allowing us
corporations to take over the country by
means quite similar to those illegally
instituted by viceroy grammar in iraq in
the last year Wilson's Marines then ran
a free referendum because we really
believe in free elections in the
referendum five percent of the
population participated and ninety-nine
percent voted in favor of the required
law for which Franklin Delano Roosevelt
leader took credit rightly or not after
19 years the marine occupation ended
having devastated much of the country it
left the country in the hands of the
vicious National Guard that Wilson
established I'll skip the rest of the
hideous story up to nineteen ninety when
a really horrifying event took place the
country had a genuinely free election
its first the election was won by a
populist priest jean-bertrand r steed
while Washington's candidate a former
world bank official received fourteen
percent of the vote nobody expected that
nobody had been paying any attention to
what was going on in the slums and the
hills of Haiti we're a genuine
democratic culture developed in the
poorest country in the hemisphere and
was able to have a democratic election
of a kind that is unimaginable here they
elected their own candidate Washington
was a called of course and moved it once
to undermine the democratic government
when I was overthrown by a military coup
a few months later Bush number one and
then Clinton
effectively supported the military junta
and its wealthy supporters they even
authorized the Texaco oil company to
supply them with oil in violation of
presidential directives thus rendering
the OAS blockade that the u.s. had been
openly undermining almost entirely
meaningless after three days three years
of state violence Clinton decided that
the population had suffered enough
torture and murder and he allowed
president rst to return but on a crucial
condition namely that he had to adopt
the program of the defeated us candidate
in the nineteen ninety elections okay
that's what we call restoring democracy
and an altruistic effort at
nation-building as was predicted at once
the harsh programs imposed on Haiti
undermined what was left of a current
economic sovereignty and drove the
country into chaos and violence which
was accelerated by Bush to who when he
banned international aid on completely
cynical ground last februari the Army
and the murderous winta were placed back
in power with the help of France in the
United States the two most guilty
parties and now there's a new reign of
terror that's now we read in the British
press that the most publicized case is
that of Gerar Jean just a Catholic
priest who was arrested last month at a
soup kitchen that he runs for children
he's in jail without charge strike a
note with me I happened to meet him in
1993 when I was in Haiti at the height
of the terror he was in underground I've
been in many awful places in the world
but I have never seen anything like the
terror in the slums of port-au-prince
under the guns of the quinta and rarely
anything like the misery and poverty
the hunt is now back in power thanks
primarily to the nobility of their
foreign policy with its saintly glow
well the paradigm example of
humanitarian intervention is not so
simple if we take the trouble to look at
the facts always a useful exercise a few
questions are more important today than
the propriety of the use of force and no
doubt one can imagine and maybe even
find genuine cases of humanitarian
intervention but there's always a heavy
burden of proof and the historical
record should give us pause not only our
own but that of others we might recall
for example the observations of maybe
the major scholarly study of
humanitarian intervention in legal
scholarship it finds three examples of
humanitarian intervention between the
kellogg-briand pact of 1928 and the UN
Charter the three are Japan's invasion
of manchuria and North China Mussolini's
invasion of Ethiopia and Hitler's
takeover of the Sudetenland now it's not
of course that the author regards these
is genuine examples rather they're the
only potential ones there and of course
they were depicted as humanitarian
intervention and evidence was indeed
provided and however grotesque it was it
was regarded with some sympathy in the
United States and Britain in fact the
use of force is almost always
accompanied by professions of benign
intent near-universal predictable
therefore totally uninformative inquiry
might also unearthed genuine cases of
intervention that is illegal but
legitimate although the prime example
offered leaves this as a dubious
doctrine for the times and it tends to
reinforce the measured judgment of the
World Court in 1949 which was reaffirmed
in the Nicaragua
ace and others that quote the court the
court can only regard the alleged right
of intervention as the manifestation of
a policy of force such as has in the
past given rise to most serious abuses
and such as cannot whatever be the
defects in international organization
find a place in international law from
the nature of things intervention would
be reserved for the most powerful states
and might easily lead to the perverting
of the administration of justice itself
those are words worth pondering I think
yes thank you for those powerful words
indeed we have 10 minutes for questions
we have microphones set up please given
the limited amount of time professor
Chomsky has to get to the airport be
brief and do ask a question identity and
please identify yourself first why do
you think that these lawyers torture
memos on the enemy combatants which
violate international law and
constitutional law are now the elite
consensus of the glass and also could
you describe her the more the
development of the cause why they will
be say something like human rights
justice well actually to be precise
that's not a consensus so Gonzalez is
torture memos it came under plenty of
criticism can hear me Gonzalez's torture
memos came under a lot of criticism so
the idea that we have the right to
commit torture and dismantle the Geneva
Conventions was not innately consensus
there was plenty of criticism of that on
that issue there was debate how did this
come about well you know you know the
history we're not the only country that
does it there are other countries where
torture is legitimate there's one
country our closest ally which I believe
is the only country in the world right
now at least the only western country in
which evidence obtained under torture
can be used for conviction even without
supporting evidence okay so torture is
technically illegal but if some if you
get a confession under torture it can
still be used even without supporting
evidence that's Israel where four years
torture was legal and of course it goes
on all over the place that goes on in
her own prisons
but to take a stand as strong as the one
that the Justice Department transmitted
to Bush that did raise objections like
the ones I quoted in fact which compared
it to the Nazis it's not unusual
comparison at the heart of the
establishment which you might support
which was taken in anticipation of like
the president justification anticipation
of an imminent dangers the president but
can you can see with any form would you
might support the character why don't
you generalize it and say can you
conceive of any action which any state
might take yeah yeah sure you can
imagine such things and it's posed let's
say you're in Iran right now okay Iran
is that's a real problem Iran is
surround the first of all it's under
attack by the hemisphere by the world
superpower with embargoes is that and
the other thing it's surrounded by
states either occupied by the it's super
power enemy or having nuclear weapons
will the way down the road is the
regional superpower which has hundreds
of nuclear weapons and other weapons of
mass destruction and is essentially an
offshore US military base and has the
biggest air force and technologically
most advanced air force in NATO more
than any native power outside the United
States and in the past year has been
supplied by the global superpower with a
hundred advanced jet bombers openly
advertised as able to fly to Iran and
back to vomit and also provided with
what I'm talking about Israel I'm
that provided with what the Hebrew press
calls special weaponry well nobody knows
what that means but if you're an Iranian
intelligence analyst you're going to
give a worst-case analyst analysis of it
of course and has actually been publicly
provided with smart bombs and deep
penetration weapons and so on I mean you
know they have a terrific justification
for anticipatory self-defense better
than any other case I can think of but
do I approve it like what I approve of
their bombing Israel or carrying out
terrorist acts in Washington and so on
no even though they have a pretty strong
case better than anything I can think of
here just as the Japanese had a much
better case than any that i can think of
here but i don't approve pearl harbor so
yeah we can conceive of cases and in
fact some of them are right in front of
our eyes but none of us approve of them
none of us so if we don't approve of
them in real cases which are right in
front of our eyes now why discuss
hypothetical cases that don't exist and
we could do that in some philosophy
seminar somewhere but in the real world
there are real cases that are a concern
us not hypothetical ones that somebody
can invent and in fact the threat of
terror and weapons of mass destruction
is very severe very severe and the Bush
administration like the Clinton
administration doesn't care about it in
fact they are acting consciously in ways
to increase the threat okay so yes it's
a serious threat which would be
concerned about it in fact the article i
quoted on the threat of ultimate doom is
talking precisely about that it's saying
yeah we can carry out actions in a way
which increase the threat of ultimate
doom for ourselves and increase the
threat of terror to ourselves but we
shouldn't they say we shouldn't do it
and we should pray the China will stop
us I think we should pray the will stop
us and that happens all the time I mean
like Texas a the invasion of Iraq I was
a big debate in Washington is totally
pointless and the media about whether
Bush downgraded terror in order to evade
Iraq
nothing to debate invaded Iraq okay that
proves beyond doubt that he downgraded
the threat of terror in favor of
invading Iraq they anticipated and their
own intelligence agencies told him and
everyone else did to that invasion of
Iraq was likely to increase the threat
of terror okay it's not a high priority
so the invaded Iraq because that's much
higher priority so yeah there and
increasing the threat of terror is not a
joke you know you could get a nuclear
weapon smuggled into a new york hotel
room and sooner or later it will happen
and if we insist on increasing the
threat of terror and increasing the
threat of ultimate doom we're likely to
get it but we don't have to think about
these abstract cases we can think about
real have to point out there for how can
you support simply regulating on the
system of imperialism for example I know
you support intentions dropping in
humanity one which people as well this
is sparta says league okay well i think
we all know that line it's false it's
already false and the rest of the line
which most of us are familiar with their
false that was always opposed to the
snakes okay
if anybody wants the spider sisley
manifesto pick it up the door Yeah Yeah
right I'd love to see workers take power
but the place to organize workers is not
here if you want I'll pay you your car
fare to the nearest manufacturing plant
and you can go over and organize the
workers with the state power the rest of
this is a waste of time yeah okay right
fine so go do it oh I think the there's
a significant literature on specialist
literature on terrorism in the United
States you know Israeli intelligence a
lot of others they all come the same
conclusion terror the the kind of
terrorism we allow ourselves to talk
about that is what somebody else does to
us not what we do then that kind of
terrorism is a threat it says
double-edged i mean the the terrorists
themselves you know they regard
themselves as a vanguard who are trying
to mobilize others and the others are
you know potential reservoir of sympathy
on people who may hate them and fear
them but recognize that there's some
justice to their claims that's standard
whether it's the IRA in Northern Ireland
or you know masama bin Laden in the
Middle East or anything else well we
have two ways we ought to therefore have
a double-edged response with response to
terrorists themselves terrorist acts
those are criminal acts they should be
treated like criminal acts that's police
action and that's worked in fact it's
had successes in Europe Southeast Asia
and elsewhere using Pakistan and other
place
ordinary police measures to find
criminals that works but the much more
important question is what about the
people they're trying to mobilize well
there we have a choice we can help the
terrorists mobilize the Vanguard by
carrying out acts of violence which will
justify their message or we can deal
with the legitimate grievances of the
people who they are trying to appeal to
which we ought to do independently of
terrorism those are the answers to
terrorism you want to read about them
you can read about it in any the
specialist literature or statements of
Israeli intelligence or anybody didn't
thinks about the matter but we don't
want to do that we I mean the guys who
run the place they don't want to deal
with the legitimate grievances because
their own interests / well no and they
don't care that much about the threat of
terror so they do things that
exacerbated but we can change those
policies so I think there's a pretty
clear understanding about how to deal
with the category of terrorism that we
allow ourselves to look at the category
in which we're the victims and it's been
this it works I mr. takes a northern
ireland for a long time the British
responded to Ira terror which was pretty
serious by just more violence that's a
gift of the IRA they just just organized
the reservoir of sympathy and support
for more terror actually I are a terror
was being supported from here and like
churches in Boston we're supporting it
the FBI knew all about it but they said
they couldn't do anything about it only
Saudi Arabia is supposed to stop funding
terrorists but finally the the British
finally got the idea that they better
look at the grievances and they started
attending to the grievances that lay
beyond you know that kind of were in in
the reservoir of potential sympathy and
it worked I mean then work perfectly
like you know belfast isn't utopia but
it's a lot better than it was 10 years
ago yeah that's the way to deal with
terrorism if
interested in dealing with terrorism if
you're not interested in dealing with it
like US policy you just carry out
actions which extend and increasing the
question is very broad asked to solve
its application how do you interpret the
bush electro victory including the
possibility of record for frying what do
you think its implications and
ramifications okay I have to tell you a
couple of months ago picked up a
declassified CIA document just kind of
intriguing it's about the Kennedy
assassination it's from a couple years
ago and it suggests to the government
they that they ought to success them
occasionally leak information about the
Kennedy assassination to the public so
they'll keep the Kennedy assassination
industry going you know people will
continue to follow up leads and put
together a complicated stories and that
will keep people away from asking the
serious questions well I don't know if
the CIA actually does that but it's a
smart idea and I and I don't know
whether they're pushing the stories
about electoral flaws or not but if
they're not they're not doing their job
there are problems with the election
plenty deep ones that have nothing to do
with whether you know the count of the
votes wrong in Ohio I mean just have a
look at the elections okay each
candidate got the usual thirty percent
of the vote the bush guys got a little
more carry guys got a little less tells
us Appling nothing about the country if
the votes had shifted a little and Kerry
had gotten a little Ward bush left get
have a different yet in the White House
it would still tell you nothing about
the country and the reasons are well
known and those are the serious
questions
the reasons are that people about ten
percent of the population voted on what
they call agenda policy programs and
ideas what an election would be about in
a free country ten percent the rest
voted on imagery the elections are run
by the same guys who sell you toothpaste
and cars their job they don't tell you
when they sell a car you know here are
the properties of the car I'm did that
it wouldn't need advertising that would
be a market system but we don't believe
in market systems where you provide
information to people we believe in
systems that are based on deceit you
have to deceive the public into carrying
out what's called consumer choice by you
know putting in a sexy model in the car
or having it drive up a sheer cliff or
something like that and it's the same
with that's this whole system you know
that's the whole system is based on
deceit and that's the opposite of a
market system i should say and it's the
same is true in the political arena it's
based on deceit now furthermore it's not
concealed so like take a look at
yesterday's New York Times on the op-ed
pages if two op-eds about how the
Democrats could you know overcome their
problems and both op-eds are won by a
professor at NYU another one at Berkeley
are about ways to deceive the public
into sneaking in your own policies by
lying to them well that makes perfect
sense in a society that's based on
deceiving the public whether it's to
undermine markets or whether it's to
undermine democracy and in fact that's
what happened people voted for images
Bush is trained to project the image of
someone who will defend you from terror
and has moral values and Kerry is
trained to project the image of somebody
who cares about the economy and health
and in fact if you look at the voting
voters they tended to believe that the
candidate they voted for
had their opinion which is totally false
when you look at the actual opinions and
the positions of the candidates but you
vote for the image just like you buy a
Chevrolet because of the sexy model or
something you vote for the image and the
the actual attitudes of the population I
gave a sample of them before from
studies that appeared right before the
election from the major institutions
they're just off the agenda totally you
know I mean just think of the things
that I mentioned it goes on like that
they don't even appear so people are
voting for images and you know the bush
image got a little more than the Kerry
image but what it amounts to is flipping
a coin for king and if it turns out to
get back to the flaws to the electoral
vote oh my suppose it turns out that the
coin was a little bit biased okay maybe
it was it doesn't change anything okay
so they flip the biased coin for the
king that's not the problem the problem
is a quite different one and it's the
different one that we ought to be
concerned about
