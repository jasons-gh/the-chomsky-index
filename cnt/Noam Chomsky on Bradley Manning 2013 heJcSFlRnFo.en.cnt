we're looking at people like Bradley
Manning Julian Assange being made an
example of Bradley Manning is a
particularly ugly case is he's been
detained without charges for I think
about nine months he was basically being
tortured that's what it means to be in
solitary confinement with pretty ugly
treatment that's the kind of thing we
complain about bitterly when it happens
in Iran or China and so on captain right
here no charge he isn't being brought
those of it in court yet may never be
he's being severely punished in fact
tortured for claims that even if they
were established wouldn't would should
be a reason for respect not to criminal
charges but they haven't even been but
he doesn't even have George's so that's
really a very ugly case
