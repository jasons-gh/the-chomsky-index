the terrorist act Temper 11 you know
very unusual and in real historic event
first time in history that the West was
attacked they received the kind of
attack that it carries out routinely in
the rest of the world which is a
historical event and you know naturally
the West is upset so many you know we're
supposed to others they're supposed to
do it to us and it was number 11th was a
did change policy undoubtedly not just
for the u.s. across the board on every
government in the world so there's an
opportunity to intensify their own
repression atrocities of whatever level
they were you know ranging from Russia
and Chechnya to in the West imposing
more discipline on their populations and
so on every every choice in between and
it had big effect so for example take
say Iraq going to that prior to
September 11th there's a long-standing
concern of the US and I'll skip rhythm
it's kind of ancillary of the u.s. to on
Iraq and that is got the second largest
oil reserves in the world so one way or
another they're gonna do something to
get it back that's clear now September
11th gave the pretext so there's an
Aeschylus change in the rhetoric
concerning Iraq after September 11th it
we now have an excuse to go ahead and do
what we're planning
