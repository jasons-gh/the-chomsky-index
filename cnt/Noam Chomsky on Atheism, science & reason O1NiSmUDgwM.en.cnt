so Chomsky thank you for joining us
would you or do you consider yourself a
person of faith I try not to have faith
I believe in a principle that was
enunciated rather well by Bertrand
Russell which is that you should try to
keep away from having irrational beliefs
you should believe some things that for
which you can find some evidence or some
support
apart from commitment to principles like
equality and freedom and justice and so
on those I wouldn't say that's faith as
there are things you're committed to but
as far as beliefs about the world
reality my feeling is one should try to
as much as possible have substantiative
beliefs or at least beliefs through
which evidence could be appropriate well
then would you consider yourself
paradoxically a person who has faith in
the scientific method I think it's the
only method we have to try to get some
approximate understanding of the world I
don't have faith that it'll reach the
truth or even that it's leading us in a
true direction
in fact as someone committed to the
scientific method I'm also committed to
its consequences and among them are that
you and I and the rest of the species or
organic creatures who have our specific
capacities and limitations and we simply
don't know and have no reason to believe
that these capacities are such that we
can gain the truth about the world we do
our best but that's the most we can do
but if people would say that you cannot
have moral principles unless you adhere
to a faith if I attribute those
principles to a divine creature who I
define as ordering me to have those
principles the principles don't become
any more better established so that's a
useless debt it's true that our moral
principles are not firmly grounded
unshakeable of evidence and argument but
nothing is going to make them any more
firmly grounded as for having a
meaningful life that seems to me
irrelevant know people who have
meaningful lives with faith and without
faith now could Americanism be fairly
characterized as a religion I would call
Americanism or Italian ISM or Russian
ISM or anything else totalitarian
doctrines no one should have any in fact
these dock notions like that are only
used in totalitarian states so for
example in the Soviet Union the old
Soviet Union dissidents you know rather
than people like that were condemned as
being anti Soviet in under the neo-nazi
generals in Brazil people who condemned
their horrifying policies were
criticised as anti Brazilian on the
other hand I mean if a book called the
unate aliens appeared in Italy referring
to people who criticized Italian foreign
policy let's say that people just laugh
and ridicule maybe under Mussolini it
would have been different and the reason
is that these are totalitarian doctrines
they identify state policy with the
country and its society and its culture
and that's not done by people of any
conception of freedom actually there's a
long history to this notion it goes back
to the Bible in Kings one King Ahab
condemns Elijah who was seeking justice
and freedom he condemns him as being a
Hebrew phrase various orell that mean
roughly someone who hates Israel or
troubles Yisrael something like that
he's anti-israel because he is seeking
justice and freedom and that's the
origin of the concept and it has an
inglorious history from King Ahab right
through
Soviet Union and up to today and we
should avoid it at least if we want to
identify ourselves with the ideals of
Elijah and not King Ahab if your concept
of America is that it should be a
violent destructive racist state that
seeks to achieve the ends of those in
power by any murderous or other means
that it has and that it's quite happy to
have say 30 million people hungry and 40
million without health insurance and so
on if that's your concept of America
then yes you should call Martin Luther
King an American you should call the
people who won the struggle for freedom
and human rights and labor rights and
women's rights you should call all of
them on American on the other hand I
would call people who regard America
that way as people who hate America
that's their conception of America
they're free to have it but it's not one
that I'd want if by America you mean the
people who have in for the actions and
the people who have in fact won a quite
remarkable degree of freedom over the
centuries in fact beyond any other
country that I know not by a gift but by
constant hard struggle and dedication
and have achieved at least some measure
of justice and want more and who are
opposed to aggression and violence if
that's your conception of America fine
and I'm pro-american but there's no
there's no answer it depends which
America you mean it's like King Ahab
again if your concept of Israel is King
Ahab's concept then Elijah is aunty
Israeli if your conception of Israel is
Elijah's concept and a half hates Israel
but there's no answer you take your
choices how important our george w
bush's religious beliefs as they relate
to u.s. foreign policy the fact is that
every american president since Jimmy
Carter who I think was authentic
everyone since then has been
compelled or maybe some of them do it
