the concept of Marxism is one that I
find troublesome in physics for example
there's nothing like Einstein ISM
because Einstein isn't God who you
worship rather he's a human being who
had important things to say and like
every other human being made mistakes
so you learn from what he had to say and
you disregard his mistakes
now Marxism the concept in my view
belongs to the history of organized
religion it's a it's a kind of worship
of an individual that makes no sense in
if you look at Marx himself and other
people who've been working in that
tradition you learn what's valuable you
disregard what's wrong and then after
that we just go and look so for example
take say socialism marks had almost
nothing to say about I mean if you read
I'm not a great works specialist but as
far as I understand and I've read a fair
amount there are a few scattered
sentences and Marx's writings about
socialism
he's a theorist of capitalism he was a
theorist basically of 19th century
capitalism perfectly naturally and he
developed a sort of an abstract model of
the capitalist system and its properties
from which I think there's a lot to
learn how much it and any intelligent
person should read it and learn what you
can from it as you learn from others to
assume that it offers a doctrine for
today is makes no sense I can't imagine
that Marx would have believed that he
also wrote important things about the
contemporary affairs for example about
the British and India certainly worth
reading but if we were still repeating
those things now civilization had been
dead you know we should have learned
something in the last hundred years so
yes there's contributions as there is
from the rest of our cultural tradition
and you learn from them what's important
then you disregard what's not useful
