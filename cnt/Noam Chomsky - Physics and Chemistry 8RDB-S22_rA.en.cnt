how much inspiration did you draw from
developments in biology or the chemistry
things like that I mean only because you
start seeing how the sciences work the
so-called human sciences are very
different from the Natural Sciences all
sorts of ways I mean in the Natural
Sciences for example if you have a
theory some kind of a theory and you get
counter examples you try to hold on to
the theory and get rid of the data not
so famous case in the 19th century the
it was discovered with the famous case
in the 19th century why don't think
slighlty I mean they should that's it
the same with Greek yes go back to the
Greeks one of the major problems in
Greek science Science and Mathematics
distinguished was the discovery of the
irrational numbers yes if you take the
diagonal of a square it's in
commensurable with these sides of the
square which was considered like you
know discovering that God doesn't exist
you're something but they didn't throw
away geometry they try to figure out
what's going on and the same with the
orbit of Uranus they didn't say ok let's
throw away Newton's was asked
could be doing it and pretty soon the
very a discovered a an extra planet out
there Neptune and okay that accounted
for it by Newton's laws in the human
science this is quite different they
find a counter example you throw away
everything it's just totally irrational
that in fact the whole dominant kind of
inquiry that goes on into human behavior
from looking at eight languages to
analyzing purposes to misunderstanding
generalizations is completely different
from the Natural Sciences for not niacin
thiamine vitamin back to the Greek and a
vanity overcome so in this sense yes it
was influential I mean noticing I'm the
little major really major errors in the
Natural Sciences flow into the 20th
century which were not understood and
are very similar to what you read in say
flossy language today so for example
it's a big argument in philosophy of
mind philosophy of languages at the edge
the problem is supposed to be that you
can't man deuce the study of physical
scientists you know Nobel Prize winners
except that chemistry is just a
computational technique yeah it can't be
real because you can't reduce the
physics
reckon if you of gases was treated the
same way we're worse the molecules you
know a punk array may have scientists of
the 20th century said that we can't take
the molecular theory of gases seriously
who can see the molecules I mean my take
on
you should have been the one tool to
discover or propose relativity he pretty
much it was very close but he didn't
give it to a realist interpretation it
gave it a positive this interpretation
it looks as if things were like that and
then Einstein came along and said and
then he did more than that he developed
the mathematical theory of it but even
if you look at Einstein immediately
after Einstein's famous 1905 papers
special theory of relativity
experimental physicists started studying
it in Germany where the main
experimental physics was and we shaded
it you know that experiment after
experiment that sure that didn't work
younger scientists completely
disregarded the experiments I mean it
was so obviously true that didn't care
what the experiments were they just
waited to find out what's wrong with the
experiments in fact that goes on up to
nineteen thirties when there's a leads
them baby a correspondence between Max
Warren and Einstein and exploring famous
Pacific in the late nineteen twenties
Max Born who followed experimental
physics much more closely than Einstein
did pointed out that Einstein in the
correspondence that a famous American
experimental physicist had apparently
disproven the michelson-morley
experiment a famous experiment which
part of the basis for relativity theory
but he said look he seems to have
disproven it and then the correspondence
is quite interesting both Einstein and
Byrnes take it for granted that the
experiments wrong and one asks Einstein
do you think it would be worthwhile to
go
look closely at this guy's experiment
and see what's wrong with it
and Einstein says well you know who
cares or something and then finally some
years later you know people we did the
experiment and found there were
statistical errors and so on
but that's typical of a science as I say
all the way back to the Greek and a very
sharp break from the human sciences and
he had to get back to the chemistry case
what is not quite understood is that if
it happened to be true that chemistry
could not be reduced to physics it was
true and the reason was discovered
physics was wrong it wasn't until the
quantum theoretical revolution took
place that you then had a way of giving
an interpretation of say the chemical
bond yes
in terms of give you the quantity ridic
exclamation effect Linus Pauling got the
Nobel Prize for this 1935 but until then
chemistry could not be reduced if
occasion turned out to be closer to
chemistry that didn't change as exchange
and the reunified that was is really
reduced couldn't be reduced and very
likely the same will be true about a lot
more was known about physics and
chemistry than is known today about
metal acts and the brain yeah so the
fact that they can't be unified you
don't know what that means could mean
