I think it's a tragedy and a catastrophe that the left
has accepted the idea of humans as
historical products
Simply reflections of their environment
because what follows from that, of course, is that there's no moral barrier to molding them anyway you like
And that humans have no inner nature.
They don't have an inner instinct for freedom... You know... if it's not
fundamental that their nature to have
free, creative, productive work under their own control... if that's not part of their nature
Then why... you know... there's no moral reason for allowing them that space
You could just mould them into being what you think they ought to be
and you can be the Central Committee, or you can be with the...
you know... the managers of the corporation or the
directors of a fascist state or whatever
And it's quite interesting that the modern intellectuals have mostly moved in one or the other of those directions overwhelmingly
either there... and in fact this was foretold in one of the
maybe the only
prediction of the social sciences that ever came so dramatically true
was Bakunin's discussion of this in the late 19th century... he was arguing with Marx
And it's well before Leninism, but he predicted
very perceptively that the rising class and intellectuals were just kind of becoming identified as a class and modern
modern industrial societies... he predicted that they were essentially going to go in one of two directions
There would be some who would believe that
The struggles of the working class would offer them an opportunity to rise and take state power in their own hands
And at that point he said they would become the red bureaucracy who would create the worst tyranny that
humanity has ever known of course all in the interests of the workers. That's one direction and he said the others
Would recognize that you're never going to get power that way and the way to get power is to associate yourself with
What we would nowadays call state capitalism
And just become the servants of its ruling class
And then you become the managers and the ideologues and so on for the state capitalist system
And as he put it those people will beat the people with the people stick in other words
They'll talk about democracy, but they'll really be beating people with the stick of democracy
Which they'll turn into a mechanism of coercion. There's some who think you can get power by
by exploiting popular struggles
And there are others who
see that you're going to get power by just associating yourself with the people already have economic power and that's largely dominated
And I think there was a very accurate description of the century that followed him
On the one his is fifty years before the Bolshevik Revolution
But he predicted its form very precisely and also its ideological background, and he also predicted
quite accurately what happens in the modern state capitalist industrial societies and looking at it now from the
retrospective a hundred years
We can see I think we can see this development very clearly and it also explains an odd fact about 20th century intellectual life
Namely, how easy it's been for people to shift from one position to another
so the same person who's a
Stalinist apologist one year is a super American patriot the next year is supporting every atrocity and
working and working in the Hoover Institute
And you know associated with most reactionary institutions that transition, which sometimes is called the God that failed
Change which was sort of authentic in the early years like people like Salone and others
You know there was something authentic about it. It became a joke. I mean when people within the... in fact
We're seeing in Russia right now
the the worst commissars are now the ones who are most passionate about the
You know the free market and investing and enriching yourself and so on
They've made the transition very easily and that goes way back, and I think the reason is there's no transition.
It's just a different estimate as to where power lies, but the same ideology.
The ideology is you beat the people with the people stick and we're going to do it in fact if you look at modern acad...
Democratic theory in the West it's remarkably similar to this. It's remarkably Leninist in its character
if you think of modern Democrat the leading
tendencies in the modern democratic theory in the West
so in in
academic world it would be the
Strands of political science that developed from the thinking of people like Harold Lasswell and others one of the founders of modern
contemporary political science and in the general sphere the Wilsonian
Intellectuals the so-called progressive intellectuals of whom maybe Walter Lippmann was the most
striking example in the United States
progressive intellectual in the 1920s
..all of these people developed theories of democracy and they're quite interesting they're very Leninist in their character
The conception is that in a democracy there's two classes of citizens
There's the general public who Lippmann calls
ignorant and meddlesome outsiders and
Lasswell says they're too stupid to... We should not be overcome by dogmatism
About the common man, who's too stupid to be able to do anything
That's the standard view so there's these people the ignorant and meddlesome outsiders
Which is maybe 90% of the population and then there are the responsible men the wise men... you know... the smart people
the
People with integrity and honor or the intellectual aristocracy whatever you call them
and they have to rule they're the ones who make the decisions who do the thinking and so on and the role of the
Masses the ignorant and meddlesome
Outsiders is just to show up every couple of years
Decide which of the smart guys is going to be their leader and then go home
