in line with your you're concerned about
the growing thread terms of nuclear
weapons are also maneuvers going on off
the coast of Korea and and the the the
words that we've heard from President
Trump in the last few day is that if
China doesn't deal with North Korea the
US will okay you talked about his
policies already developing policies
toward Korea and toward China well it's
kind of interesting to look at the
record the claim is well we've tried
everything nothing works therefore we
have to use force is it true that
nothing's worked
um there is a record after all if you
look at the record it's interesting 1994
Clinton made establish what was called
the framework agreement with North Korea
North Korea would terminate its average
develop nuclear weapons the US would
reduce hostile acts it more or less
worked on either sides lived up to it
totally but by 2000 North Korea had not
proceeded with its nuclear weapons
programs the george w bush came in and
immediately launched an assault on North
Korea you know axle evil sanctions on
North Korea turned to producing nuclear
weapons in 2005 there was an agreement
between North Korea and the United
States a pretty sensible agreement North
Korea agreed to terminate its
development of nuclear weapons in return
it called for a non-aggression pact so
stop making hostile threats relief from
harsh sanctions and provision of a
system to provide North Korea with low
enriched uranium for medical and other
purposes that was the proposal George
Bush instantly toured the shreds within
days the US was imposing trying to
disrupt the North Korean financial
transactions other countries through
Macau and elsewhere North Korea back
doors start building the clear weapons
again the I mean maybe you can say it's
the worst regime in history whatever you
like but they have been following a
pretty rational tit-for-tat policy and
why are they developing nuclear weapons
altogether I mean the economy's in bad
shape they could certainly use the
resources everyone understands it's a
deterrent and they have a proposal
actually there's a proposal on the table
China and North Korea proposed that
North Korea should terminate its its
further development of nuclear weapons
in return the United States should stop
carrying out threatening military
maneuvers with South Korea right on its
border not an unreasonable proposal and
simply dismissed actually Obama
dismissed it too
there are possible steps that could be
taken to alleviate which could be an
extremely serious crisis I mean if the
US did decide to use force against North
Korea one immediate reaction according
to the military sources available to us
is it Seoul the city of Seoul would
simply be wiped out by Masanori and
artillery and that and who knows where
we go from there but the the opportunity
to produce to move towards a negotiated
diplomatic settlement does not seem
outlandish on this Chinese North Korean
proposal is certainly worth serious
consideration I would think and it's
worth bearing in mind that North Korea
has some members memories they were
practically dead it destroyed by some of
the most intensive bombing in history
the bombing Eagle you shouldn't swear
for reading that you should read people
the official Air Force history of the
bombing of North Korea it's shattered
I'm in the head they had flattened the
country there were no targets list so
therefore they decided well we'll attack
the dams which is a war crime of course
and they and the description of the
attack on the dams is without the exact
wording I hate the paraphrase if you
really read these they were simply
insulting of in the official histories
airforce quarterly and others about the
how magnificent will be to see this
massive flood of water coursing through
North Korea wiping out crops for Asians
rice crops is their life this will
destroy them it will be magnificent the
North Koreans lived through that and
having a nuclear capable b-52s flying on
their border is not a joke but that's
most significantly there's a record of
partial success in diplomatic
initiatives total failure with sanctions
and harsh moves and options that are on
the table which could be pursued now
instead of concern about whether
somebody talked to the Russians this is
the kind of thing that should be that
should be pursued very seriously that's
what the Democrats are anyone hoping for
some form of peace of justice should be
working for which brings us to China
President Trump said if China is not
going to solve North Korea we will are
you concerned that with Trump at an
all-time low for presidents when it
comes to popularity with suffering to
feed after defeat
lashing out and trying to focus on a
foreign enemy but at the same time you
have China coming to the United States
this meeting that he's going to have
with the Chinese leader Xi in Mar Lago
also very interesting considering it's a
golf course he right he hates
and surveyed Communist Party members to
play golf is it more about Trump feeling
he has more access to shut down press
coverage or any information about who's
meeting with him when it's in his
private resort but more importantly what
the agenda is there and what our
relationship is with China as you recall
one of the interesting incident
incidents was a public discussion of
significant security issues and of the
mers work with people sitting around
drinking coffee and having drinks maybe
they keep the press out but they didn't
seem to keep the guest so well not if
you pay two hundred thousand dollars a
year and you're a member of Marylebone
nuclear facilities and then you get to
take photos selfies with the man
carrying the nuclear codes a little
football it's for he's extremely
unpredictable but this relations with
some china are extremely serious issued
china is not going to back down on its
fundamental demands concerning taiwan
for example and if trump us a lot of
what kind is demanding i think is it
shouldn't be it shouldn't is not
acceptable it's not internationally
acceptable but the reaction through use
of force is just extraordinarily
dangerous i mean you cannot play that
game in international affairs we are too
close to destroying ourselves take a
look at the record of through the
nuclear age of near accidental sometimes
accidental sometimes it kind of
irrational actions it's almost
miraculous that we survived and anything
that moved to get a good estimate of
this of the danger take a look at the
the best monitor of the global security
situation
that we have as a simple measure namely
the bulletin of Atomic Scientists
Doomsday Clock
this is set every year since the
beginning of the nuclear age 1947 by a
group of serious specialists scientists
political analysts and others who try to
give a measure of the danger that the
human species faces midnight means were
finished in 1947 the clock was set at 7
minutes to midnight in 1953 right after
the US and Russia tested the hydrogen
bombs the thermonuclear weapons it went
to 2 minutes to midnight that's the
closest it's been to total disaster
right now as soon as Trump came in it
was moved to two and a half minutes to
midnight both because of the nuclear
threat recognized to be serious and the
threat of environmental catastrophe
which was not considered in the earlier
years now is that those are that
overwhelmingly the most crucial issues
that faces everything else fades and in
significance in comparison to them those
are literally question of survival and
two and a half minutes to midnight means
extraordinary danger these should be the
major focus of attention and it's kind
of astonishing to see the way they're
ignored
throughout the whole electoral campaign
practically no mention of them every
Republican candidate every single one
either with regard to the climate either
denied what is happening or all said the
moderates like Jeb Bush should case it
should well maybe it's happening that
doesn't matter we shouldn't do anything
about well the u.s. just led the boycott
at the UN if the nuclear ban of toxins
joined it with the other nuclear powers
unfortunately there are there's also the
question of the
comprehensive test-ban treaty there are
now three nuclear powers which have
refused to ratify it
China the United States and Israel and
the his tests begin again it's extremely
serious danger as I mentioned it was
when the first tests were carried out
that the Doomsday Clock went to two
minutes to midnight there's the problem
of the New START treaty a treaty there
there has been inadequate but
significant reduction in nuclear weapons
since the end of the Cold War the New
START treaty was carried forward by
Russia in the United States has
overwhelming massively nuclear weapons
and this would cut down the the number
but also the more threatening ones would
reduce it trump has indicated i don't
nobody knows what he means but he's
indicated that is what he calls a bad
deal for the united states suggesting
maybe we should pull out of it which
would be a disaster I mean these are
major issues and the fact that they're
barely being discussed is a shattering
commentary on the the level of
contemporary civilization we're speaking
with Noam Chomsky world-renowned
political dissident linguist and author
professor emeritus at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology where he's
taught for more than 50 years he has a
new book out today it's called requiem
for the American dream the ten
principles of concentration wealth the
ten principles of concentration of
wealth and power will be back with him
