my speculation would be that they would
like to have it over with before the
presidential campaign problem is that
when you're in a war you know it's going
to happen you know I mean the chances
are it'll be a pushover it ought to be
on there's no of Iraqi army country will
probably collapse in two minutes like
that you know but you can't be sure that
and in fact if you take the CIA warning
seriously now they're pretty straight
about it the I'm sure was published here
that you know they're saying you know if
there's a war Iraq may respond by
terrorist acts and what could those
terrorist acts but you would like to be
very serious I mean years ago there were
technical studies circulating saying
that it wouldn't take that much
confidence to put together a undeclared
bomb and dirty bomb in the New York
hotel room you smuggle the farts across
the Canadian border totally porous you
know I could smuggle things across the
Canadian border there's no way of
barring and that's not a big deal
there's loose nukes around in Russia and
Pakistan all over the place any
dedicated group of people could be doing
that and the government studies
estimated before nine eleven you know a
couple years before September 11th that
the probability of success for
well-planned operation to put a nuclear
bomb and say in New York hotel room
would be about 90% way higher than any
missile attack and in fact a MIT press
published a technical study about four
years ago by three so called strategic
analyst types which is like a guidebook
to terrorists it's called America's
Achilles heel if you want to take a look
at it came out around 1998 and it's just
a you know kind of a list of possible
terrorist actions that you could carry
out how you could do it and it's mostly
pretty simple you know like wouldn't
take much so it's possible that they're
in place and you know international
relations guys like Kenneth waltz for
example have been pointing out that US
adventurism is just driving countries
into developing weapons of
destruction and terrorism as deterrent
they don't have any other deterrent you
know conventional forces don't work
obviously and there's no external
deterrent so the disguiser is free do
they want and the only way anyone could
defend themselves as terror and weapons
of mass destruction was plausible to
assume that they're doing it I suppose
that's the basis for the CIA analyses I
thought that they have any intelligence
but I suppose British intelligence the
same thing they probably are so yeah
that this could be consequences but you
don't want to have that happen in the
middle of a presidential campaign you
want it to be done you know and you want
the war to be over there is the problem
about what to do with the effects of the
war but that's easy you count on
journalists and intellectuals not to
talk about it so how many people are
talking about Afghanistan you know
Afghanistan's sort of backward was you
know run by warlords and gangsters and
the women are about where they were
before I said I just met Christina lamb
little while ago it just happens by
accident a couple of days ago I was
reading articles of hers from the night
for the 80s she was in Kabul around 1989
talked about little but her description
of kabul in 1989 looks like paradise is
compared with what it is now i'm in at
the university women are running around
with you know miniskirts the smokin
cigarettes doing they feel like and it
was it by comparator i'm not the rest of
the country but you know cut the rest of
the country now is same as it was under
the Taliban pretty much but in Kabul it
hasn't gotten back to what it was in
1989 actually the head of the the UN has
had is very Indian woman Russell Basu
who was the head of women's affairs for
the UN back in the 70s the 80s she's a
well-known lawyer
yeah lost Google graduate that sort of
thing she was writing in the late
eighties in Afghan she was f in
Afghanistan as the UN officer for
women's a fair cuz there's no such thing
and through the late 80s she was writing
articles about how if the people the
Americans are organizing take over it's
going to be a complete disaster
especially for women but for everybody
else and you know even the feminist
magazines wouldn't publish articles like
Moses in the United States wouldn't pop
coordination or anybody wouldn't publish
what she was saying because wrong story
and they're still not saying it but if
you take a look at Afghanistan now who's
writing about I mean almost nobody you
know so if it goes back to what it was
who care everyone's forgotten about it
and if Iraq turns into it let's say
people slaughtering each other you can I
can write the articles right now
backward peoples I mean we tried to save
them all they do is murder each other
because they're you know very Arabs and
sort of me but you have to have it over
so and by then I presume I'm in just
guessing you know that they'll be on to
the next one which will probably be
either Syria or Iran in fact the war
with Iran is probably already underway
according to I'm and again isn't a lot
of evidence but if you look at American
scholarly sources they are claiming I
don't know I'm they don't give a lot of
evidence that like Robert Olson who's
the main American academic specialist on
region had an article over the summer in
which he claims it's known that over
about twelve percent of the Israeli Air
Force and armored forces are in
southeastern Turkey presumably the
American military bases and according to
him that they're there because they're
preparing for the war against Iran they
don't care about Iraq Rackley figures a
pushover but Iran has always been a
problem for Israel it's the one country
in the region that they can't handle and
they've been after the u.s. to take it
on for them for years and go into this
report the Israeli Air Force is now
flying at the Iranian border that's
art of intelligence and provocation and
so on and it's not a small air force
it's bigger than the British Air Force
for example and where that it's a in
fact figure well follows bigger than any
NATO power outside the US and so it's
probably under way no claims that their
efforts to stir up azeri separatism in
the north which now makes some sense SAT
Sri territory so what the Russians tried
to do in 1946 was to pull it off first
and that would separate Iran or what's
left of Iran from the Caspian
oil-producing centers and then you could
hope to partition editor or something or
other so probably that will be underway
at the time and then they'll be a story
about how it ran is going to kill us
tomorrow unless we get rid of them today
and that's rid of me at least that's
been the pattern you know so any
reasonably so this guy might be right
but I guess that it's probably over the
winter
