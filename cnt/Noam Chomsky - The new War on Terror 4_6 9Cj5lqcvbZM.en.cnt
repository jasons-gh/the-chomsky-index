being combated by what the US calls a
terrorist force Hezbollah which in fact
succeeded in driving Israel out of
Lebanon and you can't have allow anyone
to struggle against the military
occupation when it's one that we support
so therefore the US and Israel had to
vote against the major UN resolution on
terrorism and I mentioned before that a
u.s. vote against is essentially a veto
which is only half the story it also
vetoes it from history so none of this
was ever reported and none of it appears
in the annals of terrorism you look at
the scholarly work on terrorism and so
on nothing that I've just mentioned
appears the reason is it's got the wrong
people holding the guns you have to
carefully hone the definitions and the
scholarship and so on so that you come
out with the right conclusions otherwise
it's not respectable scholarship and
honorable journalism well that's these
are some of the problems that are
hampering the effort to develop a
comprehensive treaty against terrorism
maybe we should have an academic
conference or something to try to see if
you can figure out a way of defining
terrorism so that it comes out with just
the right answers not the wrong answers
that won't be easy well let's drop that
in term to the fourth question what are
the a narrow one what are the origins of
the September 11th crimes here we have
to be sorry make a distinction between
two categories which shouldn't be run
together one is the actual agents of the
crime the other is kind of a reservoir
of at least sympathy sometimes support
that they appeal to even among people
who very much opposed the criminals and
the actions and those are two different
things well with regard to the
perpetrators in a certain sense we're
not really clear the United States
either is unable or unwilling to provide
any evidence
any meaningful evidence there was a sort
of a play week or two ago when Tony
Blair was set up to try to present it
and I think the perp I don't exactly
know what the purpose of this was maybe
yeah so that the u.s. could look as
though it's holding back on some secret
evidence that it can't reveal or that
Tony Blair could strike proper
Churchillian poses or something or other
whatever the PR reasons were he gave a
presentation which was in serious
circles considered so absurd that was
barely even mentioned so the wall street
journal for example one of the more
serious papers had a small story on page
12 I think in which they pointed out
that there isn't much evidence and then
they quoted some high US official as
saying it doesn't even matter whether
there's any evidence because we're going
to do it anyway so why bother with the
evidence the more ideological press like
the New York Times and others they had
big front-page headlines I but the Wall
Street Journal reaction was reasonable
and if you look at the evidence you can
so-called evidence you can see why but
let's assume it's true and it's a prima
that I was astonishing to me that week
the evidence was I mean I sort of
thought he could do better than that
without any intelligent service the in
fact remember this was after weeks of
the most intensive investigation in
history of all the intelligence services
of the Western world working overtime
trying to put something together and it
was a prima facie it was a very strong
case even before you had anything and
they it ended up about where it started
with a prima facie case so let's assume
it's true so let's assume that I just
you know looked obvious the first day
still does that the actual perpetrators
come from the radical Islamic miracle
fundamentalist networks of which the bin
Laden network is undoubtedly a
significant part whether they were
involved or not
we know isn't done really matter much
but out if that's the background those
networks well where do they come from
well we know all about that nobody knows
about that better than the CIA because
it helped organize them and it nurtured
them for a long time they were brought
together in the 1980s actually and by
the CIA and its associates elsewhere
Pakistan Britain France Saudi Arabia
Egypt China was involved they may have
even been involved a little bit earlier
maybe by 1978 the idea was to try to
harass the Russians common enemy
according to Carter President Carter's
national security adviser speaking of
Brzezinski the u.s. got involved in mid
nineteen seventy-nine you remember just
to put the dates right that Russia
invaded Afghanistan in December 1979
okay according to Brzezinski the u.s.
support for the Mujahideen fighting
against the government began in six
months earlier and he's very proud of
that he says we drew the Russians into
in his words an Afghan trap by
supporting the Mujahideen getting them
to invade getting into the trap then we
could develop this terrific mercenary
army not a small one maybe a hundred
thousand men are so bringing together
the best killers they could find who
were radical Islamist fanatics from
around North Africa you know Saudi
Arabia anywhere they can find them
they're often called the Afghan anees
but many of them like in Laden were not
Afghans you know they were brought by
the CIA and its friends elsewhere
whether Brzezinski is telling the truth
or not I don't know he may have been
bragging it's probably very proud of it
knowing the consequences incidentally
but maybe it's true we'll know someday
if the documents are ever released
anyway that's his perception by january
nineteen eighty it's not even in doubt
the US was organizing the afghan
is in this massive military force to try
to cause the Russians maximal trouble it
was a legitimate thing for the Afghans
to fight the Russian invasion but the US
intervention was not helping the Afghans
in fact that pract destroy the country
and much more the Afghan ease so-called
had their own it did force the Russians
to withdraw finally although many
analysts believe it had probably delayed
their withdrawal because they were
trying to get out already anyway
whatever they did withdraw meanwhile the
terrorist forces that the CIA was
organizing arming and training carrying
it we're pursuing their own agenda right
away wasn't a secret one of their first
acts was in 1981 when they assassinated
the president of Egypt who was one of
the most enthusiastic of their creators
in 1983 one suicide bomber may or may
not have been connected is pretty
shadowy nobody knows but one suicide
bomber drove the US army military out of
Lebanon and it continued they have their
own agenda they're happy the US was
happy to mobilize them to fight its
cause but meanwhile they're doing their
own thing and they were very clear about
it after 1989 when the Russians had
withdrawn they simply turned elsewhere
since then they've been fighting in
Chechnya in western China and Bosnia
Kashmir Southeast Asia North Africa all
over the place that is just what they
think I mean you know the United States
wants to silence the one free television
channel in the Arab world because it's
broadcasting a whole range of things
from Powell over to Osama bin Laden so
the u.s. is now joining the repressive
regimes in the Arab world to try to shut
it up but if you listen to it if you
listen to what bin Laden says it's worth
it there were plenty of interviews and
there are plenty of interviews by
leading Western reporters if you don't
want to listen to his own voice Robert
Fisk and others and what he's been
saying is pretty consistent for a long
time is not the only one
maybe he's the most eloquent it's not a
consistent over a long time it's
consistent with their actions so that
every reason to take it seriously their
prime enemy is the what they call the
corrupt and oppressive authoritarian
brutal regimes of the Arab world and
when they say that they get quite a
resonance in the region the they also
want to defend and they want to replace
them by properly Islamist governments
that's where they lose the people of the
region but up till then there with from
their point of view even Saudi Arabia
the most extreme fundamentalist state in
the world I suppose short of the Taliban
which is an offshoot even that's not
Islamist enough for them has even more
than that okay at that point they get
very little support but up until that
point they get plenty of support also
they want to defend Muslims elsewhere
and they hate the Russians like poison
but as soon as the Russians pulled out
of Afghanistan they stopped carrying out
terrorist acts in Russia as they'd been
doing with CIA backing before that in
Russian not just in Afghanistan they did
move over to Chechnya with but they're
they're defending Muslims against the
Russian invasion same with all the other
places i mentioned from their point of
view they're defending Muslims against
the infidels and they're very clear
about it that's what they've been doing
why did they turn against the United
States well that had to do with what
they called the US invasion of Saudi
Arabia in 1990 the US established
permanent military bases in Saudi Arabia
which from their point of view is
comparable to the Russian invasion of
Afghanistan except that Saudi Arabia is
way more important that's the home of
the holiest sites of Islam and that's
when their activities turned against the
United States you recall that in 1993
they tried to blow up the world trade
center
that part of the way but not the whole
way and that was only part of it the
plans were to blow up the UN building
the Holland and Lincoln tunnels the FBI
building I think there were others on
the list well I sort of got partway but
not all the way the person who was
jailed for that finally among the people
who was jailed was a Egyptian cleric who
had been brought into the United States
over the objections of the Immigration
Service thanks to the intervention of
the CIA which wanted to help out their
friend couple years later he was blown
up the world trade center and the and
this has been going on all over I'm not
going to run through the list but it's
kind of unique and you know if you want
to understand that it's consistent it's
consistent picture it's described in
words it's it's you know revealed in
practice for 20 years no reason not to
take it seriously that's the first
category the likely perpetrators what
about the reservoir of support well it's
not hard to find out what that is
there's some disguise one of the good
things that's happened since September
11th is that some of the press and some
discussion has begun to open up to some
of these things the best one to my
knowledge is the wall street journal
which right away began to run within a
couple of days serious report searching
serious reports on the reasons why
people of the region even if they hate
bin Laden and despise everything he's
doing nevertheless support them in many
ways and even regard him as the
conscience of Islam once it now the Wall
Street Journal and others are there not
surveying public opinion they're
surveying the opinion of their friends
bankers professionals international
lawyers businessmen tied to the United
States you know people who they
interview in McDonald's restaurants
which is an elegant restaurant they're
wearing fancy American clothes
that's the people they're interviewing
because they want to find out what their
attitudes are and their auditors are
very explicit very clear and in many
ways consonant with the message of bin
Laden and others they are very angry at
the United States because because of its
support of authoritarian and brutal
regimes its intervention to block block
any move towards democracy its
intervention to stop economic
development its policies of devastating
the civilian society of Iraq while
strengthening Saddam Hussein and they
remember even if we prefer not to that
the United States and Britain supported
Saddam Hussein right through his worst
atrocities including the gassing of the
Kurds bin Laden brings that up
constantly and they know it even if we
don't want to and of course their
support for the Israeli military
occupation which is harsh and brutal
it's now in its 35th year it's been the
US has been providing the overwhelming
economic military and diplomatic support
for it and still does and they know that
they don't like it they especially when
that's paired with US policy toward Iraq
toward the Iraqi civilian society which
is getting destroyed okay those are the
reasons roughly and when bin Laden gives
those reasons people recognize it and
support it now that's not the way people
here like to think about it at least
educated liberal opinion they like
following line which has been all over
the press mostly from left liberals
incidentally I think I'm done a real
study but I think right wing opinion has
generally been more honest but if you
look at say at the New York Times first
op-ed they ran by Ronald steel serious
left liberal intellectual he said it s
why do they hate us he this is the same
day I think that the Wall Street Journal
was running the survey on why the
hate us and so he says they hate us
because we champion a new world order of
capitalism individualism secularism and
democracy that should be the norm
everywhere that's why they hate us same
