there is an act of courage and
thoughtfulness in fact it was almost I'm
saying I'm at a point in the end of the
missile crisis with reaching a peak you
know when her staff wrote to Kennedy and
offered to settle it by a public
announcement of withdrawal of Russian
missiles from Cuba and Turkish missile
and us missiles from Turkey actually
Kennedy hadn't even known they were
there and they were being withdrawn
anyway because they were being replaced
by more lethal polaris submarines which
are invulnerable so that was the offer
Kennedy and his advisors considered it
rejected it the Kennedy himself was
estimating the likelihood of nuclear war
maybe a third to a half we rejected it
they would not he did agree to make a
secret agreement that they would
withdraw the missiles that they were
already withdrawing you know but not
public Khrushchev had to be humiliated
Kennedy other maintain as much Oh image
he's praised for this and in fact not
even mentioned I try to find it is that
a couple of months before the crisis
blew up the United States had just sent
nuclear missiles with nuclear warheads
same kind to Okinawa aiming at China at
a period of great regional tension well
who cares you know we have a right to do
anything we want anywhere in the world
okay over the fact that the law there's
other lessons to time to bandwidth but
ten years after that 1973 Henry
Kissinger called a nuclear alert the new
high-level nuclear alert the point was
to warn the Russians not to interfere in
the Israel Arab war that was going on
and in particular not to interfere with
the fact that Kissinger had informed the
Israelis that they could violate
ceasefire that the US and Russia had
just agreed upon so he wanted to make
sure the Russians didn't disrupt this so
he called it it we were alert nothing
happened ten years after that Ronald
Reagan was in office since he came into
office he is his advisors had the u.s.
force a US US Air Force penetrating
Russian airspace to try to elicit
information about Russian warning
systems so that can be a mock attack you
know fortunately the rest of the
residents had a war scare in fact they
might have thought this is a really
first-rate but fortunately they didn't
and it goes on like that well right at
the moment it's on the front pages in
the case of North Korea in case of Iran
and there are ways to deal with these
crises maybe maybe they won't work but
at least you can try I have been
considered not even being reported I
guess there's time I could talk about
them so for example the case of Iran
which is considered in the West the
gravest threat the world peace not not
elsewhere just in the West some Western
obsession but not in the Arab world you
know I'm not an age you know but is
there a way to deal with it a pretty
sensible way it was just proposed a
couple of months ago at the meeting of
the non-aligned countries most of the
world in fact they were just reiterating
the proposal was me around for decades
and in fact has been approved by the
General Assembly so on the proposal is
to move towards establishing a nuclear
weapons-free zone in the region well no
not the answer to everything but pretty
significant step forward and there are
ways to proceed with that the under UN
auspices
version treaty there was to be a
international conference in Finland last
December which was to try to implement
plans to move towards this well what
happened he won't read it in the
newspapers because it wasn't reported
but what happened you can read in arms
control journals and so on in early
November you ran agreed to attend the
meeting a couple of days later the u.s.
canceled the meeting the saying the time
wasn't right you know the European
Parliament issued a statement calling
for it to continue the Arab states that
would continue but so we're so we'll
move on towards harsher sanctions
against the population doesn't hurt the
regime and maybe war you know who knows
what'll happen and Northeast Asia is
kind of a same sort of thing North Korea
may be the craziest country in the world
you know it's certainly a good
competitor but it does make sense to try
to look at to try to see fear was in the
minds of people if they're acting crazy
so why would they behave the way their
behavior well just imagine ourselves in
the air position let's take say Spain so
suppose that Spain had been totally
leveled everything destroyed by a huge
superpower which was gloating in it they
could read the military journals public
journals of this superpower while they
were when they've gotten to the time
when they destroyed everything in Spain
there was nothing like that i sent the
air force to destroy the dams let's
imagine they're huge dams you know
control the water supply so they destroy
the damsels of course a war crime for
which people hanged at Nuremberg but
destroy the dams and then talking just
very excitedly about how wonderful it
was to see the water pouring down and
digging out the valleys and the Asian
stirring around try to survive we can't
think we can't even imagine what this
means to Asians means destruction of
their rice crop starvation and death so
it's really magnificent that it's not in
our memory it's in their memory and
let's go to the present I was an
interesting recent history in 1993 there
was a Israel in North Korea we're moving
towards an agreement in which North
Korea would stop and sending any
missiles or part and any high technology
the Middle East and Israel would
recognize North Korea Clinton intervened
and blocked it shortly after that in
retaliation North Korea had carried out
a minor missile test they did reach in
the u.s. and North Korea did reach an
agreement framework agreement 1994 and
it was more or less honored by both
sides not completely but pretty much
when George Bush came into office North
Korea had maybe one nuclear weapon and
verifiably wasn't producing anymore
maybe didn't even a well a bush
immediately launched his aggressive
militarism threatening North Korea you
know acts of evil and zone so they got
back to work on their nuclear program by
the time Bush left had eight to ten
nuclear weapons and missile system in
the in between other things happen in
2005 the u.s. and North Korea did reach
an agreement it was an agreement in
which North Korea
to put an end to all nuclear weapons and
missile development in return the US the
West mainly the US would provide a light
water reactor for their medical needs
and and end aggressive statements they
form a non-aggression pact and move
towards some kind of accommodation well
it's pretty promising except almost
immediately Bush undermined it we see
withdrew the offer of the light water
reactor and initiated programs to compel
banks to stop dealing with any North
Korean transactions even perfectly legal
ones so North Koreans reacted by picking
up their missile and weapons program and
that's pretty much the way it's been
going and it's well known the
scholarship so you can read it in
straight mainstream American scholarship
when they say is look it's a pretty
crazy regime but they're following a
kind of a tit-for-tat policy you do
something mikasa gesture will respond
with some crazy gesture but what's
happening right now there are South
korea-us military exercises which from
North Korea's point of view gotta look
threatening we think they were
threatening if they're going on in
Canada okay and in the course of these
us the most advanced bombers in the
world in history stealth
