you can I mean I don't want to say you
can do nothing like you can you know
like the church can show up at the
stockholders meeting and start screaming
about not investing in South Africa and
sometimes that has marginal effects I
don't want to say is no effect but you
can't really affect the structure of
power because of the I mean to do that
would be a social revolution and unless
you're ready for a social revolution
that is power is going to be somewhere
else the media are going to have their
present structure and they're going to
represent their present interests now
that's not to say that one shouldn't try
to do things I mean it makes sense to
try to push the limits of a system it
only takes one or two people that think
they have integrity as journalists to
getting some good press see that's
important and that goes back to
something came up before I mean there's
a lot you know our country do you know
things are complex it's not monolithic I
mean the mass media themselves are
complicated institutions with internal
contradictions so on the one hand
there's the commitment to indoctrination
and control but on the other hand
there's the sense of professional
integrity she works alone as her own
boss riding newspaper columns and
producing radio commentaries for a
hodgepodge of small clients across the
country this so-called leather lung
Texan has been firing questions at our
chief executives for almost 40 years
many a young man of this country's being
disillusioned totally by his government
these days ago this is a question which
you very properly bring to the attention
of the nation it's not that we haven't
been holding press conferences I was
just waiting for Sarah to come back very
nice of you and I appreciate it sir I
want to call your attention a real
problem we've got in this country today
those unique and often terrifying
mcclendon questions reflect her desire
to dig out information
with enough know-how and persistence she
usually gets her man what would you do
to view in a situation where you were
trying to be an honest reporter and you
were worried sick about your country and
you saw how sick it was and you facing
this week white house in a week Congress
as a reporter what would you do I think
there are a lot of reporters you do a
very good job I have a lot of friends in
the press who I think do a terrific job
what you want to but now what well
you've got you have the first person I
mean first way you have to understand
what the system is and smart recorders
do understand what it is you have to
understand what the pressures are what
the commitments are what the barriers
are and what the openings are like right
after the iran-contra hearings a lot of
good reporters understood well things
will be a little more open for a couple
of months take it ran through stories
that they knew they couldn't talk about
before we have to water and the same
after Watergate and then you know it
closes up again and so on most people I
imagine simply internalize the values
that's the easiest way and the most
successful you just internalize the
values and then you regard yourself in a
way correctly is acting perfectly freely
all right let's get to the White House
now where I think the veteran
correspondent Frank Sesno could tell us
a little bit about self-censorship that
that inertial guidance system is always
going on isn't it is there any formal
censorship there there's no
self-censorship very if somebody tells
me something I'm going to pass it on
unless as a particular and compelling
reason not to I can't deny that I
wouldn't like to have access to the Oval
Office and all the same maps and charts
and graphs with the president's looking
at but that's not possible it's not
realistic and it's probably not even
desirable
are you girls down there please welcome
to Holland it our introduce your first
in a few lines professor Chomsky Noam
Chomsky its new exists and it's all fear
the most controversial intellectual from
America its okaii and plotted to demise
over TM afternoon Chomsky has been
called the Einstein of modern
linguistics the New York Times has said
he's arguably the most important
intellectual alive today but his
presence here has sparked a protest this
book that has has poisoned the world and
a liar in there and as a Vietnamese
people I'm coming it will the book he
said that in Vietnam dest no violation
of human rights and knows crime in
Cambodia is wrong Chomsky using his a
professor he using that to poison the
world every d we come here to protest
luck I don't mind the denunciations
frankly I mind the wise well I mean
intellect was a very good at lying
they're professionals at it in a
wonderful technique there's no way of
responding of if somebody calls you have
you know an anti-semite what can you say
I'm not an anti-semite they're young
somebody says you're a racist you're a
Nazi or something this you always lose I
mean the person throws in mud always win
it because there's no way of responding
to such charges professor Chomsky seems
to believe that the people he criticizes
fall into one of two classes liars or
dupes consider what happens when I
discuss the case of obere 40 song let me
recall the facts let's not go into
details please because do we also happen
to be important yes what I have only one
question we saw Chris do the facts
matter or don't they matter of course is
let me tell you what the facts are huh
farzan says that the massacre of the
Jews in the Holocaust is a historic lie
now this is an important one has a lot
to do with the topic your views are
extremely controversial and perhaps one
of the one of the things that has been
most controversial and you've been most
strongly criticized for it was your
defensive a French intellectual who is
suspended from his university post for
contending that there were no Nazi death
camps in world war two my name is Robert
Faurisson I am 60 I am university
professor in Lyon France behind me you
may see the courthouse of Paris the
Palais de justice in this place I was
convicted many times at the beginning of
the 80s I was charged by nine
association mostly Jewish Association
for inciting hatred racial hatred for
racial defamation for damage by
falsifying a story professor Chomsky and
the number of other intellectual signed
the petition in which for a song is
called a respected professor of
literature who merely tried to make his
findings public perhaps we can start
with just the story of
Robert for a saw and your involvement
more than 500 people's sign maybe 600
mostly universite we fell off and what
happened to the other 499 of them how
come we only hear about Chomsky
signature well I think it's because
Chomsky is in himself a kind of
political power
I signed a petition calling on the
tribunal to defend the civil rights at
that point the French press which
apparently has no conception of freedom
of speech concluded that since I had
called for his civil rights I was there
for defending species for he sold then
published a book in which he tried to
prove that the nausea guest chambers
never existed what we deny is that there
was an extermination program and an
extermination actually especially in gas
chambers or gas vans the book contains a
precious written by professor Chomsky in
which he calls for his own a relatively
a political sort of liberal a communist
is a man he jus is it man energy is a
man I am a man are you a Nazi I am NOT
in adding how would you describe
yourself politically
nothing well you know that's that's not
the pressive preface that I wrote
because I never wrote a preface and you
know that I never wrote a press he's
referring to a statement of mine on
civil liberties which was added to a
book in which for asan excuse me yes you
said we do not meaning that's right I'm
the language I use as someone who views
can be dignified by the word findings or
conclusions that is a judgment and that
is a favorable judgment always do our
country I continue with that yes you can
continue with the facts for hours but
but I mean but but there are through fix
that okay let's get gonna be so called
preface I was then asked by the person
who organized the petition to write a
statement on freedom of speech they are
just bunnell kind of us about freedom of
speech pointing out the difference
between both defending a person's right
to express his views and defending the
views expressed so i did that i wrote a
rather banal statement called some
elementary remarks on freedom of
expression and i told him do what you
like with it so cam produced a book
which all the arguments of forests on
where to be put in front of the court
and we thought wise to use the text of
norm Chomsky as a kind of warning a
forward to say that it was a matter of
freedom of expression freedom of thought
freedom of reserves why did you try at
the last moment to get it back from
that's the one thing I'm sorry about but
there's one real that's not it's not a
thing it's Norris emails I tried to
reduce it in with that you said it was
the role of no I didn't say in fact take
a look at what i wrote a letter which
will then publicize in which i said look
things have reached the point where the
French intellectual community simply is
incapable of understanding the issues
look at this point it's just going to
confuse matters even more if my comments
on freedom of speech happen to be
attached to this book which I don't
didn't know existed so just to clarify
things better separate them now in
retrospect I think I should have done
that
I should have just said fine then let it
appear because it ought to appear but
that's apart from that I regard this is
not on a trivial but as compared with
other positions I've taken on freedom of
speech invisible I do not think that the
state were to have the right to
determine historical truth and to punish
people be needed I'm not willing to give
the state that right even if they happen
that row 19 if the gas chambers have a
person's day but I'm saying if you
believe in freedom speech you believe in
freedom speech with music own life I
mean gurbles was in favor of freedom
speech for busy like right so is Stalin
if you're in favor of freedom speech
that means you're in favor of freedom
speech precisely for views you despise
otherwise you're not in favor of freedom
speech it's two positions you can have
on freedom of speech and you can decide
which position you want with regard to
my defense of the utterly offensive the
people who express utterly offensive
views I have the slightest doubt that
every commissar says you're defending
that person's views no i'm not i'm
defending is right to express them the
difference is crucial and the difference
has been understood outside of fascist
circles since the 18th century is there
anything like objectivity all scientific
objectivity reality as a scientist but
I'm not saying I defend the views I look
if somebody published in a scientific
article which I disagree with I do not
say the state ought to put them in jail
all right but you don't have to support
him right away and say you know ice to
know in general the sake of you but
you're saying they thought it was
suppose this guy is taken to court and
charged with falsification then I'm
going to defend anybody that's what i
can to call oh you're wrong
but when did you write support I mean
when he was brought in fact the only
support that I gave him is to say he has
a right of freedom speech puri there is
no doubt in my mind that the example
that I gave about the story it is the
volatility not exist is very very
typically how much another example about
how much is the American press believes
the glory song has anything to say or
any press how much of the press in
France since I follow what percentage
would you say I'll tell you this is it
higher than zero I think higher NJ right
they have you ever seen anything in any
newspaper or any journal guys saying
that this man is anything of the cabinet
I'll try to answer I try to answer I
think that I just followed that a simple
quest I followed the case five or six
years ago and I happened to see that the
North Shore ski was in for strong
criticism even from some of his
supporters for doing something which
could be interpreted only in terms of a
campaign against Israel going back years
I am absolutely certain that I've taken
far more extreme positions on people who
deny the Holocaust that you have for
example you go back to my earliest
articles and you will find that I say
that even to enter into the arena of
debate on the question of whether the
Nazis carry out such atrocities is
already to lose one's humanity so I
don't think it would discuss the issue
if you want to know my opinion but if
anybody wants to refute for asana
there's certainly no difficulty in doing
to them
I'm not interested in a freedom of
speech and all that I have to win and
that's the question and I shall win I'm
just an ordinary mum who's just thinks
in terms of I don't want to someday be
holding my grandchildren and watching
something horrible happen and feel like
I didn't do anything and I mean it's
obvious what what you're doing and my
question is on a practical level where
do you see the most practical place to
put your energy I mean tonight I feel an
overwhelming I feel like it's too big
it's too much to even make a dent in the
way things change is because lots of
people are working all the time and you
know they're working in their
communities in their workplace or
wherever they happen to be and they're
building up the basis for popular
movements which are going to make
changes that's the way everything has
ever happened in history you know
whether it was in slavery or whether it
was the Democratic revolutions or
anything you want you name it that's the
way it worked you get a very false
picture of this from the history books
in the history books there's a couple of
liters you know George Washington
Luther King or whatever and I don't want
to say that those people are unimportant
Mark Martin Luther King was certainly
important but he was not the civil
rights movement Martin Luther King can
appear in the history books cost lots of
people whose names you will never know
and whose names are all forgotten than
who may have been killed and so on we're
working down in the south when you have
active activists than people concerned
than people devoting themselves and
dedicating themselves to social change
or issues or whatever then people like
me can appear and we can appear to be
prominent but that's only because
somebody else is doing the work and I
work whether it will see giving hundreds
of talks a year or spending 20 hours a
week writing letters or writing books is
not directed to intellectuals and
politicians it's directed to what are
called ordinary people yeah and what I
expect from them is in fact exactly what
they are that they should try to
understand the world and act in
accordance with their decent impulses
and that they should try to improve the
world and many people are willing to do
that but they have to understand that in
fact as far as I can see in these things
well I feel that I'm simply helping
people develop the courses of
intellectual self-defense what did you
mean by that we'll go with such a course
where I don't mean go to school because
we're not going to get it there alright
it means you have to develop an
independent mind and work on it now it's
extremely hard to do
the beauty of their system is it
isolates everybody each person is
sitting alone to front of the tube
that's very hard to have ideas or
thoughts under those circumstances you
can't fight the world alone some people
can this creeper here the way to do it
is through organization so courses of
intellectual self-defense will have to
be in the context of political and other
organization and it makes sense I think
to look at what the institutions are
trying to do and to take that almost as
a key what they're trying to do is what
we're trying to combat if they're trying
to keep people isolated and separate and
you know and so on well we're trying to
do the opposite we're trying to bring
them together so in your local community
you want to have sources of alternative
action people with parallel concerns may
be differently focused but at the core
sort of similar values and a similar
interest in helping people learn how to
defend themselves against external power
and taking control of their lives and
you know reaching out your hand the
people who need it that's a common array
of concerns you can learn about your own
values and you can figure out how to
defend yourself and so on in conjunction
with others are there one or two
publications that I as an average person
the biologists can read to bypass this
filter of our part of our press now if
you ask what media can I turn to to get
the right answers first of all I
wouldn't tell you
because I don't think there's an answer
the right answers are what you decide
are the right answers maybe everything
I'm telling is wrong cook perfectly well
be but that's something for you to
figure out when I can tell you what I
think happens to be more or less right
but there isn't any reason why you
should pay any attention to what impact
do you feel alternative media is
currently having or could potentially
have I'm actually a little more
interested in its potential and just to
define my terms by alternative media i'm
referring to media that are or could be
citizen controlled as opposed to state
or corporate control you know that's
what's kept people together to the
extent that people are able to do
something constructive it's because they
have some way of interacting I'm I've
always felt it would be a very positive
thing and it should be pushed as far as
it can go I think it's been a very hard
time there's just such a concentration
of resources and power that alternative
media while extremely important or I
have quite a battle it's true there are
things which are small successes but
it's because people have just been
willing to put an incredible effort like
say take Z magazine I mean that's a
national magazine which literally has a
staff of two and no resources tell us a
little about zeemagazine what it is and
what makes it different go ahead thank
you we just wanted to do a magazine that
would address all the sides of political
life economics race gender authority
political relations then we wanted to do
it in a way that would incorporate an
attention to how to not only understand
what's going on but how to make things
better what to aim toward and
to provide at the same time humor
culture a kind of a magazine that people
could relate to and could get a lot out
of and could participate in and what we
wanted to do which we didn't think was
provided by the existing magazines was
to give it a real activist slant so that
it could be very useful to the variety
of movements in the country and we just
felt there wasn't a magazine and
reflected that that inspired people and
that gave people sort of a strategy and
perhaps even a vision of how things
could be better south end press has sort
of been aided that is their surviving
it's a small collective again with no
resources and they put a lot of books
including quite a lot of good books but
for a Southend book to get reviewed it's
almost impossible editorially and
business-wise we make decisions based on
politics that no corporate publisher can
really advocate because of their ties to
corporate America we can solicit
manuscripts based on what we feel is the
relevance for the movement and we can
make our business decisions based on
whether we feel people can afford our
books whether we feel that a book might
not make that much money but it needs to
be out there and maybe there is a
thousand people who would buy it and
those are criteria that we feel are very
precious in this day of corporate
mergers on likewise our structure about
sharing work and continuing our training
process as long as we're at the press
there are losses there in terms of
productivity but in terms of empowerment
all of us are then able to say my
perspective is different from yours then
all of our intelligence gets used in
making those decisions and not just
whoever happens to have done it the
longest whoever happens to have
graduated from the best schools in order
to be the best editor making all the
decisions and only you
his or her intelligence who so
supportive radio in the united states
has undergone a remarkable growth in the
last decade it's perhaps the fastest
growing alternative media there are many
reasons for this first and foremost is
that it's enormously economical and it
reaches communities that have not been
served by community radio before and in
Boulder particular we see with someone
like Noam Chomsky who's been there I
believe three times in the last six
years he has a tremendous audience and
kg nu is partly responsible for that
because we play his tapes on a regular
basis we play his lectures and his
interviews so when he does come to
boulder and people hear what he has to
say they're able to tune in it's not
something exotic or esoteric that he's
talking about its material that they're
very familiar with and he's noted
