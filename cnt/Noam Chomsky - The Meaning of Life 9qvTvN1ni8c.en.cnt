what is the meaning of life the meaning
of life is what you make of it life does
not have any meaning apart from that for
a human a dog a bacterium or anything
else it is up to you what the meaning of
your life is so it is partially under
your control if you decide your life is
maximization of goods then that is the
meaning of life we can have sympathy for
you
but that is what it is if you decide
that your life is friendship love mutual
aid mutual support a community of people
who try to increase their own and other
people's happiness and welfare then that
is the meaning of life but there is no
external force that decides what do you
think is driving the need to answer that
question about the meaning of life it is
probably the sense of either
unwillingness or inability to take your
life in your own hands if you see
yourself as a creature of external
forces buffeted by a market government
parental authority whatever it may be
then you search for something elsewhere
that will tell you what the meaning of
your life is if you have developed it is
a value judgment what I think of as a
healthy respect for yourself and others
you will design the meaning of your life
of course you can't do it completely you
may want to be a world champion high
jumper let us say and you may not be
able to achieve that but you can shape
your life to a substantial extent and
that way give it meaning
in fact discover the meaning as you
proceed you don't know in advance it is
after you develop relationships that you
discover their value do you think the
key would be in the relationship itself
for example in some kind of collective
meaning unless you are a hermit if a
person decides I'm going to be a hermit
I'll get myself a piece of land in
Montana
I'll farm it I'll live by myself I won't
pay any attention to other human beings
I'll have no form of communication with
others ok that is the meaning of your
life I know people who have become
Hermits
I met one climbing a mountain once the
guy was living in a mountain hut and he
just wanted to be alone
that is a choice you can have for most
people live means warm supportive social
relationships but you don't know it in
advance take say marriage suppose you
get married when you are 20 you don't
really know what the meaning of that
relationship is you may be discovering
it 60 years later as relationships
mature circumstances change you have
children which has a new dimension of
meaning to your life that you can't
imagine or maybe it becomes sour but
these are things that develop through
life and at each stage if you do have
the sense of self-respect and autonomy
and concern for others you can within
the limits that external factors provide
determine and discover the meaning of
your life discovery is not a small part
of it
