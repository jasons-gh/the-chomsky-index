we live in a world of immense violence
and kind of like unbridled materialism /
capitalism we have we have kind of
global issues like nuclear proliferation
we have to restructure an education
system which is defunct we have
environmental degradation the huge gap
between rich and poor and I'm just
wondering how do we approach these
issues on a global level you know it's
not just like it's affecting here it's
not just affecting South Korea it's not
just affecting India it's I wonder how
it is anarcho syndicalism is that is
that is that viable somehow or how how
do you approach the world I think the
basics for us as anarcho-syndicalism
anarchism generally applies everywhere
wherever there are structures of
domination and control hierarchy and
oppression they are not self-justifying
should be challenged and if they can't
demonstrate that legitimacy overthrown I
think that applies to every case you've
mentioned it has it's not a formula as
to how to deal with say environmental
destruction but it lies in the
background each of the cases you
mentioned requires its own type of the
action with regard to nuclear
proliferation actually we have an answer
the problem is to implement it the the
non-proliferation treaty obligates the
nuclear powers to carry out good faith
measures to eliminate nuclear weapons
that's actually a legal obligation as
was determined by the International
Court of Justice back in the mid-90s and
it also requires other countries not to
develop the clear weapons there are at
the moment several that have outside the
NPT Israel India Pakistan and North
Korea
yeah but there are ways to overcome this
for example in the case of the Middle
East the one way to a serious way to
approach would be to try to establish a
nuclear weapons-free zone in the Middle
East it's been formally accepted by the
West but only formally just last
December there was to be a conference in
Helsinki to move forward on this
proposal Israel announced they wouldn't
attend Iran announced that they would
attend with no preconditions and a
couple of days later President Obama
canceled the conference so it didn't
take place there's pressure to renew it
from the European Union from Russia of
mainly the Arab states but unless the
United States is willing to
significantly participate it's not going
to go anywhere but there are mechanism
we can think of ways of overcoming this
problem when you turn to environmental
degradation it's a little bit different
then I mean it's a horrible problem
we're moving towards a precipice which
is of extreme danger racing towards it
and the longer we wait to eliminate to
reliance on fossil fuels the worse it's
going to be but it's not so clear how to
do that it's different from the nuclear
threat which in fact at least in
principle we know how to get rid of dr.
Noam Chomsky thank you so much we really
appreciate it yeah thanks
