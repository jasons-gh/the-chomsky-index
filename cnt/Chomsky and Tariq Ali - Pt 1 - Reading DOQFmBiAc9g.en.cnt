you
I'm really honored to be introducing
them Chomsky who is someone I have
respected and admired for a long long
time and it's interesting that whenever
people who were once on the Left are
about to move to the right which happens
the first test for the to know what
they're about to do is when they try to
reassure the people they work for their
colleagues by saying I'm not part of the
Chomsky left whenever anyone says that
beware because they could end up
anywhere and some of them have ended up
supporting george w bush many people who
initially started off by saying I'm not
part of the Chomsky left so that's
always a good test now it's difficult to
talk about Noam because his work is so
well-known all over the world and he
wears so many hats and speaks in so many
different places that it's not easy to
put him in a box and say this is what he
is and that's all but let me try when I
was thinking who Noam reminded me of the
most as a public intellectual the name
that came to mind was someone very
different from them in many ways but
quite similar in others and that was the
late British philosopher Bertrand
Russell and Bertrand Russell at early
stage in his life became a conscientious
objector refused to fight in the First
World War
unlike Noam he came from a very
prominent aristocratic family in Britain
you know one of the oldest aristocratic
families in Britain the dukes of Bedford
and when Burton Russell became very
radical and said we have to have a war
crimes tribunal to judge the United
States for war crimes in Vietnam we
couldn't find a single hotel in London
which was prepared to give us room and
we said to Russell we said what are we
going to do and he said oh this is the
first time I've regretted having given
up all my inheritance
mm so we said but we've got to do he
said I will make a few phone calls and
the first meeting of the international
war crimes tribunal on Vietnam was held
in the hotel Russell in Bedford Square
property that had been owned by
Russell's family in which he'd given
away I mean he said he didn't want to be
part of it now the important thing about
Russell like Nome was that he was not
fearful of speaking his mind and
speaking the truth to heads of state two
heads of governments I remember once I
met him just after some particular
atrocity in Vietnam and Russell had been
at some ceremony where the British prime
minister had come forward to greet him
and said hallo Lord Russell and Russell
said I could not bear the thought of
shaking this man's hand because he
backed the war in Vietnam so he turned
his back on him and walked away and
there are people like that around and
Noam Chomsky is one of the few and this
is the voice of America which we have to
defend and promote all over the world
because if there weren't people weren't
dissidents like Chomsky it would be very
difficult to defend the United States
and explain to people that there is an
opposition that not everyone in the
United States follows the government and
that often there is a large opposition
which is not reflected in the press and
this is what being a public intellectual
is all about and recently there's been a
spate of essays and some books bad books
bad essays published in bad newspapers
which have talked about public
intellectuals and then when you read
them they come up with figures like
Thomas Friedman and Michael Ignatieff
and Christopher Hitchens and and various
other jokers now the point is for me
there are two types of intellectuals
there are these people I've mentioned
and others we could name quite a few
these in my opinion are state
intellectuals they're not public
intellectuals they don't speak in the
public interest they're State
intellectuals they defend the state they
speak on its behalf they carry on
writing in defense of its lies and its
atrocities and its crimes as if it was
simple people who all supported the war
in Iraq do not care a damn that a
hundred thousand Iraqis have been killed
100,000 Iraqis and all these state
intellectuals who defend the war in Iraq
never speak about this figure because
that doesn't bother them well Chomsky
does and he is meticulous in the way he
searches the facts analyzes them and
presents them and it is to his enormous
credit that he does this in a country
whose political culture has totally
isolated him I mean let's things are not
that good in Europe either I don't want
to exaggerate but if Chomsky was living
in France or Britain he would have a
column fairly regularly in any major
newspaper in Germany France Britain or
Italy there's no question about it
because things have not got that bad
there as yet they may
but in the United States this is
impossible it's impossible and this
despite this his voice is heard all over
the world despite the fact that he is
treated as a pariah in his own country
by the mainstream establishment as well
as by the liberal establishment to a
large extent but despite the fact this
is the one American voice which is
respected in Iraq which is respected by
ordinary people in Pakistan which is
respected in virtually the whole
continent of Latin America why because
everyone knows that in order to win you
need the support of the American people
you need the support of American
citizens ordinary people and noam
chomsky is the one person who gives a
voice to many of these people who can
never be heard either on the american
media or outside and that makes him
extremely important and that makes him a
very precious asset for dissidents and
for resistance movements all over the
world and now he's been doing this for a
long long time nearly 45 years and this
voice has become stronger and stronger
and stronger and the fact that the
enemies his enemies and our enemies in
many cases cannot deal with this forces
them to resort to slanders to lies
because they can't deal with his
arguments even though he's not on
television he's not published regularly
anywhere in the mainstream press his
books circulate all over the world and
his voice cannot be drowned and even
this single voice dominant powerful
truthful they don't like they don't like
it they attack him people who have
endless reams of space in the New York
Times and The Washington Post they can
say what they want they feel obliged to
attack him and it's interesting this
because they could ignore him if they
wished but they can't and the reason
they can't is because Chomsky's voice
has become the conscience of his country
and is heard all over the world and that
is the reason why he can't be ignored I
first read text binome 40 years ago at
the time of the Vietnam War and he
influenced me and he influenced many
generations
it's the third generation now which is
influencing and it's wonderful to see
him in different parts of the world
especially when he's speaking to young
people a new generation and you feel
when he speaks in his own characteristic
fashion as you will hear soon when he
speaks you and and the young listen
avidly to him you feel that he is
passing on the baton of dissent to a new
generation and that is an extremely
important task today because we live in
a turbulent unpleasant world we live in
a world where this country has become
too powerful and too militarily dominant
for its own good and we need more and
more dissenting voices so my slogan
so so I think our slogan has to be
create two three many Chomsky's I'm very
proud to welcome Noam Chomsky on behalf
of the lemon foundation here today
I could thank you more eloquently if I
could see you but it's all black so I
assume there are people there my last
visit to New Mexico was five years ago
for the to join in the celebration of
the 20th anniversary of IRC I'm very
pleased to be able to participate in the
25th anniversary celebration since that
time as you know the name has changed
the scope is broadened but the mission
remains the central component as they
put it is to make the United States a
more responsible global partner and to
engage citizens in that endeavor
well that task was urgent enough five
years ago even at that time there were
warnings from right at the heart of the
establishment that quoting much of the
world regards the United States as a
rogue state and the greatest threat to
their existence that happens to be
Samuel Huntington Harvard professor at
in foreign affairs the Journal of the
Council on Foreign Relations and he was
not alone shortly after the president of
the American Political Science
Association repeated the same message in
very similar words that was five years
ago since then situation has become far
worse it's now not much of the world
that regards the US as a rogue state and
the greatest threat to their existence
but most of the world almost all of it
in fact George Bush has his
administration has succeeded in a few
years in making the United States the
most feared and often hated country in
the world well one reason for this
obvious is the invasion of Iraq which
against extraordinary
opposition in fact I can't think of a
historical parallel to that that
incidentally includes the so-called
Coalition of the Willing so at the
summit meeting announcing war declaring
the war virtually George Bush and his
I'll say politely associate Tony Blair
were joined by Prime Minister Eisner of
Spain to announce that the war was going
to start in a couple of days at that
point Eisner had support of two percent
of the population of Spain for joining
in the u.s. British war and he was
therefore a hailed as a great leader of
what was called the new Europe the grand
hope for democracy in fact the
performance about new Europe and old
Europe was very enlightening one that
was very sharp cry you remembered of
course new Europe were the good guys the
hope of the future the leaders of the
Democratic Crusade and so on old Europe
were the bad guys
stuck in their old ways don't have
democratic credentials the criterion to
distinguish them was extremely sharp old
Europe bad guys were the countries where
the government's took the same position
as the large majority of their
population knew Europe were the
countries like Spain where the
government overruled even larger
majorities of their population huge ones
in the case of Spain and Italy and
followed orders from Crawford Texas so
they were therefore they understood the
nature of democracy perhaps the most
extraordinary case was Turkey which to
everyone's surprise mine too
the government actually followed the
took the same position as 95 percent of
the population and rejected Washington's
orders and they were bitterly condemned
by the US leadership intellectuals Paul
Wolfowitz who's identified by the
Washington Post as the what they call
the idealist in chief leading the
democracy crusade he went so far as to
berate the Turkish military because they
didn't force the government to overrule
95% of the population and take their
marching orders from the boss and he
ordered them to apologize to the United
States for this and to make it clear
that their task is to help America well
that performance was doubly interesting
at first because it took place and
second because nobody seemed to notice
it and what it meant and what it means
about the elite conceptions of democracy
shouldn't require any comment what it
means is democracy is fine as long as
you do what we say and we of course
doesn't mean you and me or the people of
the United States it means the political
and economic leadership and that
conception is so deeply ingrained that
even in an incredible case like this it
literally can't be noticed well one
reason for the the deterioration in the
position of the United States and the
eyes of the world is of course the
invasion of Iraq for most of the world
that was the supreme international crime
encompassing all the evil that follows
the wording of the Nuremberg judgement
trying the Nazi criminals including
people like the Nazi foreign minister
from Ribbentrop who was accused and
hanged in fact for such crimes as as
preparing the diplomatic background for
Hitler's a preemptive strike against
Norway which leave the consequences of
the conclusion from that to you the evil
that followed was only increased the
fear and the hatred that's first of all
the fate of Iraqis as Tyriq mentioned
the most probable estimate of deaths
done in a careful study several months
ago is about a hundred thousand mostly
violent deaths it's the u.s. invasion
the number of children suffering from
acute malnutrition has doubled it's now
at the level of Burundi lower than Haiti
and Uganda these matters were barely
reported in the United States and
insofar as they even mentioned quickly
dismissed in England there was enough of
a response so that the British
government had to release a pathetic and
the embarrassing answer here not even
that and that's a rather important fact
that has to be borne in mind for people
here who care about their country the
follow that that's just the beginning of
it what followed were really serious
outright war crimes of just seen one the
last few months the invasion of Fallujah
and in this case the crimes were not
concealed which may be worse than
passing them over in silence so they
were openly reported and in fact proudly
reported you could see on the front page
of the New York Times a big picture of
the first victory in the conquest of
Fallujah the first target was the
Fallujah General Hospital and The Times
featured a big picture on the front page
of a soldier standing guard over people
lying on the floor
in hospital gowns with their hands tied
behind their backs and the story
explained that the American forces that
went in forced patients from their bed
from their beds forced them to lie on
the floor and manacle them with their
hands behind their backs the story went
on to say that this had to be done
because the Fallujah General Hospital
was serving as a propaganda weapon for
the insurgents by releasing the casualty
figures and the times added of course
that these are inflated the casualty
figures they knew they were inflated
because our dear leader had announced
that which is apparently enough the
foundation of contemporary modern post
Second World War humanitarian law and in
fact part of the supreme law of the land
in the United States is the Geneva
Conventions the conventions explicitly
and unambiguously state that any medical
facility must be protected by any
confidence in any conflict anything
other than that is a major war crime
grave breach of the Geneva Conventions
under the under you contempt current US
law the War Crimes Act of 1996 passed by
Republican Congress grave breaches of
the Geneva Conventions carry a sentence
of a possible death penalty
maybe our coming Attorney General had
that kind of thing in mind a couple of
years ago when he was legal counsel to
President Bush and advised him in that
capacity that he should rescind the
effective levers in the Geneva
Conventions to reduce the likelihood of
prosecution
well again you can draw the conclusions
yourselves all of this was passed over
very lightly here mostly without comment
but not elsewhere the evil that followed
the invasion and is encompassed in the
supreme international crime didn't only
include Iraq there are
winces for the rest of the world to
including Americans one of the
consequences is an increase in terrorism
the kind of terrorism that passes
through our doctrinal filters namely
terrorism by others against us
other kind is not recognized but that
category of terrorism as anticipated
increased before the invasion there were
warnings from specialists people
knowledgeable about the area Tarek was
one of the early ones in fact even the
US and British intelligence agencies
that the invasion of Iraq would be
likely to increase the threat of
terrorism and in fact those warnings
were realized that they did increase the
threat the National Intelligence
Estimate
in the United States that was presented
to George Bush a month before the
invasion released recently warned that
the invasion would very likely increase
the threat of terrorism just a few weeks
ago the National Intelligence Council
the coordinating body of intelligence
agencies released its projections for
the next 15 years and one of them is
that Iraq will now become a trade is
becoming and will continue to be a
training ground for jihadi terrorists
Islamic terrorists much in the way that
Afghanistan was in the past they didn't
go on to say when Afghanistan was a
training ground for terrorists so let's
add that it was in the primarily at
first in the 1980s when the CIA and its
associates pretty much the present
administration or their mentors
organized radical Islamist terrorists
from around the world for their own
state purposes created the foundation of
what is now called al-qaeda and other
related organizations and then again
Afghanistan became a major training
ground for terrorists after
Clinton bomb the Sudan and Afghanistan
in 1998 that led to warmer closer
relations between Osama bin Laden and
the Taliban previously cool and turn
Afghanistan into a training ground for
terrorists again now Iraq is taking its
place well these are this carries
consequences for everyone and very
threatening ones sooner or later a
terrorism and weapons of mass
destruction are going to be United and
the consequences could be pretty awful
there are other sources of global
concern and fear and anger with regard
to the United States which were evident
even before the Iraq invasion primarily
the stance of brazen contempt for the
entire framework of international order
that has been laborious ly constructed
since World War two and is simply
dismissed with contempt by the
administration just to take one of many
examples related to terror the National
Intelligence Council report that I just
mentioned predicts that one of the major
threat to the United States will be
biological weapons now that threat can
be reduced and we know how to reduce it
there is a bio weapons treaty but it has
no enforcement mechanism and there have
been negotiations been going on for
several years to add enforcement
measures to the bioweapons treaty which
would certainly have the effect of
monitoring controlling and reducing the
threat of biological terror that the
National Intelligence Council warned
against however that's not going to
happen in September of 2002 right after
the Bush administration released its
national security strategy which sent
plenty of shivers around the world a
couple of days later
point man john bolton informed europe
that there would be no further
negotiations to introduce enforcement
measures into the bio weapons treaty the
reasons that were given was that
inspection of course that would involve
inspection and inspection might harm the
interests of US pharmaceutical
corporations there are also suspicions
that washington wants to conceal illegal
bioweapons research and development that
it's carrying its carrying out so
therefore the National Intelligence
Council is quite right to a warrant of
the increasing threat of biological
warfare terror here however there are
much worse threats than biological
weapons far worse nuclear weapons and
militarization of space are surely the
most serious threats all of this is
particular of particular significance in
New Mexico because New Mexico as I'm
sure you know one of the major centers
in enhancing these threats to survival
and in this case we are literally
talking about survival of the species
well these threats are leading to much
more dire warnings than those that I
quoted again from the heart of the
establishment so last summer the Journal
of the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences which is very sober and
respectable and given to hyperbole ran
an article by two prominent strategic
analysts John Steinbrenner and Nancy
Gallagher in which they pointed out
these are mostly quotes that the
military programs an aggressive stance
of the administration carry in their
words appreciable
risk of ultimate doom and they go on to
say that you have to look very hard in
fact I can't think of the case where
such words have ever been pronounced in
establishment respectable establishment
circles they go on to say that if the
United States is to remain a democracy
worthy of the name the political
system will have to acknowledge that the
United States is now the dominant threat
to everyone else
the their words the super outlaw state
they want to explain that the terrifying
technology that is being developed in
Donald Rumsfeld's transformation of the
military will assuredly diffuse to the
rest of the world there will be a
competition in intimidation an action
reaction cycle creating rising dangers
potentially unmanageable ones for
Americans as well and in fact that's
already been happening the Russia a year
ago had its first military serious
military exercises in 20 years they
deployed new offensive weapons more
sophisticated missiles nuclear-armed
aimed at the United States US military
analysts estimate that Russia may have
tripled its military expenditures since
the Bush administration came in with its
militaristic stance they have officially
adopted the Bush administration's
so-called pre-emptive war strategy
meaning asserting the right of a first
strike even a first nuclear strike
without without the pretext of defense
Washington's aggressive stance is
compelling the Russians who are much
weaker of course to transfer missiles
thousands of miles from one part of
their territory to another repeatedly
this is over very lightly defended areas
nuclear-armed missiles very tempting
target for terrorists their offensive
nuclear system has been placed on care
trigger alert computer-controlled firing
we know about how the u.s. systems work
lots known about that our systems are
also computer controlled and there are
regular occurance
frequent occurrences of the computer
systems giving a warning that a missile
the u.s. is under attack and must
respond the rules are that when such a
warning comes and it is very frequent
there are three minutes for a human
intervention to determine whether it's
an authentic attack and then there's a
time for presidential authorization 30
seconds that's the way our systems work
the Russian systems are far worse for
the more deteriorating the threat is
being very consciously enhanced and it's
very serious when a senator former
senator Sam Nunn who was one of the
leading figures in arms control a couple
of weeks ago that it is madness for a
human survival to depend on the hope
that regular computer errors will be
caught in time the threat is severe and
he says may well be increasing well we
know that there have been very close
calls in the past the most dangerous was
discovered in October 2002 on the 40th
anniversary of the Missile Crisis it
there was a conference of in Havana of
high-level participants those were still
alive in the original Missile Crisis
from the United States Cuba and Russia
and that they had already known that the
Missile Crisis was Arthur Schlesinger
put at Kennedy memoirs an advisor was
the most dangerous moment in history but
they're shocked at what was learned that
this 40th anniversary meeting it turned
out that the world was literally one
word away from nuclear war the details
if you like two of the leading scholars
of the Missile Crisis who helped
organize that meeting James blight and
Phil Brenner commented that it is
miraculous that the world escaped the
nuclear war on that occasion and it had
unusual contemporary relevance in
another respect the Missile Crisis was
in large part a consequence of a major
international terrorist campaign
john f kennedy's operation mongoose the
goal of which was to bring the terrors
of the earth to cuba those are the
that's again Arthur Schlessinger is
words and his biography of Robert
Kennedy describing Kennedy Robert
Kennedy's a goal he was in charge of
these operations which he made the
highest priority for US intelligence
agencies led pretty directly to the
Missile Crisis and to the miraculous
escape well this was the most important
news in many years
it was barely reported literally it and
all ignored a few people even know about
it
which raises further questions about the
viability of American democracy and
reasons why the world should be
frightened we should be too without
saying so explicitly the two strategic
analysts I mentioned the Steinbrenner
and Gallagher express a very deep
despair about American democracy after
outlining the policies that they say
carry an appreciable risk of ultimate
doom they express hope that the policies
will be changed but not from within the
United States apparently they don't
consider that an option they hope that
the policies that there will be a
coalition of peace-loving states which
will counter American militarism
militarism and aggressiveness which they
hope will be led by China we've come to
a pretty pass when leading analysts in
the most respectable journals hope that
China can save us from the collapse of
American democracy what that implies
about ourselves is pretty shocking why
did they pick China we'll explain first
reason is that China has been in the
forefront of international efforts at
the United Nations to preserve space for
peaceful purposes that has been blocked
unilaterally
Washington actually since the Clinton
years not reported incidentally though
of extreme importance it became much
worse since Bush took over right after
the national security strategy was
announced which essentially declared the
u.s. intention to dominate the world by
force and prevent any threat to that
dominance right after that part of the
implementation of it was a program
announced by the Air Force Space Command
shifting policy from Clinton's
to a new policy clinton's policy was
control of space for military purposes
the new announced policy was ownership
of space for military purposes meaning
as they said inst the possibility of
instant engagement anywhere with highly
lethal offensive weapons which can
strike anywhere on earth without warning
the whole world is under surveillance by
sophisticated satellite and other
systems
sophisticated enough so they can tell if
a truck is crossing a street and
Damascus or any other place you pick so
the world is at risk of instant
destruction that's ownership of space
and that's a natural spelling out of the
national security strategy this also was
as far as I know not reported at all
certainly not much the lot of this is
called missile defense but as every one
knows on every side missile defense is
not a defensive system it's a
first-strike weapon that's understood by
US analysts understood by the Chinese
and other potential targets and we know
how the u.s. reacted when Russia
installed a very small missile defense
system around Moscow back in 1968 the US
has been Declassified immediately
reacted by sharply increasing its
offensive nuclear military force so as
to overwhelm it and to destroy all radar
positions and so on
is very little doubt that potential
targets will react to our so-called
missile defense system in the same way
it's apparently being deployed in early
stages right now there's a lot of debate
and discussion about the so-called
missile defense a lot of criticism on
grounds that it hasn't been tried and
probably won't work and so on so that
may be true or may not be true but it's
kind of missing the point
the system is far more dangerous if
there's some appearance that it might
work that's going that's what's going to
impel potential targets to do exactly
what the United States did in the case
of a much more primitive and significant
missile defense system in 1968 namely
expand their offensive military
capacities too overwhelming so the real
danger is that it might look as though
it's going to work well that brings us
to the second reason why Steinbrenner
and Gallagher hope that China will lead
a coalition to counter u.s.
aggressiveness the reason as they say is
that of all the nuclear States China has
been the most restrained in the
development and deployment of nuclear
weapons in fact it's done very little
however that's changing now China too is
reacting to Rumsfeld's transformation of
the military just as the Russians have
done they've recently announced sharp
increases in development and deployment
of offensive military weapons advanced
missiles nuclear weapons and so on
contributing to the action-reaction
cycle all of this is vastly more
dangerous than Iran's alleged programs
even if you assume that all the charges
are true and that's happening right here
in fact right here in New Mexico and not
being reported well these few examples
which are really a scattered sample that
should be enough to show that there's
quite a long way to go in fulfilling the
IRC mission of making the United States
a more responsible global partner and
should
enough to indicate that despair about
the state of American democracy is so
extreme among serious respected
panelists and mainstream circles that
they actually express the hope that
Outsiders led by China can somehow
rescue the world from the failed
political system in the United States
which has turned the United States into
an outlaw state in their words again the
dominant threat to everyone else well
the election of last November strongly
reinforced that feeling in much of the
world it also led to a good deal of
despair and sometimes hopelessness among
Americans at least those who are
concerned about the fate of their
country in the world and the concerns
are very real they include the
likelihood of terminal war terminal
nuclear war environmental catastrophe
the enhanced threat of terror plenty of
domestic concerns the very dedicated
effort to dismantle the achievements of
the past popular struggle in the past
century and now being systematically
dismantled in an exercise of fraud that
is truly awesome the con game about
social security is a pretty striking
stunning even example of sheer audacity
and contempt for the population and
faith in the enormous power of public
relations as an instrument of deceit run
through the details assume you know them
but it is pretty stunning
well that faith in public relations is
an instrument of deceit may well be
warranted after a few weeks of intense
propaganda fair a large part of the
population particularly particularly
young people have come to believe that
the Social Security system is in fact in
crisis which is too ridiculous to
discuss the war in Iran was in a
RAK was sold in the same way in
September 2002 and that is a month that
will go down in history if history
continues in that month there was a huge
propaganda campaign initiated by our
next Secretary of State who warned about
that the next thing we'll hear from
Saddam Hussein is a mushroom cloud over
New York within a couple of weeks of
government media propaganda the American
population was simply driven entirely
off the spectrum of world opinion
fearing Saddam's weapons of mass
destruction ties to al-qaeda probably
involvement in 9/11 and so on Saddam
Hussein was hated almost everywhere
certainly in the countries that he had
invaded Kuwait and Iran but he was
feared only in the United States not in
those countries and that incidentally
remains true some striking recent
statistics on that right now it turns
out that about 75% of the American
population think the United States
should not have gone to war if Iraq did
not have weapons of mass destruction and
ties to al-qaeda
well the belief nevertheless roughly 50
percent think the US should have gone to
war even after the government's own
reports the K and Dilfer report have
completely exploded those charges well
there's actually no contradiction there
people still believe it despite the
refutation roughly half the population
still believes that yes Iraq had weapons
of mass destruction or programs to
develop them and ties to al-qaeda
terrorism and it's not surprising that
they do if you read the report of
yesterday's committee hearings on the
rice nomination the Senate Majority
Leader Bill Frist gave a statement
justifying the war and he said outlaw
regimes must be confronted nuclear
weapons proliferation must be stopped
terrorist organizations must be
destroyed
therefore we were right to invade Iraq
didn't matter that we known beyond
dispute that they had no they weren't
involved in nuclear weapons
proliferation and that they had no ties
to terror though now they're at
terrorist Haven as for confronting
outlaw regimes few thoughts come to mind
but leave it there the faith in the
power of deceit is shared in the places
that matter in policymaking centers in
particular in the business world we all
know that corporations spend hundreds of
billions of dollars a year in
advertising which is not an effort to
inform but it's an effort to deceive as
we all know if you want to find out the
characteristics of say the cars that
Ford is going to produce next year or of
drugs or other commodities you don't
turn on the television set to see ads
the goal of the ads as hundreds of
billions of dollars is to project
imagery first of all to create
artificial wants and secondly to delude
you into satisfying those created wants
with one commodity rather than another
more or less identical one the
commitment to deceive is pursued with
real fanaticism that's demonstrated not
only by the scale literally hundreds of
billions a year but also in other ways
so recently though it wasn't recorded
here there were negotiations with
Australia to establish what's called a
free trade agreement that's with free
trade and certainly not an agreement but
that's what those things are called
it's a but and if the negotiations were
held up for some time because the United
States was objecting to Australia's
highly efficient healthcare system maybe
the most efficient in the world
the prices of drugs are a fraction
what they are in the United States same
very same drug produced by the same
corporation which makes a ton of money
in Australia but makes maybe ten times
that much for the same drug here
why was the u.s. objecting to the
Australian system well because the
Australian system is evidence-based it's
the phrase that was used that means if
pharmaceutical corporation wants to
advertise you know by showing sports
hero saying you know this drug is ask
your doctor if this drug is good for you
it's good for me or something like that
often not even telling you what it is
they're not allowed to do that they have
to provide evidence that the drug
actually does something that it's better
than some cheaper thing that's already
on the market and that evidence-based
approach the US negotiators argued is
interference with free markets because
corporations must have the right to
deceive that's crucial Australia sort of
backed off on that but the claim itself
is kind of amusing I mean even if you
believe the free-market rhetoric for a
moment the main purpose of advertising
is to undermine markets if you go to
graduate school and you take a course in
economics you're learned that you learn
that markets are systems in which
informed consumers make rational choices
that's what's so wonderful about but
that's the last thing that the state
corporate system wants it is spending
huge sums to prevent that which brings
us back to the viability of American
democracy for many years elections here
election campaigns have been run by the
public relations industry and each time
it's with increasing sophistication and
quite naturally the industry uses the
same technique to sell candidates that
it uses to sell toothpaste or lifestyle
drugs the point is to undermine markets
by projecting imagery to delude and
suppressing information
and similarly to undermine democracy by
same method projecting imagery through
the lewd and suppressing information the
candidates are trained carefully trained
to project a certain image elections
like to make fun of George Bush's
use of phrases like misunderestimate and
so on but my strong suspicion is that
he's trained to do that he's carefully
trained to efface the fact that he's a
spoiled frat boy from Yale and to look
like a texas roughneck kind of ordinary
guy just like you just waiting to get
back to the ranch that they created for
him to you know throw a cow over his
shoulder or where we're supposed to run
around but and the all of this is
careful training ordinary guy I mean
while Kerry is trained to be a goose
hunter and a motorcycle rider and so on
and so forth the other imagery seem to
work marginally better but the important
thing to do is to keep people from
knowing the stands and positions of the
candidates on any issue where the
parties and it sort of works take a look
at the last election the right before
the election people were asked voter
potential voters were asked on what what
what are the grounds for your votes
going to be about 10 percent said they
were voting on the basis of the
candidate of the candidate stands on
issues agendas policies and ideas six
percent for Bush voters 13 percent for
Kerry voters the rest are voting for
what are called qualities or values in
the PR industry which is of course all
meaningless there is a measure used by
political scientists called issue
awareness to what extent are voters
aware of the stand of the candidates
they're voting for any issues well that
hit an all-time low in the year 2000
lowest record
this election 2004 it was even worse he
can't measure it because the voters
tended to assume that the candidates
shared their opinions even when the
party platforms explicitly rejected them
the suppression of information was so
effective and the projection of image
imagery so overwhelming the candidate
5th of voters literally just took for
granted well I don't know what these
guys stand for but probably for whatever
I want that was extreme for Bush but it
was also true for Kerry unless you give
a very sympathetic interpretation to
vague statements now and then that most
voters never even heard the imagery for
Bush he was supposed to project an image
as a ordinary guy just like you also
strong leader going to protect you
against terror and so on in fact the
major component of the Bush vote was
people who are concerned about terror
actually the Bush administration had
acted consciously to increase the threat
of terror the invasion of Iraq is a
striking example of it I'm not because
they want terror but because it just
doesn't matter very much it's not a high
priority
just like the risk of nuclear
destruction that want it it's not a high
priority there are many other examples
of that some of them pretty striking so
a couple of the Treasury Department has
a bureau called Office of Foreign Assets
Control OFAC which monitors suspicious
financial transfers around the world
well it's obviously a core element of
the so-called war on terror every year
they report to Congress what their
activities are they reported last spring
that they have effect has employees who
are tracking the suspicious financial
transfers that might be related to
al-qaeda or Saddam Hussein for four
people on their staff are doing that
five times that many are investigating
suspicious transfers that might be an
effort to
undermine the US embargo against Cuba
which has been declared illegal every
relevant international forum but is
fought it's five times as important to
make sure that we can strangle Cuba than
it is to monitor transfers of al-qaeda
and Saddam Hussein well that didn't get
reported either but it again tells you
what the priorities are and there are
many more examples also Bush was
supposed to be stand up for your values
that's something that was projected what
are the values all those are pretty easy
to determine all you have to do is read
the business press the day after the
election it was describing euphoria in
boardrooms in New York and around the
country
why euphoria in boardrooms well
certainly not because CEOs are opposed
to gay marriage in fact their attitudes
are where called liberal but those are
the values that are the real ones we
also learn the values of the
administration by observing their fierce
dedication to transferring costs to the
next generation and serious costs
environmental costs fiscal costs even
the cost of ultimate doom it's time to
the carry voters the major the strongest
support for Kerry came from people who
are concerned about things like health
care well what was Kerry's health care
program actually very few people know
it's hard to find out certainly never
stated in any understandable way the New
York Times after the last debate two or
three days before the election
the New York Times commented on the
debate it was supposed to be out
domestic issues that Kerry didn't bring
up and he didn't make any hints about
possible government involvement in
health care programs because that
position has in their words no political
support well according to the most
recent polls about 80% of the
halation think that the government ought
to guarantee health care for everyone
and furthermore regarded as a moral
obligation tells you something about
people's values but there's no political
support why well because the
pharmaceutical industry is opposed the
financial institutions are opposed
surance industry opposed so there's no
political support doesn't matter if 80%
of the population regarded as a moral
obligation that doesn't count as
political support which again tells you
something about the elite conception of
democracy well the importance of
avoiding issues as was done very
successfully in the election the
importance of that was brought out very
clearly right before the election the us
at a very opinion in the United States
and attitudes is very carefully
monitored and controlled you know a lot
about it two of the most respected
institutions that monitor public
attitudes released major studies time
for the election they came out in
September right before it and the
results were extremely interesting and
surprising turns out that a large
majority of the population thinks the
United States ought to join the
International Criminal Court that oughta
subject itself to judgments of the World
Court
they'd oughta join the Kyoto treaty it
ought to that the UN not the United
States ought to take the lead in
international crises including use of
force in fact a majority of the
population even believe that the United
States ought to give up the veto at the
Security Council and follow the position
of the majority even if doesn't likely
that with regard to the use of force in
international affairs the population the
general population takes a gift it keeps
to what a rather conservative
interpretation of international law of
the UN Charter that the use of force is
legitimate if you're under attack of
course in self-defense or if there is an
imminent threat of attack
so there's nothing to do except resort
the force that's a very large percentage
of the population notice that both
political parties reject everything I
just said reject it so much that it's
not even discussed so the bipartisan
consensus and the media completely
reject the position of the large
majority of the population on all of
these issues and it continues like that
a large majority very large majority
thinks we should concentrate on domestic
spending about 80 percent for health
care similar figures for education other
domestic spending and those figures have
held for a long time I should mention
that these studies were barely reported
and the national press not even
mentioned so little reporting I could
actually list the newspapers where they
appeared the the only reasonable
conclusion from this is that media is
obviously of extreme importance right
before an election
it must be can't think of any other
explanation that media leaders
understand as well as political managers
that the public must be deluded
misinformed and marginalized the same is
true on Iraq so within a few months
after the invasion by that April 2003 a
large majority the population thought
that the UN ought to take over it ought
to take the take responsibility for
economic reconstruction and political
transition few months later same
majorities held that the UN oughta take
responsibility for security in Iraq
let's go back to Spain for a minute in
March 2003 Spain was very highly lauded
for leading the marvelous new Europe
because Eisenhower took his orders from
Crawford Texas with the support of 2% of
the population
in March 2004 an election came along and
osmar was voted out
and Spain was bitterly denounced for
appeasing terrorism what was the
position of the new government well the
position of the new government was that
Spain should not have troops in Iraq
unless they're under UN under UN
authorization which happens to be the
position of about 75 percent of
Americans at the same time but there's a
difference between Spain and the United
States in Spain people know what public
opinion is in the United States it takes
a individual research project to
determine what it is because it wasn't
reported furthermore in Spain they could
vote on it not in the United States
neither political party would touch such
an opinion and that's why Spain was
denounced because voters took the same
position as the large majority is the
American public that tells us something
- I couldn't find any comment on that
well it seems to be something
paradoxical about all of this the facts
of the matter of which the sample seemed
to conflict with the grand the
contemporary theme and namely that the
mission of the United States is what's
called democracy promotion in particular
we what the liberal press calls the
president's messianic vision to bring
democracy to Iraq that's a vision that
suddenly surfaced as the cause the
reason for the war after all the other
pretext for the invasion have
disappeared but people were polite
enough commentators polite enough not to
notice that and in fact it was near
unanimous for the president's messianic
vision critics said well maybe we it's
Noble and inspiring but maybe we can't
carry it off because of their cultural
failings and so on and so forth actually
there was one sector of opinion I should
say that didn't agree with this the only
one I could find namely Iraqis at about
the same time that the president
announced his messianic vision with
enormous on a claim
I couldn't find a word here questioning
that this was the reason for the
invasion after it was announced it right
at the same time this is last November
November a year ago the Washington Post
did report a poll taken in Baghdad where
people were asked what they thought the
reason for the u.s. invasion was and
some agreed with 100% of articulate
opinion here that it was to bring
democracy to Iraq 1% 5% thought the goal
was to help Iraqis the rest said the
unspeakable here that the goal was to
take control of Iraq's resources and
reorganize the region and the u.s.
interests a large majority Iraqis did
agree with American commentators in
seeing a cultural problem but they
didn't see it in Iraq they saw it here
it's a cultural problem here where
people are willing to believe the word
of their Dear Leader without any other
evidence and that is a problem they're
right about that actually Iraqi opinions
were somewhat more nuanced the same poll
showed that about
although 1% thought that the goal of the
invasion was to bring democracy about
half said the United States want
democracy in Iraq but the US will make
sure that it will influence and
determine its course and that's correct
that's what democracy means democracy
means you can have elections you can do
anything you like but you better do what
we say
Iraqis apparently understand that and we
choose not to wear shoes has to be
emphasized because there's plenty of
evidence well let's go back to democracy
promotion the great contemporary theme
that's led to a huge literature there's
a whole cadre of scholarly experts now
on democracy promotion the most renowned
of them is Thomas Carruthers he's the
director of the democracy and rule of
law project at the Carnegie Institution
many books and articles he's highly
supportive of this leading theme
of u.s. foreign policy since Reagan he
just published a new book in which he
reviews the achievements of the last 25
years of democracy promotion since
Reagan and the intelligent man he finds
what he calls a strong line of
continuity in all administration's
namely they're all schizophrenic they
all have split personalities in his word
so it's a very strange phenomenon I'll
give you his description of it we're
supporting democracy was consistent with
US economic and security interests the
u.s. stands up for democracy where
democracy clashes with economic and
security interests democracy is
downplayed and ignored and the u.s.
supports dictators and torturers so
democracy is fine but as long as you
follow orders same principle as always
actually the interesting bit late so
don't give more examples but I can't I
can't the bear not recording the way
this is described in the business press
the last few days with regard to Iraq
the Wall Street Journal yesterday has an
article by their Iraqi specialist which
says the following in Baghdad the men
likely to lead Iraq next government
promised to demand withdrawal as soon as
they take power after Sunday's election
then says problem in the United States
here's the way we respond a President
Bush and his aides refused to be pinned
down to such a plan here comes
Condoleezza Rice I'm really reluctant to
try to put a timetable on that because I
think the goal is to get the mission
accomplished the mission is to establish
democracy by rejecting the demand of the
elected leaders
and then it goes on to explain that they
hope they'll be able to pressure them
pressure the democratically elected
government to accept a compromise in
which they will accept vague promises to
withdraw rather than a firm timeline
well Tony Blair chimed in today in the
London Financial Times with a long
interview also full of the great mission
of bringing democracy and he says there
is no way that the United States and the
UK will set a timetable for the
withdrawal of their troops from Iraq a
deadline is not being contemplated
because we must stay the course to bring
them democracy somehow it is all done
with a straight face don't ask me how
but it's pretty impressive
well final comment the last election did
lead to a lot of hopelessness here but
it's important to bear in mind that the
election told us essentially nothing
about the country just as we would have
learned nothing about the country if
there had been a slight shift in voting
patterns and if the democratic imagery
had been a little more effective and it
had given Kerry thirty one percent of
the electorate instead of giving Bush
thirty one percent we would still have
learned nothing the reason is that there
was no election in any sense of the term
that is worth taking seriously the
political system including elections is
carefully managed to prevent the threat
of democracy the actual views and that's
very clear from the suppressed
information that came out about people's
actual views if you take a look at those
actual views the actual views of the
public or of course excluded from the
system they provide a pretty respectable
agenda for carrying forward the task of
making the United States a more
responsible global partner what's needed
is to create and
or to recreate a functioning democratic
society in which an informed public can
participate in formation and
implementation of policy domestic and
international and the political sphere
and the economic sphere as well well
that's hardly a very utopian ideal and
it's not an unmanageable task if we fail
to undertake it successfully we don't
have anyone to blame but ourselves for
what will ensue which may turn out to be
very grim
