Jewish American scholar Noam Chomsky has
been stopped from entering Israel he was
due to deliver lectures in Ramallah in
the West Bank but was refused entry at
the borden border with Jordan he joins
me now from the Jordanian capital Amman
good to see you professor Chomsky I
imagine you're very angry about this can
you tell us what happened I'm not very
angry about it I was disappointed and
surprised i entered with my daughter and
two friends old friends academics who we
met and i'm on the day before after
several hours of waiting and multiple
interrogations are two friends were
permitted entry and my daughter and I
were informed that we were denied entry
after much discussion in directly with
the Ministry of Interior the the
interior ministry is actually saying it
was a misunderstanding by immigration
officials and they're trying to clear
things up were you ever given an
official explanation I can't see
anything to misunderstand i was invited
by the university by the philosophy
department to give several lectures on
topics that I work on American foreign
and domestic policy perfectly
straightforward I do it all the time
many countries and the facts were
completely clear to everyone so there's
no basis for any misunderstanding do you
it was a decision on the part of the
Ministry of Interior it's I was going to
ask you why do you think you were
refused entry is it because you are
quite an outspoken critic of Israeli
policies I can only say what was
conveyed to me in the discussions with
the official who was carrying out the
interrogation he was receiving
instructions from the Ministry of
Interior and relay
there were two basic points one was that
the government of Israel does not like
the kinds of things I say which puts
them into the category of I suppose
every other government in the world the
second was that they seemed upset about
the fact that I was just going to I was
taking an invitation from beers 8 and I
had no plans to go on to speak in
Israeli universities as I have done many
times in the past but not this time I
was taking a beer say at the invitation
sorry to hear of your experiences thanks
very much indeed for speaking with us
