just Netanyahu it's plain that Netanyahu
constantly but it is the national mood
develop it folds national mood is
shifting very far to the international
spread its paranoid it's hysterical it's
irrational and part of it is that we've
got a crush any person we have to crush
any attempt to would question the
legitimacy and magnificence of what we
did this change in the country in
question years is dramatic and very
frightening they're really kind of
circling wagons kind of reminiscent of
what's out there it's natalia he's
riding on that way but he's not creating
yeah pretty much after every act of
israeli aggression and pretty much any
human disaster coming news you hear go
throw out the term international
community's calling for independent
investigation I just wondering who these
investigators are they have a 20 / / I
just wondered it be when the
international community as for an
independent investigation who are these
investigators and do they have any
legitimacy at all
what's going on filmer report but couple
of days ago there was an important
meeting like the real what we call the
international community means the United
States and anybody let's agree that's
the International like maybe the whole
world disagrees with them they're
against the international community so
take the idea that the international
community is going on your end to stop
enriching uranium great that every
exactly who is the international
community well it's not the non-aligned
countries which are most of the world
today vigorously support Iran's right to
enrich uranium signers and
non-proliferation treaty that's the
they're not part of the International
couple years of a tunnel it is right now
a couple of years ago majority of
americans approve the breed with silva
majority of americans went parted
the international community is
Washington and whoever happens we went
along it was pretty striking what
happened the last couple weeks about
this as you know I'm sure Turkey and
Brazil made a deal with Iran which would
have pretty similar with us suppose they
would arrange for any rain be enriched
outside of the tournament
purposes when the u.s. link person
actually turns out that Obama had
written a letter to Lulu president of
Brazil advocating that probably because
he believed they definitely random ever
breathe than any vehicle
nobody Ryan did agree what's under this
country so he was instantly reacted by
ramming through a UN Security Council
resolution which is so weak that China
agreeing to be instantly Russia agreed
to it if you read the terms of the
resolution which is past its appraised
here is great resolution if you look at
a small print it does actually
constantly about it's only effect is to
transfer to China even greater control
over the resources i ran by putting some
constraints on the west and developing
ranch resources that are quite happy
with russia's happy with it because it
permits them to sell your arms that not
do around is wrong and so forth but the
US had to ram it through to make the
world know who's lost not Brazil and
Turkey and turkeys the most important
regional power
they're not like the people was Brazil
was the most important country in most
respected country in the south so they
can't be lost in fact that you read the
New York Times you know the headline
saying spot on Google's latest years
interest rates legacy by standing up
against the United States today is three
quick but quote some leaders of fish oil
is saying we gotta do something to make
sure that turkey stays and wine
showing it let's I like the Maffei and
you never make sure that nobody
interferes with your right to control
ladies so we'll ran through a almost
meaningless UN resolution to block the
Turkish resilient initiative which could
have made some progress strike your
question by now what was the question
I'll get it who are these an independent
investigator the independent
investigation well there is a relevant
part of the international community was
actually there is an Asian security
system ca I ca what it stands for them
then they had a meeting it includes
mostly Asian states both states which
includes ranking police's room they had
a security being
and they meeting decided to call from
strongly to call for international
investigation well the rules of the
organization require consensus persons
are integrated workers like 22 lawyers
there for them as a separate declaration
from the nadir by calling for
international investigation well you
know nothing happens unless the Dustin
Sokka Greeks the when Obama immediately
blocked the Security Council preventive
security council resolution calling for
investigation the asian security
organization was just blocked out of
comedian
so there's almost you have the
independent investigation but everything
else that the u.s. does never hit them
happen so back to the usual condition
the boss besides international relations
theories does amount to much in my
opinion and sm your state of the field
frankly i announce too much there are
some principles that international
relations and probably went with
important principles is that
international affairs works like the
matthew very similar method I mean the
Godfather does not accept his obedience
it's too dangerous a small slurpee
person where doesn't pay protection
money camp and get away with maybe
donate the money but if he does away
with it somebody else
personal assistant control you wrote so
you don't just send in your goons to get
the night you send them to beat him to a
pulp so he gets the idea that's how
international fairs works sometimes
spoken domino theory or something but
you look at a zephyr case constantly
work so well in this case the US has
gotta be bought the principle that
controlling release the oil gives a
substantial control the school to back
and nobody else is allowed the morning
not turkey and most important regional
countries not presume South actually
look at the Security Council vote the
three countries who have anything to do
with the Middle East either put it
against our abstain Turkey and Lebanon
government up staying can't stand up
against the United States Brazil against
its most important voices in turkey it's
because of 300
trim constraints and savory it's been
our production reports so there won't be
an international investigation person
say so
Turkey's in NATO doesn't mean anything
the turkey is a negro
Israel
there isn't hated reading and there's a
little debate about technically how the
ship was flat worried about them but if
it was a Turkish flag ship as playing
then there is a native credence that
means it's Turkish character under
maritime law the ship in international
waters is part of the territory of the
hunted flights and the NATO treaty which
requires the native powers to the
assistance of any native country under
attack so yes native should have
extremes meant anything to pursue down
in 80 countries led by the United States
should only once for the turkey shoot
Iranian ship detected NATO vessel
face new earth
you just mentioned about this boss who
says what can happen in what God's sorry
about basically you're saying about the
boss in in the world and then he decides
of the United States and says what can
happen in one count and so basically
that the model of nation states and then
sometimes the other other times you just
speak about economic classes and saying
that if you looking by nation working at
nation-states actually isn't being in
real world you have to look at economic
glasses instead how does that work
that's an interesting question and Iran
is very striking case in Ventura there
are a couple principles of international
affairs all of them missing from
international relations theory one
principle is my favorite that's a
dominant principle of international
affairs another one is a principle that
traces back to Adam Smith
worship Adam Smith whereas the green
admits to mushroom dangers is nowhere
near the craze constructed and
so he pointed out he was talking about
aimless he said that in England the
principal podium the principal
architects of the policy are the
merchants and manufacturers improve a
silly only economy so they're the
principal architects of government
policy and they make sure that their own
interests are most peculiarly attended
to preserve very well no matter how
breathe is the effect on the people of
England and
the others who were subject to what he
called the savage and justice and the
Europeans he was talking about British
atrocities and indeed but the merchants
of the guys upon the country are they
make the policy that's Adam Smith that's
another principle international affairs
well you know sometimes the principles
of international affairs conflict and
those are interesting cases for the
study of false information and actually
Iran is an interesting case and Iran
today the guys won the country another
major economic forces but they would be
pretty happy to have the United States
normalize relations with Iran for
example US energy corporations are not
delighted that china is picking up all
the goodies in Iran but state policy
requires that we give the resources of
Iran to China and over the objection of
us energy corporations which usually
have a crucial impact
policymaking especially the Middle East
let's conflict between two doctrines the
Mafia doctrine and Adam Smith's doctor
and in this case the Matthew dr. mins
and it's striking if you look over the
history that there are such cases never
interesting ones and they find that the
very same individuals will make
different decisions depending on whether
they're running a corporation or running
the government so the same individual
could the same people who are making the
decisions in the case of your brand
let's let's give it to China if they
were still running their energy
corporations or Halliburton or whatever
it make the opposite decision but they
now are in an institutional world at
state policy which is different from the
role of the CEO incorporation see a
corporation has an institutional role
they ought to maximize profit they got
it it's a legal requirement at them
so that's an institutional the role in
the same individual say that a mistake
department of the pentagram is to
consider the long-term consequences of
policy choices and policy choices that
are made they that's because that
sometimes conflicts in the parochial
interests of a particular sector in the
economy so what you get is a conflict
and in this case the Mafia principal
wins the same individuals who might be
running oil companies are deciding that
for the long-term goals of controlling
the release the making of eels make sure
who else horns in it's necessary to take
positions which in fact harmed the
energy corporations it's not the only
case but policy towards Cuba business
thing so in the case of Google is quite
interesting study for the real
international relations theory these are
things that people could say but in case
of cute little court for 15 years or
since Cuban independence the US has been
attacking punishing the people too and
we know exactly why the documents are
all out and to punish the people
Kennedy Eisenhower have to punish the
people to vote because Cuba isn't
following orders they are carrying out
what the Kennedy and Johnson
administration's will successful
defiance of US policies going back to
the menorah Duncan the Russians monitor
doctor said we run the hemisphere Cuba's
Cariad successful defiance or back to
the Matthew principle can't put a small
store people who do live so we got a
crush punish the people to deliver
through the governor meanwhile the
american population is quote like four
decades that are you Jerry the
population was done in favor
the normalizing relations and the world
is totally is take a look at you in 72
votes every year for old versus the
United States Marshall Islands that's
not unusual striking in this case is the
major sectors of American businesses
closed that includes the energy
corporations that includes
pharmaceuticals without her business
they all want to normalize relations
those are fun to Adam Smith principal
you expect them to determine policy but
it's overridden by the managers in that
case too and that's a small story people
don't like you right that's the
International favors work if you really
want to study seriously those are the
cases you should look at just if you
want to understand us cold war policies
59 but those are exactly the topics that
are off the agenda you don't study
graduate school
Beauty very edges too revealing so
therefore but it ranks very interesting
case in respect
and cook you infidel even through West
comment it's not the first time isn't
around so for example in 1953 when the
US and Britain overthrew the
parliamentary regime stole the show the
US wanted ghost government wanted
American oil companies to take forty
percent of the British concession that
was part of a long-term policy of kind
of edging the British Middle East from
taking over returning them to the junior
department the oil companies didn't want
to do it for short-term reasons turned
out it was kind of oil but at the time
and if they took over the Iranian
concession they would have to reduce
liftings in Saudi Arabia which is much
more important for the oils much cheaper
oil and so on they didn't harm relation
their short-term parochial interests led
them to prefer not taking the bridge
concession but they were compelled by
the federal government US government to
take it they were threatened with
antitrust penalties and so on so they
followed orders it's another striking
case where they not be a principal
long-term concerns that control of oil /
/ rode the specific parochial interests
of the major architects ecology that are
interesting cases and put you reflect on
Britain's rollers and mafia sister and
other any conflicting interests with us
he lights and secondly it shortly and
could written MV you do anything to
resolve or to encourage a solution of
the israel-palestine conflict that would
act more independent frontier
interesting page written percent in the
maze of global power
a thicker than the United States
economically during the Second World
going on between the United States over
control over the next 20 min lee saudi
arabia is understood by late thirties
that's the real prize crown and Britain
might keep in the United States want to
take away so it was a battle plan the
documents on end of christina is one
written was in dire straits at the time
as much so the US took over Saudi Arabia
at the end of the Second World War the
British understood their role as the
International hegemon was essentially
over and the Foreign Office recognized
they would have to be what they call
junior partners of the United States
they had no illusions about the US was
they said the u.s. is taking over the
world under and pretext of benevolence
and so on and so forth but there just
after power and we had not we have no
choice except to be a junior partner and
we could become independent and join
Europe were to be a junior partner and
so it continues that Britain has chosen
the world to your part that's what did
you join the eurozone still thinks of
itself as independent actor in the world
affairs persist on the narrow streets
and full of content and the British just
taken on their health and kicked in the
face us is flexible
I should not a striking case it's the
1962 missile crisis during the Missile
Crisis us leaders Kennedy guys were
making decisions bishop they understood
could lead the destruction of Europe and
destruction of England they were pushing
things that point where there might be a
Russian retaliation the Russians could
destroy England they could attack the
United States and they're making
decisions with those high probability
consequences they weren't telling the
British would in fact the filament prime
minister didn't know anything was going
on it's not desperate to find out but
the only thing he knew was what British
intelligence would develop and write
that point Kennedy administration when
the senior advisers probably team had
risen to find what he called special
relationship between two US and Britain
he said the special relationship means
that Britain is our lieutenant the
fashionable word is partnered look a
British like to hear the fashion forward
but the truth is there are repentant I
thought that's roughly the difference
mission Obama Bush just told him
straight out you're a lieutenant and
then like
kind of nice rhetoric features yes your
apartment you get back home 10 taking
the face and your
that's actually I think that
accurate Europe s choices as choices
have been a serious concern for us
policy since 1950 I mean the u.s.
understood us x understood and first
with profound didn't say the early
post-war period the Europe was going to
become there would be Industrial
Recovery and once they do they're a
power on the scale of the United States
big economies like US population
educated population a lot of advantages
they could become an independent force
in world affairs they could become
what's called a third force it's a big
danger you can't go in the world that
there's a big independent force and a
lot of efforts were made to prevent that
one ones go later part of the gold made
of
to ensure that Europe would remain a
vassal us control and again what
happened in nineteen ninety is striking
in this respect I mean if anybody
believed the propaganda of the preceding
50 years then as soon as the u.s. Soviet
Union collapsed did expect it would be
disbanded I'm in the propaganda about
NATO as well as there and protect us
from the Russian words ok no more
Russian words so let's has been native
as that what happened they've extended
quite an interesting way Gorbachev
minute it's incredible concessional he
agreed to let a united Germany unified
Germany join native possible military
alliance anything about if it's
astonishing I'm Germany alone had
virtually destroyed Russia at what times
in the past century and now Gorbachev
was agreeing to let
join a hostile military alliance
superpower why did he do it because
there was a quid pro quo he did it with
an agreement with the Bush
administration that NATO would not
expand the phrase was would not expand
one inch to the east it would not
include East Germany and obviously
nothing beyond where Gorbachev was naive
that was a gentleman's agreement the
Bush administration was careful never to
put it in paper we have a detailed
record of this right now detailed
scholarly record it's quite interesting
Gorbachev made the stupid error of
thinking he did make a gentleman's
agreement with the United States that's
pretty steep something I said the
slightest intention living up to half
course didn't so immediately NATO expect
at least included East Germany
where's Russia the nominators expanding
to further its official role now is to
official rule is to control the global
energy system to control the ceilings
and the pipelines and it was just a
conference in Washington couple weeks
ago led by former severity of oberon
which outlined a global mission for NATO
or the ideas error should become the
us-run global intervention force
mother's conflict for this unhappy about
studying the money and so on us is
attacking for
22 not by factors of interesting article
kinds of weeks ago by Richard prods head
of the Council on Foreign Relations
high-level policy officially it was the
title was goodbye Europe we don't need
you anymore you took a non-violent
you're not really too were nuff money
into serving as air quote intervention
for so goodbye your needs but it's a
sign of tensions and what happened with
NATO is quite instructive I'm addict
illustration of the fact that all the
propaganda but the
just complete lies some 80 doesn't
disappear when the Russian words
disappear and expand and it expands in
order to make sure that Europe doesn't
carry out that dangerous option that
you're referring to it becomes an
independent
we should good and made us less
constrained some military force revenue
is your has choices and ethics
a couple years ago I sent is often how
would an email about the idea of climate
world militarization climate warm
climate would climb a wall and the broad
the broad idea was it's been called has
often been a call by links like Al Gore
and other people are Prince Charles
result immobilize the kind of national
mobilization define quite climate change
he very interesting things and is a very
striking case of the lethal effects of
markets it's a dramatic illustration
beneath authentic market I mean markets
have certain properties we don't really
have a market society it's not ascending
market societies sort of her projector
another supreme feet of the state that
come along and save it isn't it perfect
so it's a state capitalist
but it's partially has market principles
and those are the principles country
especially this CEO of an energy
corporation but for that matter suppose
you're in a chamber of commerce good
business love or you have certain
interests as part of your institutional
role in a market system you have to
maximize short-term profit you just have
to do that and having choices if you
decide not to do it you're out and
someone else is in the best do so it's
not a choice that means you have to
ignore what accounts for externalities
the effect of the transaction on those
ignored it if you pay attention to it
you're out if it's also illegal we're
also out and presumably also do it well
that has consequences one consequence in
severe ways the repeated financial
crisis they thought almost automatically
from the necessity to
memories the externalities in the case
of the financial system are called
systemic risk selective Goldman Sachs
makes a transaction assuming you're well
managed they have to take into account
their own welfare will happen to us if
the phone goes dead but they don't take
into account and cannot take into
account the risk that whole system
collects okay that's virtual guarantee
of financial crisis that's why they keep
repeating
I'm pushing worth that's not a big
secret the first you have to get more
externalities okay in the case of
systemic risk okay it's not an
overwhelming problem because the
powerful statement said been arrested
but let's take climate change of the
CEOs of corporations of the guys on the
Chamber of Commerce and so on they have
to follow the policy ignoring
externalities well the externality in
this case happens new phailin species
nobody's going to step in and bail you
out now the guys were making those
decisions but there's an agreement you
know they're they're running huge
propaganda campaigns to try to convince
Americans that so Little Ponies and
they're trying to beat back in a
legislation when I do anything about
copenhagen zoo the same people have no
exactly and it's practice English you to
climate change they know that it's a
serious risk that it's going to destroy
everything they destroy the lives of the
gradual very furniture as human beings
they know that but when they move back
to the office of the CEO office have to
get them there they have to keep to the
market principal tomorrow
gaster a latissimus Joseph its vicious
and that's what we're facing that's why
there isn't any legislation there is
many campaign and there won't be as long
as we permit to this element of market
systems to function do you think it's
safe to allow finance is to try and
internalize climate change and develop
carbon markets for instance is that a
greater risk if you can figure out a way
for the corporations to make money out
of dealing with climate change will
gather maybe something will happen but
anything you work out it's just still
ignoring the externalities so you know
dem instant origins of the temple
brother
ocean scene in which he said cap and
trade is a Harley proposal was the only
thing ever
as you can see that one
we're playing the big stakes it's much
worse than financial crisis literally
they're serious institutional reasons
they're not bad people bring a banker
just people fulfilling the necessary
that's very hard to do
the American reaction actually show
movie the american' reaction in Canada
were to actually shut down the process
if Canada were shut down the top sex
would shut down the tar sands oh the
torsion my list announced is one of the
bitch comprehend it wouldn't have to go
that for because the countries are
sufficiently degraded so I'm actually as
you probably know the United States has
tried to comprehend it ever since 70
1775 he tried to confer Canada was
beaten back by superior British course
that's the only reason why Canada wish
to turn and finally the US kind of
executive order but since then through
other measures the candidate has become
more emotion
the United States and the business
community antennas favor them quite
happy to be somewhere in the US and
since they pretty much running murmurs
Canada did threat big one point during
the bush years it did make a threat to
shift its oil exports to China what
happened was there was a case in the
under naf cause it was a case broke
quite candid against the united states
and canada won the United States don't
dissenters and can it was kind of the
word I said well okay you do that would
start sending oil to China United States
lab I was indexed
following up on the question about the
climate change being an externality and
the compulsion is in the fate of the
species that it's an extra okay okay
yeah pay the consequence of climate
change and I'm wondering is there
another market feature apart from the
hood need to maximize profits it's also
depending on the environment but that is
the our money system the fractional
reserve banking system that does that
require gross that aspect of you found
you require growth in order to maintain
the system and avoid collapse there's a
lot of kind of you know internet gossip
about the fractional reserve system and
somehow
I mean we can't eliminate the money
system nobody must collect the border
and the fractional reserve system just
means you'll and money
which is the only way to keep the
economy function I make sure whether
it's an individual household no no smell
so it's letting us get and they should
government's running up dead businesses
are running on definitely said he'd be
constrained if you couldn't say borrow
money to
house or something life would be very
constrained so I don't think that's the
problem there's a lot of talk about it
it's to be getting more and more
difficult to have any kind of resistance
against Palestine or against Israel and
just as far as like when you as
activists go over there they're killed
like rachel corrie and the other day us
activists was blinded on one of the
ships so what kind of role can in us in
the u.s. played what kind of resistance
do you think is effective towards the
situation which ascribes accurate but I
think that that's in frustration to the
opposite but it's easier to carry out
resistance so there any workers weren't
going from being killed a couple years
but is there warning it was no so very
okay now there's a solidarity movement
so yeah
or in cases but that's an illustration
in fact it's easier no personal
experience others who could activist for
a long time with me when you go back to
couple of years and that literally had
had police protection if I was giving a
talk at MIT I remember faces how many
years ago where the Cambridge police
insisted on accompanying my wife and me
back for a month talking about to your
car because they picked up they
infiltrate all the organizations
death threats huge audience can't get
awesome question blue moon mistress
change the change in mood has not
reached educated sectors it's not reach
the media it's not reached political
class but the options for action of far
greater there is an international
solidarity courageous people
participating in it and one of the
consequences you have to get deep racial
pores so it's real but i think it's an
illustration in fact the options for
free like you think protests are the
best way to go like us organizing
protests here greatest is not very much
easier than used to be a ninja other
actions to go there are other actions
being taken be on purpose like for
example but a boycott of products from
the occupied territories
actually it's more than assume a no
hemisphere national dream Gaza day and
this international came out for the
report calling on the United States to
terminate all arms shipments Israel
because they were illegal under
international law and there it in
animals that a pic of added it's illegal
under US soil under US law you cannot
provide arms to the country except for
defensive purposes well as I mentioned
these competence
parentheses so therefore to us arms
disorder in fact illegal under American
law also international solidarity
movements can pick that up maybe say
okay it's 440 engine garden that's
what's up a American look in reach in
regulation with a call for obeying
American boat
pretty serious regime it would also be
serious for American business but
Lockheed Martin the rest of them one of
the reasons they love Israel is because
whatever the United States provides
three million dollars a period to Israel
it goes into their pockets you know they
say that means they sell Israel advanced
weaponry
