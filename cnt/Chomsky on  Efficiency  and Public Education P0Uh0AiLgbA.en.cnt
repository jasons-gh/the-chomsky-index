introduced or what's called efficiency
efficiency is it's called an economic
notion but that's highly misleading it's
an ideological emotion so for example if
say a business sheds employees like say
an airline and you want to get a ticket
for something or other when you talk to
a person it's a it works but it's
inefficient because they have to pay
more if you call up and you get a menu
and you sit there for half an hour and
while the voice says I think you know we
love your business hang on and finally
you get something that isn't what you
wanted so you have to try something else
you've all had this kind of experience
all over the place economists don't call
that a cost because it's transferred to
people and things that are transferred
to people aren't costs but it's a
efficient for the for the business and
that corporate culture goes to the
universities and reaches what Sam was
talking about you cut back increase the
number administrators that cut back
class size uses a cheap temporary easily
exploitable labor what's called graduate
students to teach courses and you know
all of these things have a cost but the
cost is transferred to students to
faculty to just people and it saves it
sufficient from the point of view of the
funders the people who Justice Powell is
talking about the businessmen who
essentially fund the university we've
now reached a stage where public
education is practically disappearing
more than half the state that by now
already majority of the in the state
colleges and universities most of the
funding is coming from tuition books
tuition is
sky high community colleges are still
funded but it's predicted that they'll
disappear too and that the whole concept
of publicly funding universities will
disappear the universities will be for
the rich and for the rest it will be
vocational education so maybe get a job
and you know that will impose passivity
discipline and obedience well these are
principles that go very far
