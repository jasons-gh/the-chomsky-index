thank you all for coming together for
this now we are gracious to have an
excellent panel with or with us here
tonight and I'm going to turn over the
microphone right now to back to Tom
Arabia from the ISO to move on with the
program as I'm sure that we're eager to
hear what they have to say and not waste
any more time with this thank you so
much
and of course professor Noam Chomsky
so I can go on with the introduction of
Noam Chomsky them I in fact I'll just
let him take it from here thank you know
there are quite a range of topics to
talk about a lot of complex issues I
have a few minutes I don't want to speak
too long and i'll just pick two topics
and try to focus on them a couple of
words about something else the two
topics are I'm not going to talk about
the atrocities that took place in the
last few weeks I'm sure you're quite
familiar with that one question has to
do with the legitimacy of the US Israeli
invasion and we should bear in mind
crucially that it's a us-israeli
invasion your critically involved at
every level so one has to do with its
legitimacy the second question has that
I want to talk about has to do with the
reasons for it now the two are
intertwined so what I say won't be
entirely separate segregated but i'll
try to do it systematically as far as
the legitimacy is concerned it's almost
universally assumed in commentary that
us that the invasion is legitimate it's
criticized as being a disproportionate
but it's legitimate because obviously
estate has the result to defend itself
against attacks from the outside well
that this certain level of truth to that
argument yes the state has a right to
defend itself from attack but this
argument moves very quickly to another
position namely that a state has the
right to defend itself by force
from a tax from the outside and nobody
believes that if that's supposed to be
the principal it's I think universally
rejected so no one agrees that say Nazi
Germany had a right to defend itself
against by force against the terror of
the partisans in occupied Europe nobody
i suspect very few people here around us
would believe that the British had the
right to defend themselves by force
against George Washington's army and the
reasons are obvious in both cases they
had no reason to be there in the first
place so therefore I have no right of
Defense by force and there was it was an
easy way to defend themselves put a stop
to the atrocities and the invasion and
the aggression and when that option is
available you just don't have the right
to defend yourself by force or picks a
useful analog take the British in
Northern Ireland I mean I are a terror
was certainly criminal and the British
had a right to defend themselves from it
how not by violence not by terrorizing
the Irish Catholic community but by
addressing the grievances that led to
the violence and when they finally began
to do so the terror stop and you can
think of case after case like that so
the universal agreement that Israel had
a right to defend itself by force is not
only wrong but is transparently wrong
wrong on the basis of principles that
virtually everyone accepts well there's
plainly a if that reasoning is correct
there's plenty in a crucial educational
problem to face bring people to
understand that by their own principles
their conclusions are absolutely
legitimate and the reasoning is not
profound nothing beep about it it's all
on the surface well this turn two
reasons what were the reasons for the
attack there's an official reason it was
given for example by a hood Barack
that's minister who said Israel's had
lost patience with the rocket attacks
and therefore had to invade that of
course and that's accepted almost
universally then their debates about
proportionality but that has the same
fallacy you have to show that a reaction
by force to rocket it you have a right
to defend yourself from rocket attacks
surely but it takes another step in the
argument to show that you have the right
to defend yourself by force against
rocket attacks as in the examples I
mentioned the numerous others and to
show that you have to show that there
were no peaceful alternatives to doing
so well but then happily true there are
plenty of peaceful alternatives all come
to the middle minute other there has
been further debate about the discussion
about the reasons one commonly proposed
argument which i think is accurate is
that Israel had to overcome the what
they call the lessons of the failed 11
war in 2006 when Israel lost what's
called credibility it's deterrent
capability to put that in simple English
it had lost the ability to intimidate
its adversaries into submission by the
threat of extreme violence and they had
to recover that capability it was
probably a factor as for the timing
probably had to do mostly with Israeli
elections in fact it's coming up in a
couple of weeks one Israeli commentator
calculated at the very beginning of the
war that for every 40 Palestinians kill
Barack gained one parliamentary seat I'm
not sure his arithmetic was exactly
right but the principle is to compare
the poles and the casualties comes out
more or less like that but none of that
gets to the reasons i think the reasons
are different and much deeper the
reasons have two are pretty much
explicit they were explained by a hood
on one homer the prime minister but
right here in the united states and made
2006 he gave a speech to a joint session
of congress rousing ovation when he
explained two points one of the
principal and other implementation of it
the principal he said is that the
historic right of the Jewish people to
the Land of Israel the camp is beyond
challenge rousing ovation as a corollary
to that the the original population
doesn't have a right there and in fact
the US and Israel just took that
position formerly at the United Nations
once again at less last month was in
December their series of un resolutions
that were passed mostly about the same
vote something like you know 172 three
or something like that this one past 173
25 it was on the right of Palestinians
to self-determination the five against
were United States Israel couple of
Pacific Islands that's the usual usual
vote in the United Nations and as usual
it doesn't get reported so for example
also unreported was the fact
there was a resolution on the right to
food huge problem billion people facing
starvation far worse than the financial
crisis but of course that you know deals
with what one British diplomatic
historian called the unpeopled the ones
who are different from us so not discuss
much the vote on that was unanimous with
one vote against namely the United State
there was a vote on arms traffic the
United States is by far the biggest arms
traffic this was to regulate the arms
traffic in 2006 the united states voted
against that alone this time it had
company zimbabwe so there's two of us
vote against none of this obviously can
get reported but the one on the
palestinians is interesting no right of
self-determination and that's a
corollary to the conclusion that the
historical rights of Israel to the
landed to the Jewish people to the Land
of Israel are beyond question to go
together actually if you look at the
colloquy at the united nations that are
various excuse but rather pathetic
excuses as to why the US had to vote
that way but you can go into that so
that's one that's a principle then comes
the question of implementation and omair
also at the same time made 2006
explained the implementation it's the
program that he called convergence
Israel does not want to take over that
there were sections and still are
sections in Israel that want to take
over the entire West Bank but the more
rational people understand that that's a
problem it leads to what's called the
demographic problem there will be too
many Palestinians and it
in the state and the if it's at all
democratic it won't be a Jewish state so
you have the problem of how to keep the
Jewish state while taking over what you
want in the West Bank and on the side
it's not in question that all of the
actions in the West Bank are illegal in
violation of the foundations of
international humanitarian law the
Geneva Conventions in fact the Israeli
government was informed of that in 1967
by its own top legal representatives
including Justice Minister so that it's
been ratified by the International Court
of Justice the World Court and a
unanimous decision including including
the US Justice so there's no real debate
about that everything that's going on
there is criminal and the US as a has
what's called is a high contracting
party to the Geneva Conventions has the
legal responsibility of acting to
prevent it not doing so is also criminal
and directly abetting it by economic
military ideological the means is
multiply permanent so the criminality of
all these actions in Washington and Tel
Aviv is not in question but it's
accepted universally that some of us
that's okay the in other words the
United States is regards itself as an
outlaw state its commentators
intellectuals media and accept that and
that right of being an outlaw state is
inherited by its clients so the issue of
criminality and off the agenda how do
you go about taking what you want in the
occupied territories without running
into the Denver
problem well there's a way traces way
back to nineteen sixty-seven it's taken
various forms since all merits version
was that Israel should an annex
everything within what's called the
separation wall annexation wall actually
it should proceed as it's been doing to
take over the Jordan Valley that's about
a third of the West Bank it will that
imprisons what what's inside versus
really has a total control the air and
so on but what's inside the in prison
part has to be broken up into Canton's
you take a look at the settlement map
there are two cents Act III said it's
that cut through the West Bank from the
part that israel annexed within the
separation wall up to the Jordan Valley
one goes east of Jerusalem what's called
Jerusalem is illegally annexed but
illegally annexed by in violation of
security council resolutions that go
back forty years but the US accepts it
so it's okay by now it's greater
Jerusalem much expanded to the east of
it there's a town of domain which was
developed mostly in the Clinton years
with the purpose of bisecting the West
Bank and
the North there to weather said ends one
go to the town of REO the other thing
the main that breaks up what's left and
then there's what a complex network of
checkpoints and barriers and so on which
have no security function except in the
sense that they undermine the
possibility of any civilized life for
the animals that are wandering around
and the rest of the territory well that
proceeding in that way Israel could take
over what's valuable for it in the West
Bank the arable land the pleasant
suburbs around the Jerusalem and Tel
Aviv the water resources will have
control of the Jordan Valley fertile
area and also prisons everything and
everything else that goes through and it
doesn't have any responsibility for the
Palestinian what will happen to them
well it was made pretty clear right at
the beginning of the occupation by
actually the person whose clearest was
Moshe Dayan who was defense minister in
charge of occupied territories and among
the leadership perhaps the person most
sympathetic to the plight of
Palestinians he recognized it and
understood and his position was that
what we're doing to you the Palestinians
is very much like a Bedouin who kidnaps
the young woman and forces her to marry
him and ultimately she'll accept it so
ultimately you'll accept what we're
doing to you and you otherwise as he put
it you will live like dogs and those who
want to leave can leave and we'll see
where that goes nothing secret about
this public record from 1967 and it's
implemented since it's not words
repeated in one or another for
and it's implemented those are the
settlement programs the development
programs which you and I pay for in a
lot of ways not just financially but
militarily diplomatically in other ways
well that's the way to implement the
historic right of the Jewish people to
off Palestine without running into the
feared demographic problem there's also
the problem of the the Palestinian city
the non-jewish citizens of Israel mostly
Arab that can be handled in various ways
that one way in fact was just proposed
by the Electoral Commission a couple of
weeks ago it tube and participation of
the era parties in the coming election
now that's unlikely to stand the courts
I think are not likely to let that stand
it's too blatant and over to violation
violation of minimal democratic practice
but in one way or another they can be
marginalized and kept out and as a
further plan which is accepted pretty
much across the spectrum and that is
that means have to be found to encourage
the Palestinian Arab citizens to leave
decisions of Israel to leave either by
direct transfer or by with every drawing
borders so that the heavily settled and
parts of say the Galilee will be
transferred into one of those segregated
Canton's that'll be could be called a
Palestinian state some that meaningless
for those are ways of practically
implementing the the program of the dual
program of recognizing the that the
historic rights of the Jewish people are
you know to the entire land or beyond
question and doing it in such a way that
can remain free from the demographic
problem the dangerous problem of having
non-jews in a Jewish state those are not
just proposals and they're being
implemented every day going on
constantly well those proposals can be
implemented only if there's no
resistance to them now in the west bank
by now there's very little resistance
because of Israeli violence which which
has indeed subdued the population and by
now because of collaborationist
Palestinian forced some sure you know
Israel's to the United States with its
allies the Arab dictatorships that
Jordan Egypt have trained security
forces fought security forces whose main
task is to subdue the population so if
Evan if they have a demonstration you
know against the atrocities and in Gaza
instead of the Israeli army going in
they'll do it that's a typical colonial
pattern that's the whole history of
colonialism works like that run through
the details but it's absolutely calm
very common so like say India was at the
population was mostly kept under control
by Indian soldiers under British command
and just a typical and natural procedure
in Chechnya today it's kept subdued and
quiet and developing and so on under
Chechen military forces the Russians in
the background in case anything goes
wrong it's routine and it's being
duplicated in the West Bank well okay
they've pretty much subdued protest in
the West Bank so they can carry out the
policies without disturbance but they
haven't yet subdued gaza gaza you still
have resistance remember Gaza and the
West Bank are one unit furthermore there
are both
occupied there's no question that Gaza
is occupied you know even as sane as
early commentators point out that
there's never been a day that it hasn't
been under occupation there's talk about
the famous disengagement but that that
was a well-organized scan hardline
hardliners in Israel like arias are on
the patron saying to the settlers
understood that is completely senseless
to keep several thousand Jewish settlers
in the ruins of Gaza which they already
pretty much destroyed taking a large
part of the land and the scarce
resources like water and protected from
you know a million and a half people by
a big component of the IDF the Israeli
army that's just crazy so what makes
sense is to essentially transfer them to
valuable territory if subsidized to go
to Gaza so fine you load them up in
trucks and take them over to be
illegally subsidized in the West Bank
which you want to keep which is what
happened when they announced the
disengagement they also same time
announced new so on programs in the West
Bank most of them went there some went
to the illegally occupied Golan Heights
that's almost all of them this had to be
presented as a trauma a national trauma
because you had to have images on the
front pages of the newspapers about may
remember the Boston Globe pathetic
little boy you know created pleading
with the soldiers not to take them away
destroying their homes and you can have
cries of never again it's kind of like
the Nazis and so on they all totally
faked I mean if they wanted to remove
the settlers there was nothing easier it
could simply announced on august first
the Israeli Army's my
leave the Gaza two days later the people
who live there would have climbed into
the lorries provided for them and
quietly gone to their new subsidized
homes and illegally settlements in the
West Bank but then you wouldn't have had
a national crown you wouldn't be able to
shout never again and so on there's a
lesson lesson in this because it also
has to do with the possibilities of
dealing with the settlements in the
occupied territories and the west of the
rest of the occupied territories with
the West Bank it's very commonly argued
that if the Israeli army that there's no
possibility of a two-state settlement
because of the Israeli army tried to
forcefully remove the settlers there
would be a civil war and that's probably
true the the religious nationalist
settlers have such a powerful role
inside Israel in particular in the
Israeli army that they might just refuse
to carry especially at the officer corps
many of them obey the rabbi's not the
state of Oklahoma so yes they might
refuse to do it battles could be a civil
war but there's no reason for any of
that to eliminate the settlements in the
West Bank is a trivial move just
withdraw the Army and the settlers old
divide though many of them are just
there because they're paid to have a
decent quality of life okay so they'll
go back and be paid to be within the
borders of Israel there will be
nationalist religious groups that will
fight to hang on to every you know clod
of Earth okay they can be left to their
own devices they can stay in under
Palestinian Authority or they can leave
to but that doesn't have to be any civil
war and there doesn't have to be any
force the mechanisms are straightforward
so that's not a very
to proceed you to a political settlement
and this has been done and the many
examples of this just to take one recent
one which was pretty dramatic but can't
be discussed here because of what it
implies the Indonesia 1975 invaded East
Timor and it's about us but what happens
about as close to genocide is anything
in the modern period would kill hundreds
of thousands of people and maybe a
quarter of the population strongly
backed by the United States also written
when the atrocities mounted others and
they swore they were never going to
leave general said it's part of
Indonesia we're going to keep it nothing
the world can do about it well in
September 1999 under by then very
serious international and domestic
pressure Clinton decided that it's
enough he told the Indonesian generals
sorry friends the game is over and they
immediately were through you can't stand
up to the Godfather you know that's it's
just too dangerous so okay that was the
end of that now that's gone down in
history as a humanitarian intervention
by the United States look how
humanitarian we are first we supported
the invasion of 25 years help them
destroy the population and then when
just became too much would bother to us
we told them to call it off okay and
they called it off okay international
affairs is there aren't many principles
of international affairs although
scholars will tell you there are but one
principle that works pretty well is that
international affairs are very much like
the Maffei and there's a godfather and
you better obey him or us or intro and
then there are the what are called the
intellectuals who explained to you that
what the Godfather's doing is humane
divine mission and so on and so forth is
pretty much the way it works and the
same could work in the rest of the
occupied territories well does let's go
back to the question of legitimacy of of
the attack are there peaceful
alternatives for Israel when they're
under a rocket attack well there there
are alternatives and narrow sense and
also in a broader sense the narrow sense
is sometimes discussed the narrow
alternative is just to accept the
ceasefire okay that would mean ending
the rocket attacks and opening the
border okay crucially opening the border
and there are agreements on paper of
effect so in 2005 there was an agreement
that Israel would allow continuous flow
across the borders of the people
complete survive and there would be no
more violent well a couple of months
later in january 2006 israel back to
rejected the agreement as did the united
states and the reason is the
Palestinians had committed a really
grave crime now they had vite voted the
wrong way in a free election and you
don't do that The Godfather didn't like
that so therefore you have to be
punished and meanwhile the intellectual
community has to write uplifting
articles about our yearning for
democracy and so on and so forth again
that's the way international affairs
work cultural system works so Israel
backed away from the agreement and since
then there's been no acceptance of that
truth actually right before the present
invasion latest invasion December 27th
the political leader of Hamas how did
Michelle propose that they go back to
the 2005 agreement okay no need for an
invasion Israel didn't even respond
to the root of the request was much
better to attack then you can eliminate
try to eliminate the last resistance to
the atrocities that continue every
minute both in Gaza but more seriously
in the West Bank which they really care
about and want to take over and way I
described so that's a narrow proposal
you can accept the ceasefire the broader
proposal is very simple except except
the accept international law which is
straightforward you have no right to be
in the occupied territories withdraw and
allow palestinian national
self-determination in the release
territories of the West Bank and Gaza
twenty-two percent of the former Palace
not now on that matter there is an
overwhelming international consensus and
there has been for over 30 years other
topics that aren't discussed here this
proposal came to the Security Council of
the United Nations in january's 1976 it
was brought by the arab what are called
the confrontation states Syria Jordan
Egypt to state settlement on the
international borders incorporating all
the wording of un 242 that you follow
this know that that's the least
principle that's what everyone except
the right of Israel and every other
state to live in peace and security
within recognized borders and so on and
a Palestinian state and the release
territories well is really was bitterly
opposed to that they actually carried
out an action which presumably was
directed against the UN but it's euro
bombed Lebanon for no pretext killing 50
people was kind of reported here but
like a footnote rightly it is that was
probably a message to the United
nations don't fill around with us and
the u.s. vetoed it okay the godfather
two pair of that and there's a record
yeah I'll be able to there's a record
ever since it's late i'll run through it
but there is one break in the record and
it's important to recognize it because
it's significant for the future in
january two thousand and one there was
one week of negotiations in Taba egypt
in which Palestinians and Israelis
negotiated top negotiators dealing with
the detailed issues about borders
jerusalem refugees and so on and they
came pretty close to an agreement in
fact in their last press conference they
said if they had a couple of more days
they probably could have reached a
settlement in terms of the international
consensus well Israel called off the
negotiations prematurely at the end of
that but 2001 isn't that long ago no
it's not that it's reaching for pie in
the sky I mean that can be resumed
what's required is that the Godfather
agree to what aggregate to and in
Indonesia 1991 to say okay games over
and you have simple ways to proceed to
achieve the international consensus
right now the US and Israel are
absolutely isolated on this Hamas
accepted Hezbollah has said they won't
disrupt anything that the Palestinians
except Iran is it the same the rest of
the world's in favor of it to the US and
Israel and the u.s. is the crucial actor
all the way through because of its power
so it's really in our hand and that
means to say one more word on you know
there's a lot of talk about trying to
apply the kinds of tactics that were
used in the case of South Africa
but think that through you know it's
tempting I agree boycott divestment
sanctions think it through the South
African boycott divestment sanctions
were effective after decades of
education and organizing in the 1980s at
a point when Congress was passing
legislation in favor of Boyka barring US
trade mayor's were getting arrested you
know protesting against apartheid the
American corporations were protesting
against it okay at that point people
understood what was going on and you
could have effective campaign and the
same would be true in this case if
people understood what was going on
what's doing you could have that kind of
campaign but this is different you don't
need the campaign if people understood
what was going on you could settle the
problem without that namely by getting
the United States to withdraw its its
rigid extreme rejection ism and I think
that focuses on the task that's really
in front of us it's an educating and
organizing task the one that was carried
out over a long time to lead to you know
overwhelming opposition to apartheid
okay then you can do things about it and
it's not easy and the apartheid case
indicates why so in the 1980s Congress
did legislate an end to us trade with
South Africa the Reagan administration
evaded an in fact trade increased as
late as 1988 the Pentagon declared the
African National Congress Nelson Mandela
to be one of the more notorious
terrorist groups
the world it's 1988 it's colin powell's
Pentagon the in fact you may know that
Mandela was removed from the terrorist
list just a couple of months ago I guess
it was becoming too much of an
embarrassing so you know you have to I
mean even if you know even at the time
when you really have the basis for
achieving something you got to compel
the US government to go along with it
they've got their own interests in her
own constituency but it can be done and
it was done and it could be done in this
case too but not without a lot of work
