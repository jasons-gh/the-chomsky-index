the brain has developed all sorts of
capacities many of which are never put
to use I mean we just know that for a
fact
and let's say take the take another
capacity which is more or less well
understood the number faculty that's you
know that's simplest like the language
faculty you got to know what a number is
in order to learn anything about numbers
how does a child know that after it's
taught the count is six there's going to
be another one you know widen it in
there let's say and you know how do you
have the capacities that enable you to
comprehend what a prime number is if you
get that four well those capacities
whatever they are they can't be learned
because you just think through the logic
of it you can't learn in the majority
having the usual story but those
capacities were present in the human
species long before they were ever used
in fact there are human societies today
and their entire which are have the same
genes we do in every relevant respect
which in their entire hundreds of
thousands of years of history have never
used it although you can quickly evoke
the capacity in those species as soon as
you present you know you sort of give
them right stimulations so these
capacities are just sitting there you
know waiting I mean why are they there
well probably because they're
piggybacking on some other capacity like
it's been argued that they're
piggybacking on the language capacity
I'm gonna curious fact about languages
it has this odd property of the discrete
infinity it's a digits an infinite
digital system which is extremely rare
in the biological world so it and that's
like the number faculty so maybe the
number of faculty is just kind of an
abstraction from the linguistic faculty
that doesn't look at it's complicated
properties and just looks at its basic
structure well that's a nice fairy tale
may be true and if so you'd have a
number of faculty around long you know
without any without it ever being used
and there could be lots of other
faculties like that I mean the chances
are just none kind of grounds with
biological plausibility that if there is
a faculty sitting there that would
contribute to reproductive success if
you used chances are it will be used and
that's just on grounds of plausibility
you know over a couple hundred thousand
years somebody would have tried it they
were succeeded and so on and so forth
but that's about the level of what you
can say in these areas
