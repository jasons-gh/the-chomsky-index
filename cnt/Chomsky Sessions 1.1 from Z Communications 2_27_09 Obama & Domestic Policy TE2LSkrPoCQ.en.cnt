so beginning nationally in Tuesday's
speech Obama made proposals for an
economic recovery program covering jobs
healthcare education the environment
much more what is the context in which
to understand these proposals well one
context which is part of the context
which is obvious is that there is a very
severe financial crisis there's also a
manufacturing recession and its global I
may have this roots are here but its
global and in fact much of the rest of
the world is in worse shape including
Europe so it's a major crisis nobody
knows how far it's going to go certainly
the worst since the Great Depression and
a lot is uncertain it's not really
understood that's a consequence of the
financialization of the economy and the
kind of mystical faith in somehow market
so what's called the efficient market
hypothesis but somehow everything will
work out because markets have miracles
there were obvious reasons why this is
not going to work they've been in crises
all over the world since the
financialization of the economy in the
70s so far they've been either in poor
countries where you know who cares or
somehow containable like long-term
management but now it's hit home in a
way that matters and it's it's only
quite striking to see the difference
between this radical difference between
the measures that the rich used for
themselves and the one and the measures
that they use for the poor so when
Indonesia has a financial crisis
horrible crisis as it did ten years ago
the rules from the Treasury Department
via the IMF
pay back your debt namely to us raise
interest rates slow down the economic
growth suffer which is structural
adjustment privatized because now we got
a chance to take over everything in fact
there's still the rules that the IMF is
giving for the poor for ourselves it's
the precise opposite stimulate the
economy forget about that just don't as
much debt as you want we try to
encourage China and others to pay us
more which is what Clinton just given or
less trip nationalized don't call it as
you lies but essentially naturalize
instead of privatized pour money into
the economy to get it working again and
right down the line the precise opposite
and it's interesting that in a way it's
not surprising the rich take care of
themselves that's economic history and
kick everybody else in the face but it's
kind of striking that it's can go on
right in front of you and it's as if
nobody notices you know but anyway
that's one part of the crisis the other
part is which is related as we've come
out of 30 years of by many measures the
worst period of US economic history for
the majority of the population I'm sorry
rich country so you know people starve
the way they do in India but you know
I've been 30 years at which real wages
wages adjusted for inflation have pretty
much stagnated for the majority
sometimes declined benefits of declined
quality of life standards have declined
the u.s. is one of the very only or the
very few industrial countries that does
not keep statistics on what are called
social indicators you know how's the
society doing young infant mortality a
child abuse whole pile of things other
industrial in Turkey keeps the distance
but the US doesn't however there are
some that are kept there are efforts to
keep them affordable universities one
so they've been doing it and it turns
out that they started in about nineteen
sixty and from nineteen sixty two 1975
roughly indicators improved and they
tracked growth which is what you'd
expect this growth goes up social
conditions get better since 1975 they've
declined and the last ones that were
published around 2000 was back to
nineteen sixty that's a measure in the
general decline of conditions and
circumstances for the majority of the
population you know there has been
growth not as fast as before but it's at
the very few pockets so it's ended up
with tremendous inequality these this is
related to the financialization of the
economy I mean when you pour huge
amounts of capital into speculation
against currencies you know very
short-term transactions and so on first
of all it takes money out of the working
economy and it also requires countries
to protect themselves against a
speculative attack to store up big
reserves and so on and so forth so in
general it's kind of in a drag on
economic growth this is sort of muddled
in the discussion because they're out
there there are a few countries East
Asia and China which have basically
disregarded the rules they've grown
substantially so if you throw in a
billion Chinese into the total
statistics looks like there's been a
very good growth you know and
commentators including unfortunately
economists often muddle export
orientation with following the
neoliberal rules and so China grew fast
by violating the rules and exporting so
it kind of you can say well what's
called globalization works look at the
average for the world but if you sort of
disaggregated and you see who's growing
and how and why it turns out it's mostly
been a kind of a catastrophe for
everyone except the very rich so that's
another part of the context well in that
kind of course the Bush years have been
like a total catastrophe at every front
you can see it in the election
even his own party right against which
is pretty unusual so yes it was clear
that whoever came in you know maybe
Obama a little more than mccain but
whoever came in would have to move away
from the extreme radicalism of the
Cheney Bush administration to give the
right word to the names because it's
just too much of a catastrophe for major
American interests that's why a huge
funding for Obama from the financial
industries others because they just want
what's get rid of this fact more for
Obama than mccain figured he's their man
so inevitably there was going to be his
shift back towards the center not you
really can't I mean a lot of people who
disappointed in Obama but it's really
unfair he never gave any indication that
he was anything but a familiar centrist
Democrat and that's pretty but which
means a little more favorable to the
population on domestic policies but
hawkish on international affairs and
that's pretty much what you find the
budget that you have here in today's 350
times right that's 634 billion in health
care and you know 144 war just this year
on Iraq and Afghanistan as it pattern
and it's also and it's you know by and
large given the circumstances and the
constraints in his own positions it's
not a bad budget like Paul Krugman has
an article in here in which he applauds
it them you know more or less accurate i
think it's general it's not I don't
think make sense to go to progressive
budget it's a move back towards the
center after a radical departure to the
right which actually goes back to the
late entire years but sort of
accelerated with Reagan's carried on by
Clinton in a different way and went off
to catastrophe under bush so yes there's
got to be some dealing with these
catastrophes on all fronts and it is a
move towards the center and that
census welcome that's better than the
radical right but if you ask if you
really look in I mean he wasn't for a
specific which is what you'd expect the
specifics will come when they work it
out but the general outlines have
important characteristics but one of the
main course I was healthcare as it must
be because healthcare is you know it's
like a disaster the costs of the US
men's event twice per capita twice as
much per capita as other industrial
countries as some of the worst outcomes
that's a huge drag on the economy and
except for the ones who benefit like the
insurance companies the pharmaceutical
companies and but it's a it's a is a
drag for manufacturing industry in fact
one of the interesting things about the
election that's compared with 2004 is
that in 2004 as in earlier elections the
standard line in the new york times for
example was that the Democratic area
Democratic candidate couldn't bring up
any government involvement in health
care because it had no political support
meaning large majority the population
wants it doesn't wanted it for decades
but that's not political support in our
system the pharmaceutical corporations
were posed and the insurance industry
was posed the financial industries so no
political support in this campaign 2008
went to for the first time at first
Edwards and after him Obama and Clinton
made some moves towards what the public
is wanted for decades namely a national
single-payer health care system like
pretty much like other countries that
I'm here it's called canadian-style
because you know we know that Canada is
there it's hard to miss it's not called
australian style though they have a
better system because where's Australia
but it's it's what the populations water
for decades but it was never politically
possible
