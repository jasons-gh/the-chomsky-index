you should recognize that freedom speech
in the United States though it's it is
protected to a very high degree has not
been protected historically that's a
recent development and in fact it's a
development that came substantially out
of the activist movement if you look at
the there is the bill of rights you know
which says that the government part of
the constitutional system which First
Amendment it says that the government
can't prevent a speech but it doesn't
say it can't punish it so the first
meant was never understood effect
doesn't a really permit freedom of
speech it says for example that the
press can the government can't stop the
newspaper from publishing an article but
it can throw them in jail if they did
publish it that's not protection of
freedom of speech in fact it wasn't
until the 20th century that freedom of
speech cases actually reached the high
courts you know the law is basically
what the courts decide not what's
written on paper and the Supreme Court
began to address freedom of speech
issues actually during the First World
War and the famous statement supporting
freedom of speech word dissents they
were dissenting opinions later they were
recognized as important and in fact if
you look at those dissenting opinions
they were nothing to write home about
the version of one of the main ones was
during the First World War a shank case
it was a a Jewish tailor or something
who published some pamphlets criticizing
the war during the war the first world
war it became practically fascist in the
United States I mean you couldn't the
Boston Symphony Orchestra couldn't play
Beethoven let's say you couldn't mention
anything German you know there's massive
hatred if it was created of anything
loosely related to the
an enemy eugene debs the major the
leading labor
figure in the united states also a
presidential candidate the Socialist
Party candidate and he was thrown in
jail for giving a talk in which he urged
working in which told working people
look this is not your war it's an
imperialist war working people don't
have a state that they have to serve and
he urged people to think about their
constitutional right not to bear arms if
they chose not to urge any illegal
activity he was thrown into jail and he
was after the war when there was a kind
of a general amnesty he was kept in jail
he was bitterly hated by the
progressives Woodrow Wilson hated him
particularly in kept them in jail and
this was the atmosphere in the midst of
that there was a Supreme Court dissent
in which Oliver Wendell Holmes made a
famous dissent in the Schenck case and
said that this young tailor who
published a pamphlet questioning the war
shouldn't be that issues of freedom of
speech arose he said he nevertheless
voted with the majority on punishing him
so it was a dissent in the sense that he
raised the question of freedom of speech
but nevertheless said that these actions
had to be punished well over the years
it's sort of broadened a little bit but
then also went backwards did in many
ways but it was until the 1960s that
there were strong Supreme Court
judgments on freedom of speech and the
first major ones came out of the civil
rights movement during the and that's
not unusual in the first major Supreme
Court statement affirming freedom of
speech was in 1964 it was times of V
Sullivan if you want to look it up the
what happened was that the New York
Times published an ad
by the civil rights movement Martin
Luther King which condemned the an
Alabama state of Alabama Sheriff
particularly brutal racist sheriff's we
didn't horribles things and they ran an
ad at condemning him state of Alabama
sued the New York Times for what's
called seditious libel practically every
country in the world I suspect Holland
too
I've checked has a principle of
seditious libel seditious libel means
you cannot assault the state with words
and truth is no defense truth makes it a
worse crime because that's an even
greater or so as far as I know every
country I've looked at still has that
law Britain Canada you know you can
check here and that's like a core attack
on freedom of speech means the state you
know the king of the state whatever it
is is it cannot be attacked with words
well that was in the United States had
it - it was shot down by the Supreme
Court in 1964 so you can assault the
state with words you can criticize the
state freely and that means any state
authority and there were other cases and
finally in 1969 there was a the most
important case which said that
essentially concluded that speech should
be free up to participation in eminent
criminal activity so for example if you
and I go into a store and you have a gun
and we were planning to rob it and I say
shoot that's not protected speech but
anything kind of up to that should be
protected speech and this is very
relevant to the case that you mentioned
because the case in question was the Ku
Klux Klan a vicious racist organization
carrying out lynching of blacks and so
on and they were the ones who were
protected by this that they're speak
should be protected up to participation
in criminal in eminent criminal acts as
far as I know that's the most the
strongest protection of freedom of
speech that exists anywhere actually
it's even beyond what the courts are now
willing to accept now there are also a
tax on freedom of speech so it's by no
means a victory that's one forever the
worst attack is under Obama it's a case
that you should look up if you're
interested in case that the Obama
administration brought to the court that
was argued by Obama's latest Supreme
Court appointment Kagan and Justice
Kagan and they won the Obama
administration won with the support of
the reactionary justices it's a it's a
case against a group for the
humanitarian law project which was
giving legal advice to a group that's on
the government's terrorist list the PKK
a Turkish group they were just giving
him legal advice saying you know here's
kind of things you can do the court
decided that and the Obama
administration insisted that even verbal
engagement with a group that's on the
terrorist list for example a few tell
them I think you ought to turn to
nonviolent activities that's criminal
that's material support for terrorism
and that's a real attack on freedom of
speech a major attack for example I
could be charged Jimmy Carter could be
charged the plenty of people could be
charged anyone who approaches involved
in any way with a group that the
government calls terrorists any anything
you do like tell them to keep the
nonviolent activities or say here your
rights or whatever that's criminal
that's a major assault on freedom of
speech and that's Obama and what makes
it worse and isn't even discussed is
that the terrorist list itself is it you
know utterly illegitimate
any standards of the last couple of
centuries I mean the government just
says this is you're on the terrorist
list nothing you can do about it and no
judicial review no evidence no nothing
just the government says you're on the
terrorist list
