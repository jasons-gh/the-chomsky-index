the war and peace report I'm Amy Goodman
were on the road in Portland Oregon we
are here as part of our hundred city
silence majority tour on this week when
President Obama and Republican
presidential hopeful mitt romney debated
issues of foreign policy in the economy
we turned to world-renowned political
dissident linguist author MIT professor
Noam Chomsky in a recent speech
professor Chomsky examined topics
largely ignored or glossed over during
the campaign from China to the Arab
Spring to global warming and the nuclear
threat posed by Israel vs. Iran he spoke
last month at the University of
Massachusetts and Amherst and an event
sponsored by the Center for popular
economics his talk was entitled who owns
the world what I was thinking about his
remarks I had two topics and mind
couldn't decide between them actually
pretty obvious ones one topic is what
are the most important issues that we
face the second topic is what issues are
not being treated seriously or at all in
the quadrennial frenzy now underway
called an election but I realized that
there's no problem it's not a hard
choice they're the same topic and there
are reasons for it I which are very
significant in themselves I'd like to
return to that in a moment but first a
few words on the background beginning
with the announced title who owns the
world actually good answer to this was
given years ago by Adam Smith someone
we're supposed to worship but not read
he was
little subversive when you read him
sometimes he was referring to the most
powerful country in the world in his day
and of course the country that
interested him namely England and he
pointed out that in England the
principal architects of policy are those
who own the country the merchants and
manufacturers in his day and he said
they make sure to design policy so that
their own interests are most peculiarly
attended to their interests are served
by policy however Grievous the impact on
others including the people of England
but he was an old-fashioned conservative
with moral principles so he added the
victims of England the victims of these
what he called the savage and justice of
the Europeans particularly in India well
he had no illusions about the owners so
to quote him again all for ourselves and
nothing for other people seems in every
age of the world to have been the vile
Maxim of the Masters of mankind was true
then it's true del Britain kept its
position as the dominant world power the
well into the 20th century despite
steady decline by the end of World War
two the dominance had shifted decisively
in the hands of the upstart across the
sea the United States by far the most
powerful and wealthy society in world
history Britain could only aspire to be
its junior partner
the British Foreign Office ruefully
recognized at that point 1945 the United
States had literally half the world's
wealth incredible security control the
entire western hemisphere both oceans
the opposite sides of both oceans is
nothing there has never been anything
like that in history and planners
understood it Roosevelt's planners were
meeting right through the Second World
War designing the post-war world they
were quite sophisticated about it and
their plans were pretty much implemented
they wanted to make sure that the United
States would control what they called a
grand area which would include routinely
the entire western hemisphere the entire
Far East the former British Empire which
US would be taking over and as much of
Eurasia as possible crucially its
commercial and industrial centers in
Western Europe and within this region
they said the United States should hold
unquestioned power with military and
economic supremacy while ensuring the
limitation of any exercise of
sovereignty by states that might
interfere with these global designs and
those were pretty realistic plans at the
time given the enormous disparity of
power the US had been them by far the
richest country in the world even before
the Second World War though it wasn't
was not yet the major global actor it
during the Second World War the United
States gained enormously industrial
production almost quadrupled got us out
of the oppression and meanwhile
industrial rivals
devastated or seriously weakened so that
was an unbelievable system of power
actually the policies that were outlined
then still whole you can read them in
government pronouncements but the
capacity to implement them has
significantly declined actually there's
a major theme now in foreign policy
discussion you know journals and so on
the theme is called American decline so
for example in the most prestigious
establishment international relations
journal foreign affairs a couple of
months ago that was an issue which had
on the front cover and big bold letters
is America over ? that's announcing the
theme of the issue and there's a
standard Colin corollary to this the
power is shifting to the west to China
and India the rising world powers which
are going to be the hegemonic states of
the future actually I think the decline
the decline is quite real but some
serious qualifications are in order
first of all the corollary is highly
unlikely least in the foreseeable future
a China and India are very poor
countries I just take a look at say the
human development index of the United
Nations their way down there China's
around 90th I think in these around 120
or so last time I looked and they have
tremendous internal problems demographic
problems extreme poverty hopeless
inequality ecological problems China's
great manufacturing center but it's
actually mostly an assembly plant so it
assembles parts and components
ha technology that comes from the
surrounding industrial sent more
advanced industrial centers Japan Taiwan
South Korea Singapore the United States
Europe basically assembles them so say
you buy one of these I things you know
an iPad from China that it's called an
export from China but the parts and
components and technology come from
outside and the value-added in China is
minuscule it's been calculated they'll
move up the technology ladder but it's a
hard climb in the even harder well so I
think one should be skeptical about the
corollary but the clep there's another
qualification it's more serious decline
is real but it's not new it's been going
on since 1945 in fact it happened very
quickly in the late 1940s there's an
event that's known here as the loss of
china china became independent that's a
loss of a huge piece of the grand area
of asia and it became a major issue in
American domestic policy who's
responsible for the loss of China a lot
of recriminations and so on actually the
phrase is kind of interesting like I
can't lose your computer right cuz I
don't own it I can lose my computer well
that phrase lost of China kind of
presupposes a deeply held principle of
kind of American a leak consciousness we
own the world and if some piece of it
becomes independent we've lost it and
that said terrible loss we got to do
something about it it's not a question
which is interesting in itself well
right about the same time around
nineteen fifty concerns developed about
the loss of Southeast Asia and that's
what led the United States into the
Indochina wars and the worst atrocities
of the
post-war period partly lost partly not
very significant event in modern history
was in 1965 when the in Indonesia which
was the main concern that's the country
of Southeast Asia with most of the
wealth and resources there was a coupe
military coup in Indonesia it support
the coup it led to an extraordinary
massacre what the New York Times called
a staggering mass slaughter killed
hundreds of thousands of people mostly
landless peasants destroyed the only
mass political party and opened the
country up to Western exploitation
euphoria in the West was so enormous
that it couldn't be contained so in the
New York Times describing the staggering
mass slaughter are called it a gleam of
light in Asia it was the column written
by James Reston the leading liberal
thinker in the times and the same
elsewhere Europe Australian was
fantastic event years later McGeorge
Bundy who was the national security
adviser for Kennedy and Johnson in
retrospect he pointed out that probably
would have been a good idea to end the
Vietnam War at that point to pull out
contrary to a lot of illusions the
Vietnam War was fought primarily to
ensure that an independent Vietnam would
not develop successfully and become a
model for other countries in the region
would not to borrow Henry Kissinger's
terminology speaking about Chile we have
to prevent it what they call that he
called the virus of independent
development from spreading contagion
elsewhere that's a critical part of
American foreign policy since the Second
World War
Britain France others to a lesser degree
and by 1965 that was over Vietnam was
South Vietnam was virtually destroyed
the word spread to the rest of the China
wasn't going to be a model for anyone
and the contagion was contained that
were the suharto regime made sure that
Indonesia wouldn't be infected and
pretty soon the US had dictatorships in
every country of the region Marcus in
the Philippines dictatorship in
Thailand's China and South Park in South
Korea it was no problem about the
infection so that would have been a good
time to end the Vietnam War he felt well
that's Southeast Asia but the decline
continues the last 10 years there's been
a very important event the lost of South
America for the first time in 500 years
the south and since the conquistadors
the South American countries have begun
to move towards independence and a
degree of integration the typical
structure of one of the South American
countries was tiny very rich westernized
elite often white or mostly white and a
huge massive horrible poverty country
separated from one another oriented
through each oriented towards it's
either Europe or more recently the
United States last 10 years that's been
overcome significantly beginning to
integrate the prerequisite for
independence of even beginning to face
some of their horrendous internal
problems that's the loss of South
America one sign is that the United
States has been driven out of every
single military base in South America
trying to restore a few but right now
there are none MIT professor Noam
Chomsky coming up he discusses global
warming nuclear war and the Arab Spring
