the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology or MIT his world-renowned as
a research institution specializing in
engineering and the physical sciences it
may therefore come as somewhat of a
surprise that on the east side of campus
in the Department of linguistics and
philosophy a committed group of
theoretical linguists has begun the
study of Sofia the department founded in
1961 by Morris Hallie Noam Chomsky has
set the pace for much of the
intellectual work that has subsequently
made linguistics a strong and lively
branch of the cognitive sciences today
with over 40 PhD students in the
graduate program the department
maintains its focus on the continued
importance of approaches to the
discovery of both mental and cultural
universals and contrasts part of the
Graduate training includes topics in the
grammar of a less familiar language of
course initiated by professor Kenneth
Hale on February 6 2003 nine MIT
graduate students led by professors
Michael Ken Stewart's of phonologists
and Norman Richards a sin tactician
began their study of the relatively
under documented zaza key language
Suzuki can be classified as an
endangered language as it is being
spoken less and less by younger
generations since the beginning of the
20th century Zaki has been accepted as a
language of its own among linguists and
not any longer merely as a chordee or
Kurdish dialect nevertheless until
recently the Zhou Zhou people were
generally held to be Kurds speaking a
special dialect of Corti due to the
oppressive minority and language policy
of the Republic of Turkey until 15 years
ago there existed practically no
indigenous tzatziki written literature
and so no means by which the zaza people
could find out anything about their own
language and cultural identities
[Music]
we interviewed Noam Chomsky on
globalization and its effects on
endangered language complicated issue
first of all when we talk about
endangered languages we people usually
have in mind third world languages or
fourth world languages they don't have
in mind the languages of say Europe but
the languages of Europe are severely
endangered effective in disappearing at
a very rapid rate it's not they don't
cook it's something it's an early stage
of what's now called globalization with
the formation of national States and
Europe and the integration of the
European societies right within the most
advanced region of Western civilization
there's been a very rapid decline of
languages so plenty of people can't talk
to their grandmothers now because the
languages have just disappeared in fact
one of the major research programs in
linguistics
today is a European Union program
studying disappearing languages in
Europe they're called dialect they're
just language different languages and on
the other hand and this bears on
globalization the integration of Europe
and the kind of move towards
centralization and so on has set up a
counter-reaction so at an increasing
regionalization and a lot of the
regional languages are being revived
with a good deal of commitment and
intensity and it's so in say in Spain
for example Catalan is much more lively
than - Franco is suppressed you know you
can walk down the streets of Barcelona
you never heard it but now it's the
language of Catalonia you know the
Basque language has been revived
considerably other so-called dialects
like hysteria and others are also
becoming people people always spoke them
but now they're speaking of them
self-consciously and interested in
reviving them in the culture and so and
that's happening elsewhere - they walk
in the streets of Wales and
schoolchildren are speaking Welsh these
are
there there is a reaction to the
centralization and integration which is
leading to revival of regional
identities local cultures practices folk
songs language and so on and I suspect
we're those things it's harder worldwide
this is a rich privileged area so lots
of things can happen that are going to
happen in the American Southwest or you
know the Aboriginal Australia but still
I think something similar can be found
so the general process it was one of
leveling and destruction on the other
hand the human beings complicated
creatures they also struggle for their
own right so you get kind of reaction
beyond the political of importance of
studying Suzuki theoretical linguists
can benefit from the study of an under
documented language we are trying to put
together a puzzle that has been
scattered across all the languages of
the world that every language that we
look at has some something to contribute
to our theoretical understanding of how
human languages are put together so I've
been working with you on how questions
are put together in Suzuki and that's
helped me to understand better how
questions are put together more
generally there are things I understand
better for example about a language from
the Philippines that I work with the
garlic because of the things that you've
talked to me about how the key works so
there are those kinds of connections
it's also important I think for the
community who speaks those who keep
themselves to understand that the
language is valuable in an important
language that is it's got properties
that are of great importance and
interest to the nature of the course
then is is to allow our students to put
into practice some of the theory that
they've learned in describing a language
that's that's unfamiliar to them and
Suzuki is particularly interesting then
and it's in indo-european language as
you know many European languages have
been very well studied but there are
some that if not and any other languages
is one of them the class was conducted
once a week for 14 weeks supplemented by
additional
meetings between each student and cool
gym Akash the classes Suzuki consultant
that's what changes
[Music]
they show some kind of behavior which is
also unexpected that
each graduate students spent the course
of the semester writing a research paper
on a particular topic in zaza key
grammar so I'm working on how Suzuki
speakers mark the source of information
they have further claims that they make
their sentences and I found it
interesting because it's done in a very
different way I'm interested in finding
out what happens to words and other
linguistic things when they're taken
into those icky and Miyazaki how do they
change and how does that lucky speakers
change them but I've been looking at our
customs the way you say that somebody
made someone do something and I like
that I think that's really interesting
quite a few interesting phenomena which
we are only beginning to understand
things like I'm sure people have already
talked about evidential x' also as a fit
construction worst I mean in linguistics
be a formal linguistics or any other
kind we're still really just beginning
to get a grasp of how those kinds of
structures work and zaza is a great
language for exploring that really
important one of my main interests is
the in a lot of different languages as
the way the questions are formed Suzuki
has a way of forming questions that
allows you to either do nothing leave
leave a question word in situ which is
something we find in a bunch of
different languages or to move it to the
front of the sentence by a variety of
means so you can ask questions like so
you can you can take a statement like
it's good that that though and you can
change that to a question like look at
that the kanji Janecka or you can make
that into a question by taking comes
eugenic and moving it to the front so
like comes you genetic I can talk about
that
that sort of optionality in that way of
having a choice between two different
ways of forming questions that in itself
is interesting and the conditions on
when you can use which of those types of
questions that's interesting as well so
there are a lot of very sort of
complicated facts about the way
questions are formed that are that are
useful toward our understanding of human
language more generally I don't know
that much about quarters Society I'd
known about the Kurdish diaspora and so
forth and the fragmentation in the
Kurdish nation causes a bunch of
national boundaries but that was about
it I had never met until I met you until
I admit interviewer I had never met a
Kurdish person never after we started
our work in the Linguistics Department
on tzatziki we decided to see how it
might benefit other people in the MIT
community and what the sort of general
level of understanding and knowledge was
about tzatziki and Kurdish language
quite generally so we decided to spend
the afternoon polling random MIT
students about what they know and here's
what we found
I studied mechanical engineering and
electrical engineering okay we have an
engineer here do you know what Sasaki is
Sasaki saslicky I not not without any
context no okay no not off the top of my
head okay what if I told you which is
actually true that Suzuki is a language
where do you think it might be spoken
it's tough you know I would guess
possibly Central or South America or
possibly Africa maybe you know somewhere
in the Pacific Islands but I don't know
I wanted to ask you if you knew what
Sasaki is sorry no now uzuki is a
language where do you think it's spoken
Africa Africa it turns out to be spoken
by Kurds so what language would that
make it most closely related to no idea
have you ever heard of a language called
tzatziki no I have
okay does it ring any bells you have any
guess where it might be spoken I assume
I know most European languages so I'm
guessing it's not one of those it might
be a one of the former Soviet ones might
be an Asian African maybe maybe and it
might be a Native American I don't know
I have no guest is really okay it turns
out Suzuki is spoken by Kurdish people
now do you know how many guesses what
languages kurdish might be related to
arabic or if there's a turkish dialect
or Hindi possibly no I don't know just
venture any guest is also key it sounds
foreign
yes Western yes well what if I told you
and in fact it is Suzuki is a language
sounds a key is a language where is it
spoken must be in some Middle Eastern
tribe Middle East very good very close
sounds Indian this sounds Japanese I've
no idea sounds Indian to you Jeff I told
you that Zaza Key was a language where
would you think it's spoken Suzuki is a
West iranian language spoken in
Southeast Anatolia Northwest to the
Corgi or Kurdish speaking regions
estimates of the number of speakers vary
from one to two and a half million
people the major cities where tzatziki
is spoken include D advocate garrison
moosh elaziz and bing-geul on the upper
courses of the Euphrates gazelle amok
and more at rivers
in considering Zeki we may raise the
question what is the difference between
a language in a dialect that's a very
difficult question sort of in layman's
terms it would be that two varieties of
the same language that are more or less
mutually intelligible to one another
structurally it's very difficult to give
it a definition one thing that linguists
often say about dialects versus
languages which you asked about earlier
is that a dialect a language is a
dialect with an army and a navy and that
just goes to show that again it's more a
matter of how people think of languages
and what kind of social uses they have
that determines whether we call it a
language versus a dialect a lot of
linguists think that there is that there
actually are no such things as either
languages or dialects we have this
tendency to define things as languages
or dialects based on political criteria
so we call things dialects if they are
close together in both within a single
country and we call them languages if
they are in different countries those
aren't the kinds of criteria that
linguists are interested in so there are
no linguistic criteria that allow you to
say these two things are dialects or
these two things are languages so for
example we customarily talk about the
ways people speak in China the Cantonese
and Mandarin for example we talk about
those and call them dialects because
they are both spoken in China but there
are no more similar to each other than
Spanish and French they're related but
they're not mutually intelligible
there's no real reason to call them
dialects instead languages we call
Norwegian and Swedish different
languages because they're spoken in
different countries but they are
mutually intelligible someone who only
speaks Norwegians who only speaks
Swedish or Danish they can
so it's not clear that there that there
is a good definition of language or
dialect so this is a dictionary of crew
Bungie you were asking me earlier about
differences between Comanche and and
tzatziki it's very clear looking at the
end but there are a number so you know
my book in this language apparently is
book I mean I guess what all this means
is that if someone tries to belittle a
way of speaking by saying well that's
just a dialect it's not a real language
for a linguist that kind of claim has no
reading bearing that in mind can we
identify and describe differences
between what we call tzatziki in English
in English we mark the source of
information for our claims by using
parentheticals or adverbs so if we want
to claim that though the doctor but we
want to convey the fact that we don't
have intimate personal knowledge of that
fact we say things like Bill's a doctor
they say or apparently bill is a doctor
in sasaki this kind of information is
conveyed by the choice of the form of
the verb that you use in the sentence
and so when you want to convey that your
source of information is indirect and
you don't know about it personally you
didn't see it and you use the perfect
form of the verb and instead of the hon
market past for that psyche has some
sounds that English doesn't have and
vice-versa there sounds in English that
don't appear in sasaki and of course
there are other differences in the
syntax for example donkey has case
endings and we don't in English so it
doesn't have articles it has has the
verb following both the subject and
object what is curious to me is that
sometimes you can have things after the
verb but not always and I still haven't
figured out what well you can't have it
when you can the tense of the sentence
has an effect on the forms of the nouns
which is an
usual it's not something you find in
English I would say is katana I guess
right so you change that from the
subject of the sentence changes its case
depending on the tense of the sentence
in what way as the discovery of these
phenomena enriched your ability to do
fieldwork with a native speaker so this
look is about how to do field work not
only in foreign countries but working
with native speakers of languages that
we don't know like we've been doing with
the NGO Jim often linguist just work
from books and grammars or they work on
languages that they know or someone they
know know languages that are easily
accessible so we had to learn how to do
things a little bit differently to work
with languages that aren't already
described yes I think that a number of
the students are interested in caring
for their research one semester is very
difficult to get anything conclusive
done we're just getting familiar with
the the nature of the language and what
some interesting problems are but we
need more time to to investigate them
further one of the frustrating things
about this course is that we spend a
semester working on the language which
is just about enough time to see how
interesting it is and then the course
Thompson so I want to continue to
explore some of the things that I've
learned in the course of this class the
field is in a very lively state there's
for one thing rather sophisticated work
is underway on a very wide variety of
typologically different languages far
more so than say 20 or 30 years ago and
that in itself is an exciting
development because you get that's just
like biologists being able to study all
sorts of new species of course you're
going to learn all sorts of things
challenges preconceptions leads to new
ideas and so on there's quite exciting
new work going on in domains that were
not very intensively studied until
recently like certain areas of cymatics
and for example which was is fairly
recent development my own particular
interests happened to be
the attempt to try to determine to what
extent the human language faculty is
actually perfectly designed
I mean well-designed to meet certain
specific conditions that human language
must meet I think there's been an
exciting work in that area which raises
some interesting questions and
challenges to biology generally so by
and large it's a exciting period
especially last 20 or 30 years pretty
remarkable
what can a population do to maintain
their language despite the presence of a
more dominant language no simple answer
that you just have to do it and it has
been done that place is like some of
those I mentioned like for example in
Catalonia under the Franco dictatorship
the language really was suppressed in
the Kurdish areas people have maintained
the Kurdish under tremendous repression
a lot of young people may not know it
because they haven't allowed to study it
and you only talk it it's the language
your parents talk at home maybe but not
yours and that has to be revived there's
really no answer to that it's what
people are willing to do since we find
it you know the best linguistic weren't
very often gets done by people who speak
the language themselves because they
they know they can always ask themselves
well how would that say it or does this
sound right this is sent off and so
forth so
in addition to what we've already done
this kind of fieldwork what I think
we're very interested in having zazen
people themselves become linguists and
do linguistic work on their own language
you da man get Shinar you know come on
