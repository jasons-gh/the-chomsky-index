all right she here Moss tree here we are
on the road for climate action today I'm
really excited about our interview we're
here with world renowned political
dissident author and linguist Noam
Chomsky Noam Chomsky is an emeritus
professor at MIT but he's also more
recently a laureate professor here at
the Department of linguistics at the
University of Arizona where we were so
excited to join him with that being said
it's really a privilege to be with you
today professor Bell to be with you
so what we're doing over the last two
months is really trying to do climate
outreach and awareness across the
country but also hear from experts
people in the field and others who are
very well acquainted with the impacts of
climate change and the severity of the
climate crisis I wanted to ask you
you've had a long history of being
outspoken about war and atrocities
across the world really speaking on
behalf of you know protecting humanity
both domestically but importantly abroad
and one of the questions I would wanted
to ask you is where does the issue of
climate change in your view rank among
all the issues that we sort of think
about war nuclear proliferation and now
increasing the climate change how do you
rank climate change as a global threat
well nuclear war has been a dark shadow
looming over human life for over 70
years the roads the threat has also
lated now it's increasing again as I'm
sure you know the full Atomic Scientists
which says it's Doomsday Clock every
just after a year of Trump's
administration moved the clock to the
minute hand to two minutes to midnight
it's the closest it's been two terminal
disaster since since it was said in fact
there was one prior time in 1953 when
United States Soviet Union exploded
thermonuclear weapons it also went to
two minutes to midnight now it's moved
closer it's partly the increasing
nuclear threat partly the dire threat of
climate catastrophe and where both
threats are increasing on the nuclear
issue the Trump administration
presumably under Jonathan Baldwin's
pressure has announced that it will very
possibly very likely pull out of the INF
treaty which just opens the door to
countries to produce very dangerous and
short-range missiles which reduce
warning time enormous Lee and hence
escalate the severe threat of just
accidental nuclear war which has come
very close many times in the past effect
if you look at the record it's an
absolute miracle but we survived
so that threats increasing the threat of
the climate issue is something that is
almost indescribable I mean I don't
think there's anything like this in
human history there aren't words to
describe what's happening the leadership
understands perfectly well not just the
political leadership of CEOs of the
major banks of the energy corporations
they know perfectly well that they are
heading towards disaster and they are
Aeschylus
the threat what's happening that you
sometimes it's you really can't find
words words like for example a couple of
weeks ago with one of the most
astonishing documents and literally in
human history are appearances from a
bureaucracy may be an honor of CAF
killer or something like this the
department's transportation of the Trump
administration that came out with a
detailed document concerning the
regulation of emissions and mileage
conditions and so on
I think included there should be no
regulations of order and they had a
logical argument the argument is were
going over the cliff anyway and this
doesn't really add much to it so one
when they said by the end of the century
if you extrapolate this temperature will
have risen three or four degrees
centigrade sea level I've got skyrockets
so what's the difference of course they
were assuming that everyone is as
criminally insane as we are that is that
no one's going to do anything that's the
basic assumption this barely got
mentioned but it's everywhere and pick
up the current issue of the major
Business Journal Bloomberg Businessweek
very serious journal issue talking about
the wonders of increased fracking it's
the Permian field and Texas New Mexico a
huge amount of fossil fuel they I can
get to it it's great United States is
surpassing Saudi Arabia is going out
wonderful if they understand perfectly
well what this means not a word
go to the big banks JP Morgan Chase and
CEO Jamie Dimon smart perfectly on will
understand see sure he knows about the
IPCC report
everything they're increasing
investments in fossil fuels if you look
at the record of Exxon Mobil it's really
an astonishing I'm sure you know this
but the ExxonMobil scientists were at
the lead and spearheading our government
a threat sphere threat of global
warming's back in the sixties and
seventies when nobody was talking about
it but when James Hansen made his famous
revelation in 1988 about the severe
dangers that ExxonMobil changed their
policies towards funding skepticism
about climate change
not straight denialism written up crazy
enough to say it's not happening but
they say well you know no you know
there's this uncertainty that
uncertainty so as soon as they got the
indication that it's going to become a
public issue they immediately tried to
ensure that you could increase the
danger and it goes I would take say
Trump himself he talks about how its of
books and he just applied to the
government of Ireland for permission to
build a wall to protect the Golf Course
from rising sea levels appealing to
climate change so what you have is an
intellectual communities includes
journals businesspeople political
figures who understand perfectly well
that they're racing to disaster and are
saying Melissa let's accelerated in the
name of profit presumably and only a
short-term profit that Republicans key
word short-term right you've previously
spoken of the Trump administration and
actually about Trump himself being sort
of a distraction with all this sort of
extreme things he says taking up a lot
of media space I'm wondering what are
some of the things that are taking place
behind the scenes legislatively that are
most concerning as it relates to the
environment and climate change in
particular
the most important that rum it's not
deeply hidden behind the scenes is just
the dismantling of any effort to even
address the question like in the you
know the Environmental Protection Agency
other agencies you don't allowed to
mention the word climate change and any
move towards regulation is being dropped
and meanwhile policies are being
instituted to maximize the threat like
calling for opening the doors to ocean
exploration of the Atlantic rate when
we're in our apartment even apart from
climate change justement we're getting
new evidence about the disasters
terrible disasters and the Gulf of
Mexico which were unknown until recently
a huge debt response and so on but point
by point that's what's happened and on
every other front as well I mean well
Trump is performing his antics in front
of the media
the real of Evil Geniuses Paul Ryan and
Mitch McConnell are driving through
legislation which is devastating to much
of the population and beneficial to
their real constituency super rich with
the corporations and the most extreme
example is what they're most proud of
the tax bill every way to the ridge that
had the extra benefit of creating a huge
deficit so they both pointed out right
away will we've got this big deficit we
have to cut back welfare spending you
couldn't be more Franken okay
but somehow trumped as a kind of the
maestro is able to keep all of this
under control the wall and even keep his
adoring crowds loving him while it is
shafting them in every possible way it's
a pretty amazing trick that in fact the
effect on public opinion is pretty
shocking so if you think your public and
party recent polls on climene's show
that about half of Republicans deny that
global warming is taking place of the
the other half a bare majority say that
humans might be responsible for some of
them oh man this is hey again
indescribable if we're trying to get you
know a hold of this issue you know in
terms of reducing greenhouse gas
emissions and getting some serious
Poly's policies the costs are on the
table there's different groups
advocating for different things you hear
about you know putting a price on carbon
federally or at the state level but then
we also hear about Community Choice
energy on the more local level one of
the things that concern me with sort of
a lot of different pursuits by different
groups is that perhaps the concerned
climate community could get too
fractionated doing a bunch of different
things and maybe get nothing done and
I'm wondering what your thoughts are on
that and if you think that there is sort
of an umbrella that climate advocates
are you know climate groups can get
behind sort of one theme or one one
policy measure to take to Washington
what what that would be I think I think
all of these measures should be pressed
there should be a carbon tax there
should be a substantial move to develop
and
and install renewable energy everything
from LED lights to solar panels to
inform others and that we should be
beginning to think about the
carbonization and and just and we have
to recognize that you've got to
terminate the use of fossil fuels that
just hasn't done the rimless remove some
subsidies perhaps for fossil fuel in
this original we have huge subsidies
hundreds of billions of dollars a year
and what role do you think nuclear power
has in this transition away from fossil
fuels to a decarbonized future well
that's a difficult question I mean
that's just you know the people who are
really dedicated to this issue just
differ on them and I think it should be
a last resort there are plenty of other
alternatives pick the low-hanging fruit
take the low-hanging fruit wind solar
things like that all of these things can
develop very effectively and I mean just
traveled around where we are now and
Arizona the sun is shining all the time
take a look and see how many solar
panels you see I didn't notice any in
New Mexico on the way here very few and
this should be everywhere
I mean places like Arizona and
controlling power as the country just
from the amount of Sun short I mean and
there are no incentives to do it and
there are cultural barriers people just
as I say if half of the Republican Party
says it's not happening you know gets
older right right
there's a real educational cultural
program what do you say to those who say
I it's too late for climate change it's
no first of all it's not true but if
that's what you think just say goodbye
to your friends do you have any advice
for people like myself who are dedicated
or are willing to dedicate their career
to try to wrestle with this
I just took a year sabbatical so did
Athena do to do climate outreach climate
advocacy we're just getting started with
this three-month road tour but do you
have any advice for people such as
myself where can we be most effective in
trying to address this problem I think
the best advice is to keep doing what
you're doing it's gotta be done we have
to reach lots of people and weekly from
all at all levels the general population
and somehow get the elites to recognize
the monstrous crime that they're
carrying out of the idea that a person
can know that we're heading towards
disaster and say let's accelerate it so
I can put more dollars in my pocket is
simply unspeakable we have to get to the
point where this is a big headline in
the newspapers every morning right I
totally agree professor Chomsky it was
really a privilege I thank you for being
with me today so this is a book I just
was just published sure this is my
yellow two months ago it's hot off the
press that's beyond debate answers the
50 most consensus on climate change let
me give you very much very welcome
you
