action from the destruction and so on
that's that's the other way and by 1986
about eighty percent of those who are
identified as leaders in the polls that
means elites basically you know managers
executives the political figures those
guys but eighty percent of them were
opposed to the Contras they thought that
the terror option pursued by the Reagan
administration was just stupid stupid
for a number of reasons one is it was
stirring up protest at home you know
overt violence does have a way of
stirring up protest among these unwashed
masses who don't like you know murdering
children and you know raping women and
cutting people's heads off and so on
there's all these unreconstructed people
and they get annoyed by that kind of
stuff so you stir up disruption at home
when you have when you direct your
terrorist army to attack defenseless
target soft targets as they were called
as the US terrorists we're doing at that
time openly in fact it wasn't a secret
so that stirs up too much protest so it
dumb also it makes the United States
look bad internationally I'm in the
United States there's no verte violation
of the World Court decision and you know
it doesn't look good in our
international relations and so on and
finally it's kind of useless I mean
there are much better ways to strangle
and destroy a tiny country which for all
kinds of obvious historical reasons is
totally dependent on its relations with
the United States for survival you can
just do it in smarter quieter ways that
was the major you know that was the
dominant position among elite by already
by 1986 now the Reagan administration is
not off the spectrum of American opinion
but is it an extreme it's an extreme
position on the spectrum it's extremely
the people around Reagan were people who
were deeply committed to violence for
its own sake I mean it's as if you kind
of like torture in itself rather than
using it as an end for some you know as
a tool for some other purpose well
that's kind of counterproductive and
rational people don't do that you use
torture when you need it but it's not an
end in it
there's no gain in itself to torture
inflicting pain and terror and so on and
their conclusion sort of a rational
conclusion was it's just not useful it's
bad it's stirring up protest and so on
and so forth so the more rational thing
to do is the policy that the Bush
administration is now turning to I think
that policy is here's what it looks like
to me maintain the economic
strangulation which incidentally is also
unlawful I mean we talked about the we
should talk about the World Court having
condemned the Contras attacked it also
condemned the economic warfare as
illegal illegal violation of treaties
again this is never recorded but that
was the World Court decision the
violation of treaties involved the
embargo is unlawful it's also a criminal
act and the World Court demanded be
terminated but the point is you can
assume that nobody's going to talk about
that so you continue the strangulation
keep the Contras keep the canoe it's
interesting that the United States was
with all the huge amount of resources
that were poured into maintaining a
mercenary force inside Nicaragua they
were unable to do it that's a pretty
remarkable fact there is no guerrilla
movement in history that had a fraction
of the support that the Contras had I
it's just unimaginable I mean they were
they were getting three supply flights a
day just to keep them going they were
armed at a level you know they were
better on than the sandanista army they
were better armed than units of the
American army in fact that's actually
true they had advanced communication
equipment in the field which allowed
them to get information from us
surveillance flights it's always under
surveillance the country but you know
high-tech aircraft which could give them
information on the actual disposition of
the sandanista forces so that they could
attack defenseless targets with impunity
and carry out terror there in accordance
with them with the orders of the State
Department it's not secret incidentally
now you know that kind of level of
support is just no guerrilla army in
history that could dream of anything
like that with all of that stuff they
couldn't keep them in the field the
minute the level of support began to
drop they all broke for the border the
contrast el salvador's fantastic if you
bother to look at it you know I'll solve
it or you had an indigenous guerrilla
worse no support from outside as far as
anybody knows they were their arms were
mostly gotten from the Salvadoran army
or purchased internationally so they're
using American arms like you know
they're using m16 it slightly just a
side remark for the first time now the
guerrillas in El Salvador are apparently
being aided by Nicaraguans so Elliot
Abrams can finally be happy what's
happening is that as the Contras broke
for the border and went across because
you know the game was over they figured
they began to sell their arms to corrupt
Honduran army officials who were selling
them off to the Salvadoran guerillas so
for the first time the Salvadoran
guerillas are beginning to show up with
Soviet arms ak-47s and so on and so
forth and the reason is that those are
the arms of the CIA supplied to the
Contras yeah so instead of having just
m16s like they used to have you know
American arms they got from the solid or
an army they now got Soviet arms sent to
them by sent by the CIA to the Contras
and now sold off to the Hondurans are
selling them off to salvador and
gorillas so there is finally aid from
Nicaragua El Salvador like they've been
claiming all along instantly this here's
another side remarks I'm sorry but this
information comes from a very good
source so good in fact that the press
totally censored it this information
comes from the head of
counterintelligence who defected in
Honduras went to Mexico was widely
interviewed in the Mexican press his
name is horacio RC like most of the
Contras he has a nom de guerre you know
soon him his pseudonym was mercenary
mercenary oh you know they don't kid
around when they're coming for the
American press do they know who they are
he was the chief of contra intelligence
he was the guy who became chief of
intelligence in 1985 replacing a man
named ricardo lau who was beginning to
be an embarrassment because it was
beginning to be pretty obvious that he
was involved in terrorist activities
throughout Central America including
probably the murder of Archbishop Romero
who's identified by a
a chief of salvadoran intelligence and
defected as having been involved in that
this guy was getting to be an
embarrassment so he disappeared he was
probably killed and they needed a new
chief of intelligence and this guy came
in well he's been chief of intelligence
since 1985 he defected last November
it's the most important defector yet far
more important than you know the
defectors get huge publicity when they
come from Nicaragua with all kind of
fabricated story this guy was ignored he
had totally the wrong stories you know
he was telling about how they were
advised you know they were directed he
told for example about how he was
trained illegally in elgin Air Force
Base some Florida or someplace like that
we was flown in illegally of course
trained in the United States by you know
Green Berets and 82nd airborne and so on
and so forth he talked about he
identified people in the American
Embassy by name in Honduras who were
posing as a deficiency ia and were you
know giving tactical advice and support
to the Contras he mentioned their names
he described the way the Honduran Army
the Honduran military is directly
involved in contra military activities
in Nicaragua both by intelligence and
participation and so on he went through
all he described how they were how their
task was to attack defenseless targets
for the purpose of ensuring that
Nicaragua cannot carry out social reform
describes this and all sorts of stuff
which is just useless and he also
describes what i just said how the
Contras is now that they've broken for
the borders are selling their arms to
the Salvadoran guerillas well you know
all of this stuff is news and in fact
important news in fact so and from a
very good source so important that as
far as I know there's no word about it
in the American press you might look in
check and see well that was kind of a
digression so the Salvadoran coming back
the Salvadoran guerillas had no support
from outside as far as anybody knows
they're indigenous to the country
they're facing a military force which on
paper at least is the most powerful in
the region much more powerful on paper
than the army of Nicaragua and they're
somehow any radical in contrast the
Contras
who involved all sorts of mercenaries
including Nicaraguans Hondurans who are
bribed Honduran peasants are bribed with
with big bribes by their standards like
five hundred dollars that's a couple of
years income to join all sorts of things
huge amount of support you know a
tremendously high level of military
equipment and so on they just can't keep
him in the country I mean I think he
could keep a guerrilla force in the
United States with that kind of support
I'm not kidding I think you could
probably maintain a gorilla forest in
the mountains of Kentucky with the kind
of course that was that with this sport
that was given to the countries they
couldn't keep them there there's a
lesson in all of this there's an obvious
lesson in this comparison so obvious
that nobody in the press is ever going
to draw it because it's the wrong lesson
you can figure it out so I won't draw it
well alright so what is the back to the
bush administration plans I assume that
they can maintain a low level terrorist
course inside Nicaragua it's
inconceivable that they can't do that so
probably they'll keep you know that
that's why I think it's one of the
reasons I think those reports about the
illegal contracts from El Salvador
