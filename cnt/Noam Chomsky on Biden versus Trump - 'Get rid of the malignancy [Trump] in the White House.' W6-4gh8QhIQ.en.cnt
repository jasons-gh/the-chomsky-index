thirty-eight years ago a massive rally
against nuclear weapons took place in
Manhattan the New York Times reported on
June 13 1982 that hundreds of thousands
of peaceful demonstrators opposed to
nuclear arms overwhelmed Central Park in
midtown Manhattan yesterday filling the
streets and grows with echoing songs and
hopeful slogans the demonstration was
far larger than any during the anti-war
movement of the late 1960s and early 70s
and was possibly the largest ever in the
city the organizers said it was the
biggest disarmament gathering in the
nation's history late in the afternoon a
Police Department spokesman said there
might be as many as 600 or 700 thousand
people around the park many of the
dozens of speakers during the day urged
the participants to continue the
movement when they returned to their
homes quote we shall not suffer silently
the threat of nuclear holocaust said
City Council President Carol Bellamy who
addressed the crowd near the United
Nations that was a report from the New
York Times from June 13 1982 other
reports said there might have been a
million people at the March
[Music]
why highlight this March now during a
pandemic that is killing tens of
thousands of people around the world
because the anti-scientific pandemic
denial that exacerbated the current
situation the anti-scientific climate
change denial that threatens human
civilization is also at work with the
denial of the threat of nuclear war that
will likely end most life on Earth
the 1982 March is an example of the kind
of popular movement that is required now
but more so we need a conscious movement
that on a broad national scale demands
urgent action and defense of the
unemployed and for economic and racial
justice for immediate and profound
action on climate change and concrete
moves towards the reduction and eventual
elimination of nuclear weapons we may
not be able to March for a while but
online and later in the streets and at
the ballot box such a popular movement
will decide if we humans survive now
joining me to analyze this most
existential moment his Noam Chomsky his
latest book is internationalism or
extinction delighted to be with you
so in in the early eighties there is a
massive movement focused on the issue of
threat threat of nuclear war that's your
dog in the background I guess is it yeah
yeah well that's okay and you can join
the conversation threat of nuclear war
which you know in a sense in the short
term it's the biggest threat it's not
even being talked about how do you
explain how we go from massive protests
in the in the 80s on this to not even be
not even part of the discourse we should
first of all remember that that those
huge demonstrations had an effect a
significant effect one effect was that
they're part important part of the
background for the 1987 Reagan Gorbachev
agreement to establish the
and if treaty which sharply reduced the
number of the threat of war in Europe
this short-term missiles were
short-range missiles were banned which
were extremely dangerous
that gave us a kind of a respite of from
very likely terminal nuclear war and of
course as you know this was just
dismantled by President Trump in last
August who funded loads of the world and
a still more spectacular way by
immediately launching missiles which
violated the treaty essentially inviting
others please create missiles to destroy
us and give a big shot in the arm to the
military industry which of course loves
it well there wasn't but you're right
this severely declined and no matter how
hard you try to bring it up I do you do
others do it just doesn't make a dent
somehow it's for people that just
somehow feels too remote they have
immediate problems how am I going to
come in a half the population in the
United States is living essentially from
paycheck to paycheck
they don't have couple hundred a couple
hundred dollars to spare if anything
goes wrong this is one of the triumphs
of the neoliberal period assault on the
population that Reagan inaugurated these
people just don't have time to think
about anything else you remember in the
yellow vest
uprising in France a couple of months
ago people are saying that one of the
slogan was you're worrying about the end
of the world we are rendering worrying
about the end of the month
I mean if people
really in serious trouble they just
can't think anymore that doesn't answer
the question why privileged elite who
are getting by fine and some of them are
robbing the bank like gangsters why they
don't think about it and that's been
very troubling not just you and me but
too many others a couple of years ago
William Perry who former defense
secretary long many years is involvement
in trying to deal with the nuclear war
issues in the government out of it he
commented he's now doubly terrified
terrified by the growing threat which is
very severe and terrified because he
can't seem to get anyone to pay
attention to it well that's very serious
we have a president who is dedicated to
destroying the last vestiges of arm
control arms control INF treaty went
down the tube last August of the Open
Skies treaty initiated by Eisenhower is
on the chopping block the most crucial
one the New START treaty which limits
the number of missiles for the United
States and Russia actually for everyone
but they're the only ones that matter
that call me even near the threshold
this is coming up for signing in early
and about a year early 2021 the Russians
have been pleading to negotiate for an
extension of the trough administration
refuses to talk about it which
presumably means they're going to kill
it
he's reelected that ends it then there's
no arms control structure any longer if
you look at the record over the past
seventy years seventy five years it's
it's kind of it's just a miracle that we
survived
we've come very close to terminal
nuclear war over and over
threats growing the arms control system
that has reduced the threat has been is
being dismantled by our government which
seems to be bent on killing as many
people as it can latest step was
defunding the World Health Organization
which will have exactly that effect they
don't care and the population just seems
resistant to seeing what's before their
eyes
[Music]

[Music]
people that are condemning Trump for
pandemic and climate crisis denial what
about the denial of the threat of
nuclear war it seems to be them the
majority of the intelligentsia even the
progressive intelligentsia do not say a
word about it and then you get to
someone like Barack Obama who early on
in his presidency talked about the
elimination of nuclear weapons in fact
some people think that's part of the
reason he got a Nobel Peace Prize early
practically before he'd done anything
but then he's the one that signs off on
a budget for a trillion dollar
investment in nuclear weapons no that's
part of his general posture was to
whether to pretend or to claim I don't
read his mind that somehow he was making
he was accommodating with the political
opposition and they would forge a joint
policy of course they were just laughing
on him all the way Mitch McConnell
hadn't made it was very explicit soon as
Obama was going to be a liquid elected
that his task as Senate Majority Leader
was to block anything that Obama tried
to do then he succeeded in that quick
will but Obama went along with the
either pretense or claim I don't know
and what you just described as part of
it the excuse of the administration was
that this was the only way they could
get compromises on other things which is
of course perfect nonsense fulfill any
of the rhetorical claims that brought
him into power he didn't do the worst
things but he certainly didn't do the
things he could have done in Kaplan's
book on the nuclear war threat he says
that Biden opposed that investment and
modernization of the American nuclear
arms arsenal
didn't believe that it was necessary or
that the Republicans would hold up any
end of any deals that were made what
expectations do you have for the what
might be the Biden presidency it's very
hard to say he seems to have pretty much
faded into the background he doesn't say
much what he does say is pretty tepid my
impression is that in a Biden presidency
the decisions would be made by the
people around him and he would be very
much of an empty shell probably at least
I would hope susceptible to popular
pressures there's no doubt whatsoever
that he would be immensely better than
the megalomaniac sociopath is sitting in
the White House now but you could say
that about the nearest lamppost to be
threatened by one of the worst
characters in political history and the
highest priorities to get rid of him or
were probably a little toast Wyden I
suspect it would obviously be a greater
improvement a great improvement but
whether what he would do I think what
depends very largely on the leave force
of popular movements Bernie Sanders in
his withdrawal speech made a very
important point which he emphasized that
it should be repeatedly emphasized he
said this campaign is ending but the
movement must continue an electoral
campaign is just one moment in an
ongoing process we're kind of trained to
believe that it's the the end will you
just show up once every four years and
then you go home that's a great way of
inducing for
arianism and passivity but it's not the
case what happens on the quadrennial
extravaganza is you take off a little
time push a lever then go back to work
on the hard important things the kind of
activism and pressures that you
described at the beginning that reported
the background for the important nuclear
deal or the kind that have recently
moved the green new deal which something
like that is essential for survival
moved it from way out in the margins to
the center of the legislative agenda and
many other cases that has to continue
constantly if it doesn't there are there
is a group in the society the business
world which is constantly relentlessly
fighting a bitter class war doing it
right now
they're preparing for the future right
now
you know the propaganda line is we can't
pay attention to the climate crisis
because the pandemic is much worse the
rich and powerful aren't listening to
that they're taking every opportunity
they have to maximize the climate crisis
that's why the EPA before our eyes is
canceling the regulations to increase
profit and deaths and lead to and
intensify the climate crisis that's why
President Trump in his quite astonishing
budget proposal in February
I'm sure you've looked at that but it
really should be highlight it's mid
February the epidemic already pandemic
is raging of course Trump is denying now
he claims it's the WHI was full but it
was he was denying and see that clearly
right in the middle of this he comes out
with his budget what does it call for
increased defunding of the Center for
the
is control and other health related
parts of the government he'd been
defunding it since he got into office
new budget in the middle of the pandemic
is defunded further but it didn't they
fund everything for some things he
called for an increase in funding
including subsidies to the fossil fuel
industry I mean these guys are really
relentless they never stop and if we let
them go on without opposition the win
that will all suffer badly in fact human
survival is at stake you said earlier
that you don't quite understand why the
elites don't get this
whether it's pandemic whether its
climate or nuclear these are threats to
their own system and they don't seem
there doesn't seem to be a force within
capital within the elites that would
rise the way if an FDR did in the 30s
that has even in the defense of
capitalism has a far more farsighted
more rational approach then the narrow
short frame of the pursuit of profit
it's going to destroy their own system
and don't they know that sure when the
main at stake JPMorgan Chase America's
biggest bank Jamie Dimon knows
everything relevant the CEO knows
everything relevant about climate change
in nuclear war but he has a job maximize
profits tomorrow okay that's what his
huge salary depends on his bonuses as
what as shareholder wants its what the
ideology is remember that there was a
time it's called regimented capitalism
basically from Roseville pretty much up
to Reagan in which there actually were
serious efforts on the part of the
government and even on the part of some
corporations to pay some attention to
the long term
future that changed sharply when the
shifted neoliberalism began the doctrine
I'm in announced by people like Milton
Friedman but of course they're not the
ones who pushed it through pushed
through by a corporate power and others
with the free denies Hayek style
ideology which says that your only goal
as a corporate manager is greed try to
make as much money for yourself and your
shareholders all very wealthy if you pay
attention to anything else you're
undermining the foundations of
civilization and this wasn't just don't
pay attention to climate change in
nuclear war Reagan did some things that
are really right on me in the headlines
right now but they've been going on for
years like there's a lot of justified
protest now about the stimulus bill
which gives don't know the exact money I
think it's 50 billion dollars to the
airline industry which has spent the
last ten years in an orgy of buybacks to
raise stock prices and interfere with
the market and benefits management that
the approximately the amount that's
being given to them in the stimulus why
are they allowed to rob the public like
this
not even stock buybacks but with putting
their money in an office in Bermuda and
coiling it and using tax haven and so on
that's not small change that's tens of
trillions of dollars of robbery we can
thank Ronald Reagan and Milton Friedman
and all the rest up until the Reagan
administration all of that was illegal
flatly illegal and it was enforced the
Treasury Department enforced it and it
wasn't happening Reagan's under the
neoliberal doctrines appealing to
Friedman in the
the idea was you recall government is
the problem not the solution so get rid
of government put all decisions in the
hands of unaccountable private tyrannies
whose purpose as purpose by by in
principle is to maximize profit market
share for themselves to pay attention to
nothing else so open the door to stock
buybacks to tax havens any other means
you can think of to rob the public that
don't pay attention to anything that's
happening a year down the road if you
can maximize profit tomorrow all of this
follows it's had a devastating effect
that's one of the reasons why half the
population is living from paycheck to
paycheck I don't have to tell you that
wealth has enormous ly concentrated and
for the general population it's been
stagnation GDP increases productivity
increases but the population stagnates
it's part of the background for the
anger resentment bitterness that's
spreading not just over the United
States but over much of the world
[Music]
and the webcam the Biden kid with
Sanders Biden says he wants his
presidency to be the most progressive
since Roosevelt what do you think are
the possibilities conditions for that
and clearly that doesn't happen without
a mass movement on a scale perhaps more
than there was in the 1960s what's been
holding back that kind of mass woman
well first of all I think it is taking
place that we should recognize that a
lot of things have happened
much of it under the within the
framework of Bernie Sanders is
inspiration he achieved enormous
successes he just shifted the agenda of
discourse and policy well to the left
things that are right in the center of
attention now you couldn't even talk of
a couple years ago so let's take again
say the green New Deal very significant
in one form or another it's absolutely
essential for survival couple of years
ago was either ridiculed or ignored now
it's is the center of the agenda the
Republicans of course want to kill it
business wants to kill it but it's alive
and well why well we know why there was
a lot of dedicated activism finally led
to the point where the sunrise movement
activists started even sitting in in
congressional offices they were
supported by some of the young
representatives elected 2018 again with
a lot of pressure from the Sanders
movement especially a Alexandria
LoCascio Cortes welcomed them supported
them Ed Markey senator from
Massachusetts who's been interested in
this issue joined moved to the
legislative agenda we have to recall
again Sanders's words this particular
campaign may be terminated but the
movement must go on brought together
things that already existed like black
lives matter occupy the environmental
movements the ones who carried out that
great campaign strike protests the
climate protest last October shutting
down it was in large parts of the world
not on here to extinction rebellion all
of these things are there they kind of
coalesced more or less under the
framework of the Sanders inspired
movements and they have to go on so they
go on they can make a big difference you
mentioned earlier about concentration of
ownership and I think we're in a new
stage new phase of concentration of
ownership were these massive asset
manager financial institutions Blackrock
Vanguard to some slightly lesser extent
State Street according to Bloomberg the
three of them have 14 trillion dollars
under management they vote those shares
which gives the three of them
essentially control of about 90 percent
of the S&P 500 Bloomberg News is
projecting that by 2030 they will have
20 trillion dollars under management two
or three companies essentially
controlling most of the corporate world
not just of the United States the
counter to that if you if you go back to
Biden's claim wanting to be the most
progressive government since Roosevelt
you go back to what Roosevelt said about
that kind of concentration of ownership
he said if there's monopolization in a
sector that's critical to the society
then you have to turn these things into
public utilities either highly regulated
private or if you can't do that public
ownership is it not time to start having
this kind of conversation because I have
to say even in the Sanders campaign
there's very very little of that and and
the sector that needs to be regulated as
a public utility and/or serious public
ownership of at least portion of it
would be financed
because Blackrock and bank guard don't
just own banking they own the nuclear
arms industry if you look at the 18
companies that make nuclear arms the
majority shareholders I should say the
in terms of voting shares our Blackrock
Vanguard and State Street again of
course they own just about everything
else as well
so what I'm I'm asking shouldn't we
start having this conversation about
public ownership alongside one of
democratization oh absolutely we should
also take a little look back at history
take a look at pre Reagan history the
period what's called regimented
capitalism basically from Roseville up
up through the 70s beginning to erode in
the seventies just giving a body blow by
Reagan one of the first things he had to
do was bail out a major bank his term
ended with the the massive real estate
collapse goes on and on through Clinton
and on through the this millennium and
now we're right in the middle of another
one the same corporations that have been
on a feeding frenzy of stock buybacks
raising increasing wealth and management
profits are now back to the nanny state
leading to be bailed out and
interestingly being bailed out as we
learned today with Treasury notes signed
by Donald Trump as part of his election
campaign what we see here is a
confluence of a number of factors one is
the inherently destructive character of
capitalism it's a suicidal institution
now that can be controlled the
regimented capital
through the 50s and 60s that did pretty
well controlled it then comes the second
thing the neoliberal assault which
eliminates the possibility of
controlling the monster then on top of
that you get a megalomaniac sociopath
holding power surrounded by sycophants a
head of a political party which is too
cowardly and has lost even the slightest
element of integrity so though all they
can do is lick his boots now you have a
huge echo chamber foxnews that trump
says two plus two equals five but an
hour later Sean Hannity says that's the
greatest discovery in the history of the
human race then Trump turns to the Fox
on friends the next morning repeats what
he said there in this structure that's
developed is a kind of a Hydra that's
destroying us for many directions
bombers are essentially doing nothing
except helping take say their dedication
of all their efforts of an impeachment
trial it was transparent at the
beginning that this was going to end up
in a victory for Trump it was almost
impossible for anything else to happen
the issue that was raised didn't mean
much to most of the population why
should it so the president who's a
certified gangster we all know that it
was putting pressure on some other
country to harm a leading figure in the
Democratic Party okay
probably impeachable technically but
nobody cares and I was going to end up
with with the Senate which is in Trump's
pocket anyway blocking the impeachment
so a great victory the Tribune of the
people was saved from the attack by the
deep state trying to destroy
little cheer I mean that's what they're
devoting their attention to not his
climate policies which are murderers
will literally lead to the end of
organized human life not his opening the
doors to nuclear destruction and not
even has steps to destroy democracy
which are pretty astonishing know you'll
worry about that he pressures from
country that nobody ever heard of two
armed Joseph okay as if they're working
for a case after case this the only way
out of this is essentially Sanders is
advise the movement has to keep going
the immediate necessity is to get rid of
the malignancy in the White House we
don't do that nothing else is gonna
matter
don't you think that the idea of
regulated capitalism which is more or
less what Warren is proposing going back
to Bernie - really hasn't that horse
left the barn this turned towards
neoliberalism wasn't because they won an
ideological argument I don't think I
think the digital revolution
computerization it created the ability
to have globalization on such a
different scale to play the workers of
China off against the workers of Europe
and America the idea of these fancy
derivative products and the enormous
expansion of Wall Street and speculation
you couldn't do that with a pencil and
paper the digital revolution at least
this enormous strength to this financial
sector and enormous new productivity and
profits going to this tiny 1% and the
political power that goes with that I
mean it's the pandemic now showing us
that one way or the other this society
is being moved towards some kind of form
of socialism and that does shouldn't we
start talking about that more than
honestly well as much as important as
Medicare for all is the concept of
Medicare for all you know a government
health insurance plan we have to look at
that in other sectors of the economy
otherwise I think we're doomed
first of all the digital revolution
could be used for this purpose could be
used to break the whole system down
right ends how you how you use it
technology doesn't care just as it's
just as a amenable to one uses another
now it's not just the minute there are
steps that can be taken right away
not just for to diminish or you can
eliminate the scale of the financial
institutions and break up the banks
a national bank all this is feasible but
what about the fossil fuel industry why
shouldn't that be simply bought up by
the government and basically moved to
put it out of business that's feasible
that add to that what would you ask
foreign policy be if if the government
bought up and made public Raytheon and
Boeing and Lockheed Martin take the
profit motive out of war well it depends
what kind of government you had and who
runs it it was the government gonna be
run by the same corporate leaders who
run it now or will it turn into a
democratic government there is a way for
that sounds kind of utopian but it is
possible for the United States to turn
into a democracy okay if it does then
socialization of major industries could
be a big step forward it's not the end I
stepped right behind beyond that already
to some limited extent taking place is
for not the government to own them but
for the stakeholders to own them the
working the workers in the enterprise
why don't they own them why don't they
run the enterprise not the state break
it up turn it over to the people who
work there that's quite significant so
let's take a real case suppose there's a
you know some manufacturing plant in
Gary Indiana and the idea comes up of
shifting it to Mexico or China or
Vietnam who should make that decision
should it be a bunch of bankers sitting
in New York and Chicago who only you
know who run the enterprise where should
it be the people there the workers in
the plant and the community who decide
what to do maybe in coordination with
working people in may
ago in China that's not impossible
either may remember that unions are all
called internationals know right now
that sounds empty it wasn't when it was
instituted these were going to be the
International working class the
capitalist system is suicidal we can't
get around that
question is going to be controlled and
open till roughly Reagan it was pretty
much controlled then it just blew out of
hands and you're getting the situation
you has no no my promise not to let this
go on too long so let me just ask you
one final question right and I also hope
we get to do this again sooner than
later well what what do you say to some
of the young people not only young
people that are being very critical of
Bernie Sanders right now for endorsing
Biden even some people that worked with
him quite closely are critiquing him
what do you say to them I say wait a
couple months and then start critiquing
him there is a crucial urgent problem
right ahead of us get rid of the
malignancy
in the White House if you want to do
that nothing else is going to matter and
we've been talking about climate a
global warming which Trump is of course
going to accelerate maybe best tipping
points nuclear war which he's
accelerating which me what may wave us
out but there's a lot of other things
going on the real evil genius of this
administration in many ways is Mitch
McConnell the White House may be a freak
show but Mitch McConnell is serious he
knows what he's doing I assume it very
effectively
he's packing the courts with young
mostly unqualified or limited
qualifications ultra-right young jurists
who are going to ensure
that for the next generation or so
whatever the public wants it'll be
killed in favor of the reactionary
ideologies that McConnell and those like
him typify another four years of Trump
that may be beyond the level to control
that means whatever you're gonna try to
do will be shot down okay
we're facing a real crisis in November
this election is without exaggeration
the most important in American or world
history if we don't don't get by that
we're in deep trouble suppose we get
supposed Wyden comes in okay then comes
the time to hold his feet to the fire
Sanders and popular pressures are
probably going to make the mildly
progressive Democratic Party program
make them keep to it make them go beyond
it by the kinds of public pressures that
you open our discussion by bringing out
that progress recently the green New
Deal proposals many other things keep
that happening follow Sanders is advice
to get by this election then turn to
keeping the movement going and growing
and expanding and becoming more militant
and effective that's the hope for the
future and can do all the things we're
talking about can break up the financial
institutions reduce them to being banks
again and take over the fossil fuel
industry socialize it move to put it out
of business it can socialize other
institutions put demands of working
people in communities all of this is
possible none of it's you know in fact
the whole system that exists now is
actually pretty fragile that doesn't
take much to dismantle it I'll give you
one last example let me go you may have
seen a memo was leaked recently from
JPMorgan Chase country's biggest bank
economists and the
put a memo directed to investors leaked
it's very interesting it points out that
if we that quoting the survival of
humanity is at risk
if we pursue our present course
including the lending policies of the
bank and then it says the bank is under
reputational pressure to cut back on
fossil fuel funding
what's reputational pressure that's the
peasants with pitchforks banging on the
doors the same kind of thing that was in
the background with Reagan signing the
INF treaty million other things these
are things we should remember the future
really is in the hands of energetic
engaged population if they take the
opportunity if they decide to sit it out
then we're in deep trouble
