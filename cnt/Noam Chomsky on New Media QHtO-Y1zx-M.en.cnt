rolling okay so yeah thanks for taking
time let me give you the coffee we would
like to talk about today is the role of
the local media the internet which
leaked in recent conflicts throughout
the world so they have a wide range of
uprising people against their government
in the recent month in the Arab world in
the European Union in Spain and Greece
medicine Wisconsin and some coming to
claim that rickielee
played a crucial role for example in the
Arab uprisings stealing the protest from
because of a leak that claims that Arab
dictators support an attack on Iran do
you agree with this assessment that that
will explain a crucial role in this in
this and you see something new in these
conflicts in regards of of new media and
internet the internet and the new
Twitter Facebook those things they
certainly play a role they've turned out
to be very convenient that
communications technique but you say the
same that universities
so
wait till he goes by for example my
daughter not me I'm not part of this
world but my daughter teaches in the
university and the way she communicates
with their students tell them it was a
new class assignment or something is to
Facebook well ok before that you might
have put up a poster on her door so it's
a slight facilitating effect but the
essence is there and it's convenient the
younger people uses that felt that had
much of an impact in the case of
WikiLeaks and I don't think the that
what you refer to the leak that the Arab
dictators support west on Iran I doubt
that's very interesting actually but I
don't think it any effect on the
protesters what's interesting about it
is the way the West reacted to it of all
the WikiLeaks exposures that's the one
that got the big headlines the excitment
columnist syn the Financial Times and
the American press have just exalted
that this is so magnificent shows the
Arab states support us they were even
making jokes about how the whole thing
must have been organized by the CIA and
so on that's extremely interesting
because it's true that they released
information saying that the dictators
support us they have yet to publish the
fact that in the Arab world about 10% of
the population think of Iran as a threat
in fact like in Egypt eighty percent
think the region would be more secure if
Iran had nuclear weapons
not just uranium enrichment but it what
it tells us is something about the elite
contempt for democracy if 80% of the
population thinks here and should have
nuclear weapons to fend off the United
States which is their main enemy if
that's the way the population thinks it
makes no difference at all as long as
the dictators support
that's interesting about the West tells
us nothing about the Arab world and I
think in the Arabs streets they didn't
care one way or another the one leak
that may have had a very marginal effect
very marginal is from the at earnest
Embassy of the United States from a
couple of years ago pointing out that
describing what course everybody in
Tunisia knew that the countries run by a
kleptomaniac brutal dictator and so on
when they hate and so on well the only
thing I mean they knew it already of
course they lived there but what was a
some interest is that it showed that the
United States never if the United States
were at France certainly knew it they
have all place penetrated its former
French colony which means that the West
was perfectly aware that they were
supporting a brutal dictator who the
population hates but didn't care it's
the same as Egypt in Iraq as long as the
populations under control just doesn't
make any difference what they think so
we'll go on supporting the dictator till
the very end all of this tells us
something about the West
it doesn't knows nothing about the Arab
world and I doubt that WikiLeaks had an
effect it's like I mean the new media
had a marginal impact because they gave
more efficient ways of communicating
which couldn't easily be stopped by the
regime but they hadn't been there same
thing would have happened in fact in
Egypt for example the protests go back
four years that Vizard wasn't nobody
paid any attention but it's a very
militant labor movement it's been active
for quite a few years and militant
actions in fact you know if you look
that shows in the current demonstrations
so the sort of Twitter generation the
ones who sort of organize the protest
they call themselves the April 6th
movement April 6th is because of an
event that the West didn't pay any
attention to but Egyptians did that's
April 6 2008 when I was a major labor
action plan that the main industrial
center strikes for activities all over
the country and so on and it was crushed
by the dictatorship so they remember we
don't pay any attention usual reasons
but that's the April 6th movement and
that was just one of years of militant
actions some of them got some successes
mostly crushed so it's coming out and
it's the same in Tunisia that the other
countries coming out of a long tradition
of the uprising efforts to democratize
and freedom usually crushed but by the
West and the dictator the idea that the
Arab world is not ready for democracy is
the sick joke if you look at the history
and I've been trying to establish
democracies for actually 100 years that
looks 100 years and continually crushed
by the Western intervention and do you
think that that the that WikiLeaks had a
bigger impact on the West or are on
Western society or what do you think
about the policy change of WikiLeaks
they starved as Absalom they try to just
reveal information and then they switch
their media policy to to cooperation
with mainstream media outlets like the
New York Times The Guardian or the
German eagle and they edited material or
brought it out so they got a bigger
media coverage
on do you think that before the white
move that would change something or not
sure how much they change things they
also the beginning they were offering
material for the media and that was a
point when some of the major media those
who mentioned we're willing to use some
of the material but it's the media that
could be editing the image so yes
they're releasing material it's it
varies from country to country so in the
United States is very little WikiLeaks
exposure and in fact most of the
discussion of WikiLeaks is a gossip
about the Assange and so on the worst
part of it is the suspect the person was
suspected of leaking at Bradley Manning
he's been I think it's seven or eight
months now in prison in a military
prison but an under solitary confinement
that's tortured keep a person in
solitary confinement for a couple of
months and they start becoming mentally
destroyed that's a famous technique of
torture so he's being tortured for about
eight months now
although he's not no charges against him
he's just held as a political prisoner
in the military prison
President Obama was asked about it by
some journalists and he assured them
that the Pentagon had told him he's
being treated very well so it can't be a
problem well I hope all that tells us
nothing about the West but it's not
coming out of WikiLeaks and there is
some of all the material that came out
most of it is pretty low-level
diplomatic correspondence so you don't
expect it to say a lot there have been a
few things of interest actually grab
some of the most interesting perhaps was
from Pakistan where the ambassador and
Patterson it turns out was regularly
reporting to washing
that the US actions in Afghanistan and
Pakistan are threatening the breakup of
Pakistan they're leading to enormous
anti-americanism the population doesn't
like being attacked by terror weapons
drones or terror weapons and if it were
drones flying over here and without our
knowledge all of a sudden the place
could blow up that's what you live with
underground attacks and of course the
populations furious the military is
furious they want to preserve the
sovereignty of the country and it could
she kept recording pretty much would
people know anything about Pakistan and
save themselves that if these policies
persist so it might lead to the point of
an army mutiny might lead to the point
of fish on their huge nuclear program of
the fissile materials and leaking into
the hands of jihadists they have a
radical Islamist movement and that would
mean dirty bombs going off in New York
and London also kind of like Ultimate
Nightmare but she supports the policy in
criticizing but you just said these are
the consequences that the policies are
very likely leading to so the policies
just escalate that's interesting and I
don't think that was really when Bradley
Manning revealed the information to
WikiLeaks he thought at least said look
what's in fact that if the Collateral
Murder video would change the way the
policy of the western states of the US
but obviously is that that was not the
case these are the original leaks what
about the Iraq operations yeah and I had
noticed and in in regard to you to your
propaganda model do you think that this
changes
thing that that we have today we have
more information than ever with new
media we have the the Iraq protocol from
from WikiLeaks but that doesn't really
change the policy of the US and in
respect to the the the pentagon paper
that Daniel Ellsberg the Pentagon Papers
is quite different I was involved in
distributing the Pentagon Papers and rid
them before they came out that was a
record of 25 years of high-level
planning so that's quite different
WikiLeaks is low-level diplomatic
correspondence and when you read
diplomatic correspondence you have to be
very cautious because it's well known
and the diplomats themselves are aware
of it that they report pretty much what
they want the State Department to hear
if there are some famous cases of
diplomats who've tried to tell the truth
Craig Craig Murray in England is the
most famous example a very honest
serious investigator he was sent as
ambassador through his Becca Stan and he
started describing the horrors that are
going on there
you know the dictator boiling his
opponents and the death all sorts of
atrocities the British Foreign Office
didn't want to hear them they were
sporting was the dictator so please
don't tell us those stories and he was
finally cashier thrown out because he
wouldn't tell the Foreign Office what
they wanted to hear now any low-level
bureaucrat who wants to get ahead
understands that you better tell your
superiors what they want to hear you're
going to get into trouble so you have to
read the cables with some degree of
caution and nevertheless they tell you
something that it's totally different
than the Pentagon Papers and that's high
level planning US intelligence for 25
years
what do you expect if we could have
revealed information like the Pentagon
Papers they don't have that kind of
information Pentagon Papers were they
were constructed on the orders of the
Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara to
give a full history of the planning and
execution of the Vietnam War back from
the 1940s and the researchers people
like Dan Ellsberg they were supposed to
give an honest accounting because
McNamara wanted motive
and they included all the dot a lot of
the documents Declassified you know they
were all classified and so on so that's
that's like stealing the archives of
some enemy state like if you occupy an
enemy country and you get their archives
you know okay that gives you real
information but WikiLeaks is quite
difficult what Daniel Ellsberg did was
probably worked for for the USA then was
Bradley Manning was doing and how do you
see the difference in treating I mean
any other came away subtle but it wasn't
was lucky
yes exactly Daniel Ellsberg was on trial
could have gone to jail for years in
fact as it happens I happen to be
testifying at the trial on the day when
the trial was cancelled what happened is
that the judge in the trial he certainly
would have been convicted I mean to this
open-and-shut case
but and the defense which I was part I
was just putting on a political defense
explaining what's going on with the the
Nixon administration Nixon ran the
little trial offered the judge a high
political position I think head of the
FBI or something and the judge didn't
report it but then it leaked out so the
judge had to be clear a mistrial
that ended it and that's how Dan and
Tony versus personal work given escape
to escape punishment they're the same
was true of a lot of us I was going to
have for trial at the same time and the
trial was just called off after the Tet
Offensive after the Tet Offensive the
business community in the United States
concluded that the war is a waste of
time you know a little bit on forever
it's not worth it it's costing us too
much and there was a major power play
we're called wise men you know big shots
from Wall Street and so I went down to
Washington and essentially instructed
the president you've got to call this
off they instructed Johnson and say you
can't run for president upcoming
election you've got to stop the bombing
of North Vietnam you have to move to
negotiations and try to calm things down
here and he politely followed his orders
did everything and one of the minor
effects was they called off the trial
but the people who were coming up for
trial around that time all of them who
easily been convicted certainly Dan Roz
were but on the other hand there was no
crime you know it's not a crime and it
shouldn't be a crime in a Democratic
Society to let the population know which
leaders are doing I mean a dictatorship
would be a crime yeah do you think the
only way then to to end the current wars
in Afghanistan and Iraq is that's the
business community decides that they
don't want the war anymore or well you
have to ask why did the business
community decide a large part of the
reason was the public purpose it was
quite interesting if you look at the
dynamics of the war planning in fact it
was rather like Germany during the
Second World War in some ways to read
Albert Speers memoirs
you know economics he argues that part
of the problem the Nazis faced was that
they didn't trust the poppy
they had to keep the population kind of
contented you know they had it's now
calling a gun and butter war have to get
the population something so they don't
protesting much and that harms the war
effort he what he pointed out is the
West was much more totalitarian because
in the West the population was committed
to the war you didn't have to force them
they phousi a stick committed to the war
work hard and so on so you get this huge
production and so on for States and
world economy and looks very well in
fact in the United States the industrial
production almost quadrupled during the
Second World War
just because of enthusiastic uncoerced
participation Germany couldn't quite do
that and he argues that that held back
the war effort for a certain extent
which might have made the difference
because Germany was technologically so
much more advanced than the West that
they conceivably could have pulled
something out of the of the impending
defeat that Rockets and so on just
claims but during the Vietnam was quite
the same
it makes it realistic
during the Vietnam War there was so much
protest that they had to they couldn't
call a national emergency
they couldn't impose discipline like the
Second World War and the result was it
harmed the economy it led to speculation
a combination of stagnation and
inflation which didn't do but that's
what bothered the business community and
when the Tet Offensive came along they
realized this is going on indefinitely
thanks this is going to go on for a long
time and there's too much protest it's
actually take a look at the Pentagon
Papers the most interesting parts of the
Pentagon Papers weren't revealed by the
press they real kind of minor part but
take a look at the last part of the
Pentagon Papers the Pentagon Papers
materials in that around early nineteen
1968 and the last Tet Offensive was
January 68 so you get the next few
months what was government thinking like
during the next few months
well it's quite interesting it turns out
that the President President Johnson
wanted to send a couple hundred thousand
more troops to Vietnam the Joint Chiefs
of Staff were opposed they said they
would need those troops in the United
States for civil order discipline
control they were afraid there's going
to be a revolution in the United States
uprisings in the streets young people
women they wouldn't be able to control
it so in order to control civil disorder
they wanted the troops here that was one
of the main reasons why the troops
weren't sent well that's what the
thinking was like in Washington and
that's revealed by the Pentagon Papers
but not known to the public because how
many people read the Pentagon Papers and
read whatever little X or computer
times isn't but and the same is true in
general I mean I wrote about the
Pentagon Papers right away in fact I had
had them so I was able to write right
away but the parts I heard about were
never even published that what was
published with sort of details about the
tactical planning in the late 60s and so
on 50 so so basically the essence what
we're saying is that that protest stuff
and movements should put more pressure
on on the state make that make the
country and governor would you make the
country I'm governor bowl and then the
people who own the country ulcerous
policy and can you tell us something
about the neocons of media in in the
u.s. the alternative media in the US for
example democracy now is doing a great
job every day coverage of anti-war
movement of covering of protesters for
Kaplan Wisconsin it's democracy now
remember Amy Goodman who runs it because
terrific job but it's available and
she's now been able to get into a fair
number of cities but for example in
Boston you can't get democracy now like
Al Jazeera you can pick it up on the
internet and what what do you think
about the impact of Alfa's like
Democracy Now and on their on their
general public it reaches a very small
part of the public it reaches
essentially the activist public and the
public that's sort of interested in
trying to find out something other than
what's on the front page of the
newspaper but most people don't have
time or interest or even knowledge we
can go to those sources well I take
something much more democracy now is
really important but if you want to
follow what's going on in the Middle
East the best search source is all
Jazeera
highly professional they're broadcasting
you know all the time right on the
ground if you wanted to know what was
going on during the attack on Gaza
they were broadcasting 24 hours a day
from Gaza you want under to know what's
going on in Tahrir Square and good ol
Jazeera they're there no they speak the
language they're professional and so on
there are I think to towns in the United
States where you can get all Jazeera
it's kinda like China yeah it's kind of
a shut down the Internet the United
States there's no government
intervention the government doesn't know
that power but there's a self
subordination on the part of the media
which say we don't want the population
to and know the moves from the Arab
world so again you can pick up al
Jazeera on the Internet
but that's a special that's something
special for you and me we can do it
because we know we're looking for but
for the general populations is if it
doesn't it is and on the outside of the
political spectrum in the u.s. there's
the emerging Tea Party how would you
characterize this movement is this some
kind of national games or of the Tea
Party itself which has been pretty well
studied is roughly 15 percent of the
population and it's an interesting part
of the population actually it should be
familiar in Germany it's very much like
what developed and laid by my Germany
it's a petty bourgeois you know
storekeepers and people on farms things
like that a very conservative a lot of
it's very religious nativist you know
there's an old nativist tradition we
don't want foreigners
they're taking our country away from us
the interesting attitude toward the
government anti-government so hating all
governmental institutions it's very much
like what happened in Germany when the
center kind of collapse people hated the
Parliament why are they doing away
stupid maneuverings they're not doing
anything for our problems get rid of
them the other the parties you know
nationalists let's recover the glory of
the United States
if this isn't familiar in Germany it's
because you don't read the history it's
very similar to the late fine large
Germany and it you know the Nazis were
not a big move like in 1928 they got
less than 3% of the vote but they had
appeal especially as post-war problems
developed and of course when the
Depression hit had a lot of Appeal has
place collapsed but even the you know
good Germany regarded the Versailles
Treaty is totally completely unfair they
didn't think they'd lost the war
they're being mistreated they got to
recover the glory of Germany okay in the
United States recovered the glory of
America world isn't treating us properly
immigrants are coming in the Muslims are
destroying us not to do the Muslims even
the similarities are striking and
frightening you know don't say the same
thing is going to happen but it has a
resonance so it's a small movement
relatively affluent small town you know
store honor that runs a small insurance
company something like that the
conservative very religious almost
entirely white they feature a few black
faces but basically white and but it has
an appeal it resonates so maybe 50% of
the population more or less sympathizes
with a lot of what they're saying it's a
little bit like the right-wing movement
Europe today so if you take say in
Holland France depends on be the actual
participants maybe 20 20 percent of the
population or something like that but
they're the only political movements
that really try to appeal to the
concerns and the interests of the poor
and working-class so it has arisen
it's I think that's and of course in the
United States and here again it's like
not to get pre Nazi Germany concentrated
economic power in Germany was the
industrialists here it's the financial
sectors mostly they support them they
regard them is their storm troops that
they don't like them or afraid of them
so if you read the business press you
kind of afraid of them but they think
they can control them just like the
German industrialists thought they could
control the Nazis didn't quite work out
like that but the similarities were
thinking of them and a I don't have to
tell you in the 1920s
Germany was the peak of Western
civilization in the arts sciences
philosophy it was considered to model
democracy in ten years it went to the
depths of Barbary it could ugly things
can happen and I think the Tea Party
movement has that something like that
kind of character to it different
different circumstances and all sorts of
differences but that's natural country
and so on but not some similarities of
the worth being concerned to them and
what they're doing with the support of
the business world strong support of the
business world what they're doing is
extremely dangerous
so the last election of November in 2010
with
very strong support from the business
world a lot of them got into Congress
and they are now proceeding to dismantle
all of the limited efforts to do
something about the environmental crisis
they want to get rid of it the business
world doesn't want anybody to do this I
don't care if the world was up in 50
years long as you make profit tomorrow
and that's essentially what they're
doing it's very dangerous in Wisconsin
as well the governor of Wisconsin who
sort of spearheaded this effort to
destroy the last remnant of workers
rights collective bargaining
he was funded by the Koch brothers to
multi-billionaire billionaires who got
the money from run a big Energy
Corporation and they're the funders of
the Tea Party to they they were funding
his campaign pretty openly no secret
about it and you know they didn't expect
the popular reaction which was enormous
but this sort of ran through the
legislation of the popular jacking
so so they've been protesting in
Wisconsin what what was what is
different about that and what the tea
party involved in there is it will be
the team that they seek ready to go from
Union Union tea party was there they
were mobilized to try to oppose the
demonstrations but they were just
drowned out they were so small in
comparison so they were off on the side
somewhere this was just a very
spontaneous uprising and the general
public
cross across the board who were outraged
by the attack on on workers rights
actually one of the most dramatic
moments in the past couple of months
when was March somewhere time in March a
message was sent from Tahrir Square in
Egypt to the Wisconsin it was sent by
one of the main labor leaders in Egypt
Kemal Abbas they were leader for many
years he said a message to Wisconsin
expressing the Solidarity of Egyptian
workers with American workers they were
offering their support to the suppressed
workers of the United States and it's
interesting in Saval it was red and
squares and Madison Wisconsin which was
pretty impressive there were a hundred
thousand people in the streets that
occupied the state capitol for days and
it was it was with very broad support
and they look at polls large majority of
the population supported them and it was
a reflection of the general that concern
about the right wing that assault on
basic rights it's not the only one there
are others in other states with the same
thing as really long
we had right in Massachusetts for
example where I live which is a liberal
pro-labor state by us standards
the government is state governments also
trying to undermine collective
bargaining rights and there have been
protests so it's happening all over
they'll put this if they reach another
the scale they could shift policy
so far they've impossible to not
continue with the policies without
regard to the large-scale public
protests but you know there can come a
tipping point have you been following
the imagine looking in Spain and all
this left comparing your opinion to this
country and I mean I like it's different
the in Greece both degrees in Spain of
different I mean in greece there's
massive public protests against the
austerity programs which are you know
they're going to destroy the economy of
Greece I mean everything will go down
with him but then people are objecting
but they don't really have like they're
not closing an alternative realities
proposing it's happening in Spain the
protests are very impressive with mostly
young people and it doesn't what I can
tell there's not much labor union
participation and what they're going for
is quite feasible political changes so
they want to change and reform of the
electoral laws things like that I don't
think they're calling for these haven't
seen a cold calls for real
socio-economic changes thank you it's
impressive limited feasible I mean even
the you know the press does point out
though these are not radical because
it's nearly definite specific proposals
which could be implemented
it was quite different because the
circumstances are different in the
United States there has been a an
assault on labor for 50 years 60 years
I'm in the business classes in the
United States are highly classified as
much more so than in Europe and they're
always fighting a vicious class war and
they're basically vulgar Marxist and if
you read the business literature it
reads like the little red book with the
values inverted literally and they talk
about the you know the hazard price of
facing industrialists and the rising
political power of the masses and we
have to fight the everlasting battle for
the minds of men and indoctrinate people
with a capitalist story it's kind of
like a caricature of a mark Mulder
Marx's track and that's the standard
business literature reflects their
attitude and of course they hate labor
is a very violent labor history of the
United States much more than you and
this Second World War there's been a
massive concerted campaign to beat back
the labor movement because the labor
movement is understood to be a
democratizing force and then force for
social reform and with all its flaws and
corruption and where we say it's still
the only real organized force of sitting
at the front of progressive activities
so you've got to get rid of it well in
the private sector they've almost
eliminated
especially since Reagan the Reagan
basically informed the business
community that the labor Lord's on
driving force so if you want to
illegally fire union organ
go ahead anything about and in fact
firing as labor organizers triple I
think during those Reagan years and then
at Clinton did the same one of the
obvious effects of NAFTA was quickly the
so-called free trade agreements that's
not a free trade agreement what's called
a free training they essentially gave
authorized it authorized employers to
undermine organizing efforts by
threatening to move the factory to
Mexico
that's illegal but if you have a
criminal state you can carry out illegal
actions and the number of illegal
actions of that kind of vastly increased
during the twenty years and during under
Bush is even more extreme so by now in
the private sector unionization is below
below seven percent very small
how are the public sector unions and
survived there it was harder to violate
the the labor laws there's more
protection so they're still there and
now there's a major attack against the
public sector unions there's a huge
public relations campaign go on
propaganda campaign going on in the
states to try to blame the financial
crisis the economic crisis that could
blame it they're not on you know Goldman
Sachs and JP Morgan Chase so they don't
matter but to blame it on teachers and
firefighters you know their exorbitant
pensions and so on
again there's some resemblance to
Germany and blame it on the Jews and the
Bolsheviks not so blame it on them and
get rid of their pensions get rid of
their health plans
destroy the public school system then
everything will be fine and that's
essentially Wisconsin that was and not
just Wisconsin Ohio Indiana other states
so tried it and the the main way of
doing is eliminating collective bargain
which is like the core of labor right
but blame it on them you know that to
some extent it succeeding and maybe
maybe wind up with soft with two minutes
on what all the neither and it should do
well um look what they can and should do
is in fact I once treated in Wisconsin
except it wasn't done my organizers it
just exploded and then organizers took
the opportunity and helped it long and
there were quite a few of them ranging
from the labor movement through with the
IWW especially this work and they had
some remnant good lay on you here yeah
the goodness will affect him I'm
probably one of the few people who not a
as a member was not a son of a member
you know that's a different but the but
but there was you know people did take
and is there there there's there is an
organized militant labor movement small
but there and and other popular
movements moved in like there was
tremendous support for the teachers and
others we have to remember there's
another thing going on that's in the
background that's the effort to destroy
the public school system it makes it
easier to attack teachers pensions a
huge propaganda actually Obama is much
involved almost as much involved in this
is the Republicans to try to dismantle
public education it was very striking
what's happening this was you know one
of the real jewels of
of American society it's the first
country to have had a extensive
successful public educate real public
educational system message creation goes
back to the 19th century that's under
attack at the higher education level
universities by now it's under very
serious attack so in more than half the
states now the public universities get
most of their funding from tuition or
not from the government the in
California which was the jewel of the
system of great higher education systems
being destroyed
they both presentation that one biggest
present since that present prisons build
prisons instead well that's for the
poorer people in the blacks miss manic
but for the rich if they can't go to
college but huge the tuition at say the
University of California is almost the
same as the rich private institutions so
what's turning what the major college
will probably privatized they're like I
could lead colleges in the Yale
consumption and the rest of the system
will just decline and that's happening
all over the country if they claim
economic reasons but it's certainly not
economic reasons I mean Germany's not
collapsing you know and you don't have
to pay $30,000 a year ago going
universities but or Mexico let's say
poor country tuitions free that quite a
good university system I mean the
economic argument very flimsy but but
it's part of the effort to destroy a
public system and that goes down to
kindergarten so the programs of the Bush
and Obama administrations are to sponsor
and we're called charter schools
basically publicly funded but out of the
public education system so you don't
have to have unionized teachers you know
to meet the general requirements it
could be a you don't have to deal with
the difficult cases like the public
school system a very good aspect of it
is it takes care of everybody if a child
has a learning disability or whatever
public school system takes care of it
the trier schools can ignore that they
can do what's called cherry picking you
picked a good student even with that
they don't have better results a lot of
studies but it kind of it it done derm
ines public education a narrow goal is
to eliminate unions but there's a much
deeper principle involved that which has
never talked about the public school
system is based on a principle that is
considered highly subversive and we care
about other people as solidarity mutual
support you how to drive that out of
people's head so in a public school
system let's say you know I don't have
children school anymore but I pay taxes
so that the kid across the street can go
to school and that's a very dangerous
idea if you go eliminate that and in
fact this has been going on literally
for a century and a half you go back to
the mid nineteenth century and you look
read very lively working-class press at
the time that one of the things they
were condemning 1850 is what they called
the new spirit of the age gained wealth
forgetting all but self that was the new
spirit of the age in 1850 well they're
still trying to drive it into people's
heads
that's Iran that's sort of I guess usual
we should then proceed to do the
contrary always do the contrary actually
the attack on Social Security is exactly
the same there's no fiscal problem but
it's based on that same conception of
solidarity yeah what's the force I think
you think we can conclude this fall and
move on to the next
