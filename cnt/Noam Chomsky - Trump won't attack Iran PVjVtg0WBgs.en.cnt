[Music]
what's your advice to the RP does that
took a finish from darling
there's no advice to leader they know
what you do what the advice should be is
to the general population
[Music]
the leaders are sentenced to 20-years
many tourists in child what do you think
about that situation pretty obvious what
I think about it question is what to do
about the Arab leaders are concerned
with their own interests our wealth
control nominations I don't think they
want to attack you right but what they
might be provocative
[Music]
it's a great pleasure to be with you you
have always considered that humanity is
facing to to agree threats the
ecological destruction and the nuclear
threat let's start by the first one the
ecological destruction
dr. Chomsky as a philosopher do you
think that there is still a chance or a
possibility to make a balance between
the technological developments the
scientific developments and the effects
well I put it the other way scientific
developments are the only way for us to
escape the cash catastrophe which would
be from an ethical point of view utterly
disasters it's science that will help us
escape the facts the only way for us to
escape the looming disaster
environmental destruction and as I say
from an ethical point of view destroying
the prospects for organized human life
about the worst time that you imagine
but the only answer to that problem is
scientific developments so for example
if we can move to sustainable energy
it's because of what science achieves
not what achieved in the literature
Department are you pessimistic the
disaster is ready imminent
I think the disaster is very close I
don't see any reason to challenge the
overwhelming consensus virtually a
hundred percent of the serious climate
scientists and they have plenty of
evidence that were moving to within a
generation or two we might reach total
order to atrophy
if something serious isn't done there
it's not being done concerning the
second trade the nuclear threat as you
know Trump withdrew from the deal of the
famous deal of 2015 but the lates evens
proved that he looks like he could
engage a war against yarn isn't it a
positive mark in your view can we expect
a war more balances than well now I
don't think that the Trump
administration wants to attack it read
the consequences of that could be
they're unpredictable but they could be
devastating
for example Iran has sufficient missile
capacity to attack the air the northeast
areas of Saudi Arabia is Shia areas
where the oil or most of the oil is oil
facilities and also where the
desalination facilities or that would
frankly wipe out Saudi Arabia they could
the US would probably respond with some
devastating attack but then I could
easily spread and you know where we
couldn't make Isis look tame I don't
think they want to attack Iran but what
they might the provocative moves that
they're making might lead to an
accidental conflict say in the Gulf of
Hormuz which would blow up without
anyone's intending to be that easily
happen if an Iranian small boat boat
uses you know it's a US aircraft carrier
you know between be are a disaster but
more globally the Middle East is the
Middle East North Africa or the Middle
East as you call it here
yes the Middle East is very troubled are
you optimistic about its future with all
the cultural problems
ethnical problems are the optimistic dr.
Tomsky it reminds me what you said about
Israeli society it's with its cultural
problems its internal problems how these
problems may have a significant
significant impact on its power can we
talk about our self-destruction like
others that's a serious problem there so
that's not the most important treasure I
think the problem within Israel is the
European based religious population
Lucien is expanding very quickly
sorry depopulation which doesn't
contribute to the society that is
becoming an enormous factor and it's
undermining the second or character the
society it's leading to a serious
internal crisis for the there is the
Arab Jewish community is also
participating in their own you know
their own elements is for the elements
have you heard about the deal of the
century the audience though whether it
exists but from the proposals that have
been leaked out it seems like an effort
to eliminate the Palestinian issue by
sort of trying to organize some funding
that will satisfy minimal Palestinian
that needs is no indication where that
funding will come and will to some kind
of alliance between
Israel of the reactionary Arab states
one of the it's very hard to find a
coherent geopolitical program behind the
chaos the trunk creates all over but
there is one us an effort to constructed
an alliance of the most reactionary
states in the Middle East that would
mean the Gulf dictatorships CC's Egypt
Israel which is shifting far to the
right
beyond this Modi's in the or bonds
Hungary few others and to make that a
kind of an international base
reactionary alliance which would be the
base of trumps power could extend the
Brazil Wilson ro others this is pretty
explicit than the dictates of Steve
Bannon who was an advisor he talks about
it openly and it's probably probable
that that's in the background of the
people who are carrying out any kind of
geo strategic analysis and Trump
administration that may not include him
he's doing something else government
doesn't know about it doesn't cure but I
mean for the Palestinians it means just
didn't mean everything
[Music]
this is the classic question the
partition of question how do you explain
and what the silence but the complicity
of our leaders your leaders are
concerned with their own interests our
wealth controlled nomination for them
the they're compelled to show concern
for the Palestinians because they have
to keep their own populations quiet and
the population for the populations this
is a big issue but you know there's been
a kind of a tacit alliance between Saudi
Arabia and Israel since really since 97
1967 which is when US policy towards
Israel changed radically before then it
was not there was commitment but nothing
as extremists followed that and the
reason is in 1967 Israel provided a
great service to both the United States
and Saudi Arabia by destroying the base
of secular Arab nationalism which is the
main rival to Saudi Arabia radical Islam
that's an old conflict when the British
dominated the region they tended
overwhelmingly to support radical Islam
against secular nationalism when the
u.s. took over the ducting pretty much
the same policy and that's
understandable
the secular nationalism can lead to
independence development for their
alliances that were thugs radical Islam
you can assume
of 911 was an exception that works most
of the time and there for them that
meant by the post 1967 region Europe for
the first part of the US policy was
based on three pillars as they were cool
one was Saudi Arabia one was you read in
under the Shah the third was in room and
the relations between Iran and Israel
were very close a lot of this came out
theoretically they were war with one
another but in fact they had very close
relations well this came out after the
Shah fell lots of information appeared
but it turned out that virtually all the
Israeli leaders had traveled to Tehran
and they were closely they were acting
in very close concert of many issues and
Saudi Arabia was sort of part of it on
the side and one of the this great you
know the deal of the century a part of
it is just to try to bring all this in
the open with you right now of course
but was the reactionary Arab states and
others in the region the same context of
all the cultural problems more globally
in the world how do you explain the the
expansion of the right wing next time
that's happening all over the world
there also there's resistance to it
happens all over the world take a look
right now Julie masse lots of uprising
against harsh repressive regimes a lot
of it is the source of a lot of this all
over the world is the impact of the
the impact of the neoliberal programs of
the last generations which have had a
pretty harsh effect almost everywhere in
the United States for example and in
Europe they've led to high concentration
of wealth pretty much stagnation for
most of the population undermining of
democratic forms that is people angry
resentful discontent with established
institutions it's it's fertile territory
for demagogues to arise to try to turn
people's anger against scapegoats
usually people you even more vulnerable
than your immigrants Muslims African
Americans and others but at the same
time and it's it's leading to a kind of
a popular reaction which is seeking to
overcome the these crises so for example
in Chile you may have seen the one of
the slogans of the demonstrators is it's
not 30 paces it's 30 years we want to
get rid of the legacy of the Pinochet
dictatorship which was the first major
experiment in neoliberalism it was
imposed by force
chewie later spread with Thatcher and
Reagan to the Western world that effects
of elsewhere the structural adjustment
programs in Latin America and with
several decades of under development and
although this is piling up in many ways
if you look at the individual countries
there are specialists but this is a kind
of an undercurrent that you see
everywhere
that's the
kind of contempt for the centrist
institutions that have run the societies
for many years this is a pretty natural
consequence of what the policies have
meant to people in Europe the special
feature the structure of the European
Union is deeply undemocratic major
decisions taken out of the heads of
people they're placed in the bureaucracy
of Brussels naturally close enough
resentment especially was the nature of
the policies which is the austerity
policies have been very large other
places there's limitations but this is a
kind of an odd record and kind of like
the Arab Spring which may come back
it's undermining the Democratic forms
it's because of new liberal programs but
it's also a representative democracy
crisis isn't dr. Tomsky listen you were
very strikingly so as I say in Europe
major decisions are made in unelected
bureaucracy in Brussels with the
northern banks looking over their
shoulders now there's something not too
different in the United States and
England the effect of the neoliberal
programs the sharp concentration of
wealth the stagnation for the general
population has exacerbated features of
mr. democracy that were already there
namely the overwhelming power of
concentrated wealth of the corporate
power that's been exaggerated enormous
in carrying the neoliberal fury so
people know attitudes towards conkers or
people the single digit support you said
that the offspring may come back as you
know the populations are evolved against
dictatorship and authoritarianism but it
went bad because especially of
geopolitics now the populations are
taken hostage between the
authoritarianism and instability what's
the solution in your view dr. Tomsky
solution is to what was begun we see
Arab Spring but was aborted by
concentrated power to move the hunted
eliminate the autocratic reactionary
social structure at the introduced
really functioning democracy there were
steps towards that but they were crushed
in one or other way that's an is you
sort of mildly developed in Egypt there
wasn't relation but it elected the
Muslim Brotherhood which had its own
kind of autocratic repressive character
that unfortunately the military coup the
progressives part of the population
welcomed the military coup much of it
because they thought it would bring
democracy to meet you
that's quite an illusion military coup
introduced was probably the hardest
period in Egypt's history in Syria of
course everything
totally crashed but I think the germs
still exist and they'll probably come
back up in Egypt there were recently
demonstration they were crushed
authoritarian leaders token vanish from
that situation to supplies their people
while the social causes is increasing
what's your advice to the authoritarian
Arab leaders
there's no advice to the leaders they
know what they're doing what the advice
should be is to the general populations
there's the organizers carry out
significant actions to try to overthrow
the the dismantle the authoritarian
structure of the states in the economy
but that's in the hands of the
population the leaders are not going to
do it they're the ones with benefits
Berman talked about this happened you
know in Morocco to popular pressures it
was some relaxation of authoritarian
structures same in the United States in
the United States in many ways is a more
civilized country than it was 50 or 60
years ago but that's not a gift from
leaders that's because of popular
activism which forced the leadership
class to yield to the pressures of the
population now that can go much farther
this actually great social tension in
Morocco many hundreds of political
prisoners many hundreds of peaceful
demonstrators from the reef region have
been arrested during last two years for
asking for globe hospital education that
leaders are sentenced to 20 years many
tamales in jail what do you think about
that situation back to Trotsky I think
the question is what to do but but I
mean if you look at Egypt
about 60,000 that's what popular
organization should be struggling to
overcome and it would be very good if
there were international so that the
Solidarity of this to support them but
the leaders are not going to do anything
you have to force about the leadership
there's only one way that works that's
by popular activism
which is not easy you get shot by the
police imprisoned and so on but over
time it can succeed so if you look at
history there are many things that were
repressive systems that looked is this
there's no last forever
we're indeed overthrown in the same
context no message from you to the
kingdom Ahamed vi yeah to the king yeah
sure I should think you would
essentially resign and favor of a
democratic society but he's not going to
do it it'll have to be forced on him by
popular pressure he's not asking for my
advice is to thank you very much
professor I hope you didn't all the
questions
you're thinking
