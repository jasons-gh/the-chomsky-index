what the u.s. did as soon as soon as the
rst government came in it was a big
surprise remember nobody expected that
election the US hadn't had a candidate
he was a world bank official they
figured he'll sweep over everything
because he had all the resources and all
the rich people backed him and as far as
they knew there was nothing else you
know who pays attention to what's going
on in the slums the so they figured
it'll be a walkover like everything else
and to their amazement there was this
vibrant lively civil society out there
which managed to get a presidential
candidate in incidentally they weren't
organized enough and rich enough to get
parliamentary candidates in so that's
why you read the commentary now about
how you know our state is this kind of
impossible guy who can't deal with the
Parliament yeah sure because the
Parliament is the old guys who we put in
power forever
you know the rich killers and so on
that's the little subtext but they did
manage to get a presidential candidate
in so the u.s. began at once at once
trying to undermine him at one no wait a
minute
like they've been a lot of the US has a
picture of what Haiti ought to be it
ought to be basically an export platform
for you know assembly plants using super
cheap labor and there's been a whole
project about this u.s. eight had been
pouring money in for that and they
called it an economic miracle and it was
I mean wages went down about 50% and
profits went up about as fast that's
what an economic miracle is and this was
all blocked by this election so you the
USA did continue but it was stopped
they stopped any aid for investment any
constructive aid stopped because they
weren't gonna make any profit out of it
the aid simply went to the business
community to enable them to set up
counter forces to the popular movement
the National Endowment for democracy
which is a bipartisan thing went in and
any reader of or will knows what
National Endowment for democracy is
going to be and it is they moved in to
try to set up alternative things that
would weaken the executive and also
alternative groups that we try to
undercut the popular organizations and
again by one of those strange
coincidences these groups are exactly
the ones that survived the coup
while the others were destroyed and they
then filled the offices after the coup
the seven months at our stage was in
office were very frightening I mean not
only was it a popular movement that that
pushed him in but he was also being
extremely successful I mean he even
successful by conservative World Bank
standards so like the inter-american
Development Bank you know which is not a
radical outfit was writing very positive
reports of cutting down a bureaucracy
and you know getting rid of corruption
and starting a functioning economy again
and so on and that's even worse because
he started getting international funding
which means the place might fall out of
us-controlled totally unacceptable so
this guy obviously had to go really bad
news and the only question was how okay
there was a coup right after the coup as
I mentioned the u.s. essentially
supported I don't say they planned the
coup maybe they did or maybe they didn't
but they acted at once to ensure that it
stayed in so they undercut the embargo I
talked about that meanwhile they're sort
of standing by while they're guys we
talked about professionalizing the
security forces who professionalized
them in the first place you know they
were set up by the United States when we
invaded the country before as an army to
repress the population ever since then
the top officer Corps has been trained
by the United States including the guys
who are doing the killing right now
they're all trained in Fort Benning and
the School of the Americas and so on in
fact the Haitian officers were seen
there's a church group that monitors
Fort Benning School of the Americas and
according to them they there have been
Haitian officers there as recently as 11
months ago right in the middle of all
the atrocities the so they're going to
be professionalized by the same guys who
taught them in the first place and
they'll teach them how to do a little
better next time
our Steven wanted the army to be reduced
and the u.s. blocked that that's been
one of the things that held up
negotiations actually you can read about
that in an article but in foreign policy
one of the main foreign policy journals
but Ian Martin who was the head of the
UN OAS mission who points out that you
know what was holding things up was that
the u.s. insisted on maintaining the
military
while the other countries Canada and
France and so on we're trying to support
our steeds effort to cut it back and
they aren't the army leaders wanted the
United States to take control because
they trusted the United States to work
for their interests they didn't trust
Canada and France and the other guys as
much and that's going to happen so the
Army stays in the economy is going to be
driven away from the populist reforms
back towards you know the pre-1990
system our steed may be allowed in for
cosmetic reasons a centerpiece of
Clinton's speech the other night if you
heard it you know when he was sort of
trying to build up some steam for the
invasion one of the rhetorical
centerpieces of it was his statement
that you know our state has shown
himself to be a true Democrat namely he
has committed himself to step down in
1995 you know and not and not to run
again for office as the Constitution
demands and that as far as I can see
there is not going to whisper of comment
about that in the American press the
obvious has been pointed out in the
canadian press the obvious is that the
constitution does say that he's got a
five-year term but it doesn't say what
happens if three years of that five-year
term are spent in washington while the
guys who were trained by the united
states of decimating your popular
support then say anything about that so
you can interpret it in two ways if you
really have a passionate hatred for
democracy
you'll interpret it as meaning he goes
after the five years if you believe in
democracy you'll say he may gets back in
if ever he'll pick up where he left off
and finish up the five-year term but I
can't find anyone and then any
commentator in the United States yet
whose hatred of democracy is so limited
that they can even see this point you
know so he's out you know he'll come
back and I presume they'll try to get
him back in a couple of months aid will
start and maybe six months or so what
they're saying now it'll go to the
business sectors meaning he can't do
anything for his constituency
they're intimidated and decimated then
you'll be able to run on hill then he's
going to leave very quickly you can then
run a free election and we have a lot of
experience
that I mentioned the one in Guatemala
you know there are a lot of others like
it will run a free election everybody's
scared out of their wit's they vote the
way you tell them to if they bother vote
at all and they know that if you don't
you know your children are gonna get cut
in pieces and left in a ditch so
therefore you vote the right way and
then you know the press here writes
about the romantic age you know Thomas
Jefferson's back and so on and so forth
you can see that you can write the
scenario right now you know because
we've been through it so many times no
we've been through it over and over
again it's exception was occasionally
something goes wrong like there actually
is a free election by mistake like in
Haiti and then you quickly act to make
sure that's not gonna happen again
that's history you know it's got nothing
to do with the Cold War went on before
the Cold War it's going on after the
Cold War the only effect of the Cold
War's to change the pretext you know so
you shift the rhetoric around a little
and it happens for very good reasons
that's what's been happening in Haiti
and I think there's every reason to
think that's what's going to happen if
we let it happen we don't have to agree
to this you know it's like it's not laws
of nature
these are human decisions made within
human institutions they can change but
they're not going to change any more
than we're gonna have a healthcare
program or anything else unless there's
big popular pressures about it otherwise
it's not going to change because there's
no reason why the people who are making
decisions should make different
decisions they're making the decisions
which maximize their own wealth and
power and it's ridiculous to think that
they should make any other decisions
it's like asking a chairman of the board
of General Motors to try to lose money
you know you don't appeal to him to try
to cut down profits that would be
ridiculous there's an institutional
Milton Friedman is right about this it's
his job to maximize profits and market
share there's no point appealing to him
to do anything else that's crazy he
decided to do anything else somebody
else comes in and does that because it's
an institutional fact you have to change
the institution's or at least put them
under enough pressure so they acted
away and that's not simple but it's
possible what's happen done a lot of
things the invasion was just because you
know it was getting to the point where
the military they first were they
basically done their job and the
military was told right at the beginning
don't leave and they were told it in a
way which everyone understood the way
they were told was do your job do it as
long as you want when we tell you it's
enough stop and then you'll live in
luxury for the rest of your life that's
basically what they were told well you
know under those conditions why should
they leave you know I mean they're you
know they were essentially told look
when it's over and we tell you to go
you'll go and will either put you on a
jet and send you off to France like we
didn't do that yeah and you can take
half what's left of the Treasury in your
pocket or else we'll allow you to live
up and pick Youngsville and wait around
a couple of months and then we'll set it
up so you can run for office and win
like we just did with rios Montt I mean
why should they leave you know so they
didn't leave it finally got to be a bit
of an annoyance for one thing the
military was beginning to cut into the
interests so you know these military
thugs have a way of being getting too
big for their britches they start
cutting in on the interests of the
moderate sector of the business
community that's another technical term
moderate sector means the guys who don't
think you just ought to slaughter
everyone and torture them and rape them
and so on rather you have to save them
so that they can work for five cents an
hour and an assembly plant that's the
moderate sector and these guys were
beginning to cut in on the interest of
the moderate sector like you know they
were cutting in on their monopolies and
they were making too much money and you
know weakening their power and so on so
you know they gotta get got to tell him
to go okay they told him to go that's
what's called the invasion they wanted
him to go they could have told him three
years ago
on human rights colors and level of
education today society is the 26th at
support the what well I mean no I'm not
intentionally avoiding and it's a very
important phenomenon for example in
Central America in the last I mean
there's you know the left if I don't
exactly know what the term means but if
the left refers to people who are
interested in stuff like freedom and
justice and human rights and all that
kind of junk if that let's mean by that
the left if that's what the left is they
don't have any view about religion
because religion is all over the place
you know so like religion it takes a
Haiti religion is re Steve and religion
is the Papal Nuncio
who's you know the biggest supporter of
the coup
you know I mean the Vatican's role and
this is grotesque it's the only it's not
a nation but it's the only international
entity that's even recognized the coup
regime so really and that's typical you
know religions everywhere you can't make
a comment about it you can't say what do
you think about the Haitian church you
have to ask which Haitian church you
know the priests and the nuns who were
working in the in the rural areas and
you know the occasional bishop Romulus
is one bishop or do you mean the guys
who were put in on a ladder impact you
know impact modeled on Mussolini's pact
with the Vatican between duvet and the
church which put in big supporters of
the compliment and the rest of them in
power and are still backed by the
Vatican which Church are you talking
about and the same is true everywhere in
Latin America for example where the
Catholic Church has been very strong
forever for a long time it was the
Church of the rich and the powerful and
in the sixth in the 50s and the 60s that
began to change
and I was a dramatic change I'm in the
bishops conferences since medinan pueblo
back in the sixties and seventies they
just you know after mostly had to do
with pope john xxiii as an at an
official level but you know at a lower
level it just had to do with all kinds
of activism that was going on with
worker priests and nuns working with the
poor and all sorts of stuff I mean out
of all of this came the thing that's
called liberation theology if you want a
name and that became a major force in
the Latin American church well it's not
by any means the only force you know but
it was strong enough so that the u.s.
had to go to war with it we literally
went to war with the church I mean the
war in the 1980s in Central America was
very much against the church again
that's something that has to be
suppressed here but it's quite obviously
true the it was kind of symbolic just to
look at what happened I mean the big
monstrous attacks began pretty much the
ones that US was backing with the
assassination of the Archbishop in El
Salvador and they ended you know the
biggest one that ended was with the
murder of nine jazz up seven Jesuit
intellectuals and put other people in
November 1989
that's the decade starts with the
assassination the archbishop ends with
the murder the Jesuit intellectuals all
by our guys you know happen to be quite
her in the first place and who was
Reagan I guess still in the second or
maybe Bush I forget but the you know and
it was what was going on in between I
mean the church really got in the neck
the and it's because they were on the
wrong side they were on the side of the
population they were pursuing the
preferential option for the poor so they
had to be destroyed like anybody else
does who works for poor people the
United States has nothing especially has
no special US policymakers have no
particular attitude about religion any
more than the left does the question is
what religion is doing and let's say
take Islamic fundamentalism you know one
of the current myths is that the u.s. is
supposed to be worried about Islamic
fundamentalism I mean just take a look
at the world and
you ask yourself how well that holds up
the leading Islamic fundamentalist state
in the world is Saudi Arabia are we
worried about Saudi Arabian biggest
friend no why because the gangsters who
run Saudi Arabia are doing their job
their job is to make sure that the prof
to manage the oil wealth in such a way
that the profits go to the west and not
to the people of the region and as long
as they do that job they can be as
brutal and as religious fanatics and
anything else they like that kind of
Islamic fundamentalism is fine go to
non-state actors non-state fundamentals
well the most extreme Islamic
fundamentalist I guess in the world was
global in Hekmatyar in Afghanistan who
got six billion dollars approximately
from the US and our Islamic
fundamentalist friends and in Saudi
Arabia through the 80s he's a mad
Islamic fundamentalist you know more
extreme they might in dreama he's also a
major terrorist Minh narco-trafficker
u.s. was pouring money and he's not
tearing the country apart
now he's killing thousands or maybe tens
of thousands of people is destroyed
Kabul and so on nobody ever reports it
that's very good so he's an OK Islamic
fundamentalist I mean now we don't like
him anymore because he's got Stinger
missiles and he's probably giving him to
all his friends and they'll start
shooting down airliners and that sort of
thing but you know as long as he was
working for us he was a good Islamic
fundamentalist working against us he's a
bad Islamic fundamentalist and the same
is true of secular nationalists and
priests and you know anybody the
question is which side are they on not
what do they believe in so there's
nothing general to say about religion
you can talk about particular things
which are different as to why the poor
are going to fundamentalist movements
around the world yeah that's not an
accident like you say it's very good
reasons for it the reasons are that the
secular nationalist the secular
alternatives have been destroyed so take
say the Arab world
I mean secular nationalism and other
secular movements have simply been
destroyed sometimes by outside force
sometimes by internal factors but
whatever the reasons they're pretty much
gone
and if you're living in the Cairo slums
let's say which means you know like 90%
of the people of Egypt and you know your
kid is dying from some sickness there's
only one place you can go for medical
aid and that's the Islamic
fundamentalist they run clinics they
have free doctors I do think they
provide social services and so on the
government is for the rich know why we
like it but if you're in among the poor
that's they're not gonna do anything for
you and as a result the fundamentalist
movements do organize among the poor
they also offer people something
culturally and psychologically you know
maybe it's a crazy vision whatever you
think about it it's something you know
it's something you can be committed to
some kind of hope for the future you
know some way of working with other
people whatever I mean a lot of ugly
aspect but that's you know but it's you
know you look across the board you can
see why it's working kind of the same
reason why Farrakhan is having a lot of
success here whatever you think about
them you know they're offering something
to people nobody else is the and since
the US and in fact any percentage does
like anyone with any power is going to
try to block any constructive
initiatives that will cut into that
power what you're left with is the
things that somehow can survive and they
grow out of popular soil typically and
right now they haven't even taken
fundamentalist forms I mean just a last
comment on its non fundamentalism the
United States itself is one of the most
fundamentalist countries in the world I
mean by comparative standards we rank
around Iran you know literally in terms
of people's beliefs and you know
religious fanaticism and stuff like that
we're very different from any industrial
country there's another one that comes
close so you know this is an extreme
fundamentalist country and there's all
kind of speculations it's about why
that's true but part of the reason may
well be as a lot of political scientists
have thought that it reflects the
absence of
pratik institution I mean we have formal
democratic institutions but the
population knows they don't work half
the population in the country thinks
that the system is so corrupt that both
political parties ought to be simply
disbanded you know well okay you got
half the population thinking there is no
political system at all it's going to be
a big impetus to look for something else
and one of the things that people look
we don't have functioning organizations
that enable people to get involved in
the political arena like unions for
example or political clubs or things
like that
it's a business run society it has to a
large extent succeeded in imposing kind
like a business ideology gain will
forget about everybody else when you
people react to that in way various ways
and one of the ways they react is
religious fundamentalism in its this is
a very different country from say the
Cairo slums but some of the dynamism is
similar I think so I think it's a it's a
intriguing it's a proper question and
intriguing and complicated matter but
has a lot of different facets to it
I'm sorry well on the first part that's
an old story actually I had a lot of
personal experience with that it turns
out I was with a group that was a
resistance support group that was maybe
the first white group or one of the
first white groups to get involved with
the Panthers back in 60s just when they
were getting started and so I said a lot
of personal experience actually I was at
Fred Hamptons funeral the guy who was
murdered in Chicago very few white faces
there in fact but what you describe I
mean they what you allude to the United
time described is exactly right i mean
the the panthers were you know they were
an important there weren't a lot of
people they have a big publicity but not
many people by now we have a ton of IDF
stuff FBI stuff on them and according to
FBI there were about 800 members and
they were you know the FBI devoted huge
resources to destroying them because
these 800 people might actually do
something and the way they went after
them was pretty selective
I mean the Panthers like you know all
you had to do is to just begin to have
context with them you could see right
off it's a very diverse group I mean it
involved everything from thugs and
criminals who are using this as a kind
of ripoff technique to very constructive
and serious organizers if you ask who
survived it's the thugs and criminals
you know the Serious Organised were
killed or eliminated in some fashion or
other in the extreme example is Fred
Hampton who you're referring to I mean
Fred Hampton is a really important case
in modern American history
this is a black organizer who the FBI
tried to get assassinated very hard the
first way they did it all the records
are out on this it's complete publics
made public for 20 years they he was the
most constructive and effective Panther
organizer in the ghettos non by you know
no violence no drugs nothing just doing
much worse things organizing people the
first the way they tried to get adamant
first was by working through a criminal
gang there was a criminal gang in
Chicago ghetto called The Blackstone
Rangers now you know the security forces
like the police and FBI they don't have
anything against criminal gangs that's
their part of the technique for
controlling the ghetto so they're okay
uh and the FBI was all involved with the
Rangers of course and they trot they
sent a letter in flip it was kind of
comical you know fake black dialect you
know written by some guy sitting in a
Washington office you know dear brother
or something or other like it's comment
you've seen I'm sure it's just comical
to read saying you know that there's
this guy Fred Hampton and he's taken out
a contract on you written to Jeff or
whoever it was it was the head of deep
Rangers the idea was to try to get the
Blackstone Rangers to assassinate Fred
Hampton for him okay the Rangers and the
Panthers were already enough he
integrated with one another so they
first of all nobody in the black
community could have believed this
letter for a second but secondly they
were had good relations you know and it
didn't work so the next thing the FBI
did was simply set up a Gestapo Sal
assassination literally I mean they
managed to get an FBI infiltrator to be
the Fred Hamptons main security guy they
he and a bunch of other Panthers were
living in an apartment they simply they
gate they sent the Chicago Police a
completely faked
you know claim the FBI report that these
guys had guns and this and the other
thing and they got the police to break
in at four
in the morning and just murder him in
bed probably drugged there was at first
that kind of like a pretense that the
Panthers had fired and this and that and
the other thing but that all blew apart
and they finally had to concede what was
true is just a straight Gestapo style
assassination okay I mean of all the
crimes in the Richard Nixon era there
isn't one in the domestic one I'm in
forgetting in their nationals there's
not one domestic one that even comes
close to this you know I mean compared
with this water gauge isn't even a tea
party no but this is a this is part of a
program it goes way back goes back to
the late 50s Kennedy built it up a lot
continued through Johnson you know Nixon
extend that it it technically it's
supposed to have terminated in 1975 when
I was exposed but nobody knows it's just
nobody's investigated since then well
okay that's you know and that's the
selectively and the Panthers were
destroyed but it wasn't just the
Panthers I think the whole black
community was just devastated you know
there were all sorts of things going on
in the 60s and they were treated kind of
like the Haitian popular movement you
know I mean they kill 4,000 people
because this is the United States not
Haiti but similar you know it's kind of
like the similarity between death squads
that murder children and Brazil and the
way we take care of them here you know
rich countries you do it differently but
sometimes it went down the straight
murder like in the Hampton case well
okay that's you know no more Panthers
there's another part to that question
whatever oh yeah I don't know
I honestly don't know I mean it's
extremely hard to think what way there
is out of I mean it happens that there's
a very close correlation between race
and class in the United States I mean
across the board blacks and Hispanics
and so on are worse off you can but
nevertheless there is a good correlation
and fundamentally it's a class issue and
those are tough you know it's it's it
would be no easier to answer the
question how white working people could
can do something about their lives I
mean it's just a big you know it really
means that the one-sided class war
that's been going on for a long time has
to become a two-sided class war I'm in
the business class that have never had
any illusion about this they are very
class conscious they have always
understood that they're involved in a
very tough and brutal class war and
they've succeeded in demolishing the
opposition you know scattering them and
if that goes on no win simple is that I
don't think that you can get black
capitalism to compete with IBM that's
outlandish there are any resources there
but exactly the way to change this I
don't think it can be done within the
black community any more than Mexican
workers can resist transnationals I'm
made together with US workers they can
probably do something but not alone and
together with the rest of you know the
big majority of the American population
that's being ground down the black
sector which has special problems of its
own can do something but alone I don't
think there's much I can do so I don't
see any real answers in that narrower
framework I mean it takes the kind of
solidarity that crosses ethnic lines
actually that's something that the union
movement did have so you go back to say
a hundred years and the ethnic
hostilities within the white community
we're not you know it may often even
more rabbit than the hatred of blacks
like you know the hatred for hun what
they call Huns
which meant almost anybody from Eastern
Europe in white working-class
areas with good test no I restrained him
just like you know worst possible I take
say just give you one example at
gynecological surgery was developed in
the 19th century by Pete by very
respected doctors you know you'll see
their pictures up in the medical school
and the way they managed to do it was
because they had people to work on
namely Irish indigent women and slaves
black women slaves they treated in the
same way they take somebody and do 30
experiments in a row on them until they
were torn to shreds and so on you know
kind of like Mengele basically and they
didn't make much of a difference as far
as I can see between Irish women and
black women you know the one technically
white and the reason is these are
basically class issues well how did you
know if you look at the let's say labor
history I mean like at the homestead
strike big strike in 1892 when worker
steel workers essentially took over a
town and kind of ran the industry and so
on our finally smashed up by the army
that is the first time that it overcame
the ethnic hostilities on the word
wouldn't anymore beating down beating up
on the Huns because they were now part
of it you know they were all part of it
and that's happened in union organizing
and it's happened throughout the years
happened in the formation the CIO you
know it's happened in other activities
where people were really working on
something together and they saw that
their real interests were basically
common but outside of that you can't do
it as far as I know
I don't
which one Makia yeah I know the book
extremely easy they're complete
fabrication yeah furthermore they're
conscious fabrications are furthermore
they've been exposed if you want to I
don't even to tell you because it's in
print the book has been exposed as pure
fraud look I know the guy you know he's
an old Trotskyite who sort of shifted
sides at some stage and figuring out a
new way of puffing up as a reputation
he's actually a guy who is quite wealthy
because made a lot of money working for
said I'm was saying as he concedes no it
was he was part of an architectural firm
in London which was building monuments
were Saddam Hussein and so on now he's
trying to be the good arrow you know the
kind of Arab who will say everything's
the fault of the Arabs I mean every
oppressed community offers such people
like you can find blacks who say look
it's all the fault of the blacks okay
they're honored and they get
professorships and this and that and
makea fir up you know you don't know
it's obvious why you know and they don't
doesn't nobody cares do they tell the
truth or whether they're lying or
whatever they just have a useful social
function and we just need people now who
says look the problem with the third
world is their bad culture and you know
they're bad genes and so on and if you
can get one of those guys to come up and
do it then you know it's marvelous
everybody loves him Makia is not a fool
when he understands this and he knows
that he can write as many lies as he
likes and it'll he'll be exposed in some
scholarly journal or something but it's
not gonna have any effect and that's the
book so for example the I mean the worst
things the worst lies are not about me I
play a marginal role his worst lies are
about Arab writers I mean the main
thrust of the book if you know the book
is that you know the big problem in the
Arab world is that all the Arab
intellectuals loves that I'm Hussein and
you know
criticize themselves and they're always
and so on and so forth it's their fault
not your fault like you rich white guys
you didn't do anything don't worry about
and he goes after Arab writers well you
know who knows what some Egyptian writer
has written because it's in Arabic all
right turns out he's just flat-out lying
I mean there's a good review of this in
the professional journal of the Middle
Eastern society the middle Middle East
journal in which the guys who knows
Arabic it just goes through the writings
of the people he's referring to and he
is simply lying about them and it's not
just that he's lying these people are
not like him
they're courageous people these are
people who are fighting against
oppression and tyranny in their own
countries where they can be sent off to
jail or killed and so on they're not
saying in Cambridge you know they're not
sitting in London making money by
building monuments to saddam hussein
they're not sitting in cambridge you
know having fun these are people who are
actually fighting oppression and to lie
about them you know and claim that
they're the guys who were responsible
for it that's a level of degradation
that not many people reach with regard
to me it's a marginal issue you know he
has to he knows he knows look he's a
smart guy he knows who the official
targets are there's a certain number of
people you can tell any law you would
like about because everybody hates them
you know very rich hates them everybody
powerful and privileged and rich hates
them so you can tell as many lies as you
like that's understood and he
understands it he's not a fool so he has
alleged quotes for me if you want to
look at the what actually happened
there's a review but yeah a couple of
reviews I can say which just went
through it there's obviously they're
perfectly obvious lies I mean just take
a look at his footnotes is there
anything footnoted no there isn't
there's a footnote to a talk a
transcript of a to a talk that he claims
he heard there's nothing footnoted that
you can look up well all right the
transcript of that talk happens to have
been published okay so for example his
big I don't remember the whole story but
one of his big things is he says that I
called on I I claimed I I called on
quate to have democracy but I didn't say
it about Iraq alright you take a look at
the talk which is in printed
published by open magazine from Costa
these guys tape it and so on doesn't say
that at all what it says it ran through
the various proposals that had been made
that were on the table that many people
had made about a negotiated settlement I
just went through them all you know well
one of them happened to be for a pleb
aside and wait pardon
well he knows exactly what it was my
main proposal was that there were in
fact significant options for a
negotiated settlement in fact at the
time up until the bombing that starting
in late August Saddam Hussein had
effectively offered to withdraw and the
United States didn't want him to because
they wanted to have a war so and in fact
this was you could Eve this was mostly
suppressed in the press but the facts
are there and it's by now conceded and
the the withdrawal proposal that Saddam
Hussein had made was in fact supported
by about 60% of the American popular
two-thirds of the American population
right up to the bombing but they didn't
know they were supporting it because it
had been suppressed and my I was not
suppressing it and my proposal at the
time was we should explore it we don't
know if it's serious or not the only way
you can find out if it's serious it is
by exploring it the u.s. is refusing to
do that it has flatly refused to follow
the diplomatic track in fact factly in
late August Thomas Friedman at times
diplomatic correspondent kind of let the
cat out of the bag what he said is that
the correctly that the US wants to block
the diplomatic track he's quoting you
know somebody from the State Department
because if they pursue the diplomatic
track there might be a political
settlement with you know with basically
back the previous status quo and the US
doesn't want that because we want to
show that we can win by force very
important to show that you've got the
you know the guys with the guns are
going to win by force in my view was we
should take that we should pursue that
option and unlucky on those and so no
you can find out easily what my view was
because it's in print all over the place
here's something you can't find out what
his view is
- his book is about silence he claims
the Arabs were silent about which could
do well there was in fact one Arab who
is totally silent
come on Makia from the time of the and
you can find this out from the time of
the invasion of Kuwait up until March
6th that is after it was over there is
not a public word on this topic from
Canon Makia I mean has two or three
articles but they're mostly devoted to
things like denouncing edward's ie that
was the big issue at that time all right
but there is nothing said about what we
should do alright no it's not that he
had any problem getting in the press I
mean he would have been all over the
place in the press everybody's dying for
it look at him I you know where I was we
tried we wanted or Iraqi dissidents
there were Araki dissidents
you know it's good courageous Iraqi
dissidents not not frauds like him
and if we could ever find one we like
one one of the main ones actually came
through from London I put him on you
know I got him on a radio like I said
help I put him right on a teaching at
MIT that day we didn't get can on Makia
on the teaching because he wouldn't open
his mouth he's too busy attacking other
people for being silent now why didn't
he open his mouth good reason everybody
knows that the reason is because if he
came out against the war he would have
lost his new friends you know the rich
guys were paying for him if he came out
for the war he would have lost the last
shreds of credibility he has in the
Iraqi dissident community so what he did
was shut up in fact the only place you
can find out anything about what the
Iraqi dissidents were saying is in stuff
I wrote not in stuff he wrote couldn't
write anything in order to give any
public talks he was busy going around
back corridor spreading gossip about
people and the book is just full of
outrageous lies which have been exposed
in print if you want but it makes no
difference you know they're useful lies
so therefore they stand
[Music]
at the time well look the Sydenham was a
joke first of all then he every live in
Cambridge everybody know who he was no
it was a joke actually he wrote under
several pseudonyms everyone though who
knew who he was you know I mean it would
have taken Iraqi intelligence about 30
seconds to figure out who he was if they
didn't know the pseudonym is part of the
game by which he pretend to be
threatened you know looks really
exciting if you're writing under a
pseudonym oh my god these guys are
trying to get me meanwhile you know he's
head of an architectural firm which is
working for Saddam Hussein and everyone
knew who he was you know like a comic
strip I mean up until the early 80s he
was a kind of a militant Trotsky I know
and then he shifted if you're interested
there is stuff in the professional
literature which exposes all of this but
it's irrelevant
you know it's kind of irrelevant it's
sort of like exposing the lies of some
commissar in Stalinist Russia what's the
use I mean they're performing their
function doesn't matter and as I say the
stuff he said about me is so
insignificant I wouldn't even bother
responding the bad stuff is what he said
about people who are really you know
courageously struggling against
oppression and tough conditions to lie
about them and claim their being silent
and they're conforming that is you know
that's a lot worse than telling lies
about me and Edwards say
sorry the last thing that I saw after
1800 I didn't get the let the last part
of countervailing power yeah well first
of all about a shortage of capital I
don't really agree with that there's a
huge amount of capital floating around
international markets it's just changed
in character in fact there's the World
Bank their latest estimate is about 14
trillion dollars of capital in
international transactions that's way
beyond what it used to be it's just
shooting up however it's it's characters
changed if you go back to 1970 about 90%
of the capital used in international
exchanges and stuff was for investment
and trade about 10% speculation by 1990
those figures had reversed it was 90
percent speculation and 10 percent
trade the last estimate I've seen which
is by a pretty good international
economist David Felix is that today it's
gotten to 5% investment in trade and 95%
speculation so what's happened is a huge
growth in the amount of capital but a
complete shift in its you know a really
radical shift and what it's used for
it's used for speculation against for
currencies really well you know there's
some reasons for them the reason there a
lot of reasons one major reason is that
in ninth in the early 1970s the u.s.
dismantled the Bretton Woods system the
written Wood system which was set up
after the Second World War was a system
for regulation of International Finance
so the basic idea is that the dollar you
know the United States had all the money
in the world at that time so the dollar
was fixed against gold and other
currencies were fixed against the dollar
and there were various mechanisms to
adjust
in there you know when you had problems
well that system made the us basically
the world's banker and it was it was an
enormous shot in the arm for US
corporations in fact that started off
multinational corporations which were
mostly us at the time it enabled them to
take over a large part of the world
economy
however by around 1970 the US couldn't
sustain that role anymore and since
we're the big guys and we do what we
feel like Nixon just dismantled simply
dismantle the system well ever since
then it's been a system of you know
array of unregulated international
exchanges and of course it's gone
totally insane you know it's one of the
leading international economists Susan
strange of the University of London
called or London School of Economics I
guess called the casino capitalism the
way you make money now is by speculating
against currencies and the
telecommunications revolution which came
along in between makes it really easy to
do this very fast so last estimates I
saw there's more than a trillion dollars
a day moving from one financial market
to another
well that just completely overwhelms the
total resources of even rich countries
along minor ones that's why you get the
headlines you get in the newspapers
these days when the US economy starts to
grow a little bit there's fear you know
they're always worried about the fear of
growth you know like there might be jobs
and there might be production and that's
a problem you got to stop that so
therefore the Fed raises interest rates
I mean I'm you know I'm not telling you
anything you don't know it's in the
front page of the newspaper all the time
well yeah that's because speculative
capital wants stable currencies they
don't want you know they know an
inflation because then they lose if you
have if you're in the bond market and
stuff so what you've got is this all
this fantastic speculation against any
currency that might if some country even
a rich one like the United States you
know the top one but certainly any
smaller one if they start to carry out
national economic program programs that
would say stimulate the economy or
redistribute or something like that
they're going to get an attack on their
currency which will destroy because
governments can't withstand this anymore
there's too much capital around and it's
too free and therefore we're going to
have to back off those policies so
there's basically no national economic
planning this is control
I'm in a tall folker who's the former
head of the Federal Reserve were just
did ran a study chaired a study on this
where they attribute about 50% a very
sharp decline in the growth rate
worldwide since 1970 and they attribute
about 50% of that decline just to the
effect of speculative markets James
Tobin who's another Nobel Prize winning
economist came out a couple years ago
the proposal for I think it's a sensible
proposal actually the UN may take it up
so it may actually hit the papers in
which case Wall Street go berserk but he
came out with a very sensible proposal
for a attacks on international financial
transactions meaning like if you shift
your money you know from francs to you
know Marx or something because you're
speculating against maybe someone's
changing the interest rate there should
be a tax on that and that would have the
effect of slowing down financial markets
and tending to make it more attractive
to use money for the use funds for
investment than trade you know things
that do something and maybe that would
have an I mean it's gonna be really hard
to get that through because you've got
huge financial power now which is
blogging it but I think that's what's
going on I don't think it's a shortage
of capital by any means it's just a
complete shift in the composition of it
and what it's doing very radical shift a
lot of work on this incidentally and
it's a big problem I didn't mention it
my talk as it wasn't time but that's one
of the major factors that's changed the
world world economy radically there was
a last part which I forgot
countervailing power well you know
that's what I ended up saying I mean
countervailing power has to be popular
power I mean that's what unions were you
know that's what Chapas Mexico is that's
what you know popular organizations in
Haiti are I mean that's countervailing
power if it reaches a sufficient scale
it'll make a difference doesn't reach a
sufficient scale I'll make a difference
there isn't gonna be any other
countervailing power nor has there ever
been in the past you know it's the way
history works
at the what yeah there were some SPI on
police right I agree I was I was putting
that aside I don't were you at the you
know no you're too young
sorry yeah yeah they actually were very
few it was pretty dramatic I think there
were maybe it doesn't in foul in
probably thousand comment answers your
first question yes that's it that's it
you know like I mean I spend yeah okay
look I mean I spent an enormous amount
of time doing things like giving talks
all over the place pardon what's the
effect well the effect I yeah oh sorry I
thought
[Music]
yeah
[Music]
[Music]
yeah I mean I can't comment on style and
technique that's for you to decide you
know you're the judge not me
but the last point is basically accurate
I mean if you just have information and
you don't do anything about it you might
as well read comic books so the only
point of all of this activity which a
lot of people I'm one of them have been
involved in for years and years is to
try to be part of active ongoing popular
movements actually tell the truth talk
any differently when I talk to poor
people in Nicaragua or the West Bank and
Palestine or anywhere else and you can
discover that if you like by reading
what I write because some of what I've
written comes straight from there for
example the book that I'm I just
somebody mentioned a book that I'm
coming out with that happened to be
delivered based on lectures delivered in
Cairo at about ten years ago it's based
on lectures of the delivery in Managua
mostly to non you know to non-academic
audiences just people who could somehow
figure out a way to get there while the
electricity was off and I don't talk any
differently maybe it's the right way
maybe it's the wrong way I don't know
it's the only way I know how to do it
and the only so if there's a better way
to do it you know I think people are to
do it in the better way but the main
point is if it's not part if it's just
something you store away in the back
your head and you say I wasn't that
interesting and then you go on it the
rest of your life it was a waste of time
in fact I was going to say before I
realized that your question hadn't been
ended that for which I apologize that I
you know I spend a lot of time giving
talks often you know it'll be some State
University with 2,500 people there and
stuff and one thing that has struck me
over and over again during over the
years is that nobody very few people or
sometimes no one is set up for a follow
up like there are plenty of people who
when they hear something about the world
they don't like want to do something
about it
but they do not know what to do and
there's only only people who can tell
them what to do are the people who are
doing it in that place you know the
people who are sitting outside mattingly
or you know whatever the right where it
is the discs and giving out the
literature and telling them once you
come to a meeting next week and here's
what we're working on those people can
tell you what to do and if they're not
there it's just like you say it's you
know maybe changes the way you look at
things but it's not useful so for
example this I gave of talk not unlike
this in Geneva a couple of weeks ago
organized by the Women's International
League in scintilla and it was month was
all third-world people you know it's
third world people involved it would
mostly exiles and so on same kind of
talk and that's basic and they were
asking the same kind of questions what
do we do about and there's always the
same answer you know you have to decide
what to do about and if there aren't
efforts to really follow it up and they
always have to be local because there's
no other way to do it then yes you're
exactly right it's mostly a waste of all
the right time
Genovese II well I thought that I knew I
know now what I knew when I was 10 years
old
I mean I knew it I know it more detail
now but when I was in 10 years old I
already knew well enough that Lenin and
Trotsky had destroyed quickly you know
within months every socialist element in
the pre Bolshevik period and that they
had done it for quite principled reasons
they were or the two kinds of reasons
partly they were Orthodox Marxists and
it was against the iron laws of history
and all that kind of stuff which you
know if you know the Marxist Canon for a
revolution to take place in Russia they
were running kind of holding action
until it took place in Germany at which
point they'd be a backwater and part of
the reason was because they were just
brutal authoritarians of a kind -
bakunin had talked about 50 years before
when he said that you know the segments
of the intellectual class is going to
use the popular movements as a technique
for gaining power gaining state power
and then they'll create the most brutal
autocracy in human history while
destroying every socialist tendency and
they were part of that and if this
wasn't obvious to you and I mean it was
obvious to me when I was 10 years old
you know without knowing a lot of facts
back around 1940s at 12 years old
exaggerated at that point I certainly
understood it pretty well and now I know
more fact you know I don't know any more
about the gulag because I already read
George Maximoff and plenty of stuff that
was around at that time you know it's
much probably more accurate than what's
around today and I know the same thing
now so you know it's the as far as the
end of the Soviet tyranny is concerned
that's a gain for socialism and it's
just like the fault Hitler was a gain
for socialism it eliminates a barrier to
it now Jean Genovese he has a different
history he was Stalinist all his life so
you know until a couple of years ago he
he was a very as he says know
correct it was a deeply committed
Stalinist as for the editors of descent
they were a little different they were
committed Leninists including Irving how
until around 1950 so like about when
they were grown up already they were
considerably older than I was but they
were certainly old enough then to have
understood what should have been obvious
to anyone act it should have been
obvious in 1920 but I wasn't around then
and it was obvious to people in 1920 it
was obvious to Bertrand Russell you know
it was obvious to Rosa Luxemburg it was
obvious to the major intellectuals of
the Socialist Movement like anthem
Pannekoek and others the leading
intellectual the second international
way on the left of Lenin incidentally I
was certainly obvious to the libertarian
socialists the whole anarchist movement
and independent socialists like Russell
oh that was obvious by you know
certainly 1920 no later if people have
insisted on hanging on as Trotskyists or
Stalinists means they just were Poe
anti-socialist well okay for those guys
to come along now and tell people who
always were opposed to this stuff that
they've discovered something that's nice
you know but I'm not interested because
I knew it when I was 10 years old what
more is there to say I mean they want to
play their game for obvious reasons but
it's not any game that we should be
involved in in my opinion we should
recognize what I think is true I've
written about it plenty myself that the
Bolshevik Revolution was so-called
revolution it was really a coup was
really a counter-revolution which placed
state power in the hands of a highly
authoritarian anti-socialist group which
within a couple of months had destroyed
the factory councils had destroyed the
Soviets had dismissed the Constituent
Assembly because they know they're gonna
lose and had eliminated every popular
movement and had done exactly what
Trotsky said turned the country into a
labor army under the control of the
maximal leader that was mid 1918 I mean
since then there hasn't been a shred of
socialism in the Soviet Union now of
course they called it socialism but they
also called it democracy you know they
were people's democracy is the purest
form of democracy they were social
the less the West the big propaganda
system in the world of course just
laughed at the democracy part but it
loved the socialism part because that's
a way to defame socialism so if you
think that the fall of the Soviet Union
is a blow to socialism you ought to also
think on the same grounds that it's a
blow to democracy after all they call
themselves democracies too so why isn't
a bloated democracy makes it much sense
it's only when it gets filtered through
the Western propaganda system that it's
not a bloated democracy but it is a blow
to socialism but you know there's
actually no reason to play that game
whether you play it in dissent or in the
nation or on the right or anywhere else
expose it for the fraud that it is what
ideology the ideology of totalitarianism
yeah it's deeply flawed I mean they were
the initial modern totalitarian it's not
as many do socialism they destroyed
socialism within weeks you know then
wait by 1918 it was finished and they
knew it you know like it's not a secret
they knew it I mean in fact Lenin as
soon as you know as soon as he sort of
got grips of things after her he said
let's be moved to what he called state
capitalism socialism socialism I mean
you can argue about what there's no
point arguing what the word means but
what it always meant that the core was
that producers take control of
production no working people take
control of production what's sometimes
called industrial democracy that was the
absolute core of it well you know there
was more socialism in Germany in Western
Europe than there wasn't Russia no
Russia's about the most anti socialist
place you can imagine since 1918 had
wage labor had super exploitation had no
element of workers control or
involvement or participation pure know
what socialism is the exact opposite on
every point as I say the West liked to
call that socialism while laughing at
the fact that they called themselves
Democrats but that's for purely
propaganda reasons I mean unless you're
committed to being part of the Western
propaganda system there's nothing to say
about that issue if this
except to laugh and let me stress again
that these guys who are now praising the
half of the articles in their praise
themselves and the people who are
praising themselves were Leninists up
until nineteen fifty they have nothing
to praise themselves about
if I ever hurt anyone there have been a
couple of really freaky far-out polyp
parties that have occasionally asked me
to run for a vice president or something
well you know we spoke on the telephone
yeah yeah I mean you know we had long
talks about lots of things sure I mean
I'm perfectly happy say what I think
then you want to say exactly saying all
right what I say here is exactly what I
say to everybody no I mean doesn't
really change much so if somebody who
wants to have I mean I look I've given
talks to the State Department no I was
invited about seven or eight years ago I
guess there's a thing at the State
Department called the open forum which
as you can guess means the closed for
but it's open in the sense that outside
speakers are allowed in you know to talk
to the inside people and there was a guy
actually happened to be black and he
also happened get fired soon after I
don't know if this is correlated but he
was running the open forum for a while
and he invited me down to give a talk
about central US policy in Central
America I couldn't turn that one down
this is right at the peak of the worst
atrocities and everything else so I went
naturally and I gave a talk which is
virtually the same as the kind that's a
bunch of you have you know that you've
taped and what other people have heard
and so on I mean it was a little
different because in order to what in
order to
avoid irrelevant discussion I kept
strictly to US government documents so I
didn't say any I didn't make any factual
claim unless it came out of an internal
document and they're damning enough you
know so I spoke only from the point of
view of the internal records there would
be no discussion about authenticity and
other than that and the conclusions come
out exactly this name you know I was
very strong so I had a huge number of
people they were very enthusiastic they
all came up afterwards asked me to sign
their books and that goes like any talk
at any you know popular group the only
thing is they were all secretaries and
you know like junior aide officials and
people like that I mean there were a
couple of ambassadors around the edge
any noise talking about yeah I had lunch
with the policy planning staff
afterwards it was like lunch with any
faculty group I mean they're off you
know even though it's happening in the
world
no but sure I'm happy to talk to but
that's the limit it's never gonna get
beyond that unless they decide to commit
suicide which I don't see any reason why
they should do last two more
[Music]
oh they're not running out I mean maybe
you're you know brain maybe but not ear
i'm saudi arabia's got yeah I mean look
the look the oil corporations are always
looking for oil and they have there
haven't been a lot of surprises about
this I mean if you go back to their
records in the late 40s you know they
mama didn't have everything straight but
they pretty much knew and now they know
more the reason why there's more
diversification after 1973 when the oil
price went up doesn't have anything to
do with discovering the oil it has to do
with the fact that the the oil companies
and indeed the US government were not so
much very much
in fact the oil companies were very
favorable about the it was that was when
the oil price quadrupled remember in
1973 the oil companies were all for it
and the US government was kind of
ambivalent you know the reason why the
oil companies were for it was because as
the oil price goes up their profits go
up even faster and furthermore when the
oil prices got up high enough as they
finally did in 1973 they were able to
bring online much more expensive oil
that they'd already had like Alaska and
or North Sea but it was just it couldn't
make enough profit by selling it but now
they were able to sell it and that
effect gives you the illusion of
diversification but it's mostly illusion
you know the other though there's some
as far as Africa is concerned yes you're
there
they're looking all over the place but
they haven't found a lot and the
business about Somali I think was a
misleading thing I mean what was pointed
out at the time and a lot of people
thought was important at the time of the
us and you know intervention somebody
wrote an article guy in the Los Angeles
Times pointing out something that was
true and a lot of people on the Left
picked it up but I thought it's totally
irrelevant he pointed out that all the
oil American oil companies are there
that's true and they were the one
probably the moans were most opposed to
the intervention because the only effect
that the intervention is to make their
operations harder you know I mean their
intervention it was obvious in advanced
was going to end up being a catastrophe
and it was going to end up leading to a
lot of American anti-americanism for
good reasons you know you murder a lot
of people they don't like you and it was
just going to make it harder for these
guys to work there was no way the US
intervention was going to improve their
possibilities of getting oil out of
Somalia and it didn't so that was I just
don't think that was even a minor factor
in fact if anything a negative was
probably a negative factor in the
intervention
oh sure yeah look I'm sure they would
but you know I mean when the Marines go
in you know they're gonna see if there's
a white face around some guy you know
I'll say yeah I'll stick my office in
your place I mean yeah look wouldn't you
do it I mean you would do it too so
would I if we were playing that game but
I just don't think that means anything I
mean the net effect if this stuff was
probably to harm the operations of the
oil companies I mean we'll know better
thirty years from now and there's
documents around but it just doesn't
look plausible and yes but the first
thing he said is true sure they're
looking for oil all over the world I
mean actually there are big sources
available now for one thing the you know
the biggest resource still is
essentially the Arabian Peninsula but
there's a huge amount of oil in the
former Soviet Union which nobody's tried
to get much yet mainly because it's too
expensive so you know there's apparently
real technical problems in getting oil
from say Siberia you got to worry about
permafrost and that's expensive no so
they'll only go for those sources of oil
when the cheap ones are running out they
are getting oil now from Central Asia
you know which was part of the reason
the oil prices are going down is because
a lot of oil from the Russian Empire is
entering world markets through Western
corporations but I think that the worst
anything that's known from Africa where
I don't know where
I left
about the Israel
yeah well you know it's even speaking of
US aid Israel is misleading because
that's off the chart so I think we
shouldn't consider that aid that's a
special category
I mean is it I mean like it's like
giving it's as if we were giving aid to
you know New York City you know I mean
Israel is just a totally owned
subsidiary you know it does jobs for us
and we finance it that's not really aid
the jobs it does are several there's a
local regional job namely it's one of
the regional jhand arms which
incidentally helps protect the ruling
monarchies and on the oil dictatorships
so you know they're totalitarian states
so we don't get documents from them but
if we ever do get anything I'm sure
we'll discover that Saudi Arabia and
Israel have been pals for years no and
in fact there's enough evidence around
the indicator the u.s. system for the
region which was just taking over from
the British is that the there are local
managers you know who have to be weak
because you have to make sure they're
going to do what you say and their job
is to ensure that the wealth of the
region goes to the West not for the
people of the region okay that's the
Saudi Arabian dictators and you know
guys who run quate and so on and there's
plenty of documentation on this but you
got to somehow protect them from the
people of the region because the people
of the region have never quite
understood why the wasting wealth of
that region should go to the west not to
them they're you know they don't
understand so they cause trouble and you
therefore have to control them somehow
so there's been a network of regional
Jean de armes what were called under the
Nixon Doctrine and local cops on the
beat who kept order and that was their
youth it's better to have them be non
Arabs because non Arabs are better at
killing Arabs for various reasons so
it's been Israel Turkey Pakistan
ran under the Shah that was Iran's main
function in fact it was a tripartite
alliance between Iran Israel and Saudi
Arabia about which we know fair amount
and then of course in the background
there's the US and Britain with all the
muscle in case anything goes wrong so
that's the system and people who are in
that system have rights you know so the
local managers have rights obviously the
regional John Doe arms have to be
maintained in fact you look at USA
what's called USA the top recipient
which is off the chart as I said is
Israel the second one is now Egypt ever
since they became one of the you know
helpers in the region the next one is
Turkey which is another one the next one
for a long time is in Pakistan in fact
all the states that it used to be Iran
you know we lost around they'd like to
get it back it's it's the states that
surround that region are aimed at it you
know how to keep the people under
control Israel over the years has also
ended up doing other services since the
60s it's so dependent on the United
States it's like a almost totally what
affiliate it just and it has you know
the things it can do they're extremely
good at militaries it's a highly
militarized state it's a technologically
fairly sophisticated quite sophisticated
state so it can get very much involved
in massacres and torture and terror and
so on when the US can't do it directly
okay so like there was a time when
popular pressures in the United States
around the late seventies and early
eighties popular pressures in the United
States were high enough so the US could
not directly participate in these near
genocidal slaughters in Guatemala
so they got Israel to do it for them and
they moved right in and they took over
and there's no protests and so on and so
forth so there's that kind of stand
that's all over the world
I mean they you know that's the way they
got Idi Amin in power and kept him there
- in Africa for years I mean you know
it's in the fill it's been true in the
Philippines patrol all over the place
mainly Latin America so those are
secondary services as long as they
perform the services they'll let us
support as far as the Palestinians are
concerned they play note and you know
they just don't offer anything there are
many well there are many power follows
in are many rights therefore the US has
always been opposed to any political
settlement that was recognized
Palestinian rights now here the
intellectual community again has had
including the press has had to be
extremely disciplined but the most
elementary fact about this thing is that
for 25 years almost actually since 1971
the US has just been blocking any
diplomatic settlement in the Middle East
any single every single one has been
blocked by the United States since 1971
and the reason is they all involve
something or other for the Palestinians
and the US won't have that the current
agreement one of the achievements of the
Gulf War in fact you know one of the
reasons why the u.s. insisted on the war
was that it did show the world that we
are going to run this region by force
in fact George Bush put it pretty well
when he defined a new world order
he said the slogan of the new world
order is what we say goes if you don't
believe it look at the missiles falling
on Baghdad
okay everybody understood you know smart
people here but anybody mattered
understood and they all capitulated so
you know Arab world backed off the third
world backed off Europe backed off
Europe had always been calling for some
kind of diplomatic settlement they
stopped and what was left was us
rejection isn't nothing else it's the
Oslo agreement Oslo agreement is
traditional us Israeli rejection ISM to
a team Israel does what feels like the
Israeli us Israeli plan has always been
that Israel should essentially run the
occupied territories in fact what they
have set up now is something like what
the South African set up in 1959
it's not the end of apartheid it's the
beginning of apartheid
they've essentially set up banter stands
which will be under you know which will
have nominal independent they'll be very
small they're Canton's couple of kin
towns around like Gaza it's not Gaza
Strip yeah as a city as a canton Jericho
is a Canton when they move a little
further knob loose and talk to a Carmel
be Canton's they don't to administer the
population you know they never wanted to
have responsibility for the population
that's a nuisance what they wanted is
the resources the usable land you know
the cheap labor and so on and I'll take
it the other things although you know
maybe they'll even call them states like
South Africa called its thing States and
the United States will recognize it no
and since we recognize them so well
everybody else in the world because we
have the guns but basically it's kind in
fact Israeli commentators have pointed
this out quite you read it in the
Israeli press very explicitly by their
smart people you know I give you some
example if you like and it's exactly
right it's not like the end of apartheid
it's like the beginning of apartheid and
that's why everyone is so euphoric about
it here us caught what it wanted as the
guys with the guns usually get what they
want for the Palestinians complete
disaster on you know except in the sense
that maybe the I mean Israel still
torturing systematically there's just a
report that came out from Middle East
watch a couple of weeks ago about the
continuing systematic torture but why
should they stop other guys who were
funding the mark on us about about the
US aid so-called going to fund the
settlements he of course what else is it
for I mean obviously it goes for the
settlement I mean you know it's a
bookkeeping trick whether you say it's
going for the settlements or something
else it's the same money you know you
can take the money and use it for
internal things inside the green line
and say look you guys are funding the
settlements we're funding them with
money that's released by what you're
doing inside the Green Line that's a
joke you know that's for you know that's
for journalists and things but of course
the you your taxes are funding
settlements they always have no
continued to as long as you agree you
any USA that go to Israel is completely
illegal under US law I mean
completely illegal but so is most of
every I mean there are laws that say you
can't give aid the countries that are
systematically abusing human rights I
mean you can't give aid the countries
that are involved in nuclear
proliferation there's all kind of laws
if anybody bothered with them all the
aids illegal but it's not relevant
you know it'll become relevant if people
here start to care about it they don't
they'll try to get him back in a couple
of months aid will start and maybe six
months or so what they're saying now
it'll go to the business sectors meaning
he can't do anything for his
constituency they're intimidated and
decimated then you'll be able to run
he'll then he's going to leave very
quickly you can then run a free election
and we have a lot of experience with
that I mentioned the one in Guatemala
you know there are a lot of others like
it will run a free election everybody's
scared out of their wit's
they vote the way you tell them to if
they bother vote at all and they know
that if you don't you know your children
are gonna get cut in pieces and left in
a ditch so therefore you vote the right
way and then you know the press here
writes about the romantic age you know
Thomas Jefferson's back and so on and so
forth you can see that you can write the
scenario right now you know because
we've been through it so many times no
we've been through it over and over
again its exception was occasionally
something goes wrong like there actually
is a free election by mistake like in
Haiti and then you quickly act to make
sure that's not gonna happen again
that's history you know it's got nothing
to do with the Cold War went on before
the Cold War it's going on after the
Cold War the only effect of the Cold
War's to change the pretext you know so
you shift the rhetoric around a little
and it happens for very good reasons
that's what's been happening in Haiti
and I think there's every reason to
think that's what's going to happen if
we let it happen
we don't have to agree to this you know
it's like it's not laws of nature
these are human decisions made within
human institutions
maybe they did or maybe they didn't but
they acted at once to ensure that it
stayed in so they undercut the embargo I
talked about that meanwhile they're sort
of standing by while they're guys we
talked about professionalizing the
security forces who professionalized
them in the first place you know they
were set up by the United States when we
invaded the country before as an army to
repress the population ever since then
the top officer corps has been trained
by the United States including the guys
who are doing the killing right now
they're all trained in Fort Benning and
the School of the Americas and so on in
fact the Haitian officers were seen
there's a church group that monitors
Fort Benning School of the Americas and
according to them they there have been
Haitian officers there as recently as 11
months ago right in the middle of all
the atrocities the so they're going to
be professionalized by the same guys who
taught them in the first place and
they'll teach them how to do a little
better next time our Steven wanted the
army to be reduced in the u.s. blocked
that that's been one of the things that
held up negotiations actually you can
read about that in an article but in
foreign policy one of the main foreign
policy journals but Ian Martin who was
the head of the UN OAS mission who
points out that you know what was
holding things up was that the u.s.
insisted on maintaining the military
while the other countries Canada and
France and so on we're trying to support
our steeds effort to cut it back and
they aren't the army leaders wanted the
United States to take control because
they trusted the United States to work
for their interests they didn't trust
Canada and France and the other guys as
much and that's gonna happen so the Army
stays in but it was stopped
they stopped any aid for investment any
constructive aid stopped because they
were gonna make a profit out of it the
aid simply went to the business
community to enable them to set up
counter forces to the popular movement
the National Endowment for democracy
which is a bipartisan thing went in and
any reader of Orwell knows what National
Endowment for democracy is going to be
and it is they moved in to try to set up
alternative things that would weaken the
executive you know so alternative groups
that would try to undercut the popular
organizations and again by one of those
strange coincidences these are group
exactly the ones that survived to ku
while the others were destroyed and they
then filled the offices after the coup
the seven months that our state was in
office were very frightening I mean not
only was it a popular movement that that
pushed him in but he was also being
extremely successful I mean he even
successful by conservative World Bank
standards so like the inter-american
Development Bank you know which is not a
radical outfit
was writing very positive reports of
cutting down the bureaucracy and you
know getting rid of corruption and
starting a functioning economy again and
so on and that's even worse because he
started getting international funding
which means the place might fall out of
u.s. controlled totally unacceptable so
this guy obviously had to go really bad
news and the only question was how okay
there was the coup right after the coup
as I mentioned the u.s. essentially
supported the cada I don't say they
planned coup what the u.s. did as soon
as soon as the rst government came in it
was a big surprise remember nobody
expected that election the u.s. hadn't
had a candidate even the World Bank
official they figured he'll sweep over
everything because he had all the
resources and all the rich people backed
him and as far as they knew there was
nothing else you know who pays attention
to what's going on in the slums the so
they figured it'll be a walkover like
everything else and to their amazement
there was this vibrant lively civil
society out there which managed to get a
presidential candidate in incidentally
they weren't organized enough and rich
enough to get parliamentary candidates
in so that's why you read the commentary
now about how you know our state is this
kind of impossible guy who can't deal
with the Parliament yeah sure because
the Parliament is the old guys who we
put in power forever you know the rich
killers and so on that's the subtext but
they did manage to get a presidential
candidate in so the u.s. began at once
at once trying to undermine him at one
thing wait a minute like they've been a
lot of the US has a picture of what
Haiti ought to be it ought to be
basically an export platform for you
know assembly plants using super cheap
labor and there's been a whole
project about this us8 had been pouring
money in for that and they called it an
economic miracle and it was I mean wages
went down about 50% and profits went up
about as fast that's what an economic
miracle is and this was all blocked by
this election so you USA did continue
but the economy is going to be driven
away from the populist reforms back
towards you know the pre 1990 system our
steed may be allowed in for cosmetic
reasons a centerpiece of Clinton's
speech the other night if you heard it
you know when he was sort of trying to
build up some steam for the invasion one
of the rhetorical centerpieces of it was
his statement that you know our state
has shown himself to be a true Democrat
namely he has committed himself to step
down in 1995 you know and not and not to
run again for office as the Constitution
demands and that as far as I can see
there is not gonna whisper of comment
about that in the American press the
obvious has been pointed out in the
Canadian press the obvious is that the
Constitution does say that he's got a
five-year term but it doesn't say what
happens if three years of that five-year
term are spent in Washington while the
guys who were trained by the United
States and estimating your popular
support than say anything about that so
you can interpret it in two ways if you
really have a passionate hatred for
democracy you'll interpret it as meaning
he goes after the five years if you
believe in democracy you'll say he when
he gets back in if ever he'll pick up
where he left off and finish up the
five-year term but I can't find anyone
and then any commentator in the United
States yet whose hatred of democracy is
so limited that they can even see this
point no so he's out you know he'll come
back and I'm not
