are they in business to try to undermine
themselves
these are big corporate structures are
they in business to try to help people
under mine them you know it doesn't take
a genius to figure out they're not doing
that they're in business to try to make
you passive and obedient
just like the school system is which has
the same power source that should be
understood by everybody now that in
itself doesn't get you an avenue to
truth but it tells you where to start
start by being very skeptical than
anything that comes to you from any sort
of power system and in fact you should
also be skeptical about everything else
you should be skeptical though I'm
telling you why should you believe a
word of it you know I got my own axe to
grind so figure it out for yourself you
know and there is no other answer
anymore than there is when you're
studying science like when I teach my
Nick tomorrow I'm gonna be teaching
graduate courses at MIT and you know
students know they're not supposed to
believe me if they believe me they
you're not gonna yeah we wouldn't pass
them you know they have to challenge
what they hear and figure out what's
wrong with it and you know do it better
and so on in the Natural Sciences that's
taken for granted actually that's one
reason I like MIT and stay there it
doesn't have the atmosphere of the
humanities and the social sciences it
has the atmosphere of the Natural
Sciences and even though the people can
be extremely reactionary it's a much
more honest place just because you're
driven by the values of the Natural
Sciences and everybody should be you
know that's just ordinary rationality I
don't think you have to teach it to
people either I think if they beat it
out of their heads like I think children
understand it
thank you for coming
you
okay if we can be a little yeah we'll be
a little late yeah okay yeah okay I'll
try to be brief er okay let's not waste
any time you actually I'm gonna be
talking about that in that thing later
and I will expand on it a lot but if you
think about classical liberalism it was
based on the idea of I mean like for
example why was Adam Smith in favor of
markets he was in favor of markets he
gave a kind of a complicated argument
for markets but at the core of it was
the idea that if you had perfect Liberty
markets would lead to perfect equality
and that's why he was in favor of
markets because he thought that people
ought to be completely equal completely
equal and that the reason is that his
being a classical liberal he recognized
that people's fundamental character
involved notions like sympathy and
solidarity and right to control their
own work and so on and so forth so the
exact opposite of capitalism you know in
fact there's there are no two points of
view more antithetical than classical
liberalism in capitalism that's why when
the University of Chicago publishes a
bicentennial edition of Smith they have
to distort the text which they did in
fact if you read George stigler's
introduction to the Bicentennial Edition
its diametrically opposed to the text on
point after point I mean the extent of
the distortion this is a scholarly
edition you know University of Chicago
Bicentennial so it's kind of interesting
to look at it for example you know if
Smith is famous for what he wrote about
division of labor supposed to have
thought that division of labor was a
great thing
well he didn't he thought the vision of
labor was a terrible thing and in fact
he says that in any civilized country
society the government is going to have
to intervene to prevent division of
labor from simply destroying people well
take a look at the index you
detailed index for this scholarly
edition of Adam Smith and you find that
and take a look under division of labor
you won't find an entry for that passage
it's not there in the index okay well
you know that's real scholarship
I mean suppress the facts totally you
know and present them as the opposite of
what they are and figure probably
nobody's gonna read the page 473 any
because I didn't you know ask those guys
who edited it if they were read the page
473 answer well they probably read the
first paragraph and then sort of
remembered what they'd been taught and
you know some college course
that's right I mean it's just it's
you're actually right I mean they've
lived through their whole life being
taught to obey authority when you tried
to question things you were beaten down
or kicked out and we all went through
schools you know unlike I remember my
own schooling if the history teacher
told you something you thought was
pretty stupid and you raised your hand
you said I don't agree with that I think
it's wrong you're gonna be sent to the
principal or some bad thing had happened
to you you know on the other hand they
could just copy down whatever idiocy
said and then regurgitate it on the next
exam and then forget about it you were
okay and you learn that very quickly you
know and it ends up with a kind of both
it first it changes people you become
obedient the other thing is it filters
people people who aren't obedient get in
real trouble I mean I I taught children
to you know children of me and you can
see I mean there are some who just don't
take your word for it and the you know
it's kind of very unfortunate tendency
is to try to beat them down because
they're a pain in the neck you know but
what they ought to be is encouraged yeah
why I take my word for it you know come
on you know figure it out you know I was
lucky to go to a progressive school when
I was a kid I went to a Dewey 8
experimental school and there it was
done routinely little children were
encouraged to challenge everything and
you sort of worked on your own you're
supposed to think things through was a
real experience in fact was quite a
striking change when I went to the I
went there from about age you know one
and a half up till 12 and then I went it
ended you know I went to this City High
School which was the pride of the city
system you know the one what's called
these days a magnet school you know like
the one school for academically or
kids were gonna work on their own anyway
so naturally had the worst teachers you
know it was considered the cinah cure of
the system if you were tired of teaching
you could go to that school because
those kids are gonna study anyhow they
all want to get into college
right and there was the dumbest most
ridiculous place I've ever been it was
like fully into a black hole or
something but the move the transition
was so sharp you know it really made it
had an effect in fact that was the first
time I learned I was a good student you
know when it was very competitive of
course because yeah it's one of the ways
of controlling people is making things
very competitive so everybody's ranked
no and you know exactly where you are
yeah third in the class or maybe did you
move up this now the fourth there's
nothing like that and that all of this
isn't kid people's heads you know and so
I quickly suddenly learned I'm a good
student the issue had never arisen in
twelve years of schooling ten years of
schooling before that because everybody
was you know encouraged to do what they
could you know do their best and you
sort of help people and stuff like that
so the question never come up you know
as soon as you get into these systems
immediately you're ranked it's
competitive you got a beat down the guy
next to you and all of those are
techniques of enforced obedience there's
nothing necessary about it I mean there
are other kinds of schooling which don't
happen you know in fact I know because I
went through it in fact as a teacher I
was also teaching in that framework you
know with a kind of do it an educational
framework and it can certainly be done
you know it's it's not very remote from
our experience you know it's like very
close but how you break it down after 10
years of 15 years of going through this
stuff that's hard actually it's hard in
the sciences you know one of the things
you have to teach people inside you go
to a place like MIT say where I think I
mean students have to learn that it
doesn't matter and in fact like there's
a the you know one of the most famous
physicists in the world a guy named
Vicky Vice cops who just retired you
know really super physicist he used to
always teach the freshmen courses at MIT
in physics and he was famous for saying
on the first day you know students would
ask him what are we gonna cover and he
would answer it doesn't matter what you
cover it matters what you discover you
know so we're not gonna bother with
facts you can read a book and find
we're gonna learn how to discover things
no well yeah that's what you have to
teach people in Sciences and and when
you get to a high level place like MIT
it's mostly its apprenticeship no kind
of science is like learning how to be a
carpenter I mean you work with somebody
who somehow knows how to do it and you
kind of get the idea the intuitions
maybe the professor makes up the facts
it goes along because if they're wrong
you can look up a handbook and get them
right it's not important and that's the
same sort of thing that has to be done
another field
English
in all
interesting that it's called new methods
no those the old methods no like
tracking as a new thing it's reaiiy
don't know exactly when it starts but if
some of you are in education tell me
what I know that tracking you know
breaking kids into several tracks at the
early stages that's something new like
when my dad wasn't true and when I was a
kid everybody was together I mean you
didn't know who was a slow learner who
was a fast learner you know you just
learned you know he helped each other so
the when my kids were in school by the
time they were in third grade they were
ranking every friend of theirs as smart
and dumb why because some of the smart
one they were told this guy's smart he's
in third grade you know he's in the top
track this one dumb you know he's an old
low track and somebody else in the
middle track I mean you know there's a
mind boggling but this is something new
so going back to putting what are called
slow learners meaning just people who
are interested in different things and
whatever they else they do in one place
yeah this is obvious in fact most
educational resources should be going to
people who are you know having some
problems we can't just do it on their
own or who don't come from a family
where it's all done for them anyhow I
mean most of what you learn you learn at
home you know and those of us who were
lucky enough to come from you know
families that valued education or had
resources or were you know so on you
just do it on your own I mean no matter
how rotten a teaching is but they're
kids who don't have those advantages and
they're the ones who would have have the
you know the resources as to teaching in
black English that's a it's a tricky
question it's like teaching an in Evin
backing there's just another language
you know I mean if black people on the
corporation's black English would be
considered mainstream English and what
you and I talk it be called some weird
dialect no this is just question of who
owns who owns the place
it's just another language you know and
the the question of whether to teach in
the native language or in a foreign
language is always a tricky question in
any society like for example take say to
Germany modern to say most of the people
in Germany don't speak German that be
taught German
and now it's less true than it was a
generation ago but generation ago is
completely true I mean a person from
Bavaria and a person from North West
Germany couldn't even understand each
other they not the same way they all had
to be taught German the standard
language and then a question arises do
you teach the schools in their actual
language which may be the variant or do
you teach the schools in the standard
language that you're trying to inculcate
into them because it's a technique of
advancement in a way of getting into the
larger society and so on and those are
conflicts of goals I don't think there's
an easy answer to them there's an
advantage to studying in your native
language naturally what you know you
want to learn how to read it's easier to
learn in your native language than in a
foreign language on the other hand
there's a disadvantage to learning in
your native language and we are gonna be
more remote from the centers of power
and you have to figure out how to
evaluate that and black English is just
a special case of it and we call it
black English is just another it's just
another language like where I grew up in
Philadelphia Philadelphia was like the
first stop north on the south you know
and former slaves came up from the south
they stopped in Philadelphia and I mean
like you know I'd ride in the streetcars
there be kids sitting behind me I
understand a word they were saying
literally not one word they were saying
they were just talking another language
you know it's what we call black English
you know I was talking white English a
different language but they're just two
languages you know it's like French and
German there's no question no further
question about them if you have a French
kid in a German school should they be
taught in French or in German well you
know their advantages both ways
some of the great leaders of change
and you don't seem
it seems like it's oh wow
well let's take Martin Luther King say I
think Martin Luther King was an
important person but I don't think it
was a big agent of change in fact I
think Martin Luther King was able to
play a role in bringing about change
because the real agents of change were
doing the work and the real agents of
change were like snick workers snick
workers i mean you know the the real
agents of change usually fall out of
history okay because we have a way of
you know there's a way of this story
it's it's necessary to distort history
to make it look as if you know great men
were doing things that's what part of
the way of teaching people you can't do
anything you're helpless you got to wait
for some great man to come around he'll
do it for you that's part of the
technique of disempowering people but if
you take a look at the civil rights
movement that's recently we can look at
it
it began with actually black students
mostly or actually you know takes it
takes a Rosa Parks I'm the story about
Rosa Parks is you know this courageous
black woman suddenly decided I had
enough I'm not gonna sit in the back of
the bus which is sort of half true but
only half true Rosa Parks came from a
community a community of well-organized
community which ultimately in fact has
Communist Party roots if you trace it
back it was a big it was a community of
people who were working together and had
in fact decided on a plan as to how to
break through this system and she was in
fact part of the agent of that plan I'll
and her school and so on and so forth
all of that sout of history you know
what's in history is one person had
courage to do something which she did
you know but not on her own nobody did
anything on their own I mean she was
coming out of an organized community of
committed people have been working
together for a very long time Martin
Luther King was able to appear and give
speeches because snick workers had done
Freedom Riders and so on had prepared
the ground and taken a brutal beating
for it and these were incidentally
pretty privileged kids many of them they
chose it you know they don't have to do
it and
they're the civil rights movement Martin
Luther King was important because he
could stand up there and get cameras no
I think he probably saw it this way at
least I hope he did he should have seen
it this way Gandhi is the same story as
a very mixed record if you look at you
know he was in favor he was doing all
sorts of things but it was the people
who were doing the work on the ground
who prepared the bases for Gandhi to
sort of articulate things and if you
look at real movement sanghas always
like there
well I think a third party or fourth or
fifth or whatever party probably makes a
lot of sense in the United States I mean
it's really a second party we only have
one party as it now stands we have a
kind of a business party with several
factions and countries that have a kind
of a labor based party you know a
popular party I have there's things that
can be done it's not a you know it's not
a huge change I mean almost every other
country has this but it does offer some
options so I say take say Canada right
next door very similar country to ours
but different in some respects one of
the respects is that the labor movement
still exists another respect is it does
have a popular based party the NDP which
is kind of mildly Social Democratic now
when the NDP gets into office they do
exactly the same thing as the other
parties I mean they're indistinguishable
but they nevertheless are kind of like
an umbrella party in which labor and
women's groups and others can sort of
get together and work together and so on
so they can you know they can press for
particular issues that are of general
interest and you see the difference
between Canada and the United States
just for that reason
like take say health in the United
States where there is no political party
just the business party certain sectors
of the population have been able to get
health care for themselves like the UAW
you know some of the stronger unions
were able to get pretty decent health
care arrangements the way it worked was
that they were given those things
instead of salary raises you know so not
like my my university we got to it
health care all right it was sort of
given instead of raising salaries one
year you know that's the way it was done
so you can get health so if you're well
enough organized and I'm strong enough
you can get healthcare for yourself but
what happened in Canada is that those
same groups the labor labor movement did
not just get healthcare for themselves
they got it for the population and they
were able to do that because there was
in fact a political structure through
which they could work which MIT which
satisfied common interests not just
their local interests lacking that in
the United States has never happened not
you know a second party that is a kind
of a pocket
party doesn't make a big change in the
society as I say every other society
that's like us has one but it isn't step
forward and in that sense what's called
a third party really should we call the
second party makes some some sense there
was the second part of the trip oh right
