[Music]
welcome to the michael brooks show we're
broadcasting live
from our various still quarantine zones
we're actually still doing that because
we were still in the middle of a fierce
pandemic
that this absolute schmuck
that runs this country has helped uh
make infinitely worse than it needed to
be
i'm michael brooks along with super
producer matt leck
yo uh theoretician and economist
in residence david griscom how's it
going
what's going well on this week's program
medina toure she's an education reporter
for politico
and we're talking about what does it
actually mean bill de blasio
has belatedly and radically and
sufficiently but to some tiny degree
responded to the democratic uprisings
that have taken place in new york city
and across the country and globe
around police violence racism
murder and in fact budget priorities
he's saying that he's going to cut the
nypd which has a six billion dollar
budget a little bit
redirected into education to some extent
what does that exactly mean we're going
to be talking about
the numbers and the budgets with the
great reporter medina toure
and then an icon of public
intellectualism linguistics and
resistance
gnome chomsky we just recorded this
conversation about an hour and a half
ago
he supports uh free speech substantively
and across the board folks we're talking
about that
we're also talking about his perception
of the autonomous zone in seattle
the uprisings as well as
lula brazil trump the fate of the earth
and more
you'll heal the first part of it in the
main show and the second part of it
in the post game for tmds patrons and of
course we've got a gem with david
griscom
we've got a ton of stuff to get to in
the post game in addition to the second
half of the chomsky video
interview daniel bestner is going to be
here we're going to talk about the
relationship
between pentagon the pentagon the
hollywood
hollywood and policing how those
propaganda matrix work
amlo courageous he'll help send fuel
supplies to venezuela
countervailing vicious u.s sanctions
regimens we're talking about that
alarming terrifying a border skirmish
which has
reportedly left 20 indian troops dead
over disputed territory between
india and china they fought a war over
this
in 1962 we'll focus on that in the post
game
tony blair wants a new form of biometric
identification as the biopolitics out of
corona
are terrifying we'll talk about that
as well as bill burr chillaxing joe
rogan and a whole
whole bunch more the usual and
we don't usually do this we might even
do this in the main show
i'm i'm pretty bored in general by these
clips these days and this kind of
content but
charlie kirk just said some legitimately
funny stuff
and uh i think we're gonna do really i
mean basically like a little bit of like
a philosophy history lesson out of it
uh so i'm excited that we'll actually
probably do that we might do that
maybe in uh the main show we're gonna do
uh we're gonna have uh
as i say the first half of chomsky uh
probably if you're watching this
probably a little bit around 8 10 8 15
or so
but first we've got to talk about
our country's meat packing plants
tyson foods labor resistance
and the another in the endless stories
of the acceleration
of kovid 19 because of the trump
administration
and because of corporate america
now let's be very clear about this meat
packing plants
are super spreaders of the virus
counties that house meat packing
facilities have higher infection rates
than new york city which has of course
been brutally hit
by the virus due to the violent
horrific incompetence led by donald
trump
and very much amplified by andrew cuomo
and bill de blasio
15 meat packing uh counties now report
a higher infection rate on a per capita
basis than new york city
the viruses epicenter this may
a meat plant in iowa in a meat plant in
iowa over
700 employees that's 58 of the workforce
tested positive for covid workers are
packed closely together they cannot
practice social distancing
and maintain the high rates of
production
and ruthless productivity standards
imposed by these meat packing companies
tyson foods one of the lead villains in
our country
one of the that most sort of brutal
exemplifiers of modern fordism
uh was slow to enact and implement even
the most
small and modest of protections let
alone making
any fundamental changes to protect
workers health
after months of fighting for better
conditions and production slowdowns
workers have begun resorting to
absenteeism
30 between 30 and 50 percent of me
plaquing employees according to the ufcw
united food and commercial workers
international union
uh numbers let's talk about
what meat packing actually looks like
and there's a reason
why from the systemic
and up-tempo and absolutely
ruthless rate of exploitation of
labor as well as the dire ecological
consequences
and horrific abusive treatment of
animals
that the anima that the animal industry
the agriculture industry has fought so
vigorously in congress
in an attempt to keep its industry in
the shadows and block
investigative reporting and exposure to
process chickens at a tyson's
at the tyson rate of demand it is simply
impossible for workers to be safe and
practice
social distancing tyson has put up some
protections like screen dividers on the
line
but the nature of the work itself
requires workers standing
closely together the corporation has
ratcheted up production and fought
against
any changes and has helped by the trump
administration
in resisting any slowing of production
and any fundamental changes to the speed
of this process
pro-publica reports the lack of meat
packing corporations showed to the comm
the lack of the lack of care the meat
crop
the meat packing corporation showed to
the community and their workers
smith fields smithfield foods chief
executive kenneth sullivan
sent a letter to nebraska governor pete
ricketts calling social distancing quote
a nicety that makes sense only for
people who work with laptops
at some facilities and of course uh
smithfield foods is the is the
conglomerate behind uh tyson
as an example behind tyson and some
facilities like in north carolina tyson
began doing
private testing and started suppressing
the information
that reached local health directors as
health officials around the country
began demanding higher standards from
tyson and meat packing companies
donald trump got involved to fight
against
protecting workers health trump
administration put forward executive
order requiring meat packing facilities
to stay
open making the job of health and labor
officials
uh to implement safety measures much
more difficult
not only does the trump order mean that
workers continue to work in unsafe
conditions but it could also very likely
be used as a legal justification
to block future lawsuits brought by
workers
against the employers who have damaged
and risked
their health osha has a history of
complaints against tyson
in 2017 the government accountability
office reported that workers at
meatpacking facilities
are unlikely to contact osha about
complaints because of fear of
retaliation from these companies
even simple requests like bathroom usage
are often denied on the floor
in the past workers have reported to
having to wear diapers
the danger of these jobs are immense as
well meatpacking
workers face fatality
and injury rates higher than workers at
saw mills
oil and gas and construction the pay is
low with workers only making about
twelve dollars an
hour the ecological costs are also
enormous in 2017 jps cargill
and tyson emitted more greenhouse gases
than france
water waste feed production and
transportation lead
and are lead cases in environmental
damage caused by companies
like tyson the major meat producers
have had their ear have had the ear of
politicians across the country allowing
them to exploit their workers
while eluding basic labor standards
conditions at these facilities
are bad have been bad horrific and
damaging for a long time
the covid crisis has only increased
what was already enormously damaging to
workers in the country as a whole
these are real essential workers during
society and they deserve
along with all other workers dignity
safety democracy
power and fair pay
yeah you guys want to add i mean i i
would just add that
this is another great example of how
donald trump
is really um amplifying and increasing
the amount of exploitation that happens
you know the executive order that he put
forward really could be used as an
argument to protect
these companies like tyson um from
being sued in the future right because
the argument is like well the government
saw this
these were essential services so you
know any kind of abuse that happened was
you know was necessary um basically you
know and that's going to be
you know a massive massive problem going
forward
uh for a long time too not only is there
the ecological question but just the
areas that a lot of the meat production
this country is done is in these rural
areas that are very much cut off um
from you know major cities so people
don't really realize the amount of like
exploitations that
you know workers face and that's you
know you noted it's very low paid work
in the first place
um so yeah and it's been it's been
really alarming over the past few months
too to see how
how serious the spread of covet has been
in these in these places
and the simple fact that it could be
mitigated if these corporations
were willing to take a hit uh to their
profits but instead they just want to
continue producing
um an unsustainable amount of meat uh
for the circumstance for the moment
right this is something where
having a private economy is very
dangerous because
uh this is not a moment where like the
profit motive should be in charge
especially at a time uh when the public
safety
the health of these workers is in
jeopardy and then the
health of the larger public is in
jeopardy
because it's not just that these workers
are contracting covert they're going
home and
there's getting spread to people in
their communities as well which is
another reason that like rural america
has been hit really hard with the corona
virus too
this kind of exploitation that cascades
um all the way throughout
throughout our society and we shouldn't
be leaving these decisions in the hands
of a few
um assholes as you noted the
executive officer saying that um you
know that social distancing is only for
people who work on laptops i mean it's
ridiculous
yeah and probably the worst indicator
i've seen one of the most
more uh foreboding ones is how many
i i mean what maybe it wasn't a lot of
people but i saw sentiment on facebook
and like
you know online of the insinuations
about what type of people work at those
plants
instead of you know the yeah and
i don't know like i hope uh our
country's beyond
you know collapsing into that sort of
thing instead of you know talking about
the type of abuse that the bosses i mean
this we should have this story down by
now up and sinclair wrote the jungle
over a hundred years ago yeah exactly
and the kind of people who feed you
every day honestly
who could care not a wit if you live or
die
or spend an extra second with your
family i think um
you know this is actually reminds me of
the conversation one of the great
conversations we have with dustin
guestello who hopefully will be on the
show again in july and we were talking
on you know the material reality of
you know right-wing populism uh versus
the left
and you know among the many reasons
obviously the moral objections that we
fight for uh the humanity the
recognition
and full rights of migrants as an
example
is also strategic it's absolutely the
right thing to do it's also strategic i
mean
as soon if you even have a remote
conversation
whether it's some type of disgusting
class identity politics about someone
who might work in a meat packing or
whether it's racism or demonizing
of of of immigrant populations who are
very represented in these jobs
you are you know again yes
it's the wrong thing to do of course but
you're also
effing yourself because you're dividing
the potential of a base
that you absolutely are going to be a
part of
most likely and certainly if you work in
any type of service industry
and you know already basically don't
hold wealth
so you know at the end of the day
unionism is essential
and unionism is you know
predicated on
you know the democratic openness to work
across boundaries
and again as i always say it doesn't
govern you know people can have whatever
beliefs
social practices create community how
they like or not or whatever but in the
realm of politics and the realm of going
out and fighting those struggles against
a place like tyson
that requires all workers you know and
and any divisiveness around that
is a psyop it's the boss oh yeah
that's it um all right let's talk
a little bit about uh becoming a patron
and then we will
get to our great guest medina toure uh
so
every sunday eight dollar patrons get
the post game which is very in-depth we
have a lot of fun

like as an example we're in the middle
of a two-part history
of modern pakistan how that relates
to the cia fueled mujahideen
war as an example in the 1980s

1930s there had developed in the midwest
and
plain states the dust bowl crisis and
if you didn't address soil erosion you
were going to have an environmental
crisis which did occur
but this was to restore conditions in a
finer fashion
we launched the rural electrification
agency something which is hardly
ever talked about but really did
transform rural life for
of many hundreds of thousands of farmers
the big
utilities the privately held utilities
would not do that they would not provide
electricity to farmers
because they figured it wouldn't be
profitable enough

internet comes
uh do we have uh medina toure
uh not quite yet but she should be here
any second so oh here she is right
okay great all right well joining us i
guess momentarily then
is medina toure there medina can you
hear me
i can hear you okay great thank you so
much
everybody medina toure is an education
reporter
covering new york city for politico
magazine medina thanks so much for
returning to the show
yeah sure thanks for having me it's my
pleasure so
can you we're going to talk a little bit
about what
bill de blasio has put forward in terms
of an idea of cutting the nypd a little
bit
and redirecting it into education but
before we get there can you just give us
like a broader
budget picture like how much money goes
into education in new york city how much
money goes to the police and so on
right right so um yeah right now um
first of all thanks so much for having
me um yeah right now
is uh a really really um interesting
times in terms of uh
budget conversations i mean the
department of education
could see something like 262 million
dollars in cuts
um to their budget i know that there's a
lot of um
you know concern about that and um the
nypd currently has this six billion
dollar budget
um what the city council is proposing is
to cut
a billion dollars from that um and
uh this is really um a response to all
the protests that have been going on
for the last few weeks um and um
you know people have been calling for um
you know
for the the nypd's budget to be cut so
that money could be used for other
things like
hiring social workers and guidance
counselors and
um so it's it's definitely there's
definitely been a big focus on that
so far uh the mayor has said that um
you know he said recently that he he
kind of made a commitment to shifting
funding from the nypd
uh to uh youth initiatives and social
services he mentioned that
he didn't really specify a specific
amount yet that's kind of
he said that's kind of being worked out
right now in the budget process
he mentioned that there were going to be
some town halls in like areas that have
had high levels of police interactions
with um
residents um and uh where and i think
some cure violence providers are going
to be participating in that
so that's a little bit about what's
happening there
so and and how explicit so so on the
city council it's getting a little bit
more specific they're talking about a
billion dollars and
and are they being really clear too that
they're not
like this isn't all of a sudden hey
maybe half a billion is just gonna go
into like the rainy day fund or
making cuts like this is a billion
dollars we have it
and we're gonna redirect it materially
to other
socially productive things are they
being really clear about that at least
in the city
right right so so far what they've said
is that
um you know so again they want to to
cut a billion dollars from the nypd's
upcoming budget
that that amount represents something
like sixteen percent of their
six billion dollar budget um they've
made
uh you know some proposals like slashing
overtime cuts across
costs across the board removing the
school safety division from the nypd's
purview reducing the head count
they haven't really indicated um you
know
where which agencies would benefit from
the cuts
i know a lot of people are saying the
department of education
should be receiving that money so it
kind of remains to be seen where that's
going to go exactly
but i do think it is worth noting that
you know the council did
most of the council with the exception
with the exception of councilmember
andes baron
they did vote to increase the um police
force
uh by over a thousand cops and i think a
lot of activists like josemar trujillo
from
the occult and broken windows have
brought that up um and
you know some have said well you know we
should get back the money that went into
that
um so um it does remain to be seen
what what again which agencies are going
to benefit from those cuts but
definitely um all eyes are on the
department of education
um and you know this um there's been a
lot of calls
to um you know hire more social workers
guidance counselors school psychologists
um and um you know so
i think that's that's definitely one
area that everyone's going to be
watching
when you talk about the council votes
can you give us a
sense as best you can um you know
obviously we don't well
you might know some of the conversations
that happen behind closed doors you're a
really good reporter
um but in terms of like like anez barron
and uh i think it's charles barron is
her is her husband's name
this is like a very distinct political
couple in new york they have
serious political commitments and they
both in the in you know in terms of city
politics and state politics have
definitely for a very long time
highlighted
uh racism gentrification inequality
police violence and so there is
a real there is some connection there
to you know organic movements and
protests that have moved
you know kind of moved across the city
and are still ongoing
when you look at the kind of rest of the
council and i guess
up through the mayor of this kind of
interesting dynamic
where there's a lot of desire
to hop on board with different trendy
kind of discourses
but maybe the voting record doesn't
match that and also there might be a
much more
like i mean you know just taking de
blasio
himself and i'm and i'm trying to be
careful here because this is such an
opinion driven show
but i'm trying to take it out of the
realm of opinion but like
there's there's been a lot of very
interesting writing on on
particularly recently there's a piece in
jacobin about how sort of
even when he agrees with activists he
doesn't like that they're doing what
they're doing and i'm wondering you know
whatever it may be and i'm wondering
when you you know you look at the kind
of contradictions with the exception of
inez baron on the city council like
how are they filtering that to the press
like how are they saying
yeah you know we were we were voting for
all this stuff but now this is happening
so
is it people are out taking enormous
risks so we're listening or is it
hey this was actually always really our
position
right i know i definitely think it's a
good question and i and that's why i
mentioned that before i mean i think
one thing that continues to be striking
and i mentioned like
activists like joe smart trujillo from
the coalition to unbroken windows who
keep mentioning that
um and even at the time when they did it
he was among people who was criticizing
that
um you know it is striking that you know
most of the council with the exception
of uh councilman ryan as baron did vote
to increase the force
um i do remember at one point being at a
a forum on uh broken windows where some
activists had kind of taken
uh elected officials to task over that
and they were saying well you know um
there were certain things we were
promised that didn't happen
and you know we did this because of xyz
um i think it seems to me now like a lot
of these
elected officials are responding to the
moment i mean i think the protests have
been so
so so so um they've been going on for
for weeks and and people have been
going out all over the city and um you
know it's gotten to the point where
peop now people realize that they do
have to respond because of of the
actions of protesters
um i know that um the
uh the chair of the city council's
education committee mark traeger
and donovan richards who heads the
public safety committee or
they they kind of put out a statement
recently saying that they want to see
you know the the school safety agents
removed from the purview of the nypd
and um that that that was interesting
there's
some council members i think vanessa
gibson and
corey johnson some others who also you
know they were the ones who announced
the one billion dollars and
uh cut and cuts the proposal
to to make that cut to the nypd budget
um
i think a lot of them are kind of
responding to what's happening out of
the streets
um but there are there are um you know i
there are council members who are more
on the
conservative side and and not even just
the ones who are republican there are
there is kind of a group of conservative
democrats in the city council
who are are not as may not have
don't probably don't have the position
of like get the cops out of the schools
and like cut the nypd budget
so there's a little bit of nuance there
um so it'll be interesting to see
um what happens but i do think i think a
lot of these elected officials respond
to the moment and even
what you're seeing with the the current
and former staffers for
for the mayor who are going out and
protesting and who who wrote this open
letter
um you know i think it's just a sign
that like
something hap i think even though this
has happened before i think
you know brianna taylor taylor and
george lloyd all of that
um happening has kind of changed the
dynamic and all that happening with the
pandemic
um you know disproportionately impacting
black and latinx communities
all that coming together has kind of
changed things and even some
former uh top de blasio staffers like
rich rich
weary and maya wiley also kind of
speaking out about this
issue of changing um you know the
the role that school safety agents play
in schools um so i think across the
board
and even the mayor i mean he hasn't
given a specific dollar figure and he
has said that he thinks school safety
agents should still remain
under the nypd but he had he did he did
commit to shifting the funding um
i think that the chancellor i was
listening to a town hall that
the chancellor was having with a
community education council 14 in
brooklyn yesterday
and somebody asked him about that like
do you support you know um
changing the role of school safety
agents um divesting
sorry what are school safety agents what
does that mean
right right so uh school safety agents
these are the officers that are in the
schools
um and these are nypd fully
they're all under the purview of the
nypd and um so basically they're the
people
i think you know the security guards the
people who like check the students in
who are at the doors and everything and
so
um yeah and i mean i think you know to
kind of expand upon that um
the there have been calls to get school
safety agents out of the schools for a
while
but i think of course with everything
that has happened those conversations
are being reignited
you know there's some people are saying
take him out completely some people say
just reduce them and some people are
saying well
um you know why should this be under the
purview of the nypd
there are certain issues that should be
handled by social workers by guidance
counselors by school psychologists
so um there's there's been a really
interesting conversation there
um it seems like the mayor wants to keep
things in their current form
the chancellor at the town hall i
mentioned yesterday he was saying that
um he's currently he didn't take a
position
but he did say that he's um you know
studying the issue how it came to be
that school safety agents
you know were became under the purview
of the nypd so there's there's a lot of
interesting conversations that
are happening across the board
what about the more like i mean
is there is there interest in the
council on some of the
like yeah i guess broader questions too
like i i want to
be really careful now with details but
san francisco has announced that
they're going to start experimenting
with the response programs
uh so that you know one of them one one
of many many many many criticisms
uh has been you know like a really basic
technical thing like why is it that
if somebody is having you know an
emotional or mental issue
well like why is that a police response
like what you know
how why and and so in san francisco has
announced some notion of shifting that a
little bit
is there interest in the council on some
of those kind of
wider demands um as far as i've heard it
seems to me like
a lot of the focus has been on cutting
the budget and using that
funding to like hire more social workers
guidance counselors school psychologists
but um it has been interesting to see
what's been happening in other places
like minneapolis and just
you know the whole conversation there
the council members who wanted to spend
the police department
you know the schools you know ending
their contract with the police
department i do think that there are
people who want to see something similar
happen here in new york so i think it'll
be interesting to see moving forward
like what
kinds of uh things they propose yeah and
and i want to
add everybody should watch we
interviewed councilwoman sharma sawant
on the jacobin show on saturday that
anna and i host and i mean she's
really like she's actually expressed a
lot of skepticism about the idea of like
you know having a study that goes on for
a year and then mothballing it and she's
like
in the process right now as an example
taking away tear gas from the force you
know that's something that she's
fighting on so there's a lot of um
there's a lot of other areas that can go
beside some budget cuts what
what is um what do educators
uh especially now where like there's so
much question just even about the idea
of like the safety
of reopening schools for educators for
staff for children
what is your sense i guess in terms of
like
the budget priorities questions and
everything else like
the teachers want nypd in the schools
like what's your kind of sense of where
uh teachers fit in this whole
conversation right
so um yeah no actually um i um i did
maybe this was like like a weekend or
two ago i did actually go to a march
um it was it was basically a march of
parents and students and
advocates and educators who were calling
for police v schools they actually
marched from the headquarters of the
united federation of teachers this the
city's teachers union
up to um tweed courthouse the does
building and
you know it was i mean in the beginning
it was a small crowd like when they were
kind of people were speaking but
the crowd started to grow more and more
and at that at one point it seemed like
there were hundreds of people there and
there were
there were students there were parents
and there were teachers who were
speaking and
um you know a lot of them you know some
of them were actually kind of taking aim
at
the united federation of teachers
leadership and saying oh well
you guys need to do more to support
black lives matter week and
you know your statement of george floyd
was insufficient and there was a real
you know i really got a sense from that
a particular event that there was a real
desire to see
police-free schools to see some changes
to see more social workers guidance
counselors school psychologists
i i know that there's a little bit of
variation as i mentioned before i'm sure
there's some people who are like
they may not want to see police taken
out completely they might want to just
see the their role reduced i'm sure
there are people who
still think police should be there that
but that maybe there should be
more uh i don't know like a bit more um
communication between the school safety
agents and the students but
there's definitely a lot of momentum for
for this
across the board it was a pretty diverse
crowd from what i saw
um i think people definitely want to see
some changes in that regard and
and in terms of curriculum too i mean i
think
um even for myself i i mean i know i did
a story recently
where i kind of talked to students and
former de blasio officials and advocates
about
this very issue of police in schools but
i did also talk to him about curriculum
and people want to see
more they they want the this this the
you know the the there's the whole issue
of police killing of black citizens
other people they want to see that
taught in in school as
well they want students to to learn
about this like
some students even talked about to me
about having a whole class devoted to it
a human a class about human rights
issues specifically in the united states
so
i i definitely think a lot of teachers
are are interested in seeing
more being done not just about the
school safety agents but just about
curriculum for for students to learn
about this and and about the history of
different communities
what about that surge specifically in
student activism
i'm sorry what about the sir i'm sorry
what about the surge specifically of
student activism
that students are playing in it oh yeah
and it's a good question and i think
students are definitely at the forefront
of this
um there there has been i mean it's i
guess
student activism is something has always
been present in history but i think kind
of looking
speaking specifically about recent
events yeah i mean i think
um you know the they they've been
calling for
for police to be out of schools or to be
reduced for a long time
um the student activists have been vocal
on other issues too like school
integration
and you know this issue of uh
you know discrimination and admissions
process
schools that screen for students um i
think across the board we've been
students
seeing students going out and protesting
holding sit-ins over racism and
discrimination happening in their
schools
um and on this issue yeah i mean that
you know there were so many students at
that particular march i interviewed some
of them and
actually one of them her name was rayne
hawkins
she is a student at the james baldwin
school a transfer school in
a transfer high school manhattan and i
talked to her before the march and she
was saying that
you know at the end of the day this this
is an issue that affects us
every day people not elected officials
we're the ones that
make this city run we have to have a
saying where the what the money is being
used for where the funding is going
so i think students are definitely at
the forefront of this and even the
advocates i've spoken with
have said that as well and and they're
very they're very plugged into this the
students i interviewed for my story
some of them were like well i'm my
parents aren't allowing me to go out to
the protest but i've been calling
elected officials i've been phone
banking i've been telling them to like
you know get on board with uh repeat
repealing 50a and and support this uh
you know chokehold bill um so they also
said well we're
sharing videos of what's occurring on
the ground so
across the board students have
definitely been leading these
conversations
absolutely so in the final couple of
minutes i mean just
could you actually tell us i guess i
think it's related it's a little off
topic but
the state of like pushing to reopen the
new york schools and basically
how people feel about it and you know
the safety of those affected
yeah yeah so that is a big major
conversation is underway um
the the city has a bunch of different
task force
sector advisory councils that are
advising the city on different aspects
of reopening there's one for schools
there's a bunch of
there's some there has to be at least 40
or 50 people on the one for schools
and there's i mean there's like
advocates and education leaders higher
education leaders all sorts of
individuals on it
um they've had a couple meetings um
there's been a lot of interesting
developments on that recently i mean
basically um you know the city says that
it's considering a variety of options
um it could be you know um
plexi glass barriers it could be
there may there may there may be some
form of remote learning because um
you know there's kind of a mixture of
responses from families some families
are like well
even if schools reopen in september i'm
not sending my kid because it's not
going to be safe
um other families are like oh well i
need my kid to be in person or else i
can't go back to work
so there may be a mixture of in person
and then there's also the factor of like
class size has to be limited some
schools are overcrowded
um there are a lot of different options
that are being considered but i think
people are kind of
you know putting pressure on the city
and saying we don't want what happened
with
the whole situation around this closing
of the schools for remote learning we
don't want to see a repeat of that there
was a lot of
there was a feeling that the school
system should have been closed sooner
although some were saying well
a lot of kids rely on these schools for
basic needs um
so i think there's there's definitely a
lot that's underway
um i think the chancellor had at that
town hall that i was listening to
yesterday he was saying that well
they they want to be guided by um health
expert decision
decisions and guidance and they want to
be you know that
anything can happen to now and september
so they kind of want to be
careful and just look at the different
varying needs i think they put out a
survey
to to hear from families so there's a
lot a lot of different things to balance
and i know that uft
is involved with that as well because
there's a question of teachers and
how they're going to be paid and and so
there's there's definitely a lot that's
that's
underway um but i know that there's a
lot of anxiety because
different families have different
situations and like even another teacher
i spoke to was just like well
you know for those of us who have big
schools like large classes like how are
we gonna do this
you know so it's it's going to be
interesting to see how that pans out
final question is it i mean i'm
obviously with my politics
very concerned about you know bill gates
and eric schmidt
and all of that sort of andrew cuomo
stuff that he's talking about
uh in in terms of the education system
as a whole
um has there been on the
other hand any thought that
when you see these problems arise like
kids can't get food
because the schools are shut down
because of a pandemic or there isn't the
same access to technology if there's
remote learning
has there been any sense of you know
just more broadly like when you
when you have such a limited social
safety net the burden that falls on the
schools and some thinking of like hey
if we're gonna have you know proper
preparedness there has to be as an
example like other ways to get food to
people
and taking care of kids has there been
any thought in that direction
yeah um that's actually something that
uh you know someone i i had spoken with
someone from an immigrant advocacy group
who had mentioned that like
um this question of of accommodating
families who have those needs and even
things like
after school and working with community
based organizations
i'm not sure what the city has
determined yet in in that particular
area but
i do think it's something that a lot of
people are thinking about it's like when
schools reopen like
you know the city is going to have to
come up with some alternatives
um to address those needs and maybe team
up with certain organizations to deal
with that
dina torre i really appreciate your time
as always
follow all of medina's work uh on being
political
of course thank you so much all right
all right take care be well
all right guys um oh we're not taking
breaks
i'm still getting used to not taking
breaks
so let's uh what we're going to do is
i want to do this charlie kirk thing if
we can bring that to the main show
because it's hilarious
and then i want you to do your gem and
then we're going to get to
the good dr chomsky oh hell yeah so we
want to do this
uh kirk thing yeah let's do this kirk
thing so i
i'm i'm pretty and i believe i think the
super chats are open i saw somebody
question if uh
if there's a problem with giving super
chats but i don't think so
uh yeah we got erica said testing one
two three with ten dollars so
i hope that was a good test yeah go keep
keep testing guys um
keep testing away okay i've made no
secret that i'm kind of like
i don't know i'm just like whatever i i
can't
i can't spend my life making fun of
right-wing assholes i mean
you know it's part of it uh
and the humor quotients
even on reuben guys i gotta be honest i
i
you know i feel like reuben peaked
that time he was walking around after
his shay like he's never
he's never going to be that funny and if
we do reuben again we should just
revisit that video
and just watch the rest of it actually
because that was peak room
that video happened you know what like i
was on a 10-day silent meditation
retreat
so i came out and watched that video and
i
because of the mind like i found it
actually upsetting to watch
like like that level of like
i'm having a beautiful day so delusional
and like you know what they're all upset
and just
it was like just the mind field of
unskillful habits you remember what
happened that day right
that was the day colette said he was
like a loser or something like
that
yeah that was when colette whenever when
they were all trying to cut bait with
the guy
you know honest you know his grievance
about that was kind of legit
because it was like wait a second like
everybody comes in my show while i stare
into blank space
exactly fucking moron but now all of a
sudden it's fashionable to call me
stupid screw you guys
yeah now that you now that you've taken
all the money out of my subscribers
pockets
oh my god but this one really caught my
attention this is hysterical and we
haven't spent that much time talking
about charlie kirk at all charlie kirk
is of course
uh who is who funds uh attorney points
usa was a foster friend
okay so foster freeze is an infamous
reactionary oligarch he did the infamous
uh put an aspirin between your knees as
birth control comment i think back in
2011
uh funder of rick santorum and other you
know extreme far-right
figures uh and you know charlie somehow
got to him and was just like
man you know i'm in that college and i
had to hear who this guy caesar chavez
was
i mean it's just a disaster and uh
this is just funny like i don't i have
to say especially in my
mood of you know
there's just a million legitimate
criticisms of campus politics frankly
like
millions and i feel like we end up
having to delineate them on like the
actual left because they undermine the
actual left and like
not only does charlie kirk of course not
go there because at the end of the day
he's a you know reactionary dope
who wants to his you know mythologize
and naturalize
you know basically in my view every form
of repression
and uh exploitation imaginable but it's
like
what happened you're gonna watch this
clip
and i'm gonna miss like what happened to
rush limbaugh just being a fat fuck
who was just an asshole like what
happened to like
i don't need to read all that stuff i
you know ronald reagan
readers digest and the steelers like
just stop doing this shit stop
pretending that you've read this stuff
or do it if you're going to pretend like
this because it's pretty funny let's
watch
to have the opposition party go full
rasoi and marxist i'm so glad you
mentioned
rousseau because that he was the gateway
to karl marx
and plato was really the gateway to
rousseau and what the big conversation
is
you're well read the republic and so
forth thank you and aristotle and plato
of course was the the age-old
student and teacher dynamic of course
socrates
taught plato taught aristotle but
aristotle disagreed with plato on one
fundamental thing he disagreed on a lot
which is is private property a good
thing or a bad thing
plato said bad thing get rid of private
get rid of private property plato also
argued against the nuclear family
aristotle said no actually
i think private property serves a role i
think that if you try to
take people's stuff away all of a sudden
you're going to take away their meaning
and their ability
to pass on wealth and ideas to the next
generation
this divide between aristotle and plato
is playing out today in our politics
let me tell you something if aristotle
was that easy to read i would have done
way better in greek philosophy i wish
that when i was trying to find that you
know figure out the golden mean while i
was
you know pulling an all-nighter it was
just like aristotle you
cracked open it's just like plato's
against ideas
um can you okay david i look i i
admit i look i did take greek philosophy
we've all
dabbled in this stuff do you see an
unbroken line between somebody who
agitated
against athenian democracy
literally wanted a small
cadre of like kind of intellectually
gifted elite to philosophically guide
the polity do you see an unbroken
chain between him and
rousseau who
was kind of romantic yeah and then marx
who tried to you know make the the fight
for socialism economically
you know scientific whatever else you
think and was it even true
i don't i don't recall but you you could
absolutely know more to me
did plato a prose private property well
yeah i got that one
i want to start with the greek stuff
because it's like that's even funnier i
have to say
okay please you know there was one
property relation that aristotle was
very fond of
um and that was the past yeah yes
remember that that when these are
invoking
so you could pass ideas and things on to
your kids
like yeah exactly as an example like
other people's brains
yeah yeah you own the tutor and the
farmworker
both of them and you get them from dad
but eddie like the thing is with kirk is
that when he
you know he's like another one of these
characters almost like steve bannon that
when they throw away thinkers names
you know it's almost meaningless right
because they're just like throwing
buzzwords that make them seem
uh more intelligent because like here's
the things like you know plato
did critique um you know property
but very specifically for like the
warrior class it's like the idea is that
the warriors shouldn't have property
because their only goal should be
defending the city
right um and the only people who like
also and then you know the people at the
very top
in the like philosopher king system
right
they didn't have private property either
but they also were like the universal
rulers of the entire
society he didn't have private property
because like
everything was their property in a
certain sense so like the the argument
that like
of aristotle is uh you know is ludicrous
i mean it's it's um it's also not the
big
split that's not the big spl the
the split is and i forget where i'm
sorry but there's that famous uh
painting where plato's pointing to the
sky and aristotle's pointing to the
ground
right the split is just split over the
forms
over forms and basically that aristotle
was in some
you know certain way was pivoting
towards impera
empiricism and natural observation
whereas plato was saying that
you know perfect for like that that
everything existed
on an ideas level and that we could sort
of just barely comprehend them because
they existed
the perfect form of everything existed
in pure abstraction
which again is doesn't necessarily sound
super left-wing well the other thing is
that like the ideology
of uh you know i mean like you know
plato and aerosol like the actual
philosophy is
complicated is very interesting i spent
a lot of time
um you know really searching through
plato for answers i mean he was very
inspiring thinker
um and i highly you know suggest reading
all those dialogues but it's so funny to
me how the right wing
looks towards um both aristotle and
plato
as like their tribunes right literally
you know aristotle
you ever heard the word aristocracy
right like literally
systems of government that are the
complete opposite of the so-called
liberal democracy
that you know these organizations that
charlie kirk works for
are supposed to uphold right they
literally were saying that we want a
small group of elites
technocracy to govern and control
society
um hey the only thing that i think is
worthwhile in that that clip is uh i
mean foster free style policies
especially if you actually applied them
to to uh veterans god forbid
would sort of mean that warriors
wouldn't be able to own houses
yeah like indirectly because they
wouldn't have the earning capacity but
look the thing is like plato
plato was against the nuclear family um
he wanted everyone to have these like
massive sex parties
all right he knew who anyone's parents
were um
you know that's the fun kind of greek
tradition and then i also think it's
good that
uh that kirk is quite scared of rousseau
i think rousseau
uh as we talked about a couple weeks ago
should be scared of russo
yeah quite the radical philosopher uh
who is very important in
demystifying a lot of this kind of these
nonsense ideas that property relations
are somehow natural
which again is not something that is is
argued
um you know explicitly in either of
these greek philosophers
um either right the idea is that like
these are things that you can move
around that these aren't necessarily
like
these are government like the government
creates the property right it's not
something that's
you know universal um how like they like
to describe and think about property
rights
but just to not be too much of like a
stickler but i just have
never and people could know better than
me but i've just never
heard that trajectory before what i've
never heard
somebody say the plato i mean okay sure
there's like the old like hey it's plato
and everything else
is like a footnote in western philosophy
sure okay like obviously
plato and aristotle things flow in
certain traditions from them of course
but
that's an interesting one the idea that
like
like plato's directionality and
rousseau's directionality like
that would be that would be like an
interesting book to write like that
would be a novel argument
that and then somehow they both led the
marks
that would just be i know i mean that's
that's like that's like you're you're
opening up like a wikipedia page and
just basically telling us like
yeah and then you know cicero
led the mice direct card and then
that was what ended up being mal
no michael he's a moron think about it i
mean okay thank you
for trying to simplify here what's their
whole thing what's their whole moron
like
these charlie kirk people they say well
the american system is based on
there's a very specific tradition that
is missing from his definition
philosophy
the judeo-christian uh tradition of
philosophy
right so there's an entire you know
literally like around like a thousand
fifteen hundred two thousand years
of philosophy that charlie kirk is
skipping over to get to rousseau
for you know to tie rousseau to plato um
you know in a tradition by the way that
was highly
um influenced by by uh by plato
and um that charlie kirk's argues is the
basis for his worldview so i mean it's
completely ludicrous it's cherry-picking
nonsense
obviously it just it gets me mad as
somebody who spent a lot of time like
really like oh i gotta understand these
texts or work through them and i'm not
necessarily like i'm an expert i don't
have like a
you know like a master's degree or a
doctor or any of these things but you
know i spent a lot of time really
fixating on these ideas
to see how like flip it some more
like charlie can be they need they need
to approximate it though i think like
there are
so enough suckers like i need to get
some actual brain food here tell me
about plato charlie
exactly and it's like that i can't
remember there was some like science
right or something like kind of phrase
on stilts it's like it's one thing to
yeah like you're saying
like humbly try to grapple with these
things it's enough
to be trot out there by dennis prager
after you've been pumped like full of
fracking dollars and for like the last
four year 20s probably not doing a whole
lot of reading i i i'm just going to go
out in there and say
i don't think charlie will be doing the
most amount of like deep reading
exactly i do want to say though but i
actually think though this is
this is but i like that though that you
know people out there who are interested
in this stuff
and trying to read and trying to think
that should be praised
a hundred percent and support it and
then you know charlie kirk
and welcome to us because yeah come over
here we actually have research
we've actually read some of this shit
and of course
that is involved in that old teacher
student is he doing like a karate kid
thing when he does that
like i swear to god i feel like i
remember that from karate kid
how did you make it plato and russo it's
like fuck
miyagi
all right david what's the gem brother
what's up what's up
let's do the gem and then we'll get to
the first half of our conversation with
noah
chomsky yeah well you know on another
subject
uh that uh our good comrade and friend
uh uh charlie kirk has been getting
wrong for
you know pretty much his whole existence
but specifically over the past couple
weeks
as this whole trump recovery and the
so-called you know
a revival of the stock market and the
trump surge that we're seeing right now
now gore vidal has this really wonderful
line where he called the united states
uh the united states of amnesia and when
it comes to the financial community you
really have to say that it counts like
double
uh because we're going through another
massive
um moment of like completely
uncalculated
um and almost baseless exuberance that
we've seen so everyone's been talking a
lot about how they've seen you know the
stock market
you know rise and then it'll trickle
back down and rise again and that was
like you know what's going on
and they're coming up with all these
stories primarily trump um has been
focusing on the fact
that there were some good jobs numbers
in the most recent job report
and the fact that uh retail sales were
higher than expected
from the last the government statistics
now just really quick on the jobs
numbers that everyone's fixated on
let's not forget how many uh you know
jobs were lost since this coronavirus
crisis has started i mean we haven't
seen anything
on this scale uh you know since the
great depression
and even uh even this most recent jobs
report that everyone was fixated on
you know even the bureau of even even
the government statistics have been
saying that like
we think that this a lot of these might
come from misclassifications because a
lot of people don't know how to classify
their workers in the context of corona
buyers people who they've
basically laid off but they've said you
know when things get normal will give
you your job back so all those workers
been
misclassified and the epi estimates that
like we're
like the actual unemployment rate that
we're seeing in the united states
is like 19.7 percent which is like
historic
you know depression level uh you know
crisis and it's something that we're all
experiencing and feeling around us
which is why people look you know with
such shock uh towards these stock
market numbers and you know there's a
couple reasons
uh why that's happening and the first
one which is something that a lot of
people understand now but i think it's
important that we understand that
materially and not just as a slogan
is that yeah the stock market doesn't
really measure the economy
right the stock market is a way that
people make money
uh and it in in some like traditional
ways
it used to be a way to sort of was a
good barometer of like the
the feelings of the bourgeoisie and it
used to be something that was based on a
future claim to profits it's completely
divorced itself from that
um now what this exuberance and this
excitement that we're seeing from the
class of people who buy
and participate in the stock market is
the reality
that they've seen that the federal
reserve will do whatever is
needed to make sure that asset prices
stay
as high as possible one
with all of this you know the massive
amounts of money that the federal
reserve has pumped into financial
uh markets initially where is where
could that money really go
other than in the stock market right so
of course people are going to be buying
stocks with that money
um two the federal reserve is now buying
um you know is now buying corporate
bonds which is something that's
never done before and is a massive uh is
a massive move
and you've got to understand one that
bonds aren't traditionally
something that people jump into to make
a lot of money off of
but over the past few weeks they've
become very much like hot commodities
for folks
um you know bonds really like especially
like the investment grade bonds you buy
them to hold for a really long time to
just get a steady stream of income
people are seeing massive returns um on
on these corporate bonds because the
federal reserve basically is going to go
up and keep those prices as high as
possible
that that market's really shifting and
you have to understand
like how critical uh debt is in the u.s
economy
something i talked about a lot of the
gem for like the past two years and a
lot of people were saying well that's
not a problem
um how big the the corporate debt load
has gotten but it's starting to really
hit a crisis level so i just want to
share this from adam twos real quick
um so these are the rising share of
companies with debt servicing costs that
are higher than their profits
i mean if you really look at that line
it's an alarming rate
um that certainly growed after the
initial
uh recession 2008 but has grown
exponentially
fucking nightmare yeah but that's been
the dynamic from the federal reserve's
activity over the past 10 years
to basically make it um so easy to
amass a significant amount of debt uh
because they've kept interest
rates so low and now we basically have
in a con
you know like a corporate economy that
has just you know is completely addicted
um
to debt and now the federal reserve is
jumping into the bond market
uh which is not fundamentally changed
that dynamic we're in an ironic moment
right now where the federal reserve
chair
is demanding congress you know
continue to do stimulus spending which
is not um
you know it's not something that they've
been pursuing um so here's the reality
there's two very different worlds
there's the world of the working class
people
the people who get a paycheck and that's
how they you know
survive and people who get all of their
money from
holding significant amounts of assets
and we've seen this massive
institution the federal reserve step
into becoming one of the
most important players in the u.s
economy by the way something that has
very little democratic oversight
by the way and is functioning in a way
to make sure
that the super rich and the people who
have access to the federal reserve
programs
are on a completely different footing so
there's a complete decoupling from the
lived reality of people
who produce in the society and the
people who extract profits
um through holding assets so you know we
might see these kind of
jumps up on on the stock market you know
over the next couple of months but there
is no way to look at the
actual material um conditions of this
u.s economy and say that it is
anything um that's stable and i think
even the stock market is going to have
that realization
over the next couple of months as you
see these states that reopened
and you see corona virus cases spread in
those communities
that a lot of those states are gonna
have to close down operations again
um because you know we saw this retail
um
growth recently but that's just because
a lot of states reopened and now we're
already seeing
in stays like taxes and in florida the
fi the corona virus is spreading so much
that there's going to have to be another
uh likely round of uh you know lockdowns
or at least some
kind of restrictions but again you know
given the state of politics in this
country who really knows what the hell
is going to happen there but really
don't let anybody tell you that the
economy is doing great because we're
literally we're looking at around 20
unemployment uh largest amount of people
pulling unemployment checks that has
ever happened
in u.s history um and a massive
uh viral pandemic that we still have
no clear way out of um and we you know
we need to be sure that we're not
listening to the people
um who led us into the crisis in in 2008
now you're muted michael
you sound like you read uh rousseau
coming out of plato man probably you
know
i couldn't sleep till then i re-watched
big lebowski
it is like an incredible movie i was on
a coen brothers kick i want and jeff
bridges because i also watch true grit
the their version of true it's an
amazing amazing movie thank you
for uh nando
and connor kilpatrick were pushing me on
that i mean
i liked so much i'm going to order the
book uh independent books
watch uh hell or high water if you're if
hell
but i already saw that i actually saw
heller high water twice
but i the scene in big lebowski i don't
even remember
the context of it but he did where he
there's one that jeff bridges like
that's just like your opinion man
it's just like the perfect like so
almost
everything you hear today yeah so i'm
not gonna wear a fucking mask
just like your opinion man whatever
um anyways we got a bunch to get to in
the post game here's what we're gonna do
folks
we recorded this interview with noam
chomsky uh
about two hours ago it was a great
conversation he actually
definitely you know gave us more of his
time
than anticipated which is always nice
when that happens uh
and um you know it's just uh
there's i won't even mention her name
but there's another kind of
you know a person sort of in the
pantheon that i'm working on a little
bit to see if perhaps uh she could be a
guest
but you know to me obviously
you know adolf reed primary intellectual
influence on me
incredible hero brilliant intellectual
you know cornell west has meant a lot
sloboy jijx meant a lot
and uh you know gnome uh no means a lot
and i think um you know it's
even actually when i realize you know i
realized uh
you know some differences in world view
uh that are subtle but
it's just
the guy has been fighting
for this stuff for decades
against the genocide in vietnam for you
know everything from east
timor to chile to you know and the
pioneering manufacturing consent is an
incredible book
so jesus christ i keep getting
rings look we're going to play the first
half of the gnome chomsky interview
and uh the second half you will watch in
the post game
but let's get right to it it was a great
honor everybody enjoy it
welcome back to the michael brooks show
joining us now
very very honored and happy to have him
miss professor noam chomsky
who has been a public intellectual
linguist
activist for decades
and his author of course many books
including
manufacturing consent co-author of that
book
big influence on me and this show
most recently he's author of
internationalism or extinction
universalizing resistance professor
chomsky thank you so much for being here
pleasure to be with you can you
give us uh first your broad reaction
to the uprisings that we've seen across
the united states and in fact globally
over the past couple of weeks centered
very specifically and initially
on the police murders of george floyd
and brianna taylor
uh and then um in encompassing
uh race policing capital
and so on what what are your thoughts as
you look at these
these uh movements happening
well the first thing that comes to mind
is the absolutely unprecedented
scope scale of
participation engagement
and public support i mean if you take a
look at
polls it's astonishing the public
support
both for black lives matter and for the
protest
is well beyond what it was
say for martin luther king at the peak
of his popularity
at the time of the i have a dream speech
way beyond that and that's
uh it's also far beyond the
level of reaction to earlier events
now there were public reactions strong
ones too many
earlier police killings
but nothing like this maybe the most
similar was the reaction to the
beating of rodney king beat him almost
to death
of the after the attackers were
freed in the courts without charge
there was a week of protest
60 people were killed and
had to call in federal troops to quell
the protest
but it was in los angeles where it
happened
something else where nothing like this
no it's everywhere
and it's not just the police killing
its background issues so it's beginning
to move into
concern and inquiries and protests about
the
facts that lead to events like this
occurring
shows a enormous rise in
consciousness related but a rise in
consciousness about
400 years of vicious repression
unremitted leaving a very bitter legacy
deep issue in the whole socioeconomic
and cultural order
life's a thinking recognition of that
willingness to act on it is
without any precedent that i know of
what do you think accounts for the
unprecedented nature
unprecedented nature of this
i think it's the result of
many years of intensive
activism that we see it in many other
ways
so for example a year or so ago
the new york times ran a
important series highlighted in
important series 1619
on the history of racism in the united
states
1619 because that was the year
when the when black slaves began
coming substantial numbers
scattered cases before but it was from
1690.
uh you couldn't have imagined that a few
years ago
and that's one of many signs of
what i hope are really significant
changes that seem to be
in the way which will attribute to the
groups like black lives matter others
who've been
bringing these issues to public
attention
making people think about them wearing
what
happened the reaction right now say to
uh trump's uh tulsa appearance
bringing up the hideous record of that
it's quite important that when you go
back to
say ronald reagan when he opened his
campaign
in philadelphia mississippi town which
is known for owning one thing
the murders three civil rights workers
the message was
pretty plain but there was very little
reaction
there's much more reaction now and the
parallels
are are quite stark there um
it's very hard to get a grasp on
something like this
uh in in terms of of you know
various types of reporting
misinformation and so on
um so we need to approach it uh
gingerly but as someone who has a
rooting
in some respects in the anarchist
tradition i think maybe in many respects
what is your thought on this autonomous
zone that's a risen arose in seattle
it's one of the number of
very interesting developments in part
reactions to the
pandemic and park reactions to this
uh creating structures of
mutual support and cooperation
that extricate themselves from the
governmental structures which have been
shown to be
completely inadequate in dealing with
either particular problems like
getting water to people in need or
fundamental problems of what were
desperately unprepared for crisis now
the
autonomous zone is a interesting case of
this
also striking to see the support
uh the mayor of seattle sports
there were plenty of popular support and
that's driving
trump and fox news and spain but that's
a positive sign
something important has happening
again wouldn't lead to
you never know but i think it's an
important manifestation
of the sense that we've got to take our
lives under control that
we can't leave them in the hands of the
authorities who declare themselves our
masters we have to take charge
is it is it important to to reframe that
a bit that that
that something can arise and may even
result in quote unquote
failure uh but if there's information in
it
and if it expresses a certain impulse
uh towards justice or you know and so on
that it doesn't need to be kind of
linearly measured as a
quote-unquote success or failure
success and failure or
complicated things any serious struggle
is going to have moments of regression
now things don't work out the way you
expect
so you pick up you go on from there
anyone you can think of civil rights
women movement revelation all of them
it's a process
and i think so take say the
sanders campaign a lot of young
people i get letters all the time and
see things
posted say uh we tried
we lost it's over i'm getting out
it's not what happened what happened was
a tremendous success
unparalleled success nothing like this
has happened in
u.s political history actually almost
ever since the real
populist movement the radical farmer's
movement was
crushed by force uh here's a
the spectrum of discussion has been
substantially shifted uh things that
were
not on the agenda not long ago our
front and center universal health care
coal amplified by the pandemic
disaster green new deal
the result of that serious activism by a
small group of young people who
occupied congressional offices and the
background was the
sander success young members of congress
who swept into power
able to support them now that's on the
agenda
issue after issue sanders has made the
tactical decision which some criticized
but i think is correct
to join the biden campaign
and push it to the left uh his
associates are working on planning
commissions
and in fact if you look at the program
that's merged
it's farther to the left than anything
since fdr
offers lots of opportunities now this
didn't happen by magic
happens kind of like the green new deal
happened by constant
pressure and activism that's the way the
left ought to
conceive of elections pushing the button
is
not the issue it's the constant activism
that is
reshaping the array of choices
issues policies and
you don't win by snapping your fingers
some things work some things fail then
you pick up and you go on from there
and i think we've seen significant
changes over the years
i think the title of tonight's episode
might be you don't win by snapping your
fingers
which is unfortunate if only it were so
but um
i wanna we'll get back to the election
on a bit i do want your thoughts on
2020.
uh but uh two other things i wanna cover
uh with you first
is something of a kind of new outbreak
of a debate over speech and the left
and uh it's written by uh there was a
very
i think in fact a very good but very
provocative mataibi article dealing with
this but
more broadly beyond that sort of
particular controversy
uh you know and again
i think he wrote a very good piece but i
think that
and i want if and correct me if i'm
wrong i want to connect this with
perhaps some of your work around
manufacturing consent and a sort of
substantive view of freedom of speech
because it seems to me right now that
one you know it's sort of fallen out of
favor among some on the left
and i actually think more ominously i
frankly i prefer to just have that
actual debate uh with people uh but
some have sort of reverted to a very
narrow libertarian position which is
that if the state isn't mandating
something then it's not an issue
so then we don't have to worry about as
an example media of monopolies
or openness on tech platforms as an
example
of course you know you can hold up these
atrocious examples of all sorts of
obscene and bigoted people taking
advantage of these platforms
but at the same time we know that the
sort of overall
arc of of sort of controlling these
things will have implications for as an
example
investigating u.s foreign policy or
something like that
so anyways that's i'm giving you a lot
of a preamble here but i'd like your
thoughts
on how you relate to the question of
speech
and in fact even when it's quite
controversial and why
you hold it i i guess is both a
political and moral principle if i read
you correctly
first of all it's we should think a
little bit
as you pointed out before about the
history
why is this issue arising now
is it new it's the norm for
decades but it was always targeted
against the left
so nobody paid attention to it way
beyond
anything that's happening now right i
mean i'll just
give you personal experiences others
have far
worse ones meetings broken up
violently disrupted talks canceled
[Music]
just the books destroyed
so for example the first book that you
mentioned manufacturing consent
first book that ed herman and i wrote
together
was in early 70s a book was published by
a
very successful publisher 20 000 copies
were printed
uh the publisher was owned by a
big multi major corporation mega
corporation
and one of the executives in the
corporation saw the ads
that didn't like it and i wanted to look
at the book
it was horrifying and demanded that the
publisher
withdraw it from publication and when
they
refused he destroyed the entire
publisher
put all of its books all of its stock
was destroyed
all the books to prevent it from
distributing the book of errors
did anybody care actually out of
curiosity i brought it to the attention
of
leading civil libertarians like not hint
of
and the aclu but they didn't see any
problem
it's not state censorship if a
corporation decides to destroy a
publisher and destroy all that stock
to keep some book from appearing what's
wrong with that
in fact it was hard to find bend back
dickie it was about the one person who
found something wrong with this but
that's
that's not the only time uh i could give
you other cases of mine where
books were withdrawn from publication
and i was
asked to return the advance because it
had some political content that the
publisher didn't like other people have
been fired
the faculty positions was eliminated and
so on
nobody cared that wasn't censorship
it was directed against the left vastly
beyond
anything that's going on today now that
doesn't doesn't justify what's going on
today
first of all i really wouldn't call it
the left
so when the new york times withdraws an
op-ed
which i don't think they should have
done it's pretty hard to call that the
left
when a lot of young people decide to
de-platform some speaker i think they're
making a bad mistake
even from a tactical point of view there
are much better ways to deal with it
like you can run a counter session where
you expose what's going on and use its
educational opportunity a lot of things
can be done
so i think it's wrong in principle and
it's
tactically wrong like it's a gift to the
far right they love
it but uh and the platforms
but we should bear in mind that it's a
very
small uh part of what has been the norm
for for as long back as you want to go
it's now
targeting people who are considered
respectable in the mainstream
so it's a problem but we should be quite
aware of what's going on
but yes it's the wrong thing to do and
we should try to stop it
and it did uh thank you um and
yeah and and really just underlying that
that delineation that just because it's
happening
in the in the private sector does not
mean that it's not an enormous threat
um you know particularly to the left
obviously
one of the many pieces of activism that
we've
appreciated i've appreciated immensely
that you've been involved with was
advocating for president lula when he
was a political
prisoner you visited him when he was in
prison in kuritiva i had the honor of
going and interviewing him with
the journalists from brazil wire who's
reporting on exposing the truth of that
case
even before the intercept leaks they you
know they laid the intellectual
groundwork for understanding that case
uh so and and and we were
uh honored to cover it significantly on
this show and including using clips of
yours explaining the situation
can you tell us why you think
president lula is such a particularly
important
leader and i mean the situation
obviously continues
even more dire today but with corona
um can you reflect on that a bit
well president lula came from a
world-class background he was a union
activist
during the dictatorship latter days and
dictatorship
that succeeded in organizing
significant opposition run for president
you had the his victory stolen a couple
of times
but he finally won the presidency
initiated a new era in brazilian history
now you don't take my word for it and
take the word world bank
not a radical institution 2016
couple years after the end of his term
they published a long study of
recent brazilian economic history they
called
lula's term in office the golden decade
of brazilian economic history
uh enormous reduction of poverty
a tremendous increase in inclusion in
parts of large parts of the population
and then blacks the indians were
totally marginalized and repressed were
brought into it
uh policies to give people some control
over their lives
uh tremendous success uh
he was his a couple of years after he
left office there was a
fall in commodity crisis and many
argue that it was just the high
commodity prices
was based with successes on the world
bank disagreed
you know they say with the right
policies it
could have all been continued after the
commodity form
at the same time brazil became
one of the most respected countries in
the world if not the most respected
uh yet take a look now
it's an absolute pariah one of the most
ridiculed and condemned countries in the
world it's a big shift
well after there were plenty of problems
with this term
i should say but one of them was he
tolerated
corruption much too
[Music]
we often don't call it corruption
but there's plenty of just planned
straight corruption
but so that was he he did tolerate
the the same you really think this
administration really failed to do
was to get people to understand
that they were part of the system that
was developing
so in fact now it's quite striking i've
seen this in visiting
brazil you probably have two in polls
and so on
when people are asked people who
benefited greatly from the
littlest programs fossil familia and
others
people like talk to people they were
very poor families they were able to
buy a car and kids could go to college
and
start a small business when you asked
them
how did this happen they said it came
from god
or it was an accident
you know they don't know that it was
part of the workers party programs
and that was a real failure of
engagement
that just sort of came to them somehow
they were not part of it that was a big
failure
and there are other things criticized
but the judgment about the golden decade
i think he's quite right
and the rise of brazil
to a position of international
great international respect as a voice
of the global south
was extremely significant and part of
the reason for this downfall
the power systems don't like that
upstarts
are not supposed to do that to take
one case brazil along with turkey
negotiated a deal with iran
which could have completely ended the
crisis
obama clinton came down on them like a
ton of bricks
this is our business not your business
got to look i won't go into the details
but that's a general reaction
inside brazil it's rather similar the
elites in brazil are extremely racist
and class conscious and here's this guy
who comes from a work-class background
that doesn't even speak proper
portuguese he didn't go to the right
schools
he's supposed to be humble grateful for
what we do
for him not up there uh setting policy
uh you talk to people you just sense the
bitterness
and anger just for these reasons quite
apart from the policies
even more than the policy anyhow a
couple years after he was out of
office a soft coup was initiated
uh okay don't go through the details but
it finally led to the
october 2018 election
uh lula was jailed
he was the most popular candidate very
likely to win
he was jailed on very dubious charges
but he was also silenced not just jail
which tells you what was going on unlike
mass murder or on death's road he was
not permitted to make a statement
that was very important he had he
kept quiet during the electoral campaign
now he's held on
sort of uh partial release
while the appeals were going on but
before the election not keep them out
and uh
what came in was an ultra
right fanatic who's destroying brazil
i'm in the country right now is just
about on the verge of a military coup
i don't know if you saw the clips from a
couple of days ago
where the bolsonaro gangs were
attacking the parliamentary building the
supreme court and saying
get rid of it uh they're blocking
the uh our hero the executive
bolsonaro uh fired the
heads of the investigative divisions
which were looking into his family
this statement was nobody's going to
fuck around with my family
right that's it's pretty similar to what
just happened here
very similar bolsonaro sees himself as a
kind of clone of
trump you know tragedy and force
next to each other and trump which trump
just did is very similar
he just fired all the inspectors general
who were put into place to monitor
corruption and malfeasance and executive
offices they were winning beginning to
inquire
into this fetid swamp that he's created
in washington
so he fired them all and he went up like
any tin pot dictator
went out of his way to humiliate
the senior republican senator
charles grassley who'd spent his career
setting this system in
implementation not a peak from the
republican party
they've disappeared as a party that's
worse than the old communist party
the leader gives an order
we creep on our knees and bless him
nothing like this in political history
you know could
hey folks first half
of a great conversation with professor
noam chomsky we're going to play the
second half in the post game
for patrons uh i
i mean i love it i i absolutely agree
with him
on the speech question we were
potentially going to talk about the
taibi essay which people should read
in the post game and you know you could
whatever there's
various there's things to sort of
nitpick about here and there which i you
know have some some like i had some
disagreements about the times part or
whatever
but the overall part about
the strategic reasons for a serious
substantive commitment
to freedom of speech and not accepting
the terms i mean that that is really the
sort of very disturbing to me the idea
that
after decades of seeing i mean
both literal public suppression we'll
talk about eugene debs
in the post game and literally being a
political prisoner of the us
imperial machine there's a reason
socialists were involved in creating the
aclu
um but also in the examples that chomsky
pointed out you know totally in the
private domain i
i i think across the board whether we're
talking about bureaucracy
whether it's some myth and lie that
bureaucracy
is purely the products of the public
sector and not the private one
uh we we have to have substantive
commitments in all these domains so i
i like noam chomsky's uh insight and
clarity on that issue
um and of course many other things in
the second half of the interview
uh even look he's gonna talk about how
despicable
and dangerous and grotesque trump is um
you know not something to shrug your
shoulders at like there's actual
the the conversation has gotten so stuck
i think between you know people that are
absolutely rightly
well you know they understand why trump
is appealing in some ways they
understand the humor
whatever what he tapped into
uh in 2016 and they want to be real
about it for purposes of beating him
um and they're repulsed by the
embarrassing ridiculous you know cable
news democratic party hashtag resistance
and all of these people that you know we
criticize endlessly
and at the same time and we've talked
about it on this show
you know ripping up the global arms
control infrastructure
um that's significant the fact that
you know he does in fact uh
feed and foment every form of bigotry
discrimination and brutalism
and also the fact that this right-wing
populism thing is bullshit
as evidenced by as an example of the
tyson food and meat packing thing we
were talking about in the beginning
and so you know well you know we
definitely talk about other things but i
would say
that even in the the trump stuff the way
he fits it together
actually a very good and substantive
synthesis of a
systemic and radical left critique which
of course automatically makes the
conversation about neoliberalism and
capitalism and these broader historical
forces which he of course talks about
but also in fact these specific tensions
of our moment that just because
um you know
we got to be very careful of the
tendency that just because people that
might be um you know wrong about other
things
or annoying or just miss a whole hell of
a lot
it doesn't mean that they're wrong about
you know
inspiring the inspector generals as an
example like that's actually a very
solid
very clear point that he just
articulated there that's relevant
gnome gives trump a superlative label in
this uh
sec this next part and i think he
justifies it uh very well in a way that
i think
i think there is i think when people try
to balance the scales too much and say
the gop and the democrats are the same
thing which i know why people say that
obviously we all know why
the very real reasons for saying that
but it's also i think kind of
psychologically nice to think that trump
isn't as horrible and world
threatening as he is his administration
broadly again nom's not just talking
about trump the chief
right but i think it is important to
keep that in mind absolutely and he does
it very well and very ably so
uh folks and of course we're talking
with daniel bessner about the pentagon
hollywood and policing we've got a bunch
of stories to get to
uh from amlo with an extraordinary
courage in terms of getting fuel
shipments to venezuela
under siege by the united states the
tensions that threaten the whole planet
i'm telling you watch the dynamic
between china and
india and this border region especially
in the context of ratchet attention to
pakistan
the stripping of the indian constitution
and
heightened waves of brutalism you see
from the bjp government in kashmir
and a much more um assertive china
i mean this is something another aspect
of things we'll have to watch so we have
a ton of stories to get to
guys you make it all possible so join us
and let's keep growing and doing this
great work we appreciate everybody
um and uh patreon.comtnbs come watch the
second half of the chomsky interview
with us thank you matt thank you david
thanks everybody
we will see you in the post game
