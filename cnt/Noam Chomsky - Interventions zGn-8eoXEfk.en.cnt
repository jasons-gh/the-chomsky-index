in his book interventions author Noam
Chomsky discusses u.s. foreign policy
and other topics this event hosted by
back pages books in Waltham
Massachusetts is a little over an hour
since where where so much and then it
seems like the world leadership I think
most recently of course hear about
benazir bhutto having been educated in
in this area and at Harvard and and so
many of the world leaders seem seem to
come here to be educated for better for
worse you know even recent that is
definitely up until the Second World War
the United States was kind of a cultural
backward if you wanted to study
philosophy or physics you'd go to
England or Germany you want to be a
writer you'd go to Paris the United
States at that time in its relation to
the rest of the world was kind of like I
want to insult anybody but maybe central
Indiana to Boston today it's a place you
tried to get out of if you wanted to be
a creative writer I think or something
that changed during the Second World War
and it you know for in fact the whole
relationship between the United States
and the world changed and part of it was
the much of the rest of the industrial
world was seriously harmed or destroyed
and the United States gained enormous
Lee during the war in fact it already
was by far the richest country in the
world but industrial production more
than tripled during the Second World War
and it just ended up the United States
ended up owning half they having half
the wealth of the world yeah there's
never been anything like that in history
and it affected the mentality the
institutions and so on them this radical
shift so what we see today is not the
traditional United States certainly
certainly not do you are there any
commonalities and these people who come
out of this sort of modern education
system who are becoming world leaders
around do they
there seem to be sort of a similar
foundational approach are they taking
anything out of this American system
where this American ideal if that is
true it does not reflect very well on
the educational system here take a look
at the world is this what we want to
train people to create I guess it it
ties into a question I've been thinking
about is sort of obsessively rereading
poem called The Hollow Men by TS Eliot
and then it's sort of it begins this we
are the Hollow Men where the straw men
but it ends with the lullabies sort of
this is the way the world ends this is
the way the world ends this is the way
the world ends not with a bang but with
a whimper and it strikes me that that
you know I I look to education very
often as a route of how people can port
themselves even even in the political
sphere where maybe we perhaps shouldn't
be expecting that to be a relevant sort
of part of your resume but that that it
seems to me that for all of the
bombastic things that are happening
around the world it seems to be
occurring here almost as as a whimper as
a as a whimper and as the end of this
poem that it that it seems to be
incredibly muted here in in in Boston
and in America in general and and while
there are definitely large movements you
know there's a level of obfuscation that
seems to be preventing that from being a
general sentiment that you feel
day-to-day walking around and I wonder
if are there other places like this in
the world where people feel muted do
they feel almost as though things are
for how large the scale they are and in
what's happening that it oddly has this
sort of played down sense to your your
maybe your sensibility of what you can
do about it but maybe your sensibility
of even how to grasp the concept of
what's happening in the first place
I guess I just don't see it that way
really
in fact seems to be more exciting now
than it was 30 years ago much more than
it was 50 years ago
in what ways what because I guess well
let's just take this room absolutely
okay when I started giving talks on
general topics it was originally the
Vietnam War back in the early 60s a talk
would be in a somebody's living room
with two neighbors or in a church with
four people the minister the organizer
somebody who wanted to kill me and a
drunk who walked in off the street and
that was the level of concern for the
outside world
in fact horrible things were going on
all over the world the United States was
involved in them and nobody cared for
example I don't want to take a poll but
very a trial with your friends I mean
very few people even know when the
United States attacked South Vietnam I
mean that was one of the major events of
the of modern history ask people when
that the United States attack South
Vietnam I mean we did have a client
state there which killed about maybe 60
70 thousand people during the 50s but
when did the invasion take place well
turns out I was 1962 nobody cared I mean
it wasn't a secret you could read in the
back pages of the New York Times that
the John F Kennedy had sent the US Air
Force to start bombing South Vietnam
under South Vietnamese and markings
planes with South Vietnamese markings so
they wouldn't know that the huge jet
there's the US Air Force the that's when
they start at the programs of chemical
warfare to destroy crops and ground
cover
they started rounding people up and
driving them into what we're about at
the concentration camps open with
millions of people into strategic
Hamlet's and urban slums authorized
napalm a really big attack
nobody even cared I mean a couple of
years it was years before things really
became vitalized and the 60s just
changed the place enormous ly so for
example a meeting like this would have
been inconceivable in fact as late as
the late 60s the politically active
groups like say SDS you could barely
mention a word like capitalism you know
people would shrink and god that's
really frightening concept to talk about
that how many things we just take for
granted now we're considered outlandish
then and in many areas in fact it's
striking to compare the beginning of the
Vietnam War with the beginning of the
Iraq war in the case of the Iraq war
there were huge protests before the war
started in the case of Vietnam you
didn't get for a test of that scale
until South Vietnam and essentially
destroyed much of the rest of the region
as well I think there there is a
remaking that it goes goes on though so
that the the sense of people who weren't
alive or aware during that period is is
often that yeah you know the 60s are are
this this decade you know they start in
1960 they end in 1969 you see but they
didn't end as a strike it's picked up
since then absolutely I mean a major
popular movements that had a real effect
on the society are from a later period
it takes a the women's movement which
just changed the society enormous Lee I
mean take say MIT again since I'll want
to talk about Boston if you walk down
the halls of MIT when I got there 1955
you'd see white well-dressed deferential
males okay
take a walk down the holes now well you
know what you're going to see it's about
half women third minorities casual dress
informal relations and it's just
political activism was unheard of at the
time and it's just changed tremendously
and that's changed all over the country
but the women's movement is primarily a
product of the 60s as germs were in the
70s the germs were there in the 60s but
barely
and then it picked up and changed things
enormous Leora take say the
environmental movement I mean that
speaking of the end of the earth that's
going to be important came out of it
began developing the seventies the
Solidarity movement Central American
solidarity movements now worldwide
that's the 80s and that's something new
in Western history I mean no one say in
France ever thought of going to live in
an Algerian or a Vietnamese village in
order to help the people who were under
attack from French violence you know
nobody thought of going to live in a
Vietnamese village effect in the 1980s
thousands of people did it and now it's
all over the world I guess it begs
almost a simple definition question that
is you know sort of what is contemporary
liberalism with this my sense that there
are not the there and you say platforms
they're not necessarily the same kinds
of platforms and movements especially
where you can say you know I am liberal
and I am a communist I am liberal and I
am a socialist or I mean anarchists
they're not you know you don't hear that
as often in these discussions now there
seems to be a different kind of
solidarity and different kind of
definition of liberalism and I wonder
what you see that as being now one
reason is the world words have simply
lost meaning so what does it mean to be
a liberal or a communist or anything
else I mean D
when t'adore well-made I'm in the one
way of trying to undermine independent
thoughts and creative approaches to the
world is to simply destroy the way of
talking about things so the were the
words literally almost have no meaning
in fact by now just about every word has
that's used in political discourse has
at least two meetings a literal meaning
and its opposite and it's the opposite
that's normally used so take a
contemporary debate that's going on
right now
you see headlines in newspapers about a
report on foreign fighters in Iraq
Condoleezza Rice announces that she's
got a with his knees you asked a
question about how can we sell problem
in Iraq that's quite easy just keep the
foreign fighters out keep the foreign
weapons out and it'll all be settled and
nobody are there 150,000 US troops there
I mean are they bringing in weapons
they're not farm because anything we do
is not foreign if we invaded Canada they
would be enemy confidence and we would
be there by right so the concept of
concepts like aggression invasion terror
anything you mentioned this doesn't
exist I'm gonna take take democracy a
George Bush was in Egypt yesterday
praising President Mubarak the Egyptians
are writhing at the same time he's
giving talks about how we have to
promote democracy and so on I mean they
just come from Saudi Arabia the most
extreme one of the most extreme
fundamentalist charities in the world
you know see a picture of him with King
Abdullah watching a horse show and so on
and so forth I mean well what are we to
make of all of this the terms for
discussing things have been almost
evacuated of content that's why you
don't hear these words but on the other
hand people's instincts and commitments
and
agents I think are significantly
improved over the 60s I'm gonna take
your own field okay which you were
telling me about yeah you go back to the
nineteen sixties the general assumption
even in the academic world was that
there was nobody living in this
hemisphere just a couple of savages
wandering around the you know the the
idea that what has been discovered about
the pre the pre contact history it's
just you know it's kind of mind-boggling
if he's go back it was what was even in
scholarly literature at the time a
little on people's ordinary mentality I
mean like when I was growing up as a kid
you know I considered myself pretty
leftist but I would play cowboys and
Indians where we were the Cowboys
killing the Indians if maybe it still
happened somewhere but like not wouldn't
be my children they would never have
done that these are just changes that
took place in our consciousness our
conception of what the past was what
we've done who we are how we relate to
one another
that's just changed enormous ly that a
lot of sparks were lit in the 60s but
much of it took off later
for example the beginnings of the
rediscovery actually of the what
happened the original sin of this
country what happened to the native
population that really just began in the
70s yeah
from outside the academic world
incidentally people like Francis
Jennings where are these where these
words have lost so much if not all of
their meaning and and you look at the
sort of there's a rhetorical sort of
tactic of this government in particular
which is sort of the the broad blitz so
if you send out you know the top ten
people you have and you reiterate the
lie on ten news programs at once in the
same sort of quasi doublespeak sort of
way so that it becomes a truth
I wonder is is that if if you look at
the rhetoric being used by other world
leaders around the world whether you
know whether it's it's Vladimir Putin or
whether it's Sarkozy or whether it's
Hugo Chavez are there are there
different are there drastically
different tactics of the same sort of
approach being used right now or they
are they sort of all following this
model of just sort of blitzing the same
idea over and over until people don't
particularly listen I think well it's a
mistake to expect anything from leaders
other than attempts to expand their
power and control and domination they
differ but as soon as you mentioned the
word leader you should shudder and look
somewhere else and in a free society you
might have representatives but you
wouldn't have leaders so let's imagine
that this was a really functioning we're
in the primary season well what would a
Democratic primary be say take New
Hampshire it wouldn't be a candidate
comes into a town and says tells you
otherwise about themselves and what
would happen is the people in the town
would get together and say look work out
the kinds of programs they want the next
president to follow and then if somebody
wants to come in to be elected they'd
say okay you can come here's what we
want you to do if you're willing to do
that maybe we will vote for you if
you're not we're not willing to vote for
it but you don't have and then you there
should be mechanisms to ensure that they
do it or else you throw them out but the
way we do it is quite different the
leaders come they tell you what they
present themselves usually falsely and
you're then to decide well do I want him
we're going on him but that's completely
backwards from what a functioning
democratic society would be so when you
talk about leaders you have to shiver on
the other hand there are differences so
take say each other so you mentioned
on December 30 people know this but on
December 31st at the end of last year
Chavez announced an amnesty for
participants in the military coup in
2002 April 2002 not for all of them for
many of them this is a military coup
backed by the United States probably
with participation u.s. participation
certainly support which overthrew the
government kidnapped the president
disbanded Parliament the supreme Supreme
Court every other democratic
institutions applauded in the United
States denounced in Latin America almost
entirely it was overturned in a couple
of days later but suppose it happened
here I'm supposed there was a military
coup here which overthrew the government
you know kidnapped and George Bush
disbanded Congress and something that's
something that was a popular uprising
and it overturned the coup I mean would
they be amnestied the people who took
part of me you get the death sentence
you know there wouldn't be any question
of amnesty well I don't know it was out
of embarrassment or lack of interest but
I had a friend do a database search on
coverage of the amnesty a couple of
lines scattered lines here and there I'm
sure you know that Chavez is like a
demon and the Western press and one of
his worst crimes which just elicited a
a torrent of abuse was canceling the
counseling the license of a television
station RCTV actually didn't close the
station country it was said he canceled
their license to take up a large part of
the publicly owned frequencies they
could still go on cable that was
considered utterly horrendous and the
press you know denounced them think this
couldn't it kind of think it never
happened here it's perfectly true it
couldn't happen here but very few have
pointed out the reason the station if
you have to think of an analogy let's go
back to the imagine the military coup in
the United States the way I described
suppose the CBS helped instigate the
coup I supported it openly as the
popular uprising took place that
overthrew the coup leaders CBS started
playing you know comedies and anything
to let so that people wouldn't know
what's going on in the streets but what
would happen to CBS afterwards to their
managers and owners would they be
allowed to keep broadcasting for five
years and then have their pub their
license to public broadcasting removed
immediately sent to jail probably get
the death sentence
so it's true it wouldn't happen here but
not for exactly the reasons that were
mentioned well you know go on and on
like this we simply let me take one last
example to illustrate your starett you
know the difficulty of applying to
ourselves the standards we do to others
take 911 you know terrible atrocity a
huge outpouring of sympathy and support
all over the world including
incidentally from the jihadi movements
and they later turned because of our
reaction to it at the beginning they
were highly can condemned it very
strongly and it was a terrible atrocity
undoubtedly but it could have been worse
so let's imagine how it could have been
worse for
I suppose that on September 11th al
Qaeda had bombed the white house that
killed the president
instituted a murderous brutal regime
which killed maybe fifty two hundred
thousand people and tortured about seven
hundred thousand set up a major
international terror center in
Washington which was overthrowing
governments all over the world
installing brutal vicious neo-nazi
dictatorships assassinating people I
suppose he called in a bunch of
economists call him the Kandahar Boys to
run the American economy who within a
couple of years had driven the economy
into one of the worst collapses of its
history you know I suppose that this had
happened look that would have been worse
than 9/11 right what did happen and it
happened on 9/11 it happened on
September 11th 1973 in Chile the only
thing I've changed its per capita
equivalence which is the right way to
look at it well did that change the
world no I did but from our point of
view in fact who who even knows about it
well because and and because just in
terms of your comment of the reported so
it just to finish we were responsible
for that definitely and and but because
you know as you said with the amnesty on
December 31st which received no coverage
you know you look at Chile during that
period and you look at the New York
Times majority of the articles are being
filed from Argentina they're not even
being filed from Chile so your where is
that you know the the magnitude of the
event was immediately I think muted by
the fact that nobody who was reporting
for the American media was even there
yes not the case every all the wire
services covered it which means that
every editorial office knew I mean every
editorial office picks up Reuters and AP
and AFP and so on so yeah every desk at
every editorial office knew about it
they decided not to print it the main
reason is it just doesn't fit the image
that's supposed to be presented
actually I was even involved in that
inadvertently when you you all win
Chavez was at the UN a couple of years
ago
he he gave a talk they gave a press
conference in which he allegedly said
that he was very sorry that he hadn't
been able to meet me before I died that
was big stories all over the country I
was actually interviewed by the New York
Times they thought it was very funny
what did I have to say about it and so
on so that was a big issue because then
he could show what a crazy idiot he is
the only one problem that's not what he
said what he said is that it was very
explicit unambiguous he said he was
sorry that he hadn't been able to meet
John Kenneth Galbraith before he died
well evidently the editorial offices
decided that it wouldn't do to present
the image of Chavez as somebody who
admires a liberal icon so they changed
it you know it was pointed out right
away a fair media monitoring
organization a very good one immediately
looked at the transcript and wrote the
New York Times and others saying and so
it was and the New York Times did issue
a correction 17 days later the bottom of
whatever at page of advertisements do
you have any others correction all right
you can imagine that the American press
didn't understand the Spanish it's hard
to imagine how John Kenneth Galbraith
and Noam Chomsky would be confused but
let's imagine it did live long not
understand the Spanish I did a little
more Carrillo and Chile not understand
the Spanish is this just a way of
demonizing a figure who the state orders
you must demonize I think it does
independent whether you like them or not
I think it
you know it strikes me more often that
you know while this was sort of an
extraordinary you know moment of just
yeah baffling sort of rewriting that
they did it often it seems like the
articles that you find and the reportage
that you see is is just diversion
oriented so that I remember reading an
article about the the coup in Chile
where the entire it was a front-page New
York Times article from just after
September 11th 1973 where the entire
article was about bank runs in Argentina
and and nothing about Chile there was
there was no sense even that that who
was Pinochet what was going on what was
at that point the hunter that was in
control and bear in mind it's a much
worse atrocity than our 911 what's often
called in South America the second 911
for good reasons actually had personal
in Sabac I had a teenage son who my wife
and I decided to Lexington where we live
the Lexington movie theater was playing
missing you know the film about so we
took our son figure you learn learn
something about it he thought it was a
kind of an interesting adventure story
but as we were walking out of the
theater I was listening to people
talking about it I don't think much of
the audience knew that it was about
Chile I mean they knew that the American
government had done some bad thing they
hadn't rescued this nice American guy
but that's about the level of them
that's true that the film didn't spell
out in detail this is Chile 1973 United
States helped instigate a coup which had
all these horrible effects but it takes
a remarkable degree of insularity
not to know enough about the world to
appreciate what this is I should say
that the second 9/11 hours one of its
consequences was to introduce many
cracks in that insularity
it opened a lot of people's minds you
could see that in all sorts of ways and
I could see just personally like the
number of invitations from around the
country to give talks just escalated
radically audiences are much bigger much
more engaged small bookstores like a
little left book stores which were
barely struggling along had to suddenly
reprint books from the 1980s and 70s it
never sold because people are interested
a lot of people one of the consequences
of it was to shatter some of the kind of
inner internal focus of a highly insular
society and maybe people feel look we
gotta learn something about the world do
you think that even though perhaps the
yeah these sort of these sort of
platforms or identifiable movements
attached to an issue may have sort of
sort of dropped off in certain ways in
the old sort of polemical identification
way that now perhaps it is the seeking
of information that drives this more
than anything because it's I think it is
abundantly clear to people that it's you
know you can't just turn on the CBS
Evening News
you know this clip emerged last week of
Katie Couric you know clips between her
her segments from New Hampshire where
she you know it's clear that she she
said has no sense whatsoever of what
even she's reporting on so that people
perhaps it is the seeking in and of
itself that might that might be
engendering the the larger the larger
you know sort of sort of active sense
that people have well you know it's hard
to generalize about a diverse complex
society like this one but there are
tendencies that you can identify and one
tendency is to a certain level of
skepticism a certain level of interest
and independent inquiry trying to find
out what happened I mean it can lead in
crazy directions too it can lead to wild
conspiracy theories and so on and so
forth Internet
kind of tends to engender that kind of
phenomenon but on but it's also just a
much healthier concern with things that
are happening in the world the internet
also brings in I think a tremendous
amount you can't find anywhere else I
did does before and perhaps that what's
that maybe what what makes it better is
this sense that you have to be more
discerning with what you're reading but
you're prepared to be discerning which
was not the case perhaps with the older
media up on that cusp of when the
internet was I think sort of really
rising there you know that a lot of
folks I think weren't as able to be as
rapidly critical so because you got one
picture the morning newspaper you know
the local television station yeah now if
you want at least you can get it quite a
wide variety of information for example
the things they just mentioned you can
find out about it takes as you say
discernment first of all commitment and
then discernment it's not much different
from the sciences in that respect you
can't just take a look at all the data
that exists and come up with a theory
you have to know what makes sense to
look at what doesn't make sense you have
to a sort of a framework of
interpretation I mean the best scientist
is not the one who can list all the
papers that have been written on the
topic he's working on it's the one who
knows what to look at actually I had a
friend at MIT who was Nobel Prize
laureate and biology once described to
me how he taught his classes he said he
goes in and gives a lecture about the
way he thinks it or these things ought
to be just in principle and then the
task of the students is to check the
literature and find out if he's right
and and that's kind of the way you have
to look at the world too because just
you can get overwhelmed with meaningless
data you have to pick out what matters
which does take discernment and training
and so on if we had the kind of
educational systems that you and I
wouldn't the rest of us would like to
have that's what children would be
trained to do with me encouraged to do
figure out how to do it it's very
different than No Child Left Behind
we're trained to pass tests family I've
I've gotten selfish here I don't know if
anybody has a question on this sort of
the sort of topic at all you yes you yes
as a child of the period of the 1930s
and 40s I grew up thinking as I got
older that the world is never going to
be like this again I'm quite an
optimistic view how things change but as
time goes along as I get older I find
that the world repeats itself and that
many of the things that I had feared are
still all going wrong and will continue
to go on and I look at and I see a very
dangerous and dire world as we look
further into the future and wondering
whether you have the same feelings and
had the same experience and whether at
this point you two are looking
optimistically to the future as
well I I guess we're about the same age
I grew up in the 30s and 40s - but and
those were very frightening
period I'm the rise of fascism over the
Europe was really frightening actually I
can remember the first article I wrote
which was in okay exactly when it was it
was February 1939 I was right after the
fall of Barcelona was fourth-grade
newspaper that was the editor and the
only reader of I guess but and it was a
buddy I kind of remember it was about
this this symbol of Austria falling then
Czechoslovakia falling no Franco has
taken over Spain you know what's gonna
come next it looked like this monstrous
plague was going to spread over the
world
then came the depression was bad enough
much more serious economic crisis than
anything that's happened in the years
since then comes the war Holocaust
wasn't really known then was known bits
and pieces were known but was really
only known about later and then we at
the end of the word after all I mean you
can probably remember August 8 1945 when
the atom bomb was used I mean that
struck me as being as terrifying as the
fall of the rise of fascism over Europe
and that could be the end of the world
it may turn out to be the end of the
world but it was already pretty clear on
the 6th of 6th of 1945
even worse a couple days later when
Nagasaki was
then came many real Horrors I mean the
threats of the Cold War were in fact
exaggerated but they weren't something
real was exaggerated and so it goes on
is it worse now in some ways yes I mean
there are two maybe three contingencies
that might really deal a lethal blow to
the survival of species 1 remains
nuclear weapons and that threat is
getting worse unfortunately another is
environmental catastrophe and we may be
deer or some kind of tipping point on
that it's not Joe and others pandemics I
mean if there's a bird flu mutation the
kind that could happen it could lead to
a pandemic and which huge numbers of
people would and very little is being
done about any of these things in fact
in many ways they're getting worse so
there's reasons for pessimism on the
other hand there are reasons for
optimism including those we just were
talking about the it's a much more
civilized society than it was 30 or 40
years ago in many respects including
those we mentioned and you can see it in
policy as well I mean it back in the 50s
and the 60s the United States was
overthrowing governments that will
imposing brutal violent murders
tyrannies every year they'd be a couple
of them I can't do that anymore the last
time the United States tried to support
a military coup to overthrow a
democratic government was in 2002 in
Venezuela and it was returned within a
couple of days for one thing that was a
huge uproar in Latin America about it
most of Latin America and also because
there was a popular uprising and also
because the US couldn't couldn't do it
openly you know the way it was done in
the past because there's too much
opposition here well there's a reason
the things like that or reasons for
optimism
so you take a choice I mean you can be
pessimistic if you like the whale
imagine golden days of the past or look
at the things that are positive and ride
it with an amplified bit tricky to
detangle what's going on on a social the
social from the biological and I tagged
that question onto the gentleman's last
question so when I talk about the social
I just think everything about human
activities that's how I think about it
from the social so biologically is is
there something underlined what we see
going on on a social level and in that
way is that a commentary about human
beings where the circular cyclic thing
about what we do keeps repeating itself
is that about human nature
having grown up in the 1930s as I can't
hear what you're saying
the nature of her question was that
there's to her it seems that there there
is there's no there's some connectivity
between the social and the biological
aspects of humanity and just sort of
humanity in general correct yes and what
sort of creature are we exactly so so do
you see if do you see any sort of
relationship in the biological end of
things that sort of sort of explains the
more social aspects I guess of the way
we act and why we do what we do is that
correct yes one of the many areas where
I think people should be pretty
skeptical is in what you read about this
I mean there's that's very popular topic
these days to discuss what evolutionary
psychology is it's now called
sociobiology it used to be teaches us
about the nature of humans but the
problem is it doesn't teaches anything
much at all it's extremely it's an
extremely hard scientific problem to
understand the nature of any organism
say insects we can do any experiment you
like when you get to something as
complex as human beings which is just
fine is it almost anything you look for
you want to find aggressiveness and
violence and sadism yeah we can find
that that we don't need evolutionary
psychology to tell us about it we see it
in the world you want to find
self-sacrifice courage integrity a
willingness to sacrifice yourself for
some totally you know remote species
like to wade out into the wintery waters
of Cape Cod and save dolphins now you
can find that you can find what what you
look for the humans have all these
capacities different ones manifest
themselves and different circumstances
and
with different backgrounds and so on but
the science is just don't reach far
enough to answer questions like this a
little you know it's worth looking at
I'm there's interesting work say Robert
rivers has work on reciprocal altruism
which is very interesting how a
willingness to have an altruistic
relation to someone else could pay off
in terms of selection survival
yeah it could and that tells you maybe
something interesting about the roots of
this concept it's not a new idea
incidentally the first book on this
topic called mutual aid a factor in
evolution was written over a century ago
by Kropotkin leading anarchist thinker
who is also a natural historian and he
tried to show this is I think maybe
nineteen two or something like that that
you know he have a lot of evidence but
he tried to argue that in the natural
world and up to humans mutual aid a
commitment to help others and help the
community would be could have survival
value and could have been selected for
so maybe that's kind of creature we are
and in some sense yes that's the kind of
creature we are we're also unfortunately
any other kind of creature if you like
so yes there's certainly a connection
and someday maybe we'll be understood
but and there's something known about it
it's not that knowledge is zero but a
big grain of salt is necessary whenever
you read articles in the New York Times
Magazine about it
right into doing something that's
effective it must have been frustrating
and I don't know when your private was
frustrated
realizing that facts and reality didn't
really change things much you know that
you could you could explain something to
Congress people or whatever and they'd
still vote for a million dollars a day
to El Salvador
he must it must be maddening but but
it's speaking of diving deeper I mean
what do you think we can do - apart from
using facts which don't seem to work to
increase the sense of empathy that we've
seem to lack when we you know bomb other
countries indiscriminately or destroy
them economically you put much thought
to you know what you know how we can
actually make something happen from what
you know you explain to us so
beautifully well yeah but I don't think
there's any just rephrase that on the on
the mic so that so that people can hear
it just in terms of I think you know
he's asking what sort of thought goes in
to what Professor Chomsky is is writing
as he goes understanding that for
perhaps words and ideas are not do not
have the same efficacy now at least they
may used to have had so that so that
going going forward you know is there a
way to sort of sort of plan what you're
going to write that that sort of affects
people in a way where they have I think
a greater sensibility then of what we're
doing abroad and what the political
sense of is that
I mean the fact that there's a couple
hundred people here with a better raised
consciousness it doesn't change the fact
that we're finding other countries and
doing things and there's no
repercussions for the leaders or
representatives but why do you think it
doesn't change things
I mean it's there are things that the
United States did that leaders did quite
freely years ago can't do now
so take the the most liberal
administration's like say Kennedy I mean
Kennedy was carrying out a major
terrorist war against Cuba it wasn't
particularly secret you know I mean not
all the details were known then they're
known now but when Arthur Schlesinger
vengence biography of Robert Kennedy
wrote John F Kennedy was there of course
the John F Kennedy gave Robert Kennedy
the task of bringing the terrors of the
earth to Cuba and that Robert Kennedy
picked that as his highest priority and
went ahead and did it American
presidents can't do that now because of
the change of consciousness just as they
can't over go around it will be much
worse but it doesn't remotely compared
with the Indochina Wars I mean these is
what we knew at the time was horrifying
enough but what has come out recently
and is not being reported although you
can find it is much worse so it takes a
Cambodia I mean we now know we didn't
know in 1972 but we now know that in
1973 Nixon gave Kissinger words
you know I'm carry out a massive bombing
of Cambodia and Kissinger transmitted
those orders to Al Haig with the words
which were something like this massive
bomb against a campaign of Kemba against
Cambodia anything that flies against
anything that moves you even have to
work pretty hard to find a call for
genocide at that level and the archives
of any state well we now know it we
didn't know it then and something
happened after that well a good path you
know a better path
I mean there's trajectories going on one
is the dangers and the threats are
getting much worse in fact they may be
threats to survival on the other hand
there's an improvement in consciousness
and understanding and commitment and
solidarity which one is going faster let
me go back a little and in 1973 Henry
Kissinger transmitted to the Air Force
al haig the kiss Nixon's off orders to
bomb Cambodia the words were something
like this massive bombing campaign
against Cambodia anything that flies
against anything that moves okay suppose
that at the trial of Milosevic the
International trial somebody had found a
statement of militia which is saying
against Bosnia anything that flies
against anything that moves
okay trial would be over you get 25
death sentences finished this is us it
was reported barely you can find it
he's on a trial and very few people know
about it nor do they know about the
consequences there is there was a study
by two leading Cambodia scholars been
cured in and on Taylor been cured and as
the head of the genocide project Yale
will know in Cambodia scholar Taylor -
they published an article in which they
went through documents that had been
Declassified during the Clinton years on
the actual bombing of Cambodia it turns
out it was five times as high as the
horrifying level that was already known
it was the bombing of rural Cambodia was
greater than the total Allied bombing
and all theaters throughout World War
two direct against rural Cambodia and as
they point out at one of the effects was
that the Khmer Rouge had been a marginal
group in Cambodia became a huge army of
enraged peasants and we know what they
did next okay well that information is
now there you can find it it wasn't
reported they their article appeared in
a Canadian Journal as far as I know the
only publication of it in the United
States is an article on zenit that I
posted there and now it's appearing in
some other places and so on but you know
these are things that happened freely we
can at least now know about them and no
American government is doing anything
like that now nor could they as for the
effect of the public it's significant I
don't know if you've ever looked at the
Pentagon Papers
the full Pentagon Papers not the
excerpts that appeared in the New York
Times but take a look sometime at the
ending it ends in early 1968 right after
the Tet Offensive after the Tet
Offensive Johnson wanted to send another
couple hundred thousand troops to South
Vietnam the millet the Joint Chiefs
opposed it and the reason that they
opposed it is they thought they would
need these troops here for civil
disorder control if they because of the
popular reaction that would take place
if they did it you may not
convinced many congressmen to vote
differently but you can get people to
understand that they look at these
things differently and when they do that
creates a frame kind of a background in
which any leader is going to which any
leaders gonna have to react I mean even
a dictatorship you can't ignore the
population and in a relatively free
society certainly can't so therefore
decisions are made differently the
leaders become followers much more than
they want to and as we would want them
to be because they're things they just
can't do so I'm not as convinced as you
seem to be about the in efficacy of
trying to reach people to encourage them
to think about things I think it works
may not work as fast as we'd like but it
has an effect and beyond that there is
no other there's nothing else to do
you know there's not any magic trick
around that's going to achieve anything
if there's another way to bring about
meaningful social change or cultural
change I've never heard of it so that's
what we're stuck with and it does work
it's sort of working anybody okay it's
sort of it sort of begs a question that
that student who was a senior at
Brandeis last year asked when we hosted
Howard Zinn there he got up and I think
very very genuinely said I'm about to
graduate I'm about to go out into into
the world and he said I think I do have
a real social conscience I really do
want to change things I really don't
like a lot of what I see and I think I
could have an impact he said at the same
time I want I want a family I want a
wife I want kids I want a steady job I
want to be able to support myself and he
said so so then what what is left to me
to do what is in my control what what
are the things that I can hold on to and
I think as a parent as that may seem to
some of us I think to a lot of us that's
that's not quite apparent as to how do
you balance I think a lifestyle that
America has given us that is that is
better than you'll find in in many
places in the world and yet you know how
do you keep that while trying to alter
you know the things you don't like about
this
landscapes a string it's a kind of
poignant picture that you're describing
because the answer one answer to that
question is look at the person you're
asking the question to I mean that's one
way you could do it so Howard Zinn had a
family supports the families he's
changed you know he's probably had more
effect on you know the current
generations understanding of the world
than anybody can think of just for
people's history alone let alone from
actions he's been carrying out since his
early support for the activists and the
civil rights movement back in the 1960s
thrown out of Spelman College for
supporting black students that's these
are the kinds of things you can do and
it we are in we happen to be people like
us or most of us I guess uniquely
privileged I mean we have you know a
tremendous amount of freedom thanks to
the struggles of people in the past we
have a by comparative standards
historical standards an enormous amount
of privilege that confers opportunities
and they I think part I get questions
like that every day tonight when I go
home and look at my email there's going
to be 20 letters like that and but I
think that the problem that young people
face is there's just too many choices I
mean it's not you can't think of
anything that you can do you can think
of so many things you can do you can't
choose you know should I become involved
in political activism should I join
yourself verity group should I try to
organize anti-sweatshop movement I mean
I can think of thousands of things that
you can do and my own children have
picked some of them and done them other
people I know have done a lot of them
they're there the opportunities are
there for older people to do we want to
make use of them that's the question I
think the you know the the the options
part is is definitely true but I think
maybe less spoken about openly and dealt
with in the public I think is a large
component of fear and I think that
when you when you speak about the 60s
and the movements that followed you know
to us our age we see the sacrifices made
and that we're required of the people
who put themselves forward the most
during that period to lay that sort of
foundation and so I think it is
counterbalanced by the sense of what
what can be lost in this and the
question is you know you're reframing
this I think in a way that is very
helpful in this idea that there's enough
to hope for where perhaps that the loss
needs to be the sense of the fear of
loss needs to be tempered but I think
both seem to play an equal part to a lot
of people you know as much as another
way of looking at that suppose you
decide ok I don't want to take the
chance I don't become involved in any of
these things I'm gonna invest in the
stock market to have a nice home
somewhere or go to the movies and so on
there's a big loss involved in that too
you look back on your life and you think
what a waste it was somebody like say
Howard Zinn doesn't look back in his
life that way so there's all kinds of
losses I think what he was asking for
though may have been a balance between
the two and and that's something that's
we rarely speak in shades of gray we
speak in in terms of the sense of we
would all like to be Howard Zinn I think
I think we would all like to sort of
take something like that on and have
that sense of self courage that seems
almost indefatigable you just don't wear
down you consistently go and go and
manage to make something great for your
life out of it but I think and have a
huge effect absolutely and I think and
yet there's this there's a sense of your
odds on that and people don't like don't
like gambling in that way I guess again
you're gambling either way so if you
decide not to under not to make use of
the opportunities that you have not to
try to live your life in a way which is
constructive and helpful you end up
looking back and say why did I bother
living that's a loss - yes
in fact life expectancy in the United
States is approximately like Cuba I
think infant mortality in the United
States is like Malaysia that's why if I
remember - I qualified and I said most
of us or have a unique historically
comparatively unique level of privilege
not all of us certainly not many miles
from where we're talking maybe you right
next door I don't know that town so yeah
you're right I mean there's the the the
fact that the United States ranks at
about the lowest level of the industrial
countries in things like infant quality
of social indicators you know things
like infant mortality views things like
that that's a scandal I mean this is the
richest most privileged country in
history it's scandalous that there
should be something like an infant
mortality level compares to Malaysia or
that black males should have a lower
life expectancy than many third world
countries it's a real scandal and it's a
scandal that goes deep into our history
case of black males it goes right back
to slavery we does a claim that I'm in
the fourteenth amendment especially
given equal rights to everyone you know
it's a century it was a century before
it was even formally implemented and
it's still very far from actually
implemented as the statistics you
mentioned indicate or the incarceration
rate indicates yeah these are absolutely
these scandals and the scandals we do
something about I mean
very concretely people want to know what
to do okay take the the problem that in
the United States has been ranking right
at the top of in polls is the most
serious problem that people face for
years namely the disastrous health care
system it is a catastrophe
you know compare considering the options
that are available we have sure most you
know we have about twice the per capita
costs of comparable industrial societies
and about the worst outcomes among
industrial societies literally at about
the level of Cuba you know a poor third
world society that's under constant
attack by us is there anything to be
done about it of course and in fact most
people know perfectly well what can be
done about it
for decades the large majority of the
population has been in favor of a
national health care system which would
have a fraction of the costs and much
better outcomes it has been up until
recently this election is interesting in
this respect this is the first election
really in which there is some attempt on
the part of a number of candidates to
respond to the long-standing public will
on this not completely but at least it
partially you go back one election 2004
and it was just off the agenda effect I
you may recall the the last presidential
debate and the 2004 election was on
domestic issues and the New York Times
had a report on it the next day accurate
report in which it pointed out that
Kerry had not brought up the issue of
any government role in health care and
the reason was that it has so little
political support it's just supported by
a large majority of the population as it
had been for decades but that's not
political support what the reporter
meant is it was opposed by the financial
institutions and the pharmaceutical
corporations
so it didn't have any political support
well this election
things have changed enough so that the
Democratic candidates are talking about
it some of them have proposals that are
not too far from what the public is
wanted for years what changed well I
think two things changed one better
understanding and more commitment
something else changed which is does not
reflect well on the nature of our
society there is now a component of
concentrated capital that is in favor of
it
namely manufacturing industry
manufacturing industry is getting
slaughtered by the inefficient health
system so General Motors says that it
costs them over a thousand dollars more
to produce a car and Detroit then and
say Windsor Canada across the border so
they want to have a rational healthcare
system all right at that point you start
getting something that's called
political support you know a major
sector of concentrated economic power is
interested in it not very nice but it's
a step forward and it means that the
population can be organized to press for
it so you won't have statistics of the
kind that you're talking about that's
not utopian you know these are pretty
simple proposals actually in a recent
book of mine I went through polls of
people's attitudes it turns out that the
public opinion and public policy are
miles apart on many crucial issues and
in fact when you run through a list when
I run through a list of things that
people favor I'd find myself pretty much
in the center of public opinion on many
things well can you do something about
it can you make these things politically
possible even if no sector of the
corporate elite happens to be for them
sure you can it's been done in the past
and be done again so we're back to
optimism yeah it can be kind of
opportunities you can do it if you try
if you don't try it won't happen
Oh in my my general sense of
discombobulation and loss of time I run
very sure but I we are a bookstore and I
will I will run over for the one
question that I think I I at least
desperately would like to know which is
what what in the last year of reading
what was the most important or
entertaining or just valuable you know
whether it's dr. Seuss by the nightstand
or whatever whatever else sort of book
what was your favorite book of last year
a lot of books favorite pink look at my
bookshelf but well there's one a couple
of very good books that came out that on
topics I happen to be interested in one
of them is a book on the international
economic system by Hutchins Cheung it's
called bad Samaritans he's very good I
can economist an economic historian who
goes through and in a lucid even
entertaining way things that are kind of
known he has a lot of material about how
economic development has really taken
place and it turns out as any economic
historian ought to know that it's
exactly the opposite of the
prescriptions that are true that the
economic elite try and the institutions
try to impose on the rest of the world
exactly the opposite goes through a case
by case a very convincingly all the rich
countries developed by violating the
rules we're trying to impose on others
and so on and that's worth knowing it's
a it's readable available to the public
and so on another one that I read about
the same time was Peter Howard's book
which just came out recently on the
overthrow of the our state government
and Haiti in 2004 in which the US and
France who have been the two major
torturers of Haiti for two hundred years
played an essential role in overthrowing
the democratic government bringing about
a reign of terror and so
that's worth knowing another book was a
really Magisterial study by if anybody's
interested in Israel's by Ze'ev Maoz
Israeli strategic analyst political
scientist 800 pages or so on it's called
the defending the Holy Land or some name
like that in which he runs through the
actual policies from the inside that
Israel has undertaken and discusses how
self-destructive they've been the
case-by-case little on what they've done
to other people and we've supported them
all the way through just finished a
really very good book by Mike Davis as a
great writer called the in praise of
barbarians or some name like that in
which he's I'm the theme is the
barbarians that were through the Roman
Empire we've got a praise the people who
are trying to overthrow this Empire and
it's a very insightful and decisive
study of many different aspects of
American society and you know could
easily go on lots of my grandchildren
were a little enough they wanted it to
be read to them but now that they're
mine 10 years old
that's over they want to read it
themselves the first night it comes out
thank you very very much
