we've taken an economics course you know
that wasn't when you make a transaction
by a car or something the participants
in a transaction according to economic
theory look out for their own interests
and then they're kind of like side
effects what happens to other people
that's a footnote that's called an
externality you know the externalities
can be pretty large like say the current
financial crisis is an externality there
are other externalities which are even
worse for example if you take a look
today's polls last couple of days their
new polls on attitudes of Americans
towards global warming and it keeps
going down and by now about a third of
the population think that they believe
in anthropogenic global warming humans
have something to do with global warming
it's being relentlessly driven down by a
massive propaganda viraj telling people
it's all liberal hoax so forget about it
now you know the guys who are running
these campaigns know perfectly well that
the liberal hooks is very real and it
could destroy the lives of their
grandchildren effect could destroy
everything they own and in their
personal lives you know decent human
beings they understand that but in their
institutional lives as say executives of
the corporation they have to play an
institutional role the institutional
role is maximize profit and market share
in fact that's a legal requirement and
ignore the externalities well in this
case the externality happens to be the
survival of the species but the logic is
the same the same as systemic risk the
same as Adam Smith's Grievous effects on
the population of England these are
inherent properties of market systems
Botha bank lends money it cares about
one thing its own profit now there's a
property called systemic risk the risk
that if you if the market say crashes
somewhere it's going to be contagious
okay
like and there is that phenomenon that's
monstrous in fact but the investor
doesn't think about that can't you know
you think about your own risk it's you
cannot think about the cost to others of
the fact that contagion may destroy a
system that's not part of your
calculations that's another externality
so the system is sort of built to
magnify extremely dangerous properties
and this happens all over the place I
mean what are called the externalities
that just you know dominate life take a
look at the markets they are a recipe
for suicide period in market systems you
do not account it'll don't take account
of what economists call externalities so
say you sell me a car in a market system
we're supposed to look after our own
interests so I make the best deal I can
for me you make the best you can for you
we do not take into account the effect
on him that's not part of a market
transaction well there is an effect on
him this is another car in the road
that's greater possibility of accident
there's more pollution there's more
traffic cams for him individually it
might be a slight increase but this is
extended over the whole population now
when you get to other types of
transactions the externalities get much
bigger so take say the financial crisis
that one of the reasons for it is that
there are several the one is that
the in market trends that safe Goldman
Sachs makes it risky transaction of the
if they're paying attention cover their
own potential losses they do not take
into account what's called systemic risk
that is the possibility that the whole
system will crash if one of their risky
transactions goes bet that just about
happened with AIG the huge insurance
company they were involved in risky
transactions which they couldn't cover
the whole system is really going to
collapse but of course state power
intervened to rescue them state the task
of the stage is to rescue the rich and
powerful and to protect them and if that
violates market principles okay we don't
care about the market principles market
principles are essential for the poor
but systemic risk is an externality
that's not consider which would bring
down the financial system repeatedly if
you didn't have state power intervening
well there's another one that's even
bigger that's destruction of the
environment destruction of the
environment is an externality in market
interactions you don't pay attention to
it so if you're saitek parsons if you're
a major energy corporation and you can
make profit out of exploiting tar sands
you simply do not take into account the
fact that your grandchildren
have a have a possibility to survive
that's an externality and in the moral
calculus of capitalism greater profits
in the next quarter outweigh the fate of
your grandchildren of course it's not
just your
