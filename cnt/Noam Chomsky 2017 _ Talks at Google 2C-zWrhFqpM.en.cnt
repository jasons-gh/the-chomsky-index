we are thrilled to welcome no I'm Tom
ski here today mr. Chomsky has taught at
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology for the past 50 years where
he is Institute professor emeritus in
the Department of linguistics and
philosophy his work is widely credited
with having revolutionized the field of
modern linguistics he's the author of
numerous best-selling political works
which have been translated into scores
of languages worldwide and we are
thrilled to welcome him today to Google
Cambridge thank you thank you so much
for taking the time to be here I'm just
going to jump right into this since we
have limited time my name is Hassan
right I'm a software engineer here and I
have nothing to do with linguistics so
good for politics good for anything
relevance perfect we're a perfect team
but I have so many questions for you I
wanted to ask you about your academic
focus having been linguistics you
obviously know a whole lot about a whole
lot of other things and I wonder what
makes something interesting to you
several factors first of all it has to
be an intellectual challenge secondly it
has to be of some significance and there
are many different dimensions of
significance so for example the things
that have an impact on human life and
then in fact survival or for
significance even if they don't pose
much of an intellectual challenge on the
other hand things that pose a very
serious intellectual challenge like how
is it possible that human beings can do
what you and I are now doing which is
beyond the capacity of any other
organism that poses is a very
significant intellectual challenge it's
human significance when you really look
into the details you could debate so
there's different dimensions different
factors
but essentially the same as what the
four-year-old finds interesting one
understand something about the world you
want to do something important I think
that many of us lose the four-year-old
curiosity over the years what has what
has kept you curious in that way you've
obviously branched out so much
throughout your life from your focus on
linguistics you've wrenched out quite a
lot from there is it is it simply this
is something interesting too for you
know an understanding humanity or is it
is there something else it's not that it
matters much but in fact it's the other
way around
I was very much engaged in political
life social issues long before I ever
heard of linguistics so tell us about
that you you took part in a lot of
political activism sort of earlier on
and over the course of your life how did
you get started with that what was the
drive or that and and what drew you to
it I grew up in the 1930s which was
[Music]
quite an interesting period some ways a
little bit like today in other ways
quite different objectively it was much
harsher than today so conditions during
the Depression here in the United States
were much worse than they are today
subjectively it was a much more
optimistic period today it's striking to
see the anger hopelessness I get a dozen
letters every night from mostly young
people saying the world's awful what can
I do
it's hopeless then it was pretty
different not not over the whole country
if you were an agricultural worker
fleeing that the Dust Bowl was pretty
awful but in the circles that were my
own milieu which was mostly first in
first generation immigrants
working-class at the time mostly
unemployed
the very lively activist militant
working class culture of the time
it was pretty hopeful there was a sense
somehow we can get out of all this
through solidarity through working
together it was an educated community
people never gone a couple of years of
elementary school but discussing the
latest varieties of Freudian
psychoanalysis the last concert of the
Budapest string quartet and so on that
was worker education took place a lot of
it from the unions it was just a there
was a sense of hopefulness expectation
solidarity we can do things there was a
moderately sympathetic administration
very unlike today and as possible to
have some achievements which didn't end
the Depression but soften the edges and
made it look as if we can create a
better future
so objectively much worse but
subjectively much better and then of
course in the background was what was
happening in your the spread of fascism
which was very frightening and old
enough to remember listening on the
radio to the Nuremberg rallies and
Hitler speeches and in our stead the
words but there was no mistaking what it
meant and of course into the first it's
kind of ironic I guess but my wife and I
happened to be in Barcelona at the time
of the November November 8th collection
and the attitude in Europe was the roof
is falling in you know it was this is
the end of the world and it happens it
meant the first article that I wrote
remember at least was about the fall of
Barcelona so I can easily date at
February 1939
I hope the article is disappeared I'm
sure it's not very memorable I was for
the editor the fourth grade newspaper
I'm probably the only reader except
maybe my mother but the article I
remember it was about essentially about
the rise of fascism Austria and
Czechoslovakia
callate of Barcelona looked inexorable
this monstrous shadow is spreading all
over the world with this isn't long
before the Holocaust you know it's so
that's the background on the other hand
that was what was happening or within
reach by the time I was about 12 years
old my mid lives in Philadelphia about
100 miles from New York when I was 11 or
12 my parents would let me go to New
York by myself on the train stay with
relatives and hang around anarchist
bookstores and Union Square so wonder
how many parents in the audience I
thinking about setting their
twelve-year-old on a train from Philly
than you it was a much more peaceful gun
it's pretty dramatic I mean in those
days you can in New York you could walk
along and say the river Riverside Drive
or Central Park at night without any
concern you know it is just a lot of
things changed after the Second World
War I know exactly why but the cities
became a much more dangerous hostile
places there was plenty of conflict in
other words you didn't if you were Irish
and going to the Italian neighborhoods
that sort of thing but you are going to
get killed I mean you might get you know
chased or fly I spent a lot of my
childhood there running away from Irish
Catholic kids
- scary but you weren't going to get
shot in or night or anything like that
that all changed for some reason after
the Second World War
she was all over the world incidentally
here's George England so you talk about
this general sentiment zones of people
being the public being very hopeful and
around sort to the public at least parts
of Institute of the people jumps low and
blueford and you talk about an
administration at that time that was
maybe more sympathetic than the one that
we have now leaving aside the
administration part of that for the
moment do you feel that that hope has
evaporated do you feel that we have been
able to rehan us that in times of need
you talk about it as though it's you
know this is very much in the past tense
is that attention compensated still
there in fact take a look at the last
election November election
there were two striking aspects of it
one of them not very startling namely in
the Republican primary
a person who was hated by the
establishment but who happens to be a
billionaire won the nomination
okay it's kind of a surprise but not
startling that a billionaire con man
should win the nomination what happened
to the Democratic side is much more
dramatic the somebody arose who was
unknown
nobody ever heard him he had no support
from any of the sources of wealth and
power no corporate support no funding
from the wealthy he even used a scare
word socialist which means mildly Social
Democratic in fact his policies wouldn't
surprise Eisenhower very much that's a
sign of the sharp shift to the right in
the whole spectrum
but from the point of view of the
existing specter easing way on the
outside he would have won the Democratic
Party nomination if it hadn't been for
the machination 's of the obama-clinton
of party managers that's a break from
over a hundred years of American
political history I mean American
elections are pretty much bought you can
literally pretty well predict
electability just on the basis of simple
variables like campaign spending it's
remarkable
not just president as a recent
interesting study by Tom Ferguson
stunned the main work on this over the
UMass political science department he
ins and colleagues came out last year
with a study of congressional elections
from about 1980 up till the present and
simply asking what's the relation
between campaign funding and
electability
which of course means policy it's
practically a straight line just don't
get results in like that in the social
sciences it's startling the same true of
the presidential elections and it's been
known for a long time go back to the
1890s there was a very famous campaign
manager Mark Hannah who was a star of
campaign management he was asked once
what does it take to win an election and
he said it takes two things the first
one is money and I forgotten what the
second one is
that was 1895 way before citizens united
or any of this stuff
here comes Sanders and he just broke the
pattern of over hundred years
astonishing
what's more thanks to Fox News that we
know that he's the most popular
political figure in the country polled
that they were in by a huge margin and
among young people enormous well what
does that mean that means there's real
signs of hope it's out of the you know
these two non establishment figures the
one the public of course not the
establishment assures itself that it
controls the political system and the
decision so Trump could rail against
Wall Street and Goldman Sachs on the
campaign trail but take a look at his
cabinet okay so they make sure they
basically run the show but they're
losing the population and the same is
happening in Europe of the French
election was a good example two
candidates from outside the two
political parties although the the
thrust of policy will remain not all
that different but that's a sign of
potential changes if we can ever go back
to having functioning go back to
partially create functioning democratic
societies it could be quite different so
stepping back a moment then to the
political activism in your life what do
you remember out of your you know career
let's say in political activism as being
some of the these are the moments that
were defining for me what was defining
for me was things like those of you know
New York City in those days Union Square
used to be a kind of a center of
radical the offices fry are by thirsty
men for example the Atisha anarchist
movement had its offices there on others
and if he went down fourth Avenue which
is now old gentrified there were small
bookstores with a lot of them run by
European EMA grades a number of the ones
that had kind of gravitated towards were
refugees from Spain people have fled
from after the crushing of the anarchist
revolution in 1937 and I picked up
welcome pamphlets understanding I
learned a lot of things which are just
barely getting into the news now for
example you can read books now which
point out if I got somewhat misleadingly
that of the 1930s theoretically the
United States the Roosevelt
administration was following a policy of
neutrality you don't support either side
the fascists serve a republic in fact
they were supporting the fascists and I
learned it in 1939 from reading
pamphlets and left-wing
literature and others which exposed the
fact that the Texaco oil company which
was run by an outright Nazi didn't even
hide had contracts with the Republic to
supply oil in the middle of the conflict
he shifted he started supplying oil to
the fascist forces to Franco there were
questions as the State Department denied
it turned out to be true it was reported
in the left-wing press and oil was the
one thing that the Germans and the
Italians the fast countries couldn't
supply the the Franco's forces they have
it so they needed and Roosevelt and the
State Department
that didn't see it only the small
left-wing press saw it it was later kind
of conceded it's now kind of pretty much
know in scholarship at least sort of
acknowledged few years later but I do
that in 1939 just from hanging around
the left-wing offices that and you could
see what was going on I mean you know
the the administration Rosa was very
bitter and angry when they found a
Mexican an American businessman who had
sold a couple of pistols to the Republic
you know violating Neutrality Act paid
condemnation indeed while the tech major
and oil company was breaking its
contracts of the Republic and shifting
them to the fascists that's an
educational experience I also learned
things about the the civil war in Spain
um it wasn't just the Republicans versus
the fascists there was a popular
revolution in 1936 libertarian
revolution which was pretty successful
and was crushed was crushed by the joint
efforts of the fascists the Communists
and the liberal democracies they had a
lot of differences but there was one
thing they agreed on you can't have a
free society you can't have a
libertarian society so they cooperated
on that actually the attack was led by
the Communists where the party of the
police force and paid which was a very
opposed to any form of a socialist or
less than activism okay I mean those are
things you learn if you pay attention
and it was reinforced by other parts of
my family environment at the time in New
York he could I mean it was a very
lively political scene every variety of
left-wing politics you can imagine
it debated hotly the in fact this friend
of mine was a philosopher Columbia told
me recently that he and his wife got a
place up in the Catskills to hang out in
the summer turns out this retirement
communities there we said the people in
the retirement community are still
debating which brand of Trotskyism was
right the same arguments they were
having in the nineteen third it's worth
remember that working-class education
was a very serious phenomenon then that
goes way back let me go back to the late
nineteenth century here the best early
industrial revolution if Irish
blacksmith said could get enough money
and hire a boy to read them and while
he's working and reading bent what we
now call classics modern the
contemporary literature there were young
women from the farms called factory
girls and we're kind of compelled to get
into the textile factories in eastern
New England and battled their own
publications you read them they bitterly
condemned the fact that the industrial
system was depriving them of their
culture of their dignity their
independence you're selling yourself not
what you produce it's quite different
that part of it was an attack on the
culture of same in England which is a
massive study an interesting study by
kind of Jonathan rose of the reading
habits of the English working class and
turns out his own conclusion as they
were better educated than the
aristocrats and then those may not have
gone school certainly
good answer but there were the working
class the rising working class had its
own institutions of Education and
Culture which was significant a lot of
that has been destroyed
that's in all kinds of ways Google
doesn't help there is another story
happy to do our part so I asked you
about political activism and you talked
about learning a lot what part of that
is it what part of activism did you take
part in and what was that was defining
from it it was 12 years old a lot of
activism but actually the kind of
activism I was involved in mostly in
those years was with this was within
what was it's now called anti Zionist at
that time it was I honest there was a I
was my parents and my immediate media
were deeply embedded in the whole
revival of Hebrew revival of Jewish
culture connections to Palestine and so
and I kind of grew up with that and my
own actual most of the activism was
internal to that system it was what is
now called anti Zionist it was per
strongly opposed to a Jewish state in
support of Arab Jewish and working-class
cooperation in Palestine all kinds of
ideas about how to create a society
based on the cooperatives and so on that
kind of died in 1948 but then at the
time it was alive
something you could be part of and it
extended other things like there wasn't
much in the way of activism but when the
British conquered Greece in 1944 and
carry a brutal repression of the
anti-fascist forces in Greece there were
a couple of us who tried to protest
whatever it meant and when you're 15
years old and you got very physically
involved
there wasn't much he could do it was
right in the middle of the war and there
was a lot of dedicate reott ISM you know
dedication to the war effort bringing up
these things was but at by the time the
war started the political ferment
declined because of commitment to the
war effort and it was just it
overwhelmed everything else it was still
around like I was in high school in the
early forties and it happened at the
high school I was in was right next to a
prisoner of war camp were mostly German
prisoners and those days security meant
a wire fence so the big deal we a lot of
the students were kind of ridiculing and
mocking and screaming at the German POWs
and a couple of us were strongly opposed
to them tried to you know try to get
them to understand if they get work you
know there could be sort of like I said
it's not violent the way it is today
it's a kind of thing that young boys do
you know it was boys of course the
segregated but we tried a couple of us
maybe two or three of us to try to
change the mood of the students to
understand that these guys on the other
side of the fence are not criminal
so that's fascinating what do you mean
by we tried to change the mood with that
discourse to talk to people the
intrusion and these are high school
students having intellectual discourse
about where can you put in our source
camp right next door to the high school
it's probably easier for high school
students than the faculty
I imagine that you'll forgive me for
being a product of my own time where I
just can't even imagine high school next
to a prison working then separated by a
wonderful bright you you became a little
bit more perhaps politically active
later on in your life then at leeward
obliquely articulate but the political
activism never change actually declined
in the fifties sixties were pretty
classic period in the political activist
pretty individual there was not a lot
going on it was a there were things in
the background but it was a pretty quiet
conformist period but then you know the
six early sixties everything changed
everything changed and you became then
very active publicly but it wasn't that
much of a change for me personally I'm
just a different sphere you know I see
so light drove you to become more
publicly John F Kennedy so it's still
kind of like off the agenda in 1961 and
62 the Kennedy very sharply escalated
the Vietnam War it was already pretty
awful the maybe 60 or 70,000 South
Vietnamese had already been killed by
the regime that the US had imposed in
the 1950s but it was kind of under the
radar like you weren't seeing you could
find out about it but you weren't seeing
much by 61 and 62 the repression of the
South Vietnamese regime we'd installed
in violation of the Geneva Accords had
become so harsh that a popular rebellion
sprang up
the North's actually opposed that they
didn't want to they wanted to build the
country not get involved in a conflict
with the US but the National Liberation
Front would propaganda calls the
Vietcong were beginning to cause
beginning to develop and become active
in the late 50s and the regime couldn't
contain them so there was a crisis of
the kennedy kennedy decided to escalate
the war the US air force began to bomb
South Vietnamese targets under South
Vietnamese markings like the planes had
South Vietnamese markings but nobody's
fooled I learned about it myself and a
small item maybe ten lines in a back
page in the New York Times would just
happen to mention casually that the US
Air Force is bombing South Vietnamese
targets and they thought they authorized
napalm he started the chemical warfare
series chemical warfare to try to
destroy crops and livestock starve out
population they began to programs to
drive people into what amounted to
concentration camps that were called
strategic Hamlet's where peasants were
driven off the land proven into these
places and urban slums and the official
rhetoric was to protect them from the
guerrillas which in fact the government
knew very well they were supporting it
wasn't widely reported but if you looked
carefully and you know from my own
experience back in the late thirties
early forties I knew that you
really had to look carefully you know
take a look at the headlines they have
to put together what's lying behind them
like the Texaco story and it was pretty
clear that there was a sharp escalation
the war going on so I did try to become
active what being active at that time
meant giving a talk to a couple of
people in somebody's living room or
maybe in a church where there were four
people you know the the minister who was
mildly sympathetic some drunk walk them
from the street another guy who wanted
to kid you and that may be one person it
was sort of like a great way to start a
movie and that's what it was like it
later changed but it took years and it
wasn't until right here in Boston those
of you're old enough may remember but in
Boston which pretty liberal City the
first public demonstration against the
war was in October 1965 internationally
that was an international day of protest
was cold so we decided we'll take part
in it and there was a march from Harvard
Square to the Boston Common and supposed
to be a demonstration there I was
supposed to be one of the speakers it
was violently broken up by counter
demonstrators a lot of them students
there were a lot of State Police which
is the only reason we didn't get killed
nobody could hear on the speakers it was
impossible and take a look at the Boston
Globe the next day it praised the
counter demonstrators denounced the
demonstrators for daring to question our
great country and what it's doing and so
on March 1966 was the next international
day of protest that we realize it
couldn't have a public demonstration so
we
at a meeting at the our industry church
church was attacked again Tomatoes you
know cans some of the at that time there
were already a couple hundred thousand
American troops rampaging itself Vietnam
took a long time and the country was
practically destroyed I mean by at that
time at Barnard fall who was actually a
hawk but was a highly respected
unserious military historian and Vietnam
specialist by the US government he was
the one non government specialist it was
respected rightly he was a Hopf that he
cared about the Vietnamese people and he
was writing at the time 66 67 that he
wasn't sure that Vietnam could survive
as a cultural and historic entity under
the most savage attack that any region
that size had ever suffered at that
point he's just barely beginning to get
some visible purpose it's changed a lot
of the country's become much more
civilized since then about how the
opposition to aggression and violence is
far more widespread governments just
can't do what let's say the invasion of
Iraq is the first time in the entire
history of imperialism that there was
massive protests on the before the
invasion actually took place and the it
was pretty horrible what happened to go
into it but as the Bush administration
could never contemplate what the Kennedy
administration just did without any
second phone public exchange too much so
um over your extensive career and being
an activist in many different veins
obviously you've learned a lot along the
way and it's useful to share information
with the world as you do you want
example
which is kind of interesting maybe
thirty years from now it'll enter
awareness that take the Texaco oil
company and the Spanish Civil War that
that was repeated under the Clinton
administration virtually the same thing
under the Clinton that there was a in
Haiti for the first time in its history
there was a free election in 1990 and it
was won by a priest that desires our
state who nobody paid any attention to
he was supported by the people who were
considered not worth looking at urban
slums rural areas a lot of grassroots
activism and everyone surprising won the
election they expected the u.s.
candidate would win Marquez on a world
bank guy but the iris teen won the
election and he instituted the the the
main question is when will the military
coup take place took out seven two
months later quite interesting what
happened but a military coup took place
vicious brutal terror began the u.s.
actually tacitly supported in many ways
1994 the Clinton administration decided
ok enough terror had taken place so that
the population subdued we can now allow
the President to return the eve of
the there was a Marineland date in 1990
for everyone paying attention to it was
quite public at the time I happened to
be there was a guy at MIT who was
working on a project of experimenting to
allow people to have access to the 8 P
wires which is pretty interesting
because what you get when you look at
the AP wires is just raw news you know
stuff pouring out constantly the AP
wires feature a story every day keeps
repeating you know to editors here's the
big story the day before the marine
invasion of Haiti the big story was the
Treasury Department concedes that the
Texaco oil company has been providing
oil to the military hunter while the CIA
and the Clinton administration were
denying that many oil was going to them
well I was going to write an article
about it but the article that I would
write would come out two months later
so if excited worth mentioning this will
be public news still not been reported
you know those are the things that
happen in the world if you pay attention
so you've obviously been very successful
and sort of reporting on these types of
things and raising awareness and that
has been one avenue for your activism I
wonder is this intrinsic to who you are
or how you approach knowledge why aren't
there more Noam Chomsky's in the world I
think they're claiming them for example
look why is Bernie Sanders the most
popular figure in the United States
political figure in the United States a
huge margin where's that where are those
people who pick canvas the most popular
person I mean they may not be well-known
with it there I should think that as a
percentage of the rest of sort of the
people out there who are active in the
same way very few of them are as
educated as you have made yourself
I go to how many people may not know
things about the whole world that they
know things about their lives and the
situation that they're in and take a
look at polls why for maybe it takes a
an issue is right in the main on the
headlines health care and what do people
think about health care well it turns
out that over a long period most of the
population has supported a national
health care system of the kind that
other countries have
it doesn't which is pretty remarkable
because nobody publicly advocates it
when Obama put through the Affordable
Care Act at the time initially there was
a what was called a public option which
means you could choose to have
essentially Medicare you know national
health care about almost two-thirds of
the population favored even though there
was no public articulate support for it
it was dropped of course without comment
you go back a little farther and say
late Reagan years turned out that about
70% of the population I thought that
guaranteed health care should be in the
Constitution because it's an obvious
right and about 40 percent thought it or
he was in the Constitution the
Constitution is just some holy writ
which has everything good in it so it
must have had guaranteed health care
because it's so obvious that's public of
course it's not the elites it's not the
media it's not a leat discourse in fact
whenever the possibility is mentioned
it's called politically impossible or
lacking political support which is
accurate if by political support you
mean the pharmaceutical
actions and the insurance companies and
so on the other non supporter and the
way our democracy works that's political
support but the public is there and is
it educated I mean you know where do
people get these ideas from I take say
the Vietnam War that's a very very
interesting revealing situation at the
end of the Vietnam War when the Vietnam
War ended in 1975 every famous person
had to make a statement about it you
know it's a kind of material about
looking back at the Vietnam War and what
did it mean and so on and there was a
spectrum I've written about it went
through it there's a spectrum at one end
it said it was a noble cause if we'd
fought harder we could have won you know
we have to honor the effort actually
Obama had reasons this that's the whole
kitchen then you go over to the kind of
what's called the left
you know the critical end people like
say Anthony Lewis was one of the most
harshest critics of the war way out on
the Left he wrote an article in which he
said the war become quoting at the war
began with blundering efforts to do good
notice that that's an axiom and you
don't have to give evidence for that if
we did it it was efforts to do good by
definition on the left what's called the
left blundering because it didn't work
so it began with blundering efforts to
do good but by 1969 it had become clear
that it was a disaster we couldn't bring
democracy to Vietnam at a cost
acceptable to ourselves that's the
critical in ok you don't have to give an
argument to say we're trying to bring
democracy that's also an axiom it's kind
of a principle you don't question it's
like two plus two equals four well at
the very same time there were polls
taken among the public
what did they find they found that
around 70 percent of the public said the
war was not a mistake it was
fundamentally and morally wrong and that
went on as long as the polls were taken
till the early 80s now the guy the
people who were running the polls good
liberal academic political scientist he
did comment on these results and he said
well what it means is that people were
opposed to American soldiers dying okay
maybe that's what it meant maybe it
meant they thought it was fundamentally
wrong and tomorrow as they said but that
concept is it just kind of inconceivable
you know so it's but that's the public
were they educated well I'd say they
were more educated than the elites who
were writing the educated elites were
writing the articles so switching gears
for a moment it's easy to find a lot of
material on you speaking either online
or or you know articles that you've
written about egregious wrongs in the
world and you know the the historical
background for these types of things you
have a lot of context for that I wonder
how do you stay sane knowing how much
room for improvement there is where's
the levity in your life and can you tell
us a joke I've always liked the joke
marcona fringe I've looked for for quite
some time for video of you telling a
joke it just doesn't seem to exist
that's people who make the videos it's
their probe I I was also curious about
you you're obviously very effective at
sort of assimilating new information and
and sort of digesting that in a in a
comprehensive way I wonder about the
tools technology and routines that help
make your per day per
how do you work pretty straightforward
how did 19th century working-class
people gain an education that was
superior to that of the aristocrats in
England did they use the internet they
read you would look at what's going on
around you you talk to other people you
have interactions you read you learn
about things it's not quantum physics
what's understood at all is pretty much
on the surface in these domains
just a matter of working it's a little
easier now it used to be the case that
if you know you want to look into a say
you know to some the background and you
wanted to see what was the press saying
about some topic in the 1970s okay I
have to go to the library look up the
microfilm it's a bit of a nuisance and
now you can get it on the internet
thanks to what we call the free market
which means the taxpayer putting huge
amounts of subsidies into developing the
high-tech system of the next generation
which is handed over to private
corporations for marketing and profit so
that's the internet and computers and so
on and so forth so now it's a lot easier
than going to the library and looking up
the micro films but that different I
mean the change from those libraries to
libraries was a much bigger change than
from libraries to the Internet in fact
it is similarly the you know the change
from sailing ships to Telegraph was a
much bigger change than speeding up the
communication by a couple of
milliseconds with some new technique you
know so it's a little easier now but not
fun
so this next question came in from
Rakesh saw I apologize about
pronunciation there from India in an
interview in 2012 you mentioned that
artificial intelligence is going in the
wrong direction by putting more emphasis
on statistical techniques to mine data
where do you think it's heading now and
what steps should we take to make it
sort of more meaningful to society well
I don't know exactly what that quote is
from but I mean artificial intelligence
what's called artificial intelligence
which is just part of cognitive science
it can like any part of science can go
in two different directions it can
beacon direct itself towards some
engineering application which may or may
not be useful or it can go into trying
to understand something about the world
those are the choices
so take say the work that happens
interests me most on language one thrust
is trying to understand how it is that
we can for example do what we're now
doing okay what lies behind that what's
what are the mental operations or what
are the principles how is it acquired
and so on okay that's one domain another
domain is how can we get something
that's useful to give a kind of a rough
translation of an article and French
into English the google translator
that's okay I mean I use it fine
that's a but it's a brute-force
engineering achievement it doesn't tell
you anything about how the world was
working it just says here's something
useful like a bulldozer out of a
invincible dozers I think they're great
you know a lot easier than digging with
a shovel but
but it's not intellectually it's not an
intellectually interesting achievement
it's useful okay have you driven a
bulldozer I mean I haven't but I dream
house I'd like I'd be scared but I had a
shovel okay well we have a base context
then and a shared experience with that
I'm good so yeah I think that this is an
interesting thing that I mean you've
talked about the passes they interview
by the way was in 2012 with the Atlantic
I'd love to unpack that a little bit
where would you like to see how would
you like to see air research tackle
these types of deeper understanding
problems whenever you learn something in
the sciences what immediately happens is
you discover there's a mass of new
things which I never noticed before that
I don't understand
I mean scientific research is kind of
like mountain climbing that you think
that that peak over there is the top but
when you get there you find wait a
minute turns out there's other Peaks
that you didn't notice before
that's where scientific researcher come
take I mean what happens interest me is
a human cognitive capacity which is an
astonishing fact that humans are
absolutely unique in the organic world
in enormous number of respects humans
are not that old within evolutionary
terms about two hundred thousand years
so something happened around two hundred
thousand years ago you know plus or
minus which created an entirely new
organism which has what we call higher
intelligence which it is now using
incidentally to create something that
should be headlines on every newspaper
we're using human intelligence to create
a perfect storm since the Second World
War
human intelligence has created
means of suicide self-destruction
the first is nuclear weapons Second
World War ended with the nuclear age was
obvious right at the time I pay a
personal experiences that we had now
human intelligence had now devised the
means to destroy everything that's the
nuclear age we've barely survived it it
wasn't known then but it's now known
that at the same time into the Second
World War we'd entered a new geological
epoch and what's called the Anthropocene
where human activities are having a
severely destructive impact on the
environment geologists have kind of
debated its inception but they've now
more or less agreed world geological
organizations agreed on and to the
second world war so here we created two
huge sledgehammers which are able to
destroy us in the 1970s human
intelligence took the next step let's
destroy the means to protect ourselves
that's pretty much what happened as the
new as the period of what was called
regimented capitalism shifted to the
neoliberal era the neoliberal era of the
last generation is dedicated in
principle to destroying the only means
to defend ourselves from destruction
it's not called that what it's called is
shifting decision-making from public
institutions which least in principle or
under public influence to private
institutions which are immune from
public control in principle that's
called shifting to the market it's under
the rhetoric of freedom but it just
means servitude
it means servitude to unaccountable
private institutions the rhetoric those
of you remember
Margaret Thatcher there is no society
just individuals an ideal not a
description but she may not have known
it but she was paraphrasing Karl Marx
who at the period of the severe French
repression said the French repression is
turning society into a sack of potatoes
amorphous class of individuals and can't
work together or separated and atomized
that's the ideal of neoliberalism let's
turn society into a sack of potatoes
let's eliminate the institutions that
might in which and engaged in to the
people might get together to try to deal
constructively with their problems let's
transfer it into the hands of
unaccountable private institutions which
are devoted in principle to profit
maximization our maximization of course
that means undermining democracy that's
what's happened that's why we see what's
hold it's a bad term it's called the
populist uprising
there's nothing populist about it it
means anger fear hatred discontent
contempt for institutions a collapse of
institutions a direct consequence of the
neoliberal economic policies which have
also led to stagnation or decline for
the majority the real wages of accident
declined since 1979 when the program
began all of this is together and put it
together what you have is human
intelligence has created two means of
destroying ourselves and it has also
been actively engaged in trying to
eliminate the only protection we have
against them so it's a kind of perfect
storm that's what humans have done how
did this happen I'm going to get this
way how did we develop creative
capacities of a unique
the kind which have led to extraordinary
achievements
okay these are things we're going to try
to understand all of them ahead do
something about not just understand
another question from Oleg peshkov from
Australia asks how do you think Google
can and should handle the fake news
problem we have a big hammer we're
looking for nails well by not
contributing to it so for example the
Internet is actually slowing down in
some respects one of the reasons it's
slowing down is because if you pick up
you will say access say the New York
Times the first thing that gets loaded
is a ton of ads which slow everything
down all of this is going on all the
time it's contributing to the narrowness
of coverage and even to the kind of
coverage because it's influenced by of
course the choice of the funding an
institution of course is it influenced
by its funders mostly advertisers so all
that's happening and so it's not what
people call fake news but it's a
distortion of the world in ways that
shouldn't be happening
so the actual news I think should be
what we've just been talking about like
why are we just why for the last
generation have we constructed socio
economic policies and political policies
which are developing a perfect storm
which could destroy us that's so if we
could devise a way for I mean obviously
advertising monetization as the way the
lot of publications exist and perhaps
without it many of those publications
would be without the funding required to
move to continue it's not true the
period of the freest most lively person
the United States was probably the nine
things
we had a proliferation of all kinds of
newspapers ethnic working-class
mentioned the factory girls there were
others what happened in the late 19th
century is in England and the United
States which also was similar a shift
towards a capital concentration and
advertiser reliance and that has very
sharply narrowed and changed the the the
nature of media so say in England as
late as the 1960s the most popular
widely read newspaper was the Daily
Herald which was kind of Social
Democratic the tabloids in England which
are now monstrous were labor based
newspapers very interesting they
succumbed to the consequences of capital
concentration and advertiser reliance
and became quite different that a
similar here and when I was a kid
growing up there were several newspapers
delivered local newspapers delivered
every day they were not that a certain
variety now there in Boston now there
isn't even one the Boston Globe used to
be a pretty decent newspaper you know
problems but a lot of had bureaus all
over the world that four good reporters
and take a look at it now it basically
doesn't exist
it's has some local news and the rest it
picks up New York Times Washington Post
and AP that's happened all over the
country it's it's has a lot of reasons
behind it but it's a large part of it is
it's been going on for over a century
just continuing large part is the effect
of capital concentration and I'm because
reliance which affects the content of
the media reporting is wrong in that
case we'll cancel our advertising
programs the advertising is a very
interesting phenomenon any of you've
taken an economics course know that the
beauty the marvels of the market that
we're supposed to admire and worship are
because a market is based on informed
consumers making rational choices then
you prove all sorts of theorems about
how wonderful it is turn on your
television set
do you see efforts by corporations to
create
informed consumers making rational
choices is that what you see when you
see an ad for cars and if we had a
market system what you would see is when
General Motors is advertising a car what
you would see is a list of the
characteristics of the car along with a
report by consumers report saying what's
wrong with it and so on that would
create informed consumers it could make
rational choices you don't see that what
you see is an effort to delude you know
a movie star or the football player
car shooting up into the stratosphere or
whatever it may be huge amounts of
capital are expended every year to try
to undermine markets undermine markets
by creating uninformed consumers making
irrational choices and driving them to
consumerism which atomizers rather than
serious things that's what ought to be
taught in economics courses massive
efforts by the business community to
undermine markets that's right it's not
deep we all know it you know but which
some I don't think about it and that
just as we don't think about the fact
that the you know the marvels of free
enterprise like
Computers the internet and souland were
created by the taxpayer of public
expense and in places like MIT right
across the street so I wish we could go
on forever I'm riveted but unfortunately
we're out of time thank you so much for
coming but one thing I will say though
is that it's not every day that a
non-google or just to sit in a room full
of people who work at Google and our
software engineers and our advertising
experts and our you know market experts
in different fields do you have anything
that you'd like to ask us why not do
some of the serious things okay
something that we like
you
