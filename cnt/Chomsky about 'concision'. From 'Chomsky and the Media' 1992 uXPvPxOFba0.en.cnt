let me tell you a personal experience I
happened to be in Madison Wisconsin on a
listener-supported radio station
community radio station a very good one
I was having interview with news
director I've been on that program
dozens of times usually by telephone and
he's very good he gets to all sorts of
people and he started the interview by
playing for me a tape of an interview
that he had just had and had broadcast
with the guy who's some mucky muck and
Nightline I think his name is Jeff
Greenfield or some such name said name
just in the selection of guests to
analyze things why is Noam Chomsky never
on Nightline I couldn't begin to tell
you it's one of the leading
intellectuals in the entire world I have
no idea I mean I can make some guesses
he may be one of the leading
intellectuals who can't talk on
television you know that's a standard
that's very important to us if you got a
22-minute show and a guy takes five
minutes to warm up now I don't know
whether Chomsky doesn't know he's out
one of the reasons why Nightline has the
usual suspects is one of the things you
have to do when you book a show is know
that the person can make the point
within the framework of television and
if people don't like that they should
understand it is about as sensible to
book somebody who will take eight
minutes to give an answer as it is to
book somebody who doesn't speak English
but in the normal given flow that's
another culture bad thing we got to have
anyone speaking people we also need
concision so Greenfield or whatever his
name is hit the nail on the head the US
media are alone in that that it is you
must meet the condition of concision you
got to say things between two
commercials or in 600 words and that's a
very important fact because the beauty
of concision you know saying a couple of
sentences between two commercials the
beauty of that is that you can only
repeat conventional thoughts I was
reading Chomsky 20 years ago I think his
notion he doesn't he have a kidney
cohort and engineering consent or the
manufacturing to consent I mean some of
that stuff to me looks like it's from
Neptune
this is the first time the Neptune
system has been seen clearly by human
eyes these pictures taken only hours ago
by Voyager 2 are its latest contribution
you know he's firmly entitled said if
I'm seeing it through a prism - but my
view that of his notions about the
limits of debate in this country is
absolutely wacko
whatever it is two minutes and I say
Qaddafi's a terrorist how many's a
murder or you know etc etc the Russians
you know I don't need any evidence
everybody just nods on the other hand
suppose you say something that just
isn't regurgitating conventional piety
suppose you say something that's the
least bit unexpected or controversial
suppose you say I mean the biggest
international terror operations that are
known are the ones that are run out of
Washington or suppose you say what
happened in the 1980s is the US
government was driven underground
suppose I say the United States is
invading South Vietnam as it was the
best political leaders are the ones who
are lazy and corrupt if the nuremberg
laws were applied than every post-war
American president would have been
hanged the Bible is one of probably the
most genocide 'el book and Eric total
canon education is a system of imposed
ignorance no more morality in world
affairs fundamentally than there wasn't
a ton of Genghis Khan they're just
different you know they're just
different factors to be concerned with
no chop see thank you
well you know people will reason them
quite reasonably expect to know what you
mean why did you say that I never heard
that before if you said that you better
have a reason you know
better have some evidence and in fact
you better have a lot of evidence
because that's pretty startling common
you can't give evidence if you're stuck
with concision you know that's the
genius of these of this structural
constraint and in my view if people like
say Nightline and Neola or and so on
were smarter if they were better
propagandists they would let dissidents
on let them on more in fact the reason
is that they would sound like they're
from Neptune then comes our special
conversation on the Middle East crisis
tonight's is with the activist writer
and professor Noam Chomsky
again there is has been an offer on the
table which we rejected an Iraqi offer
last April okay to eliminate their
chemical and other unconventional
Arsenal's if Israel were to
simultaneously do the same have to
inject but I think that should be
pursued as well sorry to interrupt you I
have to end it there that's the end of
our time professor Chomsky thank you
very much for joining us
AT&T has supported the macneil/lehrer
Newshour since 1983 because quality
information and quality communications
is our idea of a good connection AT&T
the right choice
