academic staff from 36 departments are
present today such is the drawing power
of noam chomsky Institute professor of
linguistics at MIT the journalism
department is proud to host Norman Carol
Chomsky a visit made possible by the
foundation for Peace Studies art area
New Zealand referred on stage by Kate
Jews professor Chomsky is a New Zealand
primarily to present the media Peace
Awards organized by the foundation in
Auckland tonight the Jennison department
has convened judging of the print
section of these awards since 1987 and
it is this long association of the
foundation which opened the way that
Professor Chomsky's Whistlestop visit to
Christchurch today them Trent ski is
someone for whom the cliche needs no
introduction is absolutely appropriate
for both Lee he transformed the study of
linguistics in the 1960s and
subsequently influenced many disciplines
including psychology and education
changing our ideas about the human
capacity for language and the workings
of the mind turning his formidable
intellect to an analysis of the widest
structures of society he argued that the
ideals of democracy are submitted by
small powerful groups and his widely
acclaimed book manufacturing consent
cotton with Edward Herrmann he developed
the propaganda model to describe the
structural features of the mass media
which make them susceptible to co-option
by powerful interests so much more could
be said but let me simply call on
professor Noam Chomsky to address the
topic whose world order conflicting
visions
well I'm have to apologize that it is a
whistle-stop visit and very brief I'm in
the midst of a series of intense series
of talks around the world one of the
frustrations of talks I mean thousands
I've given over the years but it's
always the same is that the discussion
which is always much more interesting
for me and for the audience is usually
curtailed
I tried to discipline myself to keep the
talk short than the discussion long so
as to minimize that problem and given
the shirt shortness of time today I will
definitely try actually I'll just
mention really a series of topics and
maybe we can pick them up and pursue
them as you'd be interested also again
for for reasons of shortness of time I'm
going to concentrate primarily on the
United States for one reason because
that's what I know but it's not an
inappropriate choice it's been the
overwhelmingly decisive factor in world
affairs in the last century remains far
and away the richest most powerful
country in the world
it also has long stable and democratic
institutions by comparative standards
and as is good a model as there is a
state capitalist democracy which is not
meant to imply that it's a very good
model thinking of the future well the
record of prediction in human affairs is
not overly impressive understatement but
it's not an entirely hopeless task and
if we are willing to take a close look
careful look at where we are and how we
got there trying hard to free ourselves
from the grip of established doctrine
and ideology
we can get at least I think reasonable
grasp of the likely prospect and more
significant of the options that are
available to shape the future along more
just and humane directions in the coming
years there are a number of very serious
crises that are likely to loom very
large the term crisis has been used so
often that its meaning is somewhat
debased but sometimes it's authentic and
in several cases it really is
when is the crisis of nuclear weapons
it's kind of a miracle that that hasn't
destroyed human civilization and much of
the rest in the last half century and it
takes there quite a lot of faith to us
suppose that that miracle will persist
if you look at the the focus at New
Zealand actually has a stellar record in
this regard and is in a strong moral
position to lead the way in this task
that has to be undertaken to get the to
get these monstrous devices eliminated
as long as they exist life is in very
great part the focus is generally on
proliferation so you know India and
Pakistan and Iran and so on but that
peace understand that's to misunderstand
the dynamics of nuclear weapons spirit
which clearly show that the problem is
in the major nuclear states which have
of course not lived up to the
non-proliferation treaty of the
non-proliferation treaty the intent of
the non-proliferation treaty was to call
for nuclear disarmament great powers
would not permit that nevertheless there
is waiting calling for good-faith
efforts to read for the nuclear powers
to rid themselves of nuclear weapons and
of course that has nothing like that has
happened quite the opposite
and if you consider the dynamics of
nuclear weapons spread that guarantees
proliferation so Pakistan has nuclear
weapons to defend itself against India
and India has nuclear weapons to defend
itself against China and China had
nuclear weapons to defend itself against
Russia and Russia had them because of
the interaction with the United States
and it's going to continue that way
Israel has already had them for 20 years
Iran will have them Iraq will have them
the minute
inspectors leave because all it takes is
a developed industrial infrastructure to
develop nuclear weapons that you either
turn a country into a desert or want to
be able to develop nuclear weapons and
one can pretty confidently predict the
proliferation of these horrors of the
more the prolific they proliferate the
greater the dangers and that will
continue by the essential dynamics of
the process until the rot at the core is
illuminated and at the moment there are
no signs of that and that's an extremely
dangerous situation
the other major crisis that everyone is
or ought to be aware of is the
environmental crisis and that could be
extremely serious there's there is a
range of uncertainty about what the
consequences are the business world
which essentially runs the world have
been downplaying the dangers by a very
conscious misinterpretation of the
uncertainty it is quite true that there
is uncertainty so you models of
prediction of climate or you know have a
big plus or minus associated with them
and that has been used consistently in
business propaganda too many media and
so on to argue that it's unnecessary to
take strong steps because there's a
range of uncertainty maybe the forecasts
are overstated there is a range of
uncertainty but that means that the
forecasts may be overstated or they may
be understated that's exactly what
uncertainty means and we don't know
so perhaps the crisis is far more severe
than the scientific consensus or perhaps
it's less severe but minimal prudence
and rationality would indicate that
strong steps ought to be taken to deal
with it in the hope that there's still
time which is not so obvious but that's
a major crisis and cannot be left to it
it's obviously can't be left to the
market in fact the whole system
indicates a radical market failure there
are many reasons why the market ideology
which is trumpeted here for example and
not in many other parts of the world
except by force but here unusually
voluntarily there are many reasons why
that model is a fraud and there's known
to be a fraud
one reason is precisely this the the the
ones who will pay the costs of the
environmental crisis even in principle
don't have a vote in the marketplace
because they're not alive well if you
study economics that's called an
externality being sort of like a
footnote that you don't have to deal
with but that means that the models are
about as realistic as a model of
terrestrial
you know a planetary motion that called
the effect of the Sun an externality
which to bother with will continue with
the nice model and of course that's only
one the cost of oil is simply unrelated
to any meaningful market principle for
one thing because the long-term costs
the externalities are not calculated at
all but for even for narrower reasons so
for example at the large part of the
u.s. Pentagon budget is dedicated to
keeping the price of oil within a
certain range not too low because the
profits go back to the US energy
companies but not too high because that
might be more
to the US and other industrial economies
so there are moments the major US
intervention forces have always been
poised at the Middle East there's
nothing to do with the Russians that's
now officially conceded and has always
been obvious that's also true of the
nuclear weapon system and so on all of
that has to be calculated into the price
of oil in fact it's not the kind of
thing that economists studied at least
if they want to get jobs but there is
one technical step now I know only one
technical study carried out by a
Department of Energy consultant in the
United States
his estimate is that military
expenditures alone amount to about a 30
percent subsidy to the price of oil
which from which he concludes
realistically that that means that oil
estimates about the efficiency of trade
than anything else are wildly off base
for that reason alone and we can
continue on and on the market ideology
is a simple fraud for enormous for all
sorts of reasons of which this of these
are some the environmental crisis is
very real the it's tied to the not
limited to use of hog apartments that
incidentally is in murder crisis this is
coming along at least if the general
consensus of geologists is anywhere near
accurate the oil is obviously a finite
resource has been building up for
millions of years it's going to be
destroyed and roughly 200 years the
there's no alternative no feasible
alternative available though there might
be if enough effort were put into
finding them probably with the it's not
being done it's an exhaustible resource
and furthermore the exhaustion may not
be very far away there is a misleading
oil blood at the moment but it's
expected to be quite temporary oil usage
has about 50 percent of oil
usage has been in the last 20 years
since the oil crisis of the early 70s
that led to acceleration of use of oil
as I say about 50% furthermore the rate
of discovery has been going down it went
up from the mid 19th century and
straight up until mid 1960s since then
it's been going straight down the
chances are that wherever the round is
known and it's getting harder and harder
to yet and most of it the overwhelming
mass of it is in the Persian Gulf area
the Middle East as has always been the
case the Caspian Sea is as small as
estimated to be gruffly the scale of
North Sea small blip on the oil usage
and that means that the Middle East will
play a much more and more central role
in world affairs efforts to control it
by force by the United States primarily
will continue and in fact escalate
that's a turbulent region and I don't
have to tell you there's a lot of
conflict so the conflicts are going to
continue and probably be exacerbated by
the growing share of the Persian Gulf
region in the Arabian Peninsula Gulf
region and oil production it's expected
that but the sort of what's always been
regarded as the crucial point is when in
a total no and enter exploitable energy
resources are 50% utilized and that's
expected to common maybe 10 or 20 years
maybe less and after that it's we're on
the downslide that's the very usage of
oil is itself a kind of human disaster
because of the environmental effect the
absence of it will be another kind of
disaster interacting with the presence
of nuclear weapons and obvious ways all
of these things interact so you know
there are many ominous developments
lying hit
and one of them are inevitable I mean
did not laws of nature these are the
results of human decisions shaped by
ideological considerations the interests
of power sectors they're not hard to
identify it's commonly argued that the
use of oil is the result of the
basically consumer choice in a market
system so the use of oil pick say the
United States but general license is
primarily automobiles and airplanes and
that's no consumer choice free market
etc that's more fraud the use of
automobiles and the oils and airplanes
was a political decision pressed by the
major enterprises by actually it began
you know in involving an enormous social
engineering government social
engineering projects biggest ones
history I suppose which completely
changed the nature of them of the United
States and as that patterns proliferated
around the world take say airplanes
there wouldn't be any airplanes if it
wasn't for massive public funding the
aircraft industry has never been a
self-sustaining it developed in the
1920s in the 1930s through federal
government funding for the post office
and that sort of thing
in the Second World War it took off but
that was of course State Development
Boeing which now is one of the two
companies in the world that monopolizes
the commercial jet market the other
Airbus also a governmental Boeing is a
national there's a state company it's
called private its profits are private
but it's it it's it's been developed
through government subsidies is a kind
of an offshoot of the military system
and the poorest base taking off in the
Second World War and continuing that way
and furthermore this is well known so
right after the Second World War the
major business press Fortune magazine
BusinessWeek pointed out that the
aeronautical industry cannot survive in
a competitive free enterprise economy
and the government must be the savior
they meant they extended that to all a
high tech industry but primarily the
airplane industry which is the biggest
US exporter and a source of enormous
profits through tourism and so on but
it's fundamentally publicly subsidized
and developed at public expense
including the airports and the you know
the aircraft design and the jet motors
and the rest of it that's not a consumer
choice that private decisions clearly
made because the industry is
non-competitive could not exist in a
free market system and therefore the
government must be the savior which
means the public has to pay for it
leading to a shift to the use of
airplanes and favor of other kinds of
transport which would be much more
energy intensive less use of energy for
the same purpose railroads for example
well that's not part of the story the
same is true of automobiles the tech a
city like Los Angeles which I know some
of you have visited a lesson does is
kind of like a maze of freeways big
highways race around all over the place
no public transportation system that
didn't happen through consumer choice it
happened through a literal conspiracy I
don't use the term loosely this is a
conspiracy in the sense that it went to
court been led to fines for conspiracy
three major corporations General Motors
deals Standard Oil of California and
Firestone rubber biggest rubber producer
I got together and conspired to destroy
a very efficient electric rail system
that was working in Los Angeles so they
brought it up and destroyed because they
wanted people to use
automobiles for obvious reasons well
that was a conspiracy they were brought
to court and condemned I think they were
fine something like $5,000 or something
on that order bad enough for the
pleasant dinner they spent celebrating
their defeat and that led to the
elimination of the public transportation
system highly efficient public
transportation system in Los Angeles
which is you know the automobile capital
of the world and the same happen
throughout the country so New England
was where either was tied together
through electric railways the early part
of the century all that's gone you want
to survive you have to course that's not
consumer choice in the early in the
1950s the government the Eisenhower
administration inaugurated what they
call the National Defense highway system
if you want to organize a public subsidy
to big industry you always have to put
in the word defense okay so that's the
cover makes people willing to pay for
safe work so there was a national
defense highway system the you know
justification was you have to move
missiles around case the United States
was attacked by Cuba or somebody know
not to burn those those unveils the but
I thought the reason was to try to shift
transport from rail to highway trucking
and private private automobiles again
for the obvious reasons these are the
major industrial sectors of the economy
they just need massive public subsidy so
the National Defense highway system was
developed at a huge cost and it was
recognized publicly in fact you know not
big headlines but in congressional
testimony and so on but this was a kind
of a Keynesian stimulus to the economy
you know government stimulus to the
economy when they threatened Truman
stimulus that means public stimulus
after all
government is what you pay run off to
the advanced sectors of Industry and
ending up with that's a major fact this
was connected with local states
developing similar projects real estate
interests and so on that led to the
suburbanization of America a major
social engineering project which has
changed everything changed ways of life
you know shopping malls that broke up
cities change patterns of living
attitudes it's just a completely a very
radical change in the nature of the
society which is state social
engineering
consumer choice has very little to do
with it at the same time the railroads
were effectively destroyed except for
Freight that's efficient transporting
people is not efficient they have to
breathe and they take up too much space
and so on and so forth of the freight
that's fine so there's a freight
transport system but essentially no
royal transport system and in fact mass
transportation in general is furious
radically and is very costly it's
designed to be costly in a regressive
fashion so if you look closely at the
public transportation system say in
Boston it turns out that a subway ride
for a poor person in the downtown urban
area that where they go to work is very
profitable for the system but a bus ride
from to where I live out in suburbs
you know the rich folk live that turns
out to be very costly to the system so
the prices are set in such a way that
the critical keep you away from the
system can although also to make sure
that it's poor who are paying for the
and this is done in all sorts of ways
that's a very standard technique for
shifting the tax burden to the poorest
parts of the population and enriching
the wealthy which is why you have
enormous inequality among the reasons
for it these things just don't happen
because of laws of nature and certainly
not
market but by public policy decisions or
policy decisions in which the public
basically has no part because they don't
know about it they're made you know
behind closed doors that media don't
tell you about it you can find out about
it the meat parts of the scholarly
literature but not in textbooks and so
on i furthermore all of this is part of
a much broader system worth
understanding go back a little bit in
history the depression in the 1930s
convinced business anybody who still
believed that capitalism might possibly
work and there weren't many were
disabused of that notion by the
depression it was clear that the system
was utterly unbiased
and it was clearly everybody it didn't
clear the most of business before but
the depression was a serious blow there
was there were efforts to overcome the
effects of the depression through
government programs what were later
called Keynesian programs the New Deal
didn't work by 1939 the depression was
about as bad as it had been in 1932
unemployment was about the same and so
on some of the harsher edges had been
softened but it was essentially the same
when came the second world war which was
which was a huge shot in the arm for us
industry in fact the US manufacturing
roughly tripled during the Second World
War and the reason was it was
essentially a command economy corporate
executives flock to Washington they
carried out that intensive industrial
planning allocation wage controls
theoretically price controls but that
was somewhat in the breach but a
well-organized state coordinated economy
and it taught the lesson that you can
overcome the market crisis by massive
state intervention and it taught the
lesson to exactly the people had to
learn it
the corporate executives who ran the
system right after the war the end of
the war it was widely assumed by the
business press by economists general
assumption that the country is going to
hit right back to depression once this
state coordination and stimulus was
taken away and that's the background for
the kinds of comments that I was quoting
from the business press about how
high-tech industry cannot survive in a
and an unsubsidized competitive free
market economy and the government must
be the savior and there was much
discussion about this in the late
forties public discussion in business
press and elsewhere and that was
recognized right away the interesting
discussion of it that this state
stimulus with now called Keynesian
stimulus to the economy could come in
many different ways for example it could
come through social spending or it can
come through military spending and I
would have essentially the same effect
as you learn in you know your first-year
economics class it's probably true
anyway that was the assumption of the
business world who only one is talking
about this than economists all right
they made a quick decision that military
spending would be better on economic
ground but on other grounds on grounds
of power basically the prog there's a
problem with social spending like
hospitals and schools and that sort of
thing one problem is that it has a
democratizing effect so people are
interested you know you're building a
school somewhere people have an opinion
about where it should be and what it
should be like and so on and so forth
and I generally tends to engage the
population in the political system which
is a bad thing we've got to prevent that
I'm we're in military spending doesn't
have that that effect so nobody has an
opinion on what kind of a jet plane you
should build you know some guy in a
Pentagon doesn't so the furthermore if
social spending has a redistributed
effect it tends to shift
wealth towards the general population
military spending concentrates will in
the hands of high-tech industry and
another thing is military spending is
very is easy to sell if you can frighten
the population so as Senator Vandenberg
Bullock we have to scare hell out of the
people in order to ensure that all of
this can work
Truman's this is very conscious Truman's
first secretary of the Air Force Stuart
Symington informed Congress that the
word you have to use is security not
subsidy of course it's a subsidy but use
the word security that way people will
be adequately frightened I need a major
effort to frighten people it continues
you know all sorts of horrors it's not
the Russians it's Hispanic
narco-traffickers or Libyan terrorists
trying to kill the president or
something like that that dead tank
surrounding the White House to prevent
we've been hit men from killing Reagan
the criminals black by implication black
criminals and so on you got to keep the
population frightened that's a large
part of the job of the media and
intellectuals and so on and have to sell
them on security not subsidy that way
you can carry out subsidy in the
efficient fashion through the monetary
system which concentrates wealth and
undermines democracy and that's the way
it continues part of the reason why the
Pentagon budget stays that Cold War
levels and in fact is now increasing
under pressure from the concert'
so-called conservatives who understand
the system very well
well this covers just about everything
Amick part of the economy it's not just
aircraft so the reason you have
computers and electronics generally in
the automation pharmacy the
pharmaceutical industry but technology
just run through the list information
technology the internet the transit
just like what you like if you look at
it closely it's initiated from the
subsidized through the cross plate
period you know the development period
through public spending and then if it
ever turns out to be profitable that's
handed over to so-called private
enterprise the internet is in fact a
dramatic example which would have
developed in the Pentagon run there for
20 or 30 years then handed over the
National Science Foundation I mean
public universities finally in nineteen
nineteen ninety-five just very recently
it was commercialized meaning handed
over to Bill Gates people like that who
would at least you have to admire
sometimes for their honesty gates for
example has pointed out that his he's
attributed his success to his ability to
embrace and enhance the ideas of others
mostly from the public sector and which
is great and that's in fact the way the
economy works there's an enclosed way
back you know it goes back to textiles
and steel and everything else and in
fact every other successful economy
works the same way there are new zealand
is unusual in that it's actually
believed the official ideology are
chosen to believe it
and is following the path that was
imposed by force on the third world
namely they have been forced to follow
free-market rules and that's a good part
of the reason why India is India and
England or was England pre Thatcher
England was injured well that's the
history of these are things that we can
understand I mean maybe it's not all
well the economic theory isn't entirely
clear the facts are reasonably clear and
control your own conclusions from the
the United States also is still keeping
to the United States has they happen to
have an extremely violent labor history
it's an unusually free country in many
respects but a very violent country and
the by comparative stand
look comparative that is to the
industrial societies Ville over history
is particularly violent so hundreds and
hundreds of American workers were being
murdered by security forces at a time
when that was just totally unknown in
Europe I mean even in very reactionary
societies by the 1920s it appeared that
there was a lot of Glee about the end of
history utopia the Masters the labor
movement had been totally destroyed
mostly by violence and business was
running everything it looked as if
everything was under control
workers were totally intimidated huge
stock market you know going through the
roof in fact kind of an extreme version
of what's being praised today
well then came the 1930s economic
collapse revitalization of popular
forces rapid revitalization because even
when they seem to be destroyed they're
sitting there right below the surface
ready to get going again
and they did the labor organizing was
more than successful and other popular
movements developed and they essentially
forced the government to grant the kinds
of rights that had long existed in other
industrial societies sort of the right
to organize some minimal form of
security I'm so on and so forth that's
the New Deal and that became frightening
it became nearly revolutionary the sit
down as you have to remember the a
sit-down strike which was what was
taking place then a sit-down strike is
just one step short of taking over the
industry and placing it under worker
control which is a radical change in the
nature of the social system and it
doesn't take long for people to figure
out well you know we can learn how to
run this factory why let the managers
boss us around give the owners the
profit that's an extremely small move
sit-down strikes we're getting there the
ideas were around it's a move that at
least in my opinion ought to take place
but they came very close to taking place
at that
time and all frightened business no end
if you read the business literature at
the time they were very frightened they
warned what they call the hazard facing
industrialists in the rising political
power of the masses which was
threatening traditional business rule
there was a counter-offensive that
started off right away in the late 30s
it was put on hold by the war about
Second World War
another priority but it was picked up
immediately after the war there were
immediate legislative efforts that
cutback the rights of labour they
started in the late forties they've been
continuing since and there was also a
kind of an innovation business
recognized that they could no longer
control the workforce by violence and it
was therefore going to be necessary to
turn farm work the techniques of
propaganda that there's a huge public
relations industry in the United States
it is dedicated to what it calls
controlling the public mind regimented
the minds of men as just as an army
regiments their bodies quoting from PR
manuals and that's what they were going
to do after the Second World War the
they there were calls in the business
world for fighting the everlasting
battle for the minds of men and
indoctrinating people with the
capitalist story until they can repeat
it by rote and so on and so forth
major campaign which targeted everybody
captive audiences and factories were
compelled to submit to this propaganda
got into the schools including the
elementary schools the universities of
course the churches I mean even the
sports leagues everything was targeted
it was an enormous campaign and it had
some kind of effect the United States
was basically a social democratic
country in the popular attitudes in the
late 40s within about ten years it
looked as if that had been controlled
again and by the end of the fifth
people were talking again about the end
of ideology I mean things are under
control passive and quiescent
okay then came sixties everything grew
up massive changes very constructive
changes I think that led to totally
really substantial change in American
society not institutional that didn't
change but in attitudes and awareness
and understanding of and implementation
of the human and civil rights
so women's rights for example rights of
minorities respect for other cultures
opposition to aggression and terror in
the environmental movement and all of
these things grew out of this major
changes that of course set off a
counter-offensive again right away and
in fact what's called Mia liberalism is
just a part of that counter offense it's
part of the effort to undermine
democracy and boil fair state the social
contract of another phase in the same
battle that's been going on and on and
it's pretty straightforward the Year
liberalism and it's called you know
economic rationalism it's given
different names there's nothing new
about it it's an old old policy it was
imposed by the British on India in the
late 18th century and afterwards and on
the colonies generally it's so it's not
neo it's certainly not liberalism
because the rich and the powerful insist
on a powerful state that will foster
their interests that's extreme on dumb
estate under Reagan for example state
power vastly increased along with
protection and subsidy and the bailouts
and so on the take a look at the last
budget was just passed a couple months
ago and note you notice that the
so-called conservatives the the House
Majority Leader at that time House
Majority Leader Newt Gingrich and the
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
who are full of you know impassioned
rhetoric about how seven-year-old
children have to learn responsibility
and get off of the cycle of dependency
and so on they continued to hold the
record which they always hold for
government subsidies to their own rich
constituent so Gingrich has been in the
lead for years and Lotte joined him this
year and that's typical they all
understand that the rich have to be
subsidized and protected that's the
purpose of the nanny state they have to
be kept on their cycle of dependency
it's poor women with you know young
children we have to learn that harsh
lessons of the market and that extends
to the third world there all were women
with children except for the rich a leek
that works for the Masters that's a good
part of the structure of the world and a
good deal of the violence of modern
history is the effort to impose those
structures by force if people don't
accept them there are occasional
exceptions rare exceptions where they're
adopted voluntarily New England is an
accredited zealand's an example but
typically it's by force and the nanny
state remains in fact if you look at the
OECD countries the rich countries the
state has grown relative to GNP during
the period of so-called minimization of
the state it's not minimization of the
state it's a shift of the state from
some degree of response to public needs
to more concentration on the needs of
private power and the market is mostly a
joke all right for lots of reasons
well the big change and this the big
change that took place in the modern
period the first world works World War
two period it was around around 25 years
ago there was an international economic
order that was established at the end of
the Second World War it was called the
Bretton Woods system established by the
United States and Britain it
it did try to liberalize trade they were
hoping to get trade had international
trade had dropped very sharply between
the two wars and they wanted to get it
back to roughly what it was before the
first world war that's pretty much
what's happened I mean what's called
globalization is actually in many ways a
return to the pre-world War one period
in terms of the ratio of trade to global
economy investment flow relative to the
global economy and so on there are
changes but by gross measures it's not
all that new in fact in many ways less
than before the Second World War so one
effort was to liberalize trade increased
trade to move toward some kind of what's
called free trade but another part of
Bretton Woods a crucial part of it was
to regulate capital flow to make sure
that capital flow is controlled so
countries were permitted in fact
encouraged to maintain controls on
export or import of capital and the
exchange rates were to be fixed so the
financial system was to be regulated and
controlled the trade system was to be
liberalized and those two things went
together on the theory which is
plausible but like most of economics
kind of guesswork but at least plausible
that the liberalization of finance would
either mind liberalisation of trade that
was part of the reason there was a
general consensus on that another reason
was it was a truism that was understood
by everyone and explicitly articulated
by the framers of Britain Woods and in
fact the obvious on 2-minutes thought
that liberalisation of finance
undermines democracy in the welfare
state almost automatically and the
reason is that the threat of capital
flight is sufficient to undermine social
program so if a country undertakes say
programs to stimulate the economy or
spend money on education and
I'd do anything which is called
irrational namely helps the population
not just profits so you anything
irrational like that capital can flow
out of the country
well capital flows out of the country
interest rates go up economic growth
drops yeah stop spending and end up in
recession in fact that's exactly the IMF
prescriptions for every poor country if
you notice that of course what happens
is what you expect the so capital flight
is the possibility of capital flight
creates gives financial institutions
which are highly concentrated gives them
the power to determine social policy
everywhere you know just by the threat
of capital flight therefore capital
controls are necessary and if you want
to preserve some degree of democracy and
also Social Welfare well I wasn't
unversity paraphrasing what was said by
the framers of Bretton Woods but openly
and it's kind of obvious I mean the
logic is straightforward and it wasn't
controversial then and it isn't
controversial now well capital flight
was liberalized in the early 1970s the
Bretton Woods system was dismantled in
the early nineteen said in the early
muslim can only survive as a cooperative
system so when confine malaysia is
trying to control capital that'll never
work because you have to have
cooperation at the other end both sides
have to be participating and if any
major financial power pulls out of the
system it quickly a road
well the united states pulled out of it
in the early seventies followed by
britain switzerland
the other major financial centres and an
assistant was gone
by the 1980s the rich countries had
dropped regulation of capital others
either joined or were forced to join the
east asian countries like say especially
south korea is a dramatic case which had
a miraculous economic growth
in history was compelled to drop capital
controls in 1993 that led to huge inflow
of speculative capital and quick outflow
of speculative capital that's the East
Asian crisis particularly striking in
countries like South Korea which would
had a strong economy and might recover
it if they were some rational world
order reestablished and I had plenty of
other consequences too there was an
astronomical increase in the speculative
capital I mean it just you know the
numbers are staggering right after the
decline of controls and it's mostly
speculative capital it's now estimated
at over a trillion dollars a day maybe a
trillion and a half dollars a day most
of it extremely short term speculation
so you know money goes in and back in
less than a week for about eighty
percent of it a lot of it's hours or a
minute
this bullet is very harmful to the real
economy and certainly not beneficial to
it and that's most of the foreign
exchange transactions in fact probably
about 95% of them by now maybe 5% are
related to trade and investment you go
back to the Bretton Woods period
pre-1970 about 90% was exchange
transactions were related to real
economy and maybe 10% for speculative
and that's an enormous change quite
apart from the scale which is exploded
and there are plenty of other effects
exactly the ones you'd predict it since
1970 growth rates have declined
productivity is declining throughout the
wealthy countries for the third world
it's been mostly a disaster incomes have
stagnated or declined in the United
States for example about 80 percent of
the population of the workforce is
working longer hours under worse
conditions either to maintain them yet
recover their income level of 1973 not
even 90
and it seems in England to a lesser
extent but somewhat and the other
industrial countries there's been a vast
birth and inequality back to the 1920s
then a very sharp rise in imprisonment
this is superfluous population you've
got to get rid of them somehow so
throwing them into prison mostly black
males that rate is going up very very
fast tripled in the Reagan years still
going up fast health and education and
Welfare are deteriorating in fact
profits are going through the roof or
they were until the middle of this year
in the middle this year the fairy tale
economy as it's called which was a it
was a fairy tale for three percent of
the population that finally began to you
know the crisis began to hit the rich
and the wealth and privilege so that
made the front pages now it's a front
page story that the global economy is in
trouble because it's not just the 80% of
the population who've been suffering
from it in the rich countries and even
more elsewhere but it's also the top few
percent who were benefiting from they
are facing problem markets are
extraordinarily well for markets and
nobody understands they're governed by
what's called panics manias and crashes
in the International Economics
literature and all totally unpredictable
nobody knows what's going on and that's
now threatening the rich they're afraid
of a global meltdown will hurt them as
well so there are calls for
reinstitution of Britain Woods
re-regulation of capital and they're
coming from the most conservative
sectors so the World Bank the Bank for
International Settlements which is you
know the Richmond the bankers Bank
basically is the Bank of the central
bankers the most conservative
institution you can find has been
calling for it has also been warning
that about that one should have humility
and discussing International Economic
Affairs it's
theorem you say humility because nobody
has a idea about what's going on totally
out of control
as they recognize and while dangerous
because it's threatening rich people so
you see it on the front pages well
there's nothing as I say in the third
world that's mostly disasters and it is
as well for most of the most of the
population at home in the United States
it's remarkable and there's all this
talk about a fairytale economy but if
you take a look at it the tough say few
percent of the population have been
doing fantastically well if you get the
top 10% and income sort of getting by
well what for the next ten percent you
know the 80th to 90th percent they've
actually lost net wealth during the
fairytale economy a meaning that debts
have grown faster than asset and they
get down below to the top you know the
80th percentile that's mostly racing to
try to stay even as you possibly can
that's the great Goldilocks economy that
everyone's talking about it's also the
slowest recovery in US economic history
and unprecedented in that it's left out
most of the population and the reasons
are understood so the reasons are
understood to be what Alan Greenspan
calls greater worker insecurity workers
are intimidated you know they're afraid
that the jobs will be transferred the
unions have been destroyed by simply
refusing to enforce the laws and though
that makes workers insecure so they
don't ask for raises and that improves
the health of the economy gives you a
fairytale economy for the people account
now and they happen to be the ones who
are writing the articles which is why
now you read about it but it's not true
of the population and now as I say it's
beginning to hit the rich so there's a
lot of concern about what to do well
there's nothing inevitable about all of
this the
yeah you know these are not the results
of economic laws or you know laws of
nature or anything there are political
decisions very specific decisions taken
by groups that happen to have the power
to impose their will through the often
non-governmental institutions like the
international financial institutions and
others which carry out their work more
or less in secret or simply through
corporate power corporations are
tyrannies private tyrannies which are
unaccountable to the public which should
Minister trade you know it's not free
trade and involved in all kind of
alliances with one another and have
enormous impact on state policy
obviously those decisions are leading to
a certain form of globalization it
doesn't have to take that form and you
can take other forms the globalization
is by no means out of control
and you look at trade and investment
flows and that sort of thing it's the
great majority is within is among
countries which have parliamentary
institutions Europe United States and
Japan and they have no fear of military
coup which means that in principle
policies can be changed even within
existing mechanisms it's a matter of
taking control of what's effectively at
least any principal ought to be under
your control that requires understanding
what's going on of course and breaking
through the web of propaganda secrecy
and so on but that's by no means
impossible especially for relatively
privileged people and in these societies
large part of the population is
relatively privileged privileged and can
be taught about it
and choices furthermore that's within
the framework of existing institutions
and there's nothing holy about them
institutions are not self legitimizing
they have to be they have to face the
test of legitimacy that's true of kings
and princes and slave owners and the
Stalinist state and corporate structures
or any other form of tyranny and
domination has to prove that it's
legitimate and if it's not legitimate it
can be dismantled exactly as has
happened throughout history that's why
there's maybe agonizingly slow but
definitely detectable progress in
history progress to a more humane world
and that hasn't ended it's a matter of
choice and if institutions have to be
dismantled and modified and democratized
those are choices that are surely within
the hands of the public as they have
always been in the past
