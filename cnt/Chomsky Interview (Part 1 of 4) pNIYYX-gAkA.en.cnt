in light of what's been happening in
Egypt in the wider Middle East with the
Arab Spring there is a justification
that's wheeled out regarding the u.s. is
support of Mubarak and that he
represented stability in the region of
course as a justification it falls apart
as soon as you examine it closely
however is there ever a case when you
would countenance supporting a tyrant at
least in the short term because
destabilizing the region could
precipitate catastrophic repercussions
for the whole species and closest
analogue I can think of maybe Pakistan
well you can imagine all kinds of things
but before we even discussed this you
have to decode the terminology at least
the term stability has a kind of
technical meaning in foreign policy
discourse what it means is subordination
to US interests that's stability and in
fact Egypt's very striking case so for
example if you read press commentary and
foreign policy commentary they say
exactly what you said in fact they go on
to say that the 1979 egypt-israel peace
treaty is the cornerstone of stability
in the region now that's a very
interesting interpretation because in
the real world it's the cornerstone of
instability in the region the people
that's precisely why the Egyptian
population is so strongly opposed to it
and why the West so strongly wants it
just take a look soon as the peace
treaty was signed Israeli analysts
strategic analysts right away began to
write about the meaning of it which is
transparent it removes Egypt from the
conflict Egypt is the only military
force in the Arab world so it eliminates
the sole deterrent and therefore it
frees Israel to carry out actions often
very violent action without concern very
shortly they invaded Lebanon no pretext
at all credible pretext killed about
20,000 people destroyed much of southern
Lebanon try
I had failed to install their own
government and expanded their their
illegal occupation in the occupied
territory settlements and so on well
that's you know by the standards of some
objective observer that's instability
but by the standards of the power
systems that stability so therefore it's
the cornerstone of stability in the
region Mubarak kept stability this usage
is all over the place this affects a
deer at the other huge foreign policy
issue the Iranian threat is supposed to
be the worst problem in the world if you
look at foreign policy literature and
media you know government's terrible
Iranian threat well you know the Iranian
government is certainly a threat to its
own population but they're hardly unique
in that respect but so what exactly is
the Iranian threat well it's kind of
interesting that in all the discussion
about it that question is almost never
raised however there is an answer to it
an authoritative answer comes from the
Pentagon and US intelligence every year
they present to Congress an analysis of
the global security situation the most
recent one of course discussed the
Iranian threat which they think is very
severe but that's interesting to see
what they said the it said it's not a
military threat Iran has very low
military expenses even by standards of
the region that has little capacity to
deployed force its military strategy is
designed to try to hold off and a ground
invasion long enough for diplomacy to
set in they of course talked about
nuclear capability they said if Iran is
developing nuclear weapons capability it
would be part of their deterrence
strategy so that's the military threat
nevertheless there are huge threat why
their destabilizing the region how are
they doing it by trying to increase
their
improve their relations with neighboring
countries so they're trying to improve
commercial cultural political other
interactions with Iraq and Afghanistan
and that's destabilizing now when we
when the US and Britain invade the
country's occupy the half destroy them
kill hundreds thousands of people that's
stabilizing until you understand the
terminology you can't even discuss these
questions in fact the whole terminology
of political discourse is sort of
reshaped so as to make it almost
impossible to talk sensibly so to go
back to your question suppose that we
had is let's take say Pakistan the
Pakistan is very dangerous country
undoubtedly the main dangers number has
internal problems huge internal problems
it's a kind of patchwork separate
federated unit different languages
different cultures and so on but there
are two main problems for international
concern one is it's actually the most
rapidly growing nuclear power thanks
Pakistan so a huge nuclear power growing
very fast it's part of their competition
with India I secondly it has it has a
substantial not overwhelming but a
substantial radical Islamist streak that
we saw that recently when the governor
punjab was assassinated there was
enormous he was assassinated because of
his opposition of the blasphemy law and
the way was used to persecuted young
woman who was charged so he was
fascinated there was overwhelming
support for the assassination SAS ins
and a lot of that support was coming
from the and black-suited the lawyers
who were being held because they led the
reform movement that overthrew
musharraf that's where the sport for the
assassin was coming for him well these
it's not a majority they don't get a
majority in any election but it's there
these are part of Reagan's gift to the
world the Reagan administration
pretended they didn't know that Iran was
developed as Pakistan was developing
nuclear weapons of course they did and
they supported the worst dictator in the
history of Pakistan zo huh who was
radically Islam izing the country with
the support of Saudi Arabia the major US
UK ally in the region so this company
fecked both the US and Britain have
tended to support radical Islam for a
long period this quite a good book that
just came out on this way I British
diplomatic historian mark curtis it's
also two of you never not on Britain but
it's also true of the United States and
Pakistan's case in point so yes there's
a radical Islamist sector there's a big
nuclear power there's a lot of internal
problems what do we do about this well
one thing we do about it is try to
exacerbate so if you take a look at the
problems that Pakistan is facing it has
one stable institution the military is
highly stable highly professional
dedicated to the protection of Pakistani
sovereignty and the US is pushing it to
the wall overwhelmingly Pakistanis
support the right of the Taliban to
defend their Afghan Taliban that
Pakistani thought the right of the
Afghani Taliban to defend their country
against aggression they don't like the
the Taliban they didn't like the
Mujahideen during the Russian invasion
but they do support their right to
defend the country against aggression
the United States is demanding that they
take part in that fight well that causes
tension furthermore the drone attacks
which is just there just terror weapons
I mean if they were drawn attacks here
there could be 15 minutes we wouldn't
know about it that's what drone attacks
are their terror weapons and the
Pakistani bitterly resent them the
military too and not just because the
kind of weapon they are but just because
they're bombing Pakistan there are
pressure on the Pakistani army to
participate in the US war to go into the
drive alaria is to prevent basis from
which the US troops in Afghanistan an
occupying army can be attacked I mean
like if the Russians had tried anything
like this during the Russian invasion of
Afghanistan we've had a nuclear war you
know yeah but nobody would have
tolerated with the Pakistani army is
infuriated that's dangerous if they are
forced into a military confrontation
they'll fight the reading military
specialists on Afghanistan Mac Pakistan
points this out and that could even lead
to the leakage of fissile materials into
Joey hands and this has just happened
right before our eyes and is not being
discussed that take the bin Laden
assassination that was obviously an
attack on Pakistani sovereignty the you
know 79 commandos in to assassinate
someone but more than that they were
under orders to fight their way out if
they had to if they the American
American commandos the orders were fight
your way out fight your way out means
you're going to get air support and all
sorts of things you'd be war with
Pakistani army and they'll fight and
then comes possible cycle maybe nuclear
weapons going to the hands of jihadis
well the Obama administration and
Britain we're willing to chance that is
that stabilized it's quite the opposite
in fact one of the major experts on
Pakistani
Terry annika given his military store in
and England one of the main experts in
Pakistan he wrote recently is it book
that just came out which talks about
this in detail but in an article he had
recently he said that American and
British soldiers are dying in
Afghanistan to make the world more
dangerous for the United States Britain
at what we call that stabilization
