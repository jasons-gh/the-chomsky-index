yeah professor I think you've done a
marvelous job of deconstructing American
foreign policy and a lot of the myths
that are used to rationalize it I wonder
if you could talk some more about where
we go from here where the Israelis go
from here where the Palestinians go from
here we just pick one I just felt about
us I mean it's well I think you I if I
can just make a brief comment I think
you would find that in all those
constituencies a vast majority of the
population out of fear in some cases
very justified feels that all the
actions are justified in terms of
self-defense which 911 sort of
underscores for most Americans well I'm
not interested in giving lectures to
Palestinians and Israelis I mean when
I'm in Tel Aviv or when I'm in verse 8 I
tell them what I think they should do
but I'm here ok so I think we should ask
what we should do what we should do is
very straightforward and simple and
within our reach first of all break
through the the doctrinal constraints
which are rigid and find out what's
going on ok once you find out what's
going on well you may be agree that I'm
right or you may think I'm wrong but
whatever it'll be at least know what's
going on when you look at the maps and
so on and if what I said turns out to be
more or less accurate it's clear what we
ought to do we ought to change US policy
so that no longer is the major
impediment to peace in the region and
that's a
it's a pretty pretty conservative view
you know it means taking the position of
the majority of the American population
and even the formal position of the US
government say okay let's do it and we
know how to do it there's no israel will
respond to what the US says they have to
them their choice and they always do
when it push comes to shove if there's
any resistance you just make a hint that
maybe we'll suspend the arms shipments
for a little while but there's no real
need if the US agrees to accept the
long-standing international consensus on
this and the position of the its own
population now you can move towards the
kind of settlement that everyone more or
less agrees is the only short-term
possibility some kind of two state
settlement on the internationally
recognized borders with all the wording
that I just repeated from the 1976
declaration that comes from UN 242 the
rights of both states in the region the
peace and security and so on and so
forth Palestinian state would certainly
be disarmed there could be some border
adjustment you know mutual adjustments
there might be some territorial trading
these are all technicalities the main
thing is to agree to the general point
that there can be a viable Palestinian
state unless that's agreed to there
won't be any progress in the USS so far
totally refused it over here good
evening professor Chomsky are you
familiar with the house of
representative cynthia mckinney democrat
from georgia her allegations that
certain segments of government knew in
advance about the terrorist bombing and
that the Bush family in particular were
in cahoots with a so-called bin Laden
construction company well so Cynthia
McKinney is a great person and I'm glad
she's in Congress she didn't actually
make those allegations the way I read it
she raised some questions and I think
myself the questions are off the wall
you know I don't think there's any
conceivable
ability that this was known in advance
by this by US intelligence however the
second part is not even dubious the Bush
family and those around them are
certainly involved with the bin Laden
family in all kind of projects in fact
Dick Cheney a lot of his money comes
from dealings through various no
intricate offshore groups and so on
dealings that is that yet Iranian and
Iraqi oil to the United States and yeah
the family there's all kinds of
intricate involvement there which would
quickly be discovered if anybody looked
for them on the other hand that's
separate from the allegations about
involvement in the state world trade
center bombing that just doesn't make
any sense my opinion over here Mike
phone number one national ideas are in
the works medical history is open to
anyone especially law enforcement
without your signature and knowledge
censorship cameras everywhere a shadow
government cheni in hiding and now less
Friday is standing armed military at the
ready on US soil illegally against a
constitution according to Jim layer of
the PBS Newshour now my question is this
what will it be used against will it be
US citizens and just exactly why do we
need a standing our military on our soil
and also how do we as citizens of the
United States fight despotism I know our
vote is important but what if I vote is
compromised as in Florida I see the
above list headed to a despotism how do
we as the people depose the despot let's
take the first part of the question I'm
much less alarmed about any of that to
tell you the truth I think first of all
you know about the last election yes
there were Florida shenanigans and so on
but the fact of the matter is that a
much bigger factor in in that in the
Florida vote than all of the shenanigans
was the fact that under Clinton and gore
so many black males
had been put in jail and disenfranchised
that that alone swung the vote you know
so what would have easily swing the vote
to the Democrats and I tend to agree
with the large majority the American
population that this is not a big issue
this is a PEZ bennett Florida vote has
been a huge issue among intellectuals
very interested in it lots of articles
about you know this that knee other
thing that went wrong and they've been
kind of intrigued that it's been
commented are the most of the population
seems to think is a poor and I basically
agree with them the what the problem of
the election was not that it was other
things I mean the major issues that
concern the population never even came
up in the election literally never came
up because the populations opposed to a
leech on them right before the election
you know like on the eve of the election
about seventy-five percent of the
population regarded it as a joke some
kind of game between among rich people
and party bosses and the public
relations industry so therefore they're
not much interested if you know the
Supreme Court made some crazy decision
to switch it one way or another over in
what was pretty near a statistical tie
so whatever was going on there was
serious but I think we're looking at the
wrong we're looking at the wrong problem
there was a problem but it was not the
stealing of the votes we've got on the
military part you know look that civil
libertarian tradition in the United
States is by now quite strong there were
times and not in the very recent past
when the government was able to carry
out highly repressive and brutal actions
I don't think that's possible anymore
they're just been too many victories
especially in the last 30 or 40 years
which have established barriers to
government repression their face plenty
of problems but in my view at least
that's one of the least of them
