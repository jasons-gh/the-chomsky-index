on Wednesday just before Bernie Sanders
announced but it did look like he was
about to pull out of the presidential
race
I asked political dissident linguist and
author Noam Chomsky about his assessment
of the Bernie Sanders campaign in this
time of the corona virus pandemic if
Trump is reelected
it's a indescribable disaster it means
that the policies of the past four years
which have been extremely destructive to
the American population of the world
will be continued
and probably accelerated the what this
is going to mean for health is bad
enough I just mentioned the lens of
figures it will get worse what this
means for the environment or the threat
of nuclear war which no one is talking
about but is extremely serious is
indescribable suppose Biden is elected
my I would anticipate it would be
essentially a continuation of Obama
nothing very great but at least not a
totally destructive and opportunities
for an organized public to change what
is being done to impose pressures it's
common to say now that the Senators
campaign failed I think that's a mistake
I think it was an extraordinary success
completely shifted the arena of debate
and discussion issues that were
unthinkable a couple of years ago are
now right in the middle of attention
the
the the worst crime he committed in the
eyes of the establishment is not the
policies proposing it's the fact that he
was able to inspire popular movements
which had already been developing an
occupied black lives matter or many
others and turned them into an activist
movement which doesn't just show up
every couple of years to push a lever
and then go home but applies constant
pressure constant activism and so on
that could affect a Biden administration
that's activists public intellectual
world-renowned linguist noam chomsky
will spend the hour with him on Friday
on Democracy Now this is democracy now
when we come back the racial disparities
who's dying in this pandemic stay with
us
you
