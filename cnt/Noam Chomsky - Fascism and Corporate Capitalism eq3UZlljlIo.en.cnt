Oh how does an advocate of corporate
welfare today compare with you know it's
a Muslim linear Hitler of yesteryear
like are there any meaningful
differences between the two useful
difference country but the nominees are
not the same system that some
similarities even the German state was
strongly supported by major corporate
power so they didn't much like it after
it turned out the Nazis had ideas of
their own and in fact the big American
corporate power isn't so happy about a
lot of the things happening now either
they're not happy about the there is a
strain a strain in the ingre Charmy
which is sort of right-wing populist but
that means they're also against big
business and they are against the
handouts to big corporations and the big
corporations of course don't like that
but they also don't like the fanaticism
the Christian fundamentalism is
something scares of a lot the corporate
executives are mostly what are called
liberals kind of cultural liberals like
their militantly pro-abortion
they don't want their kids to be forced
to wear repeat prayers and schools then
I like guys running around with assault
rifles and so on and insofar as that's a
segment of the ingred constituency
they're ran happy about it Gingrich
himself is France they like a big big
business fortune as Fortune magazine's
run a couple of polls on this and they
love what Gingrich is up to I mean
because he's just pouring money into
their pockets
on the other hand they don't like him
and they're worried about the people
around him and that's somewhat
reminiscent of the attitudes of big
business towards the Nazis in the late
30s but you know these are different
systems I mean I want to draw their
lines too tight well the similarities I
was thinking were in the results
especially in the non Western or non
industrialized countries that basically
a corporate state and a fascist state
seemed to
be searching for leading strong and and
yet at the expenses as many people's
lives and perhaps you and when you
factor global warming and other
unsustainable industries into the
equation it could may have the expense
of everybody's life yeah but that's
these are the interests of private power
I mean that's it kind of independent of
system I should say that you know these
days or after the Second World War
people think of fascism as being
something that involves gas chambers and
death camps and mass slaughter and so on
and so forth but fascism as a socio
political system was pretty much admired
in the West
Mussolini for example was very popular
in the West in the nineteenth respect I
mean less liberals like Franklin
Roosevelt called him that admirable
Italian gentleman and in fact the u.s.
continued to support him right after the
war and an Ethiopian Franco was very
popular
Franco fascism in the West in fact even
one years later in a way after the war
he was gaining he was being praised by
Eisenhower and the Kennedy
administration and so on for the
wonderful things he did he was straight
fascist Hitler Germany was very popular
up until though least around 37 or so
the State Department ether t7 the State
Department was advocating that we
support Hitler as what they called a
moderate standing between the extremes
of right and left and if we don't
support Hitler we might have to worry
about the masses rising up and maybe
with the middle classes supporting them
and overthrowing the system that we like
there was no great opposition
and attacked it back in those days you
will find books by very mainstream
American political economists like say
Robert Brady a very good political
economist at Columbia University written
a very interesting book must have been
around 1943 or so called business as a
system of power in which he simply
described similarities among the various
state capitalist countries of the world
Germany Italy the United States England
all of which were adopting as he pointed
out Rather's adapted to their own
conditions and circumstances but rather
similar policies of trying to integrate
state power and the private power into
fascist like systems with different
different variants it became
unfashionable to talk like that after
the Second World War but there was a lot
to it and it wasn't considered very
strange that Grady for example pretty
mainstream Veblen economy yeah it's a
scene they don't teach that um teach the
connections between our systems and
classical fascism in the elementary
school yeah you tell it by looking at
investment flows after Mussolini took
over in Italy and destroyed the
parliamentary system instantly and it's
to terror and destroy the labor movement
and so on he was the absolute darling of
the American business community Italy
investment started pouring into Italy I
was the I think it received the highest
flow of investments probably in Europe
in the 1920s after Hitler took over the
investment flow started to shift to
Germany and in the 30s Germany received
more US investments than any European
country outside of England where of
course their historic ties the
reflecting general attitude towards
approval of what he was doing was was
there any direct conflicts of interest
between let's say d the advertisers of
the ownership of the New York Times and
Washington Post in there
ability to let's say benefit from a
military conflict in the Gulf or was it
a more informal structure of control
let's say with the Washington press
corps being manipulated by the White
House or something of that you know that
goes into the level of detail which we
don't have evidence about nobody knows
what goes on on the inside of private
corporations they don't release
documents new and so we have to
speculate but what's interesting is that
this pattern is a highly consistent it's
been demonstrated this is a pretty
dramatic case of it but the pattern
itself has been illustrated in case
after case this thousands of pages of
documentation on this so nobody has made
a an analysis of let's say what
advertisements appear in the New York
Times The Washington Post if defense
contractors and oil companies oh yeah
and do that but it doesn't really tell
you much like for example I wouldn't be
at all surprised if the oil companies
were in favor of a negotiated settle
that's quite possible you know these are
things that you would know only if you
had internal records and remember these
are private tyrannies then I like
governments governments have secrets but
at least more or less democratic
governments bits and pieces leaked out
and ultimately you get a fair amount of
declassification but you don't get the
classification of records from acts on
these are private tyrannies these are
totalitarian systems they don't have any
public accountability and they don't
tell you anything so that's why the
Gingrich Republican sites liked them so
much because they're when you talk about
the analogy to fascism the real analogy
is private corporations those are two
adult Aryan institutions and we don't
use the term for them because our
ideological system keeps away from
economic power in structure but if we
were honest about it we would point out
that these are basically about as close
to the Belet Aryan as any institution
humans have devised if you look at their
history they came out of the same back
around us as political fascism the
modern corporations were given their
extraordinary rights and powers not that
long ago early in this century and
mostly by courts and lawyers not
legislation and it and the thinking
behind it the intellectual background is
rather similar to what led the
Bolshevism than the fascism and they
were similar in form totalitarian
institutions unaccountable to the public
and very hierarchical authoritarian and
their internal structure so you would
say that where some governments are semi
top-down with a little bit of feedback
available classical fascism and
corporation share completely top-down
decision-making structure now and
they're similar completely is too strong
even for fascism very much so I mean
very much tort in that direction like
I'm a taxpayer corporation power is
vested ultimately in the honours and
investors control is done by the CEO and
the board of directors if the investors
don't like it they can come out the the
rest of the structure is strictly pretty
severe II strictly top-down if you're
somewhere inside that system say a
junior manager now you get orders from
above and you hand them on down below
and at the bottom there are people who
rent themselves to the place quote
workers there anything you say now you
know there's a little bit of feedback in
interchange but that was true even in
Stalinist Russia these are about as
close to totalitarian as any
institutions we know and they're not
small
they by now the top 500 corporations
14500 control about almost two-thirds of
American gross domestic product and a
very big piece of the world economy so
you're in favor of using the term
totalitarian to describe corporations
what about the F word could you
effectively like or can you make an
argument to say that they're really yeah
well little or no
I don't like to use the word fascist
just because of its connotations if we
could go back to say the 19 the say of
the early 1940 and describe fascism as a
socio-economic and political system okay
then it would be a system you could
describe but after by now fascism has
the you know it brings images of gas
chambers and death camps and mass murder
and so on and of course that's not true
of these other instances and mainly true
of them is not specifically true of
these other institutions so it's just
kind of bringing the wrong imagery along
with it and it's become a kind of a you
know a word of abuse rather than a
descriptive term so probably better
avoided
