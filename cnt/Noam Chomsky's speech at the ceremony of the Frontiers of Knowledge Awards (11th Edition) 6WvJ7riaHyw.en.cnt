game we're not gonna listen to his
acceptance speech not able to be with
you personally today my wife Valeri and
I were looking forward very to this
occasion with great anticipation a
sudden health problem arose made it
impossible great disappointment for both
of us
needless to say it is most gratifying to
receive this award and I would like to
thank all of those involved in the
decision it is particularly gratifying
as recognition of the achievement of the
so called generative Enterprise at the
outset in the 1950s it seemed to be an
exotic initiative there was no such
field at the time within linguistics
then a small discipline focusing on
rather narrow topics but there was a
tradition completely forgotten that had
posed the challenge addressed by the
generative enterprise the Galileo
expressed his amazement at the
remarkable fact that with a few dozen
symbols humans are somehow able to
express infinitely many thoughts and to
convey to others the inner workings of
our minds similar observations motivated
Cartesian dualism vil home von Humboldt
regarded language as the formative organ
of thought based on the unique human
ability to you make infinite use of
finite means a rich tradition sought to
penetrate the mystery but was unable to
explain how finite means could yield
such infinite expressions of thought the
tradition was swept aside by behaviorist
and
structuralist currents and forgotten by
mid 20th century Alan Torrie other great
mathematicians had established the
theory of computability on firm grounds
that it was clear how a finite system
coded in the brain could address the
Galilean challenge with grammars that
use finite means to generate an infinite
array of structured expressions that
constitute thoughts and to map them to
sensory motor systems usually sound by
now languages of vast typological range
have been investigated in this manner at
a level of depth and scope of inquiry
that could not have even been imagined
not long ago the work also revitalized
the study of language acquisition and
processing and became a core part of the
emerging carbon of Sciences of
particular interest is that we can now
begin to investigate fundamental
properties of language never before
recognized while satisfying the twin
conditions of learnability and
evolvability the results that open very
exciting prospects for understanding
essential features of human intellectual
capacities on the basis for human
creativity and achievement thank you
very much
you
