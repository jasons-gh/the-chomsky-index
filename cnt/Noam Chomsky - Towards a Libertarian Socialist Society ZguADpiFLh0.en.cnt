an email conversation you and I had you
said that libertarian socialism is a
long-term goal one that you and I both I
think agree with this is a good goal
what should we be doing from within
towards the long-term goal of
libertarian socialism partly its
educational partly its organizational so
at the educational dimension what we
would do and have to do is first of all
develop their own visions of the future
Society and try to learn about them and
try to get others to understand them try
to get others to contribute their
understanding of them that's educational
programs at the organizational side we
should be simply developing alternative
institutions for example self managed
workplaces with sharing of work roles
Robin Hahnel who you mentioned is one of
the people who's done a lot of work on
this as Michael Albert and others yeah
we can do that and a lot of its going on
there's recent book by gar alperovitz
reviewing initiatives of that kind all
over the country so it's both both
develop the understanding of some better
future for yourself and for others and
you also try to work towards
constructing it
