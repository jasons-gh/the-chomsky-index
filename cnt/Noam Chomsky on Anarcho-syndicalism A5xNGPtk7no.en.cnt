I kind of wanted to start off by asking
you to briefly describe what is
anarchism and more specifically
anarcho-syndicalism well I think the
best characterization that I know was
given by one of the leading thinkers and
activists in the modern
anarcho-syndicalist world Rudolf rocker
who described anarchism in general as
not a specific set of beliefs that
provides particular answers to all the
questions that can arise but rather what
he called a general tendency in the
history of humanity which aims to
inquire into the nature of social
economic political structures to
determine to detect structures of
hierarchy and domination and to
challenge them to demonstrate their
legitimacy they're not self-justifying
and if they cannot defend their
legitimacy on some plausible grounds
then to dismantle them and reconstruct
them from below and to do this in the
context of the existing society
developing alternative institutions that
are more free and more just in the hope
of moving on to a world of free
associations of workers communities
controlling their own institutions their
own fate in association with one another
various kinds of federal arrangements
and so on that's the basic thrust of our
anarchism altogether in my view and of
anarcho-syndicalism in particular which
is designed for complex industrial
societies so you're talking about
workers controlling their own work and
controlling the enterprises that work
and expanding us I think that's the
crucial aspect doesn't
in fact anarcho-syndicalism kind of
shades off and to left anti-bolshevik
Marxism people that count on panic Oh
climatic Carl course and others and
sympathetic relationships and ideas and
the great anarchist achievements like
the 1936 Spanish Revolution before it
was crushed I did have the strong and
sympathetic support of left Marxists who
felt a community of interests in
commitment workers controlling their own
work how is this organized and how does
it arise how does it want to all over
the place first of all it's a constant
development takes place all over there
were efforts in Eastern Europe for
example and self-management in
Yugoslavia right now in the in the
United States and the and the old
decaying Rust Belt where industries are
collapsing they're being replaced to a
certain extent by worker owned and
partially worker managed enterprises
there's one huge institution that's a
Mondragon great conglomerate didn't
Spain which is worker-owned if not the
delegates selected by manager selected
by workers but not actually worker
managed which is a collection of heavy
industries at banks hospitals community
living do they rise arise kind of
spontaneously and is there any kind of
one specific like is there a system that
regulates how the workers organize
themselves like maybe in the u.s. like
they do it one way and then over and
Spain Mondragon they'll do it a
different way is it is there any kind of
vision there's no leadership or Bible
things develop on the basis of the
circumstances that exist so the
conditions and say the Rust Belt in
northern Ohio
and in Catalonia and Aragon and the
19:36 are quite different and the
backgrounds are quite different but but
there were similarities in the way the
takeover by working people and peasants
of their own lives proceeded let's say
that
Mondragon wants to have an association
with somebody in the rest of that's what
is happening in fact okay I don't know
how far it will go but the one of the
major US unions and Steel Workers is no
has entered into some kinds of
interactions with Mondragon to try to
work out ways to develop a Mondragon
type system in the old industrial
sections of the United States and revive
them on the basis of worker ownership
and community ownership and control if
it is correct as I believe it is that a
fundamental element of human nature is
the need for creative work for a
creative inquiry for for free creation
without the arbitrary limiting effects
of course of institutions then of course
it will follow that a decent society
should maximize the possibilities for
this fundamental human characteristic to
be realized that means trying to
overcome the elements of repression and
oppression and destruction and coercion
that exists in any existing society ours
for example as a historical residue now
a federated decentralized system of free
associations incorporating economic as
well as social institutions would be
what I refer to as anarcho-syndicalism
and it seems to me that it is the
appropriate form of social organization
for an advanced technological society in
which human beings do not have to
be forced into position of tools of cogs
in a machine in which the creative urge
the that I think is intrinsic to human
nature will in fact be able to realize
itself in whatever way it will I don't
know all the ways in which it will
