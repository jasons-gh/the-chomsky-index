hi my name is Nancy and I work with the
International socialist organization and
I just want to start by saying I like
I'm sure many many many other people who
are here tonight are deeply indebted to
your work it's been absolutely essential
in helping us cut through the kind of
garbage that we're faced with every day
when we try to figure out what's going
on in the world but I think if I could
continue I think there is also a problem
in the analysis that I've seen in your
works and that you presented tonight in
the sense that I think we can tend to
lose the forest for the trees that you
present so many you know astonishing
details about what is wrong with the
system and about what is wrong with the
media that we can tend to lose sight of
what I think the really key question is
which is why is this control necessary
in the first place and I would submit at
least that I think it's because there's
antagony I got a minute and a half I
swear to God it's no longer it's because
there's antagonistic interest involved
they didn't talk about milkmaids and
dairy went up whatever it was dairymaids
and spinsters and labors in the 17th
century for no reason it was because
they were the working class and what we
see today in this country I think is
quite frankly let's speak bluntly a
ruling class which tries to control a
working class population and that's what
it's about is holding on to that power
if that's the case then it seems like to
me the question that we face is how to
organize to change that system to
challenge capitalism and I think in that
effort you do a disservice to your
listeners and to the people who respect
your work when you equate Lenin with
Stalinism as likely as you did tonight I
say that and I think it's also important
to point out that that is an
unquestioned assumptions and also an
easy applause getter we saw that you
share with the mainstream media and I
think if it were actually that simple
the horrific kinds of measures that even
bushwa historians describe as a
counter-revolution under Stalin would
not have been necessary if they were all
the same to begin with now in short to
sum up the situation that you have
outlined tonight I think is extremely
serious and I think it's important that
we all take it seriously what we're
talking about is literally the fate of
millions of lives around the world
particularly in the international
politics that you describe that being
the case then I think we need a full and
a serious and a fair discussion of
various different alternatives not just
talking about the horrors of capitalism
but actually how to change it to end
this stuff once and for all
well I think you made okay
I think well there's several questions
there one is about the discussion of the
United States and I think what I said is
approximately what you said except I
didn't use some of that rhetoric the I
you know which I don't particularly
helpful to big truth either analytically
or to understand or whatever but it's
the same picture John Jay had it
straight the people who own the country
out of government and the people who own
the country have basically now are a
network of corporations and
conglomerates and banks and so on they
ought to govern it and the way they do
it is by the methods we've described now
as far as the Soviet Union is concerned
I didn't happen to talk about it tonight
but I've written about this topic I
haven't just made the charge I've
written about it and explained why I
think it's true and it doesn't bother me
if I happen to agree with the mainstream
media on this Trotsky to pick somebody
who you remember once he was charged in
the 1930s with agreeing with the
fascists and his condemnation of the
Soviet Union and he pointed out that his
critique was to be true didn't wasn't
going to abandon it if somebody else had
to sit up and say it for different
reasons so the question is about the
Soviet Union and particularly about
Lenin so what was Leninism well in my
here we have to look at facts now you
know you look at the fact I think here's
which fine Lenin was a right wing
deviation of the socialist movement and
he was so regarded he was regarded as
that by the Marxist by the mainstream
Marxists we've forgotten who the
mainstream Marxist were because they
lost and you only remember the guys who
won but if you go back to the to that
period the mainstream Marxist where
people like for example Anton punycode
who was head of education for the for
the Marxist movement and a serious he's
the one one of the people who Lenin
later denounced as an infantile leftist
but he was one of the leading
intellectuals of the actual Marxist
movement rosa luxemburg was another
mainstream Marxist and there were others
and they were very critical in fact
Trotsky was one up until 1917 they were
all very critical of Leninism because of
this what they regarded as this
- mystic vanguard ISM the idea that the
radical intelligentsia were going to
exploit popular movements to seize state
power and then to use that state power
to whip the population into the society
that they chose now that was quite
inconsistent with Marxism as as
understood by the mainstream sort of I'd
say left Marxists from this point of
view Bolshevism was a right-wing
deviation Trotsky made the same points
up till 1970 now when Lenin came back to
Russia in April 1917 he took a different
line quite a different line than the one
he'd had in the past there you take a
look at Lenin's work it shifted
character in April 17 in April 1917 it
became kind of libertarian that's when
he came out with the April theses and
that's when he wrote state and democracy
came out it came out a year later but
that's when it was written and these
were a statement revolution these these
were basically libertarian works they
were very much more in the main in the
mainstream of sort of left libertarian
socialism from sort of you know this
range that goes from anarchism over left
Marxism of the panic of Luxembourg
variety any talk about Soviets and the
need for you know a workers organization
and so on in fact came really closer to
what the essence of socialism was always
understood to be after all the core of
socialism was understood to be workers
control over production that was the
core it's where you begin with then you
go on to other things but the beginning
is controlled by the workers over
production that's where it begins
then Lenin took power in October 1917
and what's called a revolution but in my
view ought to be called a coup and the
then and things followed that coup or
revolution if you want to call it that
one of the things that followed it was
the immediate moves to destroy the
Soviets and the factory councils those
were some of the first moves of Lenin
and Trotsky after they took the Trotsky
joined at that point after they took
state power in fact if you look at what
Lenin wrote after that period or did
you'll find it's a reversion to the
earlier position the
sort of left deviation is that a
deviation you could ask why in my view
it was just opportunistic he knew that
in order to gain power he was going to
have to go along with the popular
currents that were developing which were
in fact spontaneous and libertarian and
socialist as most popular movements are
have been in fact since the 17th century
and being an astute politician which he
was he sort of went along with that and
talked the line that the people wanted
to hear it's just like when an American
politician goes somewhere and his
pollsters tell him say so-and-so and he
says it mean he believes and laughing
Lenin was doing the same thing without
polls in any event whatever your
interpretation is when he took power he
reverted to the former Vanguard ISM and
moved at once to eliminate the organs of
workers control now that meant he was
moving to destroy socialism if socialism
has as its core workers control over
production the Soviets in the factory
councils were instruments of workers
control and saying that you could say
they're defective instruments never be
worked out better and so on yeah no
doubt but they were the instruments that
had been developed in the course of
popular struggle for to implement
basically workers control and those were
the first things to go by early 1918
this is now it's still really before the
Civil War said in Lenin's view was
pretty clearly expressed it was the view
that both he and Trotsky took position
that what you need is with what Trotsky
called the labor army which is
submissive to the control of a single
leader is it modern you know progress
and development and socialism requires
that the mass of the population
subordinate themselves to a single
leader in a disciplined workforce well
that has absolutely nothing to do with
socialism in facts the exact opposite of
it and was criticized for that by the in
a sense in a spirit of some solidarity
because the you know the revolutionary
forces were still operative it was
credit he was criticized for that by
people like it was a Luxembourg and by
Pannekoek and Gorder and the other
mainstream sort of left Marxists and
that and I think they were right it
seems to me that
and then it just goes on from there I
mean Lenin reconstructed these are
systems of oppression often more
efficiently check a KGB and other
techniques of control and oppression I
think from that point on there was
nothing remotely like socialism in the
Soviet Union I think it was in fact in
my view is a precursor of later forms of
death Ithorian ISM
