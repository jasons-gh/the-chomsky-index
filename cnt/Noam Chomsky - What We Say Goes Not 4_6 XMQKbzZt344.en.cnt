but it's losing ground you might keep
your eyes on tomorrow's newspaper there
was a what looks like might be a
military coup in Ecuador one of the
countries that has upset the United
States because of its exercise of
sovereignty see where that goes the
United States has tried to maintain
military bases it was the last one it
was kicked out of was Ecuador which
makes one suspicious right away before
the facts come in just last februari a
new organization was formed from the
Caribbean and Latin American States see
Lexi Lake see it excluded the United
States and Canada included cube included
every country the region except the
United States and Canada that's a
threatening development if that and
there are others if those continue it
does shake us domination of the region
that has been considered absolutely
essential for world control and has
traditionally been in the US pocket for
a long time much more important as
always is the Middle East as you may
know this year is called the year of
Iran and in foreign policy circles Iran
is depicted as the major threat the
world security and the major foreign
policy problem for the United States
well that's the position of the United
States and Europe Europe has chosen to
be vassals of the United States instead
of following on an independent course in
fact one of the purposes of NATO is to
try to maintain that but aside from
Europe in the United States the world
isn't going along it's not Iran that's
isolated it's the United States that's
isolated the non-aligned countries which
are most of the countries in the world
they have bitterly opposed US policy in
Iran for years and supported Iran's
right to
and rich uranium as a signer of the
non-proliferation treaty probably the
most important country of the south
brazil and the most popular leader in
the south Brazil's Lula have again
strongly endorse that position much to
the annoyance of the United States well
the population of the region of the Arab
states they are so enraged by US
policies that by now a majority of them
a favor here want Iran to develop
nuclear weapons at the balance us and
Israeli power that's pretty dramatic but
of course these are what the British
British diplomatic historian mark curtis
calls on people they're not real people
it's just the non-aligned countries you
know the majority of the world's
population people in the Arab states so
we can kind of dismiss them there are
others who are little harder to dismiss
one of them is turkey major power right
a neighbor of Iran they're disregarding
the US sanctions they've just
established a pipeline to Iran just as
Pakistan has it's not aboard the Turkish
trade with Iran has been increasing very
quickly the prime minister or maybe the
one of the minister's I've got who just
announced that they're going to triple
trade relations with Iran Brazil have
already mentioned very significant state
in the south they're harder to ignore
but the one that's impossible to ignore
is China you can't ignore them they're
too big and too powerful and they're
simply not paying attention they're
accepting the UN sanctions because the
UN sanctions are completely toothless
but they're not accepting the US
sanctions and that's considered a very
serious crime the State Department is
reacting with literal desperation just
recently the State Department warned
China that if they want to be accepted
members of the world community they're
going to have to live up to their
international responsibilities it's the
phrase that was used what's their
international responsibility to obey
unilateral US sanctions that's your
international responsibilities that know
what the rest of the world thinks what
we say goes not unfortunately and I
assume they're just laughing in the
Chinese Foreign Office don't regard that
as their international responsibility
and they know there's nothing the US can
do about it desperation is kind of
dangerous on the part of a powerful
state that has unlimited resources and
should be recognized that Obama
particularly is building up extensively
a military threat against Iran then get
reported here obviously they know about
it that includes naval maneuvers in the
Persian Gulf but particularly what it in
the most important part is the build-up
of military forces offensive military
forces on the island of Diego Garcia
llego Garcia is an African island which
was a british protectorate the british
kicked out the population on us orders
so that the u.s. could establish a major
military base there and it is in fact
one of the major bases is the base
that's used for bombing in the Middle
East and Central Asia Obama has
significantly built up the forces on
Diego Garcia he's established the
reinforced a major a nuclear base there
for nuclear submarines which means also
nuclear missiles and he's also recently
sent a couple of hundred a
deep-penetration ordinance bombs
heaviest bomb in the Arsenal outside of
atomic weapons which are designed
specifically to hit deep targets inside
Iran nothing else actually Bush
initiated that program but it kind of
languished under Bush as soon as Obama
got into office he quickly
escalated it now the bombs are being
produced a couple of years ahead of
predictions and they're being sent to
Dave Garcia a warning to Iran that we're
ready to attack and of course it's
justified if the Iranian threat as the
major threat the world order well
finally exactly what is the Iranian
threat I'm in this terrible threat that
we all have to you know be prepared to
bomb and so on and so forth actually
this is an authoritative answer to that
the answer is provided by the Pentagon
and US intelligence every year they
testify to Congress on the global
security situation the last testimony
was in April and in their review of the
national security situation of course
this is section on Iran and it's worth
reading in fact it would be worth
reading in the US press if they were
willing to publish it which they're not
but you can find at its public document
they point out that the Iranian threat
is not military they say Iran has its
has very little guys very little
capacity to deploy force its military
system is designed for deterrence that's
what little bit they say first of all
Iran spends very little on the military
in comparison with countries of the
region and what they spend is an attempt
to deter an invasion of Iran long enough
for diplomacy to set in and they have
limited capacity deploy force they say
they bring up the nuclear issue they say
if Iran is developing nuclear capability
they don't know but if it is it would be
part of their deterrence strategy well
you know it's a country that needs a
deterrent strategy we may forget the
Iraq us Iraq war they don't it's
surrounded on two sides by the two
countries are none either border which
are occupied by a hostile military
superpower Israel's
major nuclear power of their nuclear
weapons all around the region pakistan
and india has them there are three
countries that have never signed the
non-proliferation treaty nuclear powers
India Israel and Pakistan all developed
and maintained nuclear weapons with us
assistance and the Obama administration
continues to insist that they are not
subject to UN declarations so last year
September 1990 2009 I guess it was the
Security Council did pass a resolution
1887 a calling on all states to join the
non-proliferation treaty that was aimed
at Israel India and Pakistan the Obama
administration immediately informed
India that it can consider itself to be
exempt from this and in fact India
responded to it by announcing that they
now have the capacity to produce nuclear
weapons of the same yield as the
superpowers thanks in part to US aid
Obama also sent a delegation to Israel
to inform them that the resolution
doesn't apply to them if India continues
to develop nuclear weapons Pakistan that
developed them in the first place with
Reagan's assistance and since still and
Iran can see this I mean maybe we don't
notice it maybe they don't report it
here but you can be sure that Iranian
strategic planners know about it well
that's so they might be developing a
deterrence strategy maybe involving a
nuclear capability well if the threat
isn't military what is this awesome
threat that requires the central issue
in world affairs well the threat is the
usual one sovereignty they're exercising
their sovereignty the Pentagon and
intelligence reports go on to say that
Iran is a threat because it's trying to
extend its influence into neighboring
countries and that's destabilizing when
we invade those countries that's
stabilizing when they try to
extend their influence into the
neighboring countries that's
destabilizing interfering that's an
illegitimate interference with it's an
exercise of sovereignty within a domain
that we control they're also there's
more but that's essentially it well this
let's go talk too long it this good deal
to say about the domestic implications
of all of this will drop that but
they're very real just to mention one
thing there's a lot of talk now about
the terrible problem the deficit you
might ask like the Iranian threat why is
it such a terrible problem I mean in a
recession country supposed to run a
deficit that's the way to try to get the
economy moving again but suppose we say
okay it's a threat why is it what's the
deficit well turns out about half the
deficit is military spending which is
going up under Obama fact it's higher
under Obama than at any time since the
Second World War and it's there to
ensure stability around the world like
in the Middle East so that's roughly
half the deficit the other half of the
deficit is medical costs the u.s.
privatized medical system is an
international scandal that has about
twice the per capita costs of other
countries it's some of the worst
outcomes because it's privatized system
for profit and it remains that way under
the minor modifications under the
so-called health reform but that part is
maintained in fact the u.s. is maybe the
only country the only one I know of
where the government is barred by law
from negotiating drug prices with the
pharmaceutical corporations so the
Pentagon can negotiate prices for say
paper clips but the government is not
allowed to negotiate prices for Medicare
drug prices so loud to do it for the
Veterans Administration which it turns
out government-run much more efficient
fewer administer of costs works much
better
national systems but not for medicare
and Obama insisted on that that was one
of the first things he insisted on in
the health care reform that was over the
opposition of eighty-five percent of the
country at that time minor phul point
that's the deficit if we had essentially
the same kind of medical system as other
industrial countries the deficit would
actually turn to a surplus but that's
the deficit the other half is military
spending which is growing and expanding
well there plenty of victims of this are
the worst the victim the real victims
are abroad of course you want to get a
sense of it you can look at the exhibit
outside don't have to talk about it
about their victims at home to a good
part of the population you think that
they might be reacting to this in a
constructive fashion but unfortunately
that's not happening it's another topic
in itself and unless something changes
significantly I think the projections
are not particularly auspicious
thanks very much time we've gone over
time a little bit this this is gnomes
third speech today and the first time
he's gone over time we can probably talk
take questions for about 15-20 minutes
we've got a couple of people with
microphones where are they at the top so
if you want to ask a question just put
your hand up they'll come down i'll pick
a couple people first could you will ask
the question those having trouble
hearing for the microphone
