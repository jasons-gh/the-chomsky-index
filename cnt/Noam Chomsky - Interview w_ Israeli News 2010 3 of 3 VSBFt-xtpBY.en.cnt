you know I think you're taking a lot of
responsibility here a person should take
responsibility for what they are
responsible for yeah but you are so
convinced for many years in your
theories you obviously don't see an
existing danger to Israel there is a
danger it's posing a danger to itself
you see only from that you're asking
Israelis Israeli government to take a
risk you're saying for I'm going back to
the nuclear issue because let's take the
nuclear issue okay there's a way to what
if you're wrong that's what I'm asking
look you have to make judgments on the
basis of your best assessment of the
facts available so there's shouldn't we
learn from history there were voices
before the world war who didn't take
Hitler that serious and history
unfortunately proved us wrong how can
you be so sure that a community odd is
not going to widen Israeli damage sure
so therefore what you should do is take
steps to mitigate the threat to the
extent that it exists the obvious step
to take to mitigate the threat is to
move towards instituting a nuclear
weapons free zone in the Middle East
region that will mitigate the threat
that is not excuse me that's important
no Israelis who don't want to do that or
harming Israel but in your eyes you're
quite sure that this there is no
immediate threat on Israel from outside
of Israel the Israeli what if you're
wrong
what if you're wrong and people are
using your argument to have the
international community to look the
other way suppose those who claim
there's a threat are wrong and in fact
by making that claim they're harming
Israel
yeah that's perfectly possible in fact
it's true so whatever position you take
there's a possibility that it's wrong if
you have the interests of Israel at
heart then what you would want to do is
reduce the possibility of
and a nuclear threat in the region and
there was an immediate way to do that
which is supported virtually by the
entire world and that is to move towards
establishing a nuclear weapons-free zone
with and so let's let's do that
well Israel's refusing and the United
States is refusing now they repeat the
words they say oh yes a nice idea but
they say we can't do it until there's a
comprehensive peace settlement well
that's saying we can't do it period
now what's blocking a comprehensive
peace settlement well we know the answer
the United States and Israel are opposed
to the world on the exists on a
political settlement on the
international border with maybe along
the lines of the table negotiations
which would lead to a comprehensive
peace settlement everyone in the world
is supporting that now by opposing that
it is it is questionable of people it's
not that sure that the Palestinians can
go through with this agreement they have
the Hamas on one hand they have the
photo I'm just saying that look every
relevant actor is in favor of this now
Israel and the United States are not
only opposed to in words they're
blocking it in deeds furthermore
international law is in favor of it okay
that's that's of course your opinion oh
it's not my opinion that's where the
look the occupied territories Israeli
actions in the occupied territories with
us crucial us backing are first of all
illegal Israel recognized that in 1967
they're illegal and they're harmed well
unfortunately we can't solve that
problem we can't agree though it's a
complex situation it's not black and
white but I understand that while your
parents were were alive it was you were
more cautious in making those arguments
against against Israel I don't make
arguments against Israel okay making
these arguments for Israel as you say
was it was it a factor I mean was it
hard for you because I didn't I was
unhappy about the fact that they were
subjected to a series of tantrum
from hysterics in the United States but
I said the same things in effect they
approved of them so when you when in
Israel they consider you to be on
someone who is harming Israel does it
hurt you personally I mean that the
public opinion I mean public opinion is
reading what you're pretending to are
you there's a defend you personally are
you upset that that is the situation set
by the fact that people in other
countries in the world think I'm the
greatest danger to their country is it
tiring tiring yeah I expected any
dissident and critic can anticipate that
they're going to be subjected to
hysterical tirades if you're a Soviet
dissident did you expect to be treated
nicely in fact do you think of it this
in any country who's treated nicely
let's go back in history let's just take
Israel okay you go back to the Bible you
studied the Bible I'm sure yeah in the
Bible there is someone who's called a
hater of Israel the prophet Elijah King
Ahab you know the epitome of evil in the
vine so know what you see yourself as
about saying that no no I've seen the
prophets as intellectuals so it's it's
your life mission and therefore even
your life's mission it's the mission of
any decent human being
I'll take Elijah or Jeremiah or Isaiah
any of them where they treated nicely
they're treated very badly Elijah was
called a hater little carries around man
hater in Israel centuries later he was
honored but not at the time there were
people who were honored at the time
centuries later they're called false
prophets centuries later
that was my rhyme laughing because that
was funny because that was my next
question how do you think history will
judge you that's up the history depends
who when the Jewish history it depends
who wins the battles if you had taken
the other path in nineteen in the 1950s
and stayed in Israel where would you
think we would find you I would be with
my friends in Israel who say the same
thing and you can read them in the press
every day and if you wouldn't live in
the states where would you live if I
wouldn't
five years ago you were asked the
question I was asked the question in an
interview in Haaretz and I said well I'd
certainly go to Israel but now I
wouldn't say then it's changed in the
last few years it's changed in ways
which are extremely harmful to the
country you can see it harming itself
day after day it's its undertake it's in
a mood of not the whole country but
leading sectors including the government
are in a mood of paranoia and
irrationality which is harming the
country very seriously I mean you know
my own case is so trivial it doesn't
matter but just take this trivial case
if the Ministry of Interior had not
refused entry and I'd gone to give it
didn't have to be the end of it nobody
would ever heard of it just as nobody
heard of other talks I've given in verse
eight but that's minor on the other hand
purposely humiliating the Turkish
ambassador
that's not minor it takes a the reaction
of the Goldstone report which is quite
interesting
Israel has turned it into an
international incident if Israel had
acted rationally they would have
responded to the Goldstone report by
saying Thank You mr. Goldstone for your
careful work thank you particularly for
giving us a great gift as he did if
you're concerned about the safety of
Israel should be concerned about these
matters because in case after case the
irrationality and the paranoia is very
harmful and destructive and in the long
term it could be of lead to very serious
consequences preserver Noam Chomsky
thank you very much Baba it's being jet
