from the line on the right thank you dr.
Chomsky for taking my question questions
about the debt ceiling it's become
increasingly obvious that we're in a lot
of trouble here and it's also becoming
obvious to everyone that the Federal
Reserve Bank that issues the currency is
owned by a bunch of private bankers so
my question to you is do you think it
would remedy the situation at all to
return the power of printing money and
issuing currency to the people of the
United States frankly I there's a lot of
feeling about that but I really think
it's misguided I don't think the problem
is printing fiat currency that's so I
mean just in a mighty I mean if you
eliminate capitalism you know okay then
there are other options but in a but but
that's but that's not on the agenda we
have a state capitalist economy you know
maybe in the long term it can be weren't
away maybe ever thrown and hope so but
the issue now is how do you function in
a sensible state capitalist economy and
you cannot do that without a central
bank that controls currency in fact if
it wasn't for the Federal Reserve's
ability to print money we'd be in a deep
depression right now worst depression
than a 1930s and what's you know since
the sensible thing isn't being done for
political reasons the sensible thing
would be creating demand by government
investment but for reasons that we can
go into that's not being done in our
state capitalist economy the only
alternative is the one that Bernanke is
used and if it wasn't for their option
we would be in a deep depression now
what's the debt debt ceiling issue well
that's first of all it should be
recognized that the
it is not a serious problem certainly
the deficit is not a serious problem
there are long-term problems about the
debt but they are so remote they don't
bear on policy as far as the Deaf it is
concerned deficit is concerned remember
that's not the same as a debt as Clinton
left office it's not that long ago we
had a surplus no deficit and it's not a
deep structural problem the current
deficit is the result of Bush's tax cut
the crazy wars the virtually criminal
behavior of the corporate system that
led to the financial the housing crisis
finally financial crisis all of that has
increased the deficit but not out of
sight the deficit is chrysalis declining
and it's it would be overcome by actual
growth I mean the the government
economic offices Bureau of the budget
and so on they calculate that there's
about a trillion dollars of unused
capacity I mean the real problem of the
economy is not the debt and the deficit
it's the fact that the economy is so
kind of grotesque that you have tens of
millions of people wanting to work and
not able to you have huge financial
resources corporate the corporations
that you don't know what to do with
their money huge profits huge bank
profits there's an enormous amount that
has to be done just walk around any city
you can think of a million things that
have to be done and all kind of you know
it's just the numerator Matt will so a
huge number of idle hands enormous
resources tremendous amount of work that
has to be done and the economy is so
dysfunctional it can't put them together
that's the problem and it's destroying a
generation of young people it's harming
severely harming the economy under
current circumstances the way out is
pretty well known
it's to stimulate the economy through
government demand since corporations
aren't doing it and to devalue the
dollar so that we import less than
export more these are methods that are
technically feasible but not politically
feasible and I think we have to ask
about that so what's the dysfunction and
government about well for one thing it's
called polarization of the parties
that's just not accurate I mean what's I
think about what's happened in the
United States you go bad about 50 years
and the United States was described not
not incorrectly as a one-party state the
business party with two factions called
Democrats and Republicans and that was
pretty accurate but something changed
and the time to talk about it but in the
last roughly generation 30 35 years has
been a significant change in the economy
and it's led to a change in the
political organizations that were still
a one-party state the business party we
still have two factions but they're not
Democrats and Republicans the one
faction is moderate Republicans who are
called Democrats so the Democrats today
are pretty much the moderate Republicans
of a generation ago now people say
moderate programs have disappeared no
they haven't they've just become
Democrats and the other faction was
mobile as the two parties drifted to the
right the Republicans just went off the
edge they became the party of the very
rich and the corporate sector well you
can't get votes that way so they were
compelled to turn to the SEC kinds of
sectors of the population that I was
describing before which were always
there but were not mobilized as a
political force you know the people
terrified that somebody's coming after
them the
religious extremists that people who
hate science because one of those guys
know and so on and so forth that those
are the sectors of the that's the base
of the Republican Party and we've now
and that's the second faction the if you
look at the business pages now the
corporate sector is very concerned that
they can't control their base they can
no longer control them these guys don't
care if they destroy the economy who
cares you know we can win the Civil War
you know God will help us whatever it is
they just don't care and it's it's a
very unusual situation but that's the
that's the rough political system in the
United States there's some counterparts
it's kind of similar to something that
happened in late by mar germany when the
German industrialists thought that they
could use the Nazis as a battering ram
against labor than the left and they
figure then they could control them
turned out they couldn't they couldn't
control them and you know what happened
this is not them are Germany but this is
striking similarity and that's the
dysfunction that's what's happening in
Washington that's why the world that's
why the World Bank in the IMF are
pleading with the United States to try
to act like a civilized society you know
because we may bring down the global
economy with these two factions that's a
serious problem Florida's right in the
middle of it so do you guys see it all
around you
