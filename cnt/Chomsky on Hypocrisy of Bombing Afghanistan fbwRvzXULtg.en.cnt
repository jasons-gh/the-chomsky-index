...'cause you can't comprehend
that we should apply to ourselves  the standard you apply to others.
That is incomprehensible.
If you take a poll among US intellectuals, support for bombing in Afghanistan is just overwhelming.
But how many of them think that  you should bomb Washington,
because of the US war against Nicaragua,  let's say, or Cuba or Turkey or anyone else?
Now if anyone were to suggest this  they'd be considered insane. But why?
I mean, if one is right, why is the other wrong?
When you try to get someone to talk  about this question, they just - well, try...
They can't comprehend what your question is.
Because you can't comprehend that we should  apply to ourselves the standards you apply to others.
That is incomprehensible.
Now, you know, there couldn't be a moral principle more elementary.
I mean, all you have to do is read  George Bush's favourite philosopher.
There is a definition, famous definition,  in the Gospels of the hypocrite.
The hypocrite is the person who refuses to apply to himself the standards he applies to others.
By that standard the entire  commentary and discussion of the war,
the so-called 'war on terror,' is  pure hypocrisy, virtually without exception.
Can anybody understand that?  No. They can't understand it.
But that's not so unusual.
I bet you anything that if you  go back to Japan in the 1930's or 40's,
and you did a poll of intellectuals on the war, you'd probably get the same reactions.
I mean, I know it's true in Germany, France, and everywhere else.
It's just standard. It's ugly, but it's standard.
