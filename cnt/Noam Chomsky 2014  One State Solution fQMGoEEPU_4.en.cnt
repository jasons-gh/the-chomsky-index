what what's next once date well I'm
sorry to be a minority of one again but
I think that the entire discourse on
this is highly misleading the usual
discussion almost universal on the part
of Israeli authorities Palestinians
international commentators almost
everything is that there are two options
either two states or if that's going on
one state and in fact a lot of
Palestinians support that this okay
let's have Israel it's given the keys
they take the whole place over will run
a civil rights struggle kind of an
anti-apartheid struggle that's all pie
in the sky those are not the two options
there are two options one is the
international consensus on two States
the second option is Israel continues
doing exactly what it is doing now with
us support Israel doesn't want to take
over the the Palestinian population in
fact what they're doing it's right
before your eyes they're carrying out
settlement and development programs
which carve up the West Bank Gaza is
kept as a prison carve up the West Bank
in a way which integrates into Israel
the parts of the West Bank that they
want that Pleasant suburbs of Jerusalem
and Tel Aviv of the Jordan Valley where
they're kicking out Palestinians the
corridors that go through to the east
Matta Adam Amon south are real in the
north break up the region into sort of
Canton's and take over the major
resources including the water but leave
out the population it's designed so that
they will not there will be very few
Palestinians in the regions that are
integrated into Israel ultimately
annexed to it so in fact there won't be
what's called the famous demographic
problem too many too many Arabs and
Jewish state that's not going to happen
what'll happen in fact is that the
proportion of Jews in Greater Israel
will go up when they bring in the
settlers because they're there first of
all there aren't a lot of Palestinians
in those areas and the ones where
they're being kicked out that's the
second option so if you don't have a
two-state solution this is what's going
to happen as long as the US and Britain
supported of course yeah that's
