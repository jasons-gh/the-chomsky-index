no I wanted to ask you if you think the
revelations from WikiLeaks right the US
diplomatic cables before that Iraq and
Afghan war logs is massive trove of
documents that have been released Julian
Assange talking about the critical issue
of transparency have played a key role
here I mean in terms of Tunisia a young
university graduate who ended up because
there were no jobs just selling
vegetables in a market being harassed by
police immolates himself that it was the
spark but also the documents that came
out on Tunisia talking confirming the
u.s. knowledge while it's supported
Tunisian regime that it was wholly
corrupt and what this means from one
country to another Yemen as well do you
think there is a direct relationship
well actually the you know faq of the
matters of wikileaks are not really
telling us anything dramatically new
they're providing a confirmation often
of reasonable surmises tunisia was a
very interesting case so the ambassador
did have a one of the leaks comes from
the ambassador july two thousand nine
and he describes tunisia he says it's a
police state with little freedom of
expression or association as serious
human rights problems ruled by a
dictator whose family is despised for
their corruption the robbery of the
population and so on that's the
assessment of the ambassador not long
after that the US singled out Tunisia
for an extra shipment of military aid
not just in izya also two other Arab
dictatorships Egypt and Jordan and of
course Israel it's routine
and one other country namely columbia
the country with the worst human rights
record in the Western Hemisphere for
years and the leading recipient of US
military aid for years two elements that
correlate quite closely has been shown
well that was that's that the this tells
you what the understanding was about
Tunisia namely police state literally
hated dictator and so on but we send
them more arms afterwards because the
populations quiet so everything's fine
actually there was a description by a
very succinct account of all of this by
a former high Jordanian officials now
director of Middle East research for the
Carnegie Endowment or one washer he said
this is the principal he said there's
nothing wrong everything is under
control meaning as long as the
population is quiet acquiescent may be
fuming with rage but doing nothing about
it everything's fine there's nothing
wrong so under control that's the
operative principle he's a former
Jordanian diplomat former Jordanian
official high official what about what's
happening now in Jordan what you think
is going to happen and also in Saudi
Arabia how much it drives this and what
you feel Obama needs to do and what you
think he actually is doing well Jordan
the the Prime Minister was just replaced
he was replaced with an ex general who
seems to be his claim to be moderately
popular in the park but Lee's not hated
by the population but essentially
nothing changed there are changes of the
Jordanian cabinet frequently and the
basic a system remains whether the
population
we'll accept that whether the washer
principle will work nothing's wrong
everything's under control that we don't
know Saudi Arabia is an interesting case
of the Saudi Arabia the king of Saudi
Arabia has been along with Israel the
strongest supporter most outspoken
supporter of Mubarak and the Saudi
Arabian case should remind us of
something about the regular commentary
on this issue the standard line and
commentary is that of course we love
democracy but for pragmatic reasons we
must sometimes reluctantly oppose it in
this case because of the threat of
radical Islamists the Muslim Brotherhood
well you know there's maybe some
whatever one thinks of that take a look
at saudi arabia that's the leading
center of radical Islamist ideology
that's been the source of it for years
the United States says it's also the
support of Islamic terror the source
first Islamic terror the ideology that
supports it that's the leading US ally
and has been for a long long time the
u.s. supported us relations of close
relations with Israel incidentally after
the 1967 war escalated because Israel
had struck a serious blow against
secular Arab nationalism the real enemy
in Nazareth Egypt and in defense of
radical Islam a saudi arabia saudi
arabian egypt had been in a proxy war
just before that and there was a major
conflict and that's quite typical the
probably the most going back to
wikileaks and maybe the most significant
revelation has to do with pakistan
in Pakistan the WikiLeaks cables show
that the Ambassador is ambassador
Patterson is pretty much on top of
what's going on there's a enormous the
phrase campaign of hatred against the
United States an understatement
population is passionately anti-american
increasingly so largely as she points
out as a result of us actions in both
Afghanistan and Pakistan the pressure on
the Pakistani military to invade the
tribal zones the drone attacks and so on
and she goes on to say that this may
even lead to the wood is in fact the
ultimate nightmare that Pakistan's
enormous military nuclear facilities
which incidentally are being increased
faster than anywhere else in the world
that these there might be leakage of
fissile materials into the hands of
radicalism the radical Islamists who
were growing in strength and gang
profits support as a result of in part
as a result of actions that were taking
well this goes back to this didn't
happen overnight the major factor behind
this is the rule of the dictator zo hawk
back in the 1980s he was the one who
carried out radical Islam ization of
Pakistan with Saudi funding he's set up
these extremists and madrasas the young
lawyers who were in the streets recently
shouting their support for the assassin
of of the political figure who opposed
the blasphemy laws their products of
those madrasas who supported him
Ronald Reagan he was reagan's a favor
dictator in the region well you know
events have consequences you support
radical Islam ization and there are
consequences
