the third world well one aspect of that
is the kind of privatization which
leaves power in the hands of usually
foreign industry or their local
counterparts we've just seen it go on in
Mexico Mexico said the biggest
privatization in modern history and the
last you know actually the biggest
privatization in history probably is the
internet and the whole telecommunication
system here is a system developed at
public expense which is being given you
know it's not even sold sign the
privatization song as they sell it for
something here we just give it away you
know the private power so that's huge
privatization but in third world
countries I suppose the main cases
Mexico and in fact yachts true the
mexican telephone company and so on
they're getting privatized and you're
getting a small couple hundred
billionaire's you know service isn't
improving except for the rich getting
small number of billionaires wages and
incomes of collapsed by pence a measure
but maybe fifty percent during the
liberalisation period in 1995 right
after the collapse GNP went down by
about eight or nine percent still not
recovering yeah that's a privatization
on the other hand sometimes it might be
the right thing to do you know like
maybe it would be but you need an
argument and the arguments complicated
the the principle that says it's a
wonderful thing always do it that's just
you know it's not even religion that's
just pure doctrine it's kinda like
Stalinist doctrine there's no reason to
believe that sometimes it might be right
some that it might be wrong something
and right or wrong don't have don't mean
anything either it's something to be
right for some people and wrong for
other people
yeah that's right no not too erratic
well see the world back gives you to
country to take a look at World Bank
programs they have two contradictory
messages totally contradictory on the
one hand the World Bank does say
consistently and forcefully that the
path to economic growth requires
relative equality human capital you know
so improving health and education and so
on improving infrastructure and relative
equality those are the primary factors
that are involved in growth that's one
side of their mouth with the other side
of their mouths they're imposing
policies which bar all of those things
so structural whatever you may like
structural adjustment or hate it but
nobody doubts that what it does is
reduce expenditures for Health and
Welfare increase inequality cutback
infrastructure in fact undermine exactly
the factors that the World Bank on the
other side of its mouth says are
necessary for growth and privatization
is part of it simply ask yourself a
question who you know whatever debates
you can have about privatization there
is one group of people that definitely
gained by men were the people who are
picking up the pieces okay well they
happen to be the same people who are
making the policy that should at least
cause some question to arise
I
will be significant but prior to the
privatization of pelvics that phone line
wait you that's right and now you don't
like ride the work
and now it's much faster whoo-hoo or you
yeah anyone except that for ninety five
percent of the populations out of the
question yet try as more as it has a has
a rich sector which is being well
provided but for but public phones
that's not happening and you can see all
be leaving in a very high when like in
high school I with Sierra have to walk
there now they have yeah I don't buy the
argument I also the my dr is not helping
who Connolly would be really cool yeah
that's right I hope but let's take a
close look yes exports increase to pay
up mostly to pay off the debt you know
for most of the population take a look
at what's happened for most of the
populate for in fact average wages have
declined quite radically depends exactly
how you measure but roughly in the fifty
percent range declined since the
liberalisation began malnutrition has
gone way up starvation has gone up
millions of people have driven have been
a driven off your land because they've
been undercut by subsidized us agro
exports there is production in regions
which are in the maquila regions
primarily which I've had virtually no
linkage to the Mexican economy they
don't use Mexican inputs they don't the
about the only thing that they
contribute to the Mexican economy is
whatever the wages are environmental
conditions have gotten much worse but
for a sector of the population you know
the wealthier sector surely
or better that's true of every third
world country you go to sub-saharan
Africa the same thing is true there's a
sector of the population that lives
extremely well in fact it lives by
Western standards and there's a large
mass of the population which is
somewhere between suffering and misery
and for the wealthier part of the sect
of the population there is no doubt that
these policies improve things the same
everywhere for that part of the
population yes these policies improve
things when you say that Mexican
Mexico's living off exports that's true
on the other hand the growth the growth
rate in Mexico is much faster prior to
nineteen eighty declines into then and
you have to ask yourself what
alternative policies are not being
followed okay of course there's always
improve you know things always there's
always technical improvement there's
always more fun there's always no more
airplanes and so on we'd have to ask
yourself is what are the net effects of
carrying out this specific form of
change well it has varied effects for
different parts of the population I
certainly has improved things for the
wealthier sector and it's harm things
for the for the majority well
I can say what I saw is in one state
president in these last year half a
million people that didn't get regular
are getting it for tonight it's a staple
for million people so that know where
they getting a trim water no it's going
up actually but all over all Mexico it's
going up
you weren't talking about Mexico City
where you yeah yeah but the with Mexico
City is true the opposition one but you
know you'll find places where there are
things are getting better you find other
places where they're getting worse on
the average they're getting worse and
that's particularly striking when you
compare the development of Mexico up
till nineteen eighty when it was in fact
a rapid growth period just in fact very
much the same as East Asia so yeah it's
separate but for people like us you know
yeah in most of the third world people
like us live very well most of the
population are like the ones in roxbury
they don't and for them it's getting
worse not look I in the case of state
privatization of the mexican telephone I
think you have to look at it on its own
have to look at what the consequences
were of course it's an attack on
democracy that's by definition any kind
of privatization is but sometimes it
could be that an attack on democracy is
beneficial to people and sometimes it
might not be you have to look closely
and see what happened where resources
went what the alternatives were you know
what people are paying for it and so on
and so forth that's what you have to
look at same is true when you look at
Sadie toothpick right here at the
regulation of Airlines is it beneficial
or not beneficial well actually there's
been quite a big debate about that I
mean it's true that airplanes are faster
and they're more of them and they're
safer but that was going on before
deregulation so what you have to show is
that there was a is a point of
inflection you know the things and in
fact what you find is yeah there were
changes but they're in all directions so
so one of the one of the changes for
example is that the number of heart
attacks has gone way up because people
are now cramped crammed into such close
quarters that they end up with embolisms
another is that the cheapest way to get
from
the Washington is probably through
London because of the way they
privatized air fares workout and you
know there's all kinds of changes and
you really have to measure them all and
some of them are very hard to measure so
for example one change which shows up in
the statistics as an improvement is
automation of services in the airlines
it's like you call an airline office you
know and you get into an automated menu
and you know ultimately if you work
through it you feel like you get what
you want that saves money that makes the
airlines much more efficient because
they don't have to pay human beings to
sit there and answer your your what
you're saying right so when an economist
looks at it they say a lot more
efficient than it used to be but that's
because of the ideological technique of
measurement they're not measuring what
it costs you you know person is calling
up to sit there for half an hour while
you sort of wait for you know to get
onto the computer and to start pushing
the buttons which you don't understand
and they don't have your answer anyway
and so on well that's a cost to a person
the cost to people the users is
multiplied by the number of users could
be a substantial cost may be small to
each person but huge when you multiply
it by the number of users but it's
unmeasured the only thing that is
measured is the increase of efficiency
in the airlines which shows up an air
cost so yeah it looks good well those
are things you really have to take into
account and they're not small I mean
there have been a few attempts to study
them it's not a popular topic but there
have been a few attempts to study for
example the cost of highway repairs as
compared of
a repair of cars well the few studies
are around seem to indicate that the
cost of repairing highways is
considerably lower than the total cost
of repairing cars because of the hitting
potholes and so on but the second cost
is not counted it's only the first cost
that's counted the first cost is a cost
of the inefficiency of government
spending money on you know on highways
the second cost is distributed over the
population in fact if you really look
closely the second cost turns out to be
an improvement in GNP because if your
car it's a rut and you have to take it
to the garage to get fixed the GNP goes
oh so it's actually an improvement in
the economy when the costs are
transferred over to individuals there's
a lot of that that goes on and all of
those things would have to be taken into
account if we were giving an honest
accurate description of these effects on
the other hand in Mexico I think if you
look closely you'll find that the gross
effects are not in doubt there has been
a very sharp decline in living standards
for the majority of the population and
in many areas at dangerous increase in
pollution especially around the
maquiladora areas there are places where
doubtless things have improved for some
people as they had been doing before and
we have to know you have to evaluate all
of these effect
as to the effect of NAFTA was probably
very limited it's now conceded that the
if take a look at the trade flows before
it after NAFTA trade did go up after
NAFTA better roughly the rate it was
going up before there's a very little
change and that's now conceded all the
projections are now admitted to have
been false and what it said right in the
mainstream as you know the purpose of
NAFTA was to lock Mexico into the
reforms in fact let me add something
else which is less public this was
discussed in strategy sessions in
Washington earlier the minutes of which
are public there was a major meeting in
Washington in 1990 of pop decision
makers and Mexico specialists and so on
talking about us-mexico relations and
they decided to decided that relations
were very healthy and very good with but
there was one cloud on the horizon the
cloud was I'm quoting it now that a
democracy opening in Mexico might bring
into power government with more
nationalist and populist goals okay well
not to stop that the main effect of
NAFTA has not been increasing trade but
it's been decreasing the danger that a
democracy opening might lead to that so
they can pick say populist leaders in
mexico city but the virtual Senate of
international investors under nafta
style arrangements ensures that they
can't do very much so there is any fear
of a democracy opening my own view is
that's the main thing lay behind afta as
the World Trade Organization as the
coming agreement
person who's got a PhD in linguistics be
interested in poor people understand
that question I mean this taking a
degree in linguistics remove your
humanity any I hope yeah you shouldn't
believe me you should certainly not
believe a word I said that's why i was
giving sources look them up you
shouldn't believe me or anyone else did
may but I it may but it shouldn't yeah
55 billion
to open up Korea to foreign ownership
yeah actually but just in terms of scale
the bailout for Korea is not all that
big I mean let's compare it with what's
done here say the bailout of the asset
snl's which is one miniscule
insignificant part of the US economy was
four times the bailout of Korea that's
the biggest socialization in modern
history was the taking the SNL's which
are like you know it's not like a
central core piece of the US economy
these little banks that are you know
giving out real estate mortgages bailing
them out meaning bailing them out
meaning bailing out wealthy investors
who made bad loans investments that came
a conservative estimate of that is about
200 billion dollar I was just
distributed over us taxpayers because
part of the system is that cost and risk
are socialized okay and that that alone
that little piece is four times Korea
well what's happening in South Korea
take the yesterday's New York Times had
pretty good discussion of it on the
business page is not in the front pages
if you look in the business pages there
was a pretty good discussion or what
they pointed out was yeah the bailout is
a bailout of mostly foreign investors
and foreign banks and you know wealthy
Koreans who made bad loans in fact the
chief economist of the World Bank Joseph
Stiglitz was quoted as saying that being
very much opposed to this because what
he's saying is all it's doing is telling
investors there's no risk so if they
want to you know lend money within
Chancey investment well you know if it
works they make a lot of money if they
lose it get socialized remember that
these are socialized with the bailout of
so-called bailout of South Korea means
you're paying for it right even the
stuff that comes in the World Bank is
coming from taxpayers so all of this
stuff is being socialized just like the
third world debt was to make sure that
the rich people donit face
and in fact the you know the chief
becomes the World Bank which is quoted
on that yesterday adjusted Jeffrey Sachs
from Harvard the advocate of all the
stuff was also quoted saying the same
thing he's saying these were failures of
private markets do they do with
governments these were failures in
private markets and now the public is
being called upon to pay them off with
the condition crucial condition that you
mentioned that it's very crucial South
Korea now has to agree to abandon the
system which led to its phenomenal
growth South Korean growth rates have
really been phenomenal like nothing in
the West and they were done under a
highly regulated States entered system
as soon as they began to liberalize
their financial institutions they
immediately started getting into trouble
just like Latin America and now they are
supposed to go the Latin American
Direction sell out their resources make
with foreigners on their industry you
know let foreign banks decide what
social policy is going to be cut down on
wages you know cut back on security of
employment yeah that's what they're
supposed to do in return for the public
socializing the debts of the vet paying
off the bad debts of rich people that's
what it comes down to but quite apart
from what it amounts to even the scale
isn't so huge as I said it's about a
quarter of the SNL and that's a small
part of the socialization of risk that
goes on in the United States it's not
just the United States there's a the
best study I know of the only detailed
study of transnationals but to British
economist investigated the top hundred
transnationals and the fortune list you
know ranking and you know a long
detailed analysis they concluded that
the top hundred every single one of them
first of all they concluded the almost
none of them were trans
nationals they were based in a
particular country and that's where
their markets were and that's what they
relied on for you know subsidy and so on
they also concluded that every one of
the top hundred had benefited from state
industrial policy in its own home
country and that more than 20 out of the
hundred would not exist as business
enterprises if it hadn't been for
bailout by the home country that
incidentally includes newt gingrich's
favorite locky which was bailed out by a
two billion dollar loan guarantee when
they started getting into trouble so
nothing special about South Korea except
that it so it's another form of
socialization of risk and is being used
as a lever to turn it into Mexico
can't hear Iran
even internally to rent well Iran did
have a democratic opening back in the
early 1950s and they elected a
conservative conservative Nationalist
government the Masada coven that was
overthrown by a US British military coup
put into power the Shah who ruled the
country in a very brutal fashion for up
till nineteen seventy nine but insanity
with economic growth you know it's
another one of those brutal dictators
who were part of the population was
producing substantial growth and
modernization he was considered a great
hero in the West when he was overthrown
well you got how many revolution and
it's which you know it was very
dictatorial and religious I'm sure
you're probably Ronnie and I get ya say
you know ten times as much about this is
me there's no point am I talking about
it but I mean that's been somewhat
eroding and I think there's now a lot of
unpredictable you tell you tell me but
as my feeling is there's a lot of
unpredictable currents going in
different directions in Iran which could
are opening up the society and so I
decide itself is much less
fundamentalist than others but like say
saudi arabia in fact in many ways it's
west fundamentalism in the united states
the united states is one of the most
religious fundamentalist countries in
the world but they have a kind of clout
the religious authorities there the
deland here but i think i think well i'm
interested in hearing what you say but
to me it looks like it's eroding
but there's just a lot of things
happening in the society you know
there's a lot of crosscurrents
independence you know you see people
let's see you see people publishing all
kind of things you wouldn't believe and
so on exactly where Iran is going to fit
into the world system is a tricky story
the United States is trying very hard to
isolate it the United States and Israel
but they're alone in that the United
States and Israel are alone and trying
to isolate your hand right now and that
it doesn't look like they're getting
away with it other countries are just
you know breaking the rule freedom you
yeah one more night at least one more
Bobby
harborne guided privation well the
system was set up in such a way and the
Soviet Union was is the original third
world that goes back to the 15th century
you go back to the 15th century eastern
or western europe were sort of alike and
they started separating the West began
developing the east became its service
area and the gap between the East and
the West grew right up into early this
century the largest gap between the East
and the West was around 1910 you know
kept going up until then well in Eastern
Europe was a deeply impoverished
peasants society it had sectors of
wealth mostly Western connected it had
you know artists and writers and on our
stalker so you talk French and all the
stuff we read about when you know we
study Russian history but I had a huge
mass of people who are living total
misery you know and backward well you
know the Bolshevik Revolution was I
don't think I had a thing to do with
socialism word certainly not democracy
but it was a revolution of forced
industrialization and it carried out a
quite brutal policy of forced
industrialization which turned the
Soviet Union into a modern society not
third world that's going back to third
world but through the 1980s it was not a
third world Society if you compare it
with comparable more or less comparable
societies that we were running looks
pretty good so compare the soviet union
with brazil what's a another big country
a lot of resources
no enemies in that case very much run by
Western Power first the British than us
for ten percent of the population of
Brazil it's way better than living in
the Soviet Union for probably ninety
percent it's much worse than living in
the Soviet Union you know in fact if you
look at their social indicators they're
about the level of Albania well okay so
the Soviet Union became a modern
industrial society midday there were
things it was beginning to stagnate
around the 1960s for all kinds of
reasons which people debate by the 1980s
it was still growth rate was going on
you know the old functioning the upper
classes in the Soviet Union which is the
state bureaucracy you know caltarian
state it was run by a state bureaucracy
they essentially made the decision to
dismantle it concluding probably
accurately for themselves that they
could do much better being like the
wealthy sector in Mexico than being like
the wealthy sector in Russia they
themselves could be so they returned
essentially are returning the society to
its third world status meaning a sector
of very great wealth most of them old
communist party apparatchik just like
guilty who essentially sold off the
system they are now becoming extremely
wealthy a kind of a mixture of the old
state bureaucracy and do criminal
elements and so on and so forth well
there's a huge flow of capital from
Russia to the west capital flight is
extraordinary I mean nobody knows
exactly how to estimate it but it's
considered to be a measurable part of US
national
come now it's just capital flight from
Russia just like Mexico and Brazil and
other countries with the rich people are
free to you know make money by selling
off the resources or and then sending
our money to the west most of the
country is the foremost of the
population has been very harsh there's a
by 1993 that were already estimated by
the west by Western sources to be about
a half a million extra deaths a year
just as a result of the economic reforms
which the West approves of fairly
substantial you know and so on across
the board I mean very moving to a
typical third-world pattern what is the
Western role in this well to implement
it of course I mean western investors
are very happy to see it go back to that
you can put a you know Volkswagen or
General Motors or Fiat and so on can put
up a assembly plant in former Eastern
Europe at a fraction of the cost of what
it costs for what the business press is
quite frank about this they say you can
put up i'm quoting you can put up
factories there for a fraction of the
cost of what you have to pay the
pampered Western workers it's true you
have to pay that you have to pay them
anything like what you pay the pampered
Western workers just the same as when
you shift the assembly plant from
Indiana to northern Mexico and that's
great for western investors it has the
usual effects on the recipient society
divides it into a sector of wealth the
large number of people who sort of get
by if they can spur Lewis people and yes
the West has implemented it the specific
programs were developed pay taxes
program
also were designed to break up the
interactions among the Soviet the
eastern the countries of the Soviet
system you know they had all kind of
economic it was closed economic system
and the idea was to set up what's called
a hub-and-spoke system so each eastern
european country would have independent
relations for the West not with one
another and the early effect of that was
a very serious attack on the whole
economic system that's intently now
rebuilding those links are coming back
to some extent but the essentially it
was subjected the same kinds of
neoliberal structural adjustment
programs is Latin American sub-saharan
African with pretty similar effects
again you have to disaggregate I mean
this Eastern Europe was not a
homogeneous area parts of it were part
of the West like the Czech Republic and
that was a rich Western industrial
society and it all with various failures
and so on it will probably move back to
that same through western Poland which
is really part of Germany but and you
know estonia will become part of finland
rich industrial society but by and large
it's more or less restoring what it was
before the move towards independent
