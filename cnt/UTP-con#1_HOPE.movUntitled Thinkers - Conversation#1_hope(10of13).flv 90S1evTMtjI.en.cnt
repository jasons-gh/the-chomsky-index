I
more free and just world in fact right
now what I hope for is a world in which
my grandchildren can have a decent life
and that's not obviously going to happen
they there are really serious that
threats that might destroy that
possibility the threat of nuclear war
for example which is very serious the
threat of environmental catastrophe
extremely serious in fact there are now
threats of a kind that even beings have
never faced before they are on the wall
you can see a picture of Bertrand
Russell he and Albert Einstein in 1955
and published the very eloquent to
manifesto to the people of the world and
he said people the world have to face
make a choice that is stark and
inevitable shall we give up war or shall
we destroy the species and we don't
really have many other choices you could
say the same about environmental
catastrophe shall we decide to do
something about it or shall we create a
world in which decent people wouldn't
want to live those are species
threatening choices of a kind that were
never faced before and there are plenty
of others in the end
what I hope is that the world will be
better for the next generation than it
is for this generation and that we those
of us that are in this generation
understand that we have an obligation
for the next generation it's an
obligation that has to deal with the
environment it's an obligation that has
to do with the challenges of poverty and
opportunity around the way it's an it's
an obligation to deal with the threat of
war and the threat of nuclear weapons
for example it's something that was
created in my generation or at the end
of my parents generation anyway and we
still haven't we still have been dead
with one of the greatest threats
properly to human civilization as a
whole and we still haven't dealt with it
we've we're better than what we wants
war but we're not we're not home free by
a long ways and I think that's something
we owe the generations of fire we've
conquered so many other problems looking
look at what we've managed to do in
feeding people it's not that people
don't starve around the world people do
starve but largely now because of the
disruptions of war and civil unrest not
because we can't grow enough food around
the world because we can grow enough
food around the world and that's an
amazing set of achievement of course
achieved by both controlling birth rates
and the importance of controlling birth
rates as well as by technology
technology that's made tremendous
improvement so we've gotten to the point
where we can solve that I think we can
as a civilization have lofty goals but
lofty goals that are achievable we can
actually achieve these things and that's
something I think are the kind of noble
things that we should aim for
I hope that the recognition would with
that we are part of nature will enable
us to deepen our understanding of
democracy to the point where we
recognized that there will be tensions
and contradictions but that part of
democracies to mediate those resolve
them for the used next stages but
eliminate one the need to kill each
other in that only tension I also hope
that we as communities would arrive at
the next stage I hear all the theories
about all sorts of Rights but I just see
a simple right do not ask for yourself
what you would not Crump to others the
individual under the community level I
think that's the found a that they had
two challenges that are immediate if we
are to go forward beyond that I can't
see and I will not be around so I don't
want to look too far ahead you guys
we've made a mess of this world you guys
whatever you do don't be afraid whatever
you do is going to be better than the
mess we've made so do it and take it
forward
