oh yeah I got the revolutions in North
Africa and the Middle East have
shattered the theory of a passive Arab
world in your to dictatorship and in
thrall to political Islam but there's a
challenge to for the world view of the
left
after 911 with the Afghan war and the
invasion of Iraq the world for the left
became polarized between America and its
enemies Noam Chomsky the professor of
linguistics who became the global
intellectual figurehead of the left saw
America itself as terrorist America he
described as a totalitarian state
Chomsky who is Jewish said Israel's
invasion of Gaza was not only criminal
but politicize the systematic murder of
a nation all this prompted the English
writer Christopher Hitchens to accuse
Chomsky of accepting moral equivalence
between the actions of the USA and of
al-qaeda for the best part of 20 years
the left's narrative on the Middle East
has been dominated by imperialism and
anti-imperialism Chomsky recently
predicted that in pursuit of oil the US
and its allies will pull out the stops
to prevent any really functioning
democracy from developing in the Arab
world but with the risings in Egypt and
Tunisia a new force blew into history
secular young people many of them
Western educated who didn't seem to hate
America and this too has been the test
of a new kind of American diplomacy
under Obama the USA has so far refrained
from militarizing the situation and
exercised soft power to speed the exit
of men like Ben Ali and Mubarak Chomsky
a giant of modern linguistics claimed
the media had become a machine for
manufacturing consent but these were
revolutions driven by free access to
information the sudden impact of social
media the consent machine broke down
and it's been shaky in America with a
hundred thousand on the streets of
madison wisconsin in defense of union
rights Chomsky describes himself as an
anarchist or libertarian socialist and
in that he embodies the ideas that have
become dominant on the left with the
demise of leninism and trade union power
now from Tahrir Square to madison
wisconsin that left is faced with a new
question once you've mobilized people
power what do you do with it well
earlier I spoke to professor Chomsky i'm
professor Chomsky when you see all those
thousands of people demonstrating on the
streets of Egypt or Libya what do you
think well I think it's wonderful I
don't have a lot of problems internal
and external notice that it's been a
remarkable achievement so far but the
regimes are intact there have been name
changes but no significant
socio-economic political changes that
they may come you talk about them
demonstrating against regimes which
enjoyed the backing of the West isn't it
characteristic of these demonstrations
that the West is by and large back the
demonstrators against the dictators
certainly not in fact what's happened is
following the a standard game plan which
has been used over and over marcos in
the philippines davila in haiti tryn and
south korea's sooo heart though and
indonesia there comes a point when you
cannot support your favorite dictator
any longer I and the and the same thing
happens every time it's happening here
to support them as long as possible when
the judgment is
but not anymore maybe the Army's turned
against them or whatever come out with
ringing declarations about your love of
democracy and how you're on the side of
the people and then try to preserve the
regime so you think that the the
immediate response should have been to
withdrawal support for the
administration in in Egypt fruit so not
quite i think that response should have
taken place a long time ago sure
remember these these demonstrations are
bursting out now but things have been
going on for a long time so for example
in Egypt there have been very extensive
significant labor struggles for years
the january twenty fifth movement was
led by the uprisings were led by a group
called the April sixth group April's
those are the one you know the heck
savvy young people April sixth is a
significant day that was the date of a
major strike and support action have
planned that the mala textile industries
which was broken up by force and that
was a couple of years ago do you find it
striking that what many of these
demonstrators appear to want is the sort
of freedoms western freedoms that you
have often said a rather illusory well
they're a loser if we let them be
illusory in fact what's happening in
Madison Wisconsin sorry irrelevant in
this respect right in the middle of the
court time of the most dramatic moments
of the protest couple of weeks ago was
when calabaza well done labor leader in
Egypt sent a message to madison
wisconsin saying the people of the
workers of Egypt support the workers of
Madison in their struggle in Madison
they're trying to preserve aspects of
democracy they're under serious attack
in Egypt they're trying to
gain the rights that have been denied
them the trajectories are crossing but
going in opposite directions do you
think that the West should go as far as
arming the dissidents in Libya or Egypt
Egypt it's not even the issue doesn't
even arise in Egypt so yes no of course
not but he took the way Libya do you
think we didn't look like again look
there's a special case libby's a civil
war should the West intervene militarily
that's very doubtful I don't think so
there's a long way before that question
even arises now there are first of all
the people don't want it remember that
the West is hated for good reasons and
it takes a Libya eastern Libya which was
just pretty much liberated that's the
site of the first post World War one
major genocide Italy in that case that
we may not remember they do and there's
a long history sense with England France
for the for the powerful the histories
bunk but for the victims don't have that
luxury so what do we do just do nothing
we wait and first we're not asked to do
anything mostly we've been asked to stay
away just read what is being said mostly
stay away you've got a enough blood on
your hands already there are the the
question of what to do is not up to us
we're not the only ones in the world
sure so say Brazil for example is a
respected country so it's Turkey we know
because we've seen what you've had to
say on the subject how you regard Bush
and Blass record in the Middle East do
you think Obama's know better
many ways worse I I've been writing
about it I started writing ability for
the election why is he worse well should
go through the video in the case of
Afghanistan he's sharply escalated the
war this is threatening a breakup of
Pakistan which could be a catastrophe
for the West let's take Israel Palestine
I mean his position is shocking he is
refused to do I mean there was just a UN
Security Council resolution few weeks
ago in which calling on an ending of
settlement settlement expansion and
declaring the settlements illegal which
is not even controversial Obama vetoed
it you famously said that every American
president since the Second World War
would fail in the judgment as applied at
Nuremberg and devil effectively should
be hanged do you see the same applies to
president said not everybody was hanged
at Nuremberg I said if not even a film
was hanged up I said if we believed in
the Nuremberg principle yes every
American president would be subject to
them what the decision would be we'd
have to check notice that this is the
Nuremberg principles not the trials but
Obama would fan know better were those
principles apply to him no he's carrying
out he's carrying out a major war in
Afghanistan he's supporting he's
directly and I mean they stand correctly
involved in aggressive and criminal
actions carried out by Israel for
example he's only been in office for two
years so he hasn't a chance to invade
yeah but his record is quite consistent
with what's happened before professor
Chomsky thank you thank you very much
and you can watch the whole of that
