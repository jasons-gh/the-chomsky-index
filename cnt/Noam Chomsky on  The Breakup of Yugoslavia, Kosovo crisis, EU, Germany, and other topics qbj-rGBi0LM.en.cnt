can you say more about that today just
think that yeah yeah an amazing person
well he knows history but which was
incredible but it went on until his last
days he never stopped I've learned a lot
for a man about you just lobby of just
talking to that we were involved and
what kind of other things together he
was very active in the International
nineteen sixties he was a very serious
kind of dissident you know he understood
the complications of the situation that
he was protesting he wasn't just trying
to make friends with powerful people in
the West so a very very sensible
critical analysis and a very engaged it
was we're both seriously wounded in the
war they were partisans and he had
plenty of later problems one of his sons
was murdered by Tito
just check that to the last minute
once I think it was due to 70s you made
a reference to the governing
self-management experiments we should
pretty interesting there were problems
with them they were in the framework of
a authoritarian structure but if you
abstract from the structure that should
have been dismantle in many ways
what you think they're they're still
much of debate and they're much
controversy over the reasons and real
causes of the dissolution of Yugoslavia
so certainly they are they are internal
and external factors that led to death
and internally a lot of people argue and
I think it's it's accurate the data
basically it's the primarily the
responsibility of the political elites
in all eurozone republics and also
intellectuals who just so nationalism
kind of new ideological for was the
effects of the new liberal policies
instituted by usual world and all of the
world including the Western countries
they had pretty much the same effects
different different charters so if you
go down for the Occupy Wall Street today
they're protesting the impact of these
programs on the United States if you go
to a toddler square and Egypt there
in fact Egypt which was the first
different it's different country but
similar in the neighbors states and at a
same around the world Latin America for
example which the countries that observe
the rules most stringent were South
America sub-saharan Africa and they're
the ones who suffered most
she lost a piece of the earth develop
like South America pulled out over the
fact ejective are now present the Europe
that's being imposed now in a way the
austerity programs being imposed by the
World Bank but by the ECB this is
European Central Bank and German banks
and so on
incidentally the IMS is no longer
approve you know them but they're
similar to the kinds of programs many
ways were employed there are another not
in Santa Fe this form of class warfare
undermining welfare states you know
name's Rebeca there is enough undermined
the role of labor pre-standard
effects and then use lobbies and they
were either accepted or were subjected
to
structural Justin inside programs of the
1980s which undermined a lot of the
achievements of the society I thought
and also had the usual effects of
centralizing welcome arming the general
population eliminating state structures
many of which were beneficial many not
and the leading I mean the poster child
for this the person to the West just
loves wouldn't anyone else was there was
a bitch he was then able to roll
advocate so I think right up until 1990
he was a real favor of the West because
the policies is personal there was the
Nationalists an interesting phenomenon I
mean
details the feel of it polls throughout
Yugoslavia in around 1990 there was
still I think said several majority
support for keeping the Federation
together it started to break up when I
think we know the sequence of events and
ask about the internal dynamics but
Croatia Slovenia declared independence
that wasn't much of an issue
they were pretty much part of Central
Europe anyway so okay in naturally
pretty complicated its then it's a sort
of in support of this weight loss
absolutely yes that could be moved was
Croatia Croatia declared independence
there's a lot of memories there for the
rest of you certain procedures through
it was immediately backed by Germany
which raises more members the Nazis and
the Croatian fascists were very closely
at Germany's plainly just trying to
expand its influence
traditional areas
the support for the German support for
coition dependence paid no attention to
the rights of the Serbian minority which
was a pretty big I think was better
population so quite naturally the use of
slow army entered the first of the
conflict some of the first trusted
Croatians and as I said this plenty of
baggage their historical members the big
question was how do you ever would
respond your along with Germany which it
usually does motor your which meant that
they were supporting Mariko and certain
conflict then the internal conflicts
broke yeah the u.s. first was sandy
decide and in fact you know supporting
some steps towards unification there
were proposals and
I guess 1992 so this one which could
probably had resolved conflict more or
less speed not not a pretty way that
without the atrocities followed and the
us that when I entered in and undermine
the apparently Washington wanted to have
a piece of the action and not leave it
to Europe so did either going to have
somebody support so it's where did the
bus
that very much Hirsch is a bitch not to
accept the settlements or being proposed
which are instantly not very different
from the way it ended up after all the
crimes are so very likely could have
been put together right at that point
and then follow what we all know is
violence conflict the current estimates
are about careful estimates from Bosnia
if every 100,000 people maybe 60,000
votes which is pretty bad
cries always ever done this better ever
nature that nobody knows the trophy Nova
Scotians about the same time these
ethnic cleansing
the US was behind it was Croatian so
there's okay but that's the usual story
finally militarily it was the lines were
more or less strong after Serratia
Carmina and so the u.s. stepped in the
monitor the agreements which essentially
ratified what was there as I said 1992
and then comes war conflict we get to
1999 actually except Kosovo had a very
strong nonviolent resistance there was
resistance I think
this question whether they should have
taken part in the elections is not the
had taken part the elections that
probably would've voted lost her job and
enough votes Terry that's a yeah we sure
looked like it
they didn't the by in 1998 the hatch
moved to a pretty violent uprising
chaotic forces are attacking from across
the border from Albania but they make
pretty clear that what they were trying
to do was to provoke a Serbian my
observing response was made that people
to the west and that went on we know
very well
Stanny other conflict in the world after
october 19 was it was formal Audrina
there were monitors on the ground
is this a customer verification mission
live international monitors were all
over there sending back tons of reports
there were we have very rich
documentation the two major collections
of State Department documents the
British parliamentary inquiry this
native documents the United Nations and
the mill say about same thing there was
a steady level of conflict a typical
cycle according to them was race walking
across the border by day about a
gorilla's violent killing Serbian
soldiers the anticipated Serbian
response way over usually that
one it was fairly steady nothing much
changed up till March 1999 this essence
pretty rough but it seems that the
killings were approximately comfortable
on both sides according to the British
during the period up until the January
they were mostly and nothing changed
after that nineteen in March there were
February there were different
negotiations there were two position
positions presented one of those the
other was Serbian Serbian position was
never mentioned just the decision to fly
serving sources negotiations broke down
at that point the us society the the the
general charge general Clarke the
testified in Washington secretly but it
all came out verse and he met with
Clinton administration officials sandy
Berger national security advisor they
asked him what his plans were said they
bombed soldiers on the day he was asked
well the consequence of speeds it well
of course the Serbs will react on the
ground they can't follow us so they'll
respond with a strong which is on the
ground
we did trust these explosions and so on
and then he was asked well what do you
do then he said will be bombs more that
was early March
anticipating this the monitors who was
wrong I think they're not March 22nd
then the bombing started Clark right
away had a press conference of course
distorted he exists
what's going to happen they said the
same thing
it's predictable he said there will be
trust me something around does the
Serbian army response they are bombing
survey report and yes it happened about
a week later the UN High Commission on
refugees was began registering his first
refugees in candy bars on the ground
the bomb went off for 78 days it was
finally ceasefire and a UN Security
Council resolution which was pretty much
a compromise between the two positions
like February which suggests that there
could have been a negotiated so but it's
kind of academic because they violated
the agreement with the support of the
Western media and then you need one
syllable of this under British American
pressure of the International Criminal
Court
indicted militia bitch that's kind of
interesting look at the indictment all
for crimes committed after the bombing
there's one exception
it's disputed but made it's true one
exception was the Russians a junior but
everything else was after the bombs it
was plain that just part of thee but
that quarter was simply following words
ladies surely from its masters to try to
provide for their attack and this was
recognized pretty short pretty much done
after that you never be able to get away
with indicted in lawsuits for Christ as
a result of the NATO bombing so they had
it Bosnia through it then you get this
whatever you think about it it's highly
politicized he can't go on a series
Barilla pasta dish and the that constant
moves on to the u.s. imposed
independence not accepted by me
but the UST not very well they have
major major military base kosovo Catalan
steals useful at times just by living in
fit and that's is the us and positioned
in the Balkans it's not just Jeremy
territory us as a position there in
Kosovo disaster area I just don't want
to it should add that there is a Western
religious doctrine on this most fanatic
in England much more than in the United
States the religious doctrine which is
catechism the accurate P is the the West
intervened to stop the atrocities and
the way that's achieved is just by
inverting the chronology and suppressing
the massive documentation Western
documentation about what happened up to
the bomb and everything else I said they
just invert that and then it turns out
that the West is the noblest act in
human history
intervention intervened to stop the
atrocities that we're going on and that
anyone who questions this is a supporter
of the hall to us okay that instant
discussion it's amazing and England's
best bet and France really kind of
expanded their actions less extreme in
the United States for once and this is
true when the British left
right to everybody what we're going
about this there's an interesting
International Commission not for anybody
justice Goldstone inquiry into customer
with very good people on it and sample
stone did the Goldstone branch as a
South African jurors and they came out
of love interesting study which
concluded that the bombing of Kosovo was
illegal but legitimate and the reason it
was legitimate was because it was
necessary to make a humanitarian taking
monetary an act to stop the atrocities
that were going on if you look at their
evidence it's the same as the Catechism
they just invert the chronology simple
invert the chronology well located
in this role of Germany in the breakup
of Yugoslavia the human in one interview
for Slovenian and in German if I
remember correctly that exactly what you
have said now that basically German who
was the chief promoter of Croatian
independence and and then the rest of
the Western Europe European Union just
just follow that path
but what was the main interests of sure
when you know how to say again you know
I study this is death so I'm just
talking about the way it looks
yeah I think the make that Germany has a
historic interest in the wars that's
when his removed in that was not an
innovation
I think was just trying to restore its
influence over over that part of your
justice Jeremy's the driving force right
now and the austerity programs that are
destroying so that you were how do you
see these developments I will come back
later to Yugoslavia a temporary but when
we speak about the dis German influence
in Europe how do you see the current
political and economic situation in
Europe there is one member of British
Parliament who just recently accused
basically that Germany wants to dominate
it to control the entire Europe and
Europeans don't go to war with each
other anymore
school the political science literature
so the Democratic peace the democracies
don't fight each other it's true the
democracies don't fight each other if
they understand that the next time they
play their favorite game of slaughtering
each other they're going to destroy the
world
so in 1945 a white dawn that Europe they
realized we've been in the most savage
brutal place
history for centuries but we can't do it
anymore
because we need level of capacity for
destruction was reached such a level but
the next time there's a war between
France Germany Italy will follow
Einstein once they exist what it'll be
the weapons used in the next war they
said well I don't know what will be but
I know they'll be in work after that
stone axes yeah that's when that
realization go on they don't fight each
other anymore they carry out of Trustees
also but so is this it's not a lot of
good things of that economy I mean a lot
of steps toward the European Union they
were very sensible then it became quite
a civil space of comparative standards
but there is a struggle to influence our
policy and so honest
yet this Germany has done very
respectively at many years in many ways
it has to become kind what it was like
in the 1920s when Germany was picot
Western civilization sciences our
suburbs as a model
sanctity this ten years later but it's
changed its going back to a very
civilized place anyways the economy
again but comparative standard living
quite well that's the one Western
society that has maintained really well
functioning manufacturing base and
export economy and someone's of plenty
of favourable things to say shifting to
more than other most of the countries to
sustainable energy so a lot of a lot of
good things to say but it does want to
maintain the
the German financial and industrial
sector over euro as much as possible and
I think this was pure ice
policies which
I said I think it's policy this will
simply worship grasses you can't miss
the austerity to pursue the recession
which it needs growth not necessarily
good quarter to get out of the recession
in order to see that what you need is a
stimulus the dermis my hair resources to
stimulate the economy for them to be
borrowing from China Russia is far
greater resources but that we want to do
and that has to be a decision of the ECB
the leaders and so on and they're stuck
in a they have a
the mantra you have to keep inflation
below 2% because there
19:23 has any relevance and keeping
inflation there's no signs of inflation
but potential inflation isn't good for
bankers and investment firms and so on
so we got to make sure we have any
thread of that it is good for debtors
manufacturers so much about then also
we'll keep that policy will impose
greater austerity will reduce the
likelihood of the poorer countries
growing out of the recession which is
exactly what's happening there are
differences among them and Teresa's a
difficult problem that faced Spain it
was its financial situations quite
decent before the collapse of the
manufactured industry in fact it's it's
that pretty fast and that your space for
example didn't say important things like
simple automation of Health Services
very significant and management of both
space moral leaders technologically
it's a society but then it'll be
probably crushed but I think this is
part of the effort of basically German
financial sectors in first of all
expanding German influence but also I
think probably more significant my view
just finding a class war they never
liked the welfare state measures they
don't like the power of labor such as it
is and these are perfect ways to
undermine do you think that this
economic crisis since 2008 can't believe
it was some people pointed out to some
sort of the United States of Europe so
that this that the government Central
European government will become a
stronger and basically that sovereign to
your national states will be more
significant acknowledge in fact happen
to an extent so the shaming agreements
to reduce the sovereignty of individual
states and lead to a more civil society
and it's quite nice to be able
- Oscar without crossing borders many
other forms of integration like
educational cultural commercial we've
been very successful with it if the
world from that direction I think they'd
rather keep that idea but could be the
opposite in fact what's something very
unpleasant things are happening in
Europe and there's let's go back to
Germany I said in the 1920s it was the
peak of Western civilization maybe by
the 1930s it was kind of the depths of
human sympathy jewelled same culture
a lot of conflicting strange that's not
the ugly ones that are coming out
dramatically and Hungary pretty serious
we had Austria and through an extent the
rest
we have just if you could comment on the
current situation comes the cost of
Independence and there was Serbian
membership to EU just in December 2010
European Union denied Serbia's ageism
candidate and most of the people being
that it was German Germany who actually
vetoed the decision based on a result
Costabile issue what do you think could
be the final solution for that proposal
yeah there was a proposal back in the
90s by the Serbian his time as president
of the Yugoslav Federation coverture was
adjusted
he proposed a partition of Kosovo it's
time to make some sense but no nobody in
the United States and Europe or we
Saturday us will talk to Connor toasters
the us like who it is unimpressive as a
client state as I said
military base base reduce power your
posters will go along with something
like that I think so
can you do think that Serbia Kent State
isolated game these to you a lot better
closest system look it's very hard even
for a country like Greece to survive
Serbia is but I think Serbia is just
gonna be compelled in some fashion to
adapt to great power concentrations and
to recognize the defendants thank you so
much
