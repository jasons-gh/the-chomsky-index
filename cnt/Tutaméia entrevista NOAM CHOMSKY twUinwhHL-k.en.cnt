allah so very nice to see you
we want to begin asking you how are you
doing oh you are doing with this the
spirit so absurd in a way we're okay
pretty easy for us we live it out feel
the desert no people around it's easy to
be isolated enough how do you see the
situation in the big picture what what
do you think what are going to to see
what's the sea to the kind of the crisis
crisis is bigas 29 how do you see the
situation in a hole what all the
situation's quite serious it differs in
different countries the East Asian
countries who paid attention to the
information that China was providing
acted very quickly used test and trace
measures were able to contain it and
they're in reasonably good but of course
in a you know they're not isolated from
the world so they'll be affected by what
happens elsewhere and there so that by
no means over for them but it's at least
somewhat under control there's life the
economies the Europe wasted some time
they didn't pay much attention to the
information that was coming out of China
but most of them finally pretty much got
their acts together there are a couple
of countries that are simply where the
leadership is insisting on destroying
countries one lewton's of Brazil the
other ones the United States so the
United States is now because of the way
the when Washington ran it is no this
epicenter of the crisis globally many
more deaths than any other country
rising and the Trump is now acting to
increase the distal go into the details
Brazil it's just indescribable I mean
the well tell you about it because you
know more than I but it's it's as if
it's in another planet but of course it
will almost certainly get much worse
and unfortunately Brazil does have very
it does have very good medical system
even if the new health director probably
wants to dismantle it
research institutions like the Osvaldo
Cruz institution between the forefront
internationally if finding of
understanding what's happening what to
do about it I think we can expect with
some confidence that both snarl will
probably defund it it's too it's doing
too much good for the general population
that's nothing but art from the few
outliers like the United States and
Brazil the world is slowly managing to
deal with it it'll be serious crisis
it'll be very costly
what kind of world comes out of it is to
be determined now some are working on it
the the business world the right wing is
working quite hard to ensure that the
system that emerges will be very much
like the one that caused this except
harsher or brutal were profit and so on
just this harsher version of the
neoliberal assault which is what lies
behind the crisis that others have to
try to overcome that and Canada that's a
conflict that's taking place right now
and will become prominent as the virus
recedes
in the countries because other countries
it's going to continue to rage how do
you think this the actions of mr. Trump
can be explained because even that
governments that were in denial in
Europe like the UK government they
changed positions and in the States
Trump seems to be like his like I said
working in favor of the cry of the
crisis or working in favor of the enemy
well I did the crisis occur that well if
we want to stop the next pandemic which
is right down the road these are going
to keep coming each one more severe than
the last
prosody and the scientists know know
very well what it is and how to deal
with what we might unless we look at the
roots of the current crisis and try to
overcome them it's gonna be worse in the
future and the scientists today know
that they could be working on potential
vaccines for the crisis is going to come
and they also knew that in 2003 right
after the SARS epidemic was pretty
evident in scientific community that
another pandemic probably another
coronavirus pandemic will be coming down
the road and they could have prepared
for it but of course you know just to
know what's likely to happen is not
enough somebody has to pick up the ball
and run with it do something well who
can do the big drug companies have
plenty of resources they can do it but
they can't now because of something
called capitalism well there's no profit
in it okay so there's much more profit
in doing something that'll work tomorrow
than in preparing for a massive crisis
it's going to be catastrophic so we
begin with a fundamental failure of
capitalism it's built into the system
now it can be avoided by a kind of
regulated capitalism which the savagery
of capitalism is limited and mitigated
by control that's in fact the way most
of the world function from
the depression up until the 1980s when
Reagan or Thatcher inaugurated the new
and the old liberal programs
Reagan's inauguration speech Fuhrman is
the problem not the solution not sure
there's no society just individuals
thrown into the more this had a
devastating effect all over the world
but one of the effects is that in this
case the government couldn't step in our
to fulfill the gap that's left by the
unwillingness of course of the drug drug
company doing far get signals they when
I was a kid the polio was a terrifying
threat I can remember it very well
I was ended by a vaccine developed under
government programs no patents it
wouldn't talk was asked whether you
wanted things done none of that could
have been done starting in 2003 but the
government has hampered by the
neoliberal plague the doctrine that says
no everything has to be transferred to
the hands of private unaccountable
institutions the personal part of
neoliberalism is we must destroy all
democracy all of the government has a
flaw that it can be influenced by people
we don't want that if decisions are in
the hands of private power they're
unaccountable to the public for
everything's wonderful
they're tyrannies but that's okay you're
the greatest oh my tyranny as long as
it's in the right hands so the
government's is a second blow the old
liberalism which blocked the any
reaction that's more than that
neoliberalism means
things have to be ruined by a business
model for efficiency so hospitals can't
have an extra bit because that would be
inefficient plenty of people m1 in fact
can testify as to how these works in
normal times even at the best hospitals
in the world pretty far but if anything
goes wrong everything collapses so if
you're running an automobile
manufacturer and you is just on time
business models something goes wrong
okay assembly line doesn't work for you
go back you can't do that with the
health system
if you undermine and destroy the health
system make it very efficient by
neoliberal principles you're asking for
catastrophe
and then comes the question of
individual leaders leadership how
individual governments work on these
other things are backgrounds where
everyone under the neoliberal form of
capitalist a venturi but then you come
to individual governments take a look at
what happened
Trump's been in office for four years
through these four years he's steadily
defunded the health related aspects of
the Government Center for Disease
Control others of the u.s. in fact had
programs where US scientists were
working in China along with their
Chinese colleagues to try to prepare for
things like this Trump canceled them no
people's lives are extinct money for the
private so that's the funding hospitals
would be funded welfare system begins to
collapse the United States is not alone
in this that's true in New York through
wherever the neoliberalism had its
lethal grip
then these models who followed in your
decimated by austerity nevertheless some
countries did pay attention to what was
happening and it wasn't a secret it's
now conventional to blame China let's
blame somebody else for our crimes it's
normal but if you take a look at the
facts story's a little different
China informed the World Health
Organization on December 31st that they
were having pneumonia like symptoms with
unknown etiology a week later Chinese
scientists had figured it out there
except they had identified it as a
corona virus they've identified the
genome they provided all relevant
information divider ologists all
throughout the world World Health
Organization well some countries may
detention Taiwan South Korea Singapore
New Zealand a couple of others they
acted appropriately and they it's not
perfect they know of the situation
pretty much under control Europe didn't
pay much attention to these Asians
whether they know so they got into
trouble again they mostly have it in
hand the United States you want to you
want to see what the United with the
Trump administration was doing first of
all they were denying they were being
bombarded by US intelligence agencies
they help you as health specialist which
is what this is serious we have to do so
the Trump's only concern was to keep the
stock market by that will increase his
electability so you know it's just just
a cold
just flu what's not
the clown's fallen meanwhile people are
dying and demux growing steps are being
taken in mid-february
separate 10th the pandemic is ragin
Trump comes out with his budget for the
next year it's worth taking a look at
well continue to defund the Center for
Disease Control and other health related
parts of the government in fact be fund
anything that is of any assistance to
mere human beings but increase funding
for subsidies to fossil fuel companies
who are working to destroy the prospects
were organized human life on worth so we
therefore have to increase government
funding for them and of course for the
military which is already out of sight
and obviously for his famous wool to
keep the rapists and murderers from
Mexico from coming to commit genocide
against the white population so that's
the budget in the middle of the pandemic
finally by March something broke through
with the White House it was sort of do
something and of course it was
accompanied by Trump's announcing that
he was the first person in the world
know that it was academic because he's
so brilliant and then this gets echoed
on Fox News the next day saying the
president was the greatest genius in
human history was endemic though he
moved on from there that's very
interesting to see what's happening
right at this moment
Trump has figured out that's when he's
tried every way to cover up for the
crimes that he's committed so blame
China blame the World Health
Organization
that's getting kind of thin so his next
move which is brilliant is to tell the
governors of the state it's your problem
we can't help federal government can't
do anything okay Mitch McConnell the
Senate leaders its accomplice just
yesterday told the states but we can't
give you any money declare bankruptcy if
you want okay so tall you're a problem
we can't help have we happen of all the
resources but we can't help so if
anything goes wrong you can blame it on
the states if something by accident
happens to work the Trump can say look
I'm a genius and it's not only Americans
that the Trump administration is working
to kill its world Hawaii that people
don't talk about it much but what
happens when you DIF defund the World
Health Organization take funds away from
the wilfer World Health Organization and
take a look at Africa the World Health
Organization is the institution that's
working to save Africans from dread
diseases cholera diarrhea miscarriages
all kinds of problems
so what Trump is saying is we'll kill as
many of you as we like if it can improve
my election chances and there's not a
word of criticism about this you want to
do that okay who are they just a bunch
of black people I mean that's the world
you don't even hear criticism of this in
Europe you know the Godfather did it
okay that's the world and this is all
over the place I mean probably recalled
a year ago the Trump decided that the
Palestinian Authority wasn't treating
him nicely
he was offended so he canceled all US
aid to hospitals health services Gaza
were can barely be livable but there's
no criticism of that if the Godfather
wants to kill a lot of people who aren't
nice to him it's right you know that's
the world we're living in
in fact if you look further it's
remarkable
it takes a Europe that there's supposed
to be something called a European Union
remember that where people used to use
Union Germany's rich country richest
country in Europe doing pretty well
mines control things a couple of miles
south of the border northern Italy
center of a pandemic are they in any
help from Germany they are getting help
from Cuba as usual the one
internationalist country in the world so
they're getting help from Cuban doctors
who are supported by China which is
exporting first of all sending doctors
but also exporting a Tyrael that's
needed ventilators and so on so
fortunately Cuba and China over there
overcome the fact that the rich
countries in you that's also the world
religion it's you can see it every
minute today that yesterday Trump
announced that the u.s. that have the US
warships in the Gulf are being harassed
by the Iranian vote then
shoot him shoot him out of the water and
destroyed the good so right now is there
a background for this I mean why are you
riding in boats doing anything you ever
hear of the u.s. pulling out of the
treaty to deal with the nuclear weapons
u.s. pulled out wants to increase the
tensions and threats of war in the
Middle East Europe doesn't like it but
they're too intimidated by the United
States to do anything they could but you
have to be willing to stand up to the
bully in the White House Europe can't do
that they can make a few timid
statements that they can't do it I'll
say yes then you get increasing tensions
and we can praise trunk for not going to
war or just take what happened yesterday
though the Israeli government announced
that it's going to annex the parts of
the West Bank okay
Europe came out with statement saying
not a nice idea violates international
law you should do it
Mike Pompeo Secretary of State said so
this really issue it's not up to us
okay that's the law okay
the world is very much like the Mafia
where the Godfather happens to be a
sadistic - megalomaniac and everybody
else
cartels well - girls try to follow his
path like bull Sonora either walk in his
footsteps or belton fortunately there's
some who don't do it like Cuba it's
remarkable how similar in phrases and
actions of Busan are so narrow and how
similar are the phrases and actions of
Trump and Busan are even to the very
phrase well Elektra Molinaro said that
this was small food a grip is Ian and
like Trump mo senado said that the
governors and mayors of the cities would
have to take action and take
responsibility for what happened in the
country so have you ever been seen
watching what Boston are is doing in
Brazil and whatever you are your
opinions about you remember Karl Marx's
famous comment about history repeating
tragedy is force Trump as the tragedy
both knows the force following the
Masters footsteps with making a total
idiot of himself full he's doing it's
kind of amazing what happened in Brazil
just take a look at this century first
15 years of this century Brazil was one
of the most respected countries in the
world leader in world affairs
Lula so Salama rim were regarded as some
of the leading statesmen in the world
Brazil was a voice for the global South
was enormous praised for its internal
developments even from the international
financial institutions the World Bank in
2016
I had a review of the Brazilian economy
they said we've just gone through what
they called the golden decade unique in
Brazil's history huge number of people
lifted from poverty inclusiveness
bringing marginalized part of the
population which in fact is very near
the majority into the mainstream
positive programs going commodity prices
fell there was a problem but the bank
said these can be handled by pursuing
the right policies there's no deep
problem take a look now
Brazil is one of those ridiculed
countries in the world dismissed as a
joke the policies it's pursuing our
grotesque the and designed to make it
worse
take the economics or alligators
privatize everything okay make sure we
sell the country out to foreign
investors and the super-rich and there's
nothing left for the people that's
privatize everything now he hell's the
Pinochet regime he was in Chile during
those years working it's a great wonder
huge economic triumph he doesn't bother
telling you what happened
and what happened is that his neoliberal
Saints who had the perfect opportunity
first was notice that the perfect
opportunity to apply their theories
there couldn't be any protest because of
anybody protests he goes to the torture
chambers so they're quiet you get money
was pouring in from international
investors and the international
financial institutions to try to make it
work they try to kill me IND government
now they're pouring in money's the the
neoliberal heroes were smart enough not
to touch the main source of Chilean
wilth a highly efficient nationalized
copper company Fidelco nationalized very
efficient main source of Chile's income
so they forgot their principles long
enough to allow this to remain that
every imaginable advantage within five
years they had totally crushed the
economy the economy was in total
collapse in fact there were more the
state had more control over the economy
because I had to take it over then it
had under a ended
now people used to call this the Chicago
Road the socialism and finally handed it
back to the traditional you know cars
and ran the economy they've kind of
pulled it out mostly thanks to high
cover prices and you know their ability
to produce fruit for the US market in
the offseason a couple of other things
enormous inequality pension system
collapsing privatized pension system
schools collapsing huge protests all
over Chile right now that's the great
success that the Judas wants to bring to
Brazil okay he can succeed in making it
worse you know better than I was an
auto-fire the right-wing health minister
because he was talking some sense so
he's out the new one who came in is what
he said so far as the polling you may
even want to privatize the Brazilian
health system turn it into a catastrophe
like the United States normally
privatized for-profit system the
international scandal twice the costs of
comparable countries some of the worst
outcomes and totally unprepared for
anything like what's happening now
because of the that's the way privatized
for-profit systems work they don't want
to waste money to try to save people who
might be in trouble if anything goes
wrong that's not the way you increase
salaries for CEOs okay now a catastrophe
take a look at what's happening New York
these really heroic doctors and nurses
or working day and night to try to
contain a catastrophe they have to work
without equipment dangerous conditions
because the government was in the hands
of neoliberal fanatics the people like
the ones that were trying to turn Brazil
into
that's what we see right in front of us
I think secret so right there question
is how do you react well several ways
first of all we should remember that in
class war one of the sides is relentless
they never stop for a second the
business world is constantly fighting a
relentless class war and they're doing
it right now they're trying to create
the conditions for the post-crisis
systems and make sure it's an expansion
of the neoliberal plague which was very
good to them of course they made huge
profits even harsher than before with
more controls of the population and bear
in mind that that's perfectly consistent
with neoliberalism know there's a lot of
talk about Liberty and so on but the
neoliberals were always strongly in
favor of strong state intervention and
state violence to ensure that their
doctrines could be applied the Pinochet
dictatorship was an obvious case
Friedrich Hayek Milton Friedman all the
roads flocked down there they said it
was marvelous besting neighbors so I
said there's more Liberty under Pinochet
than there was a preceding dream that's
perfect forget those guys in the torture
chambers of being dropped out of
airplanes and we don't care about them
proper economic policies fulfillment
this goes back to the 1920s
neoliberalism has its roots in Austria
in the first world war first world war
period does Ludwig von Mises seminar the
Austrian proto-fascist government in
1928
smashed the labor unions violently
murdering lots of people crushed
Australian social democracy fund Mises
couldn't contain his authority they
thought this is wonderful but he was
writing that fascism is going to go down
in history as having saved human
civilization he joined the proto-fascist
government and look what they're doing
was fine they were protecting what he
called sound economics you can talk
about what that means but if you want to
kill a lot of people and instead fascism
that's fine as long as you do that
that's a lesson for today
the Neo liberals who are trying to
create the common theme society in the
future will be perfectly happy with
arbitrary state violence Muslim was it
achieves the end of maximizing the
wealth and power of private wealth
private corporations that nation for
everyone else all with nice words about
liberty and freedom just what we've seen
for the last 40 years to make it worse
but there are other forces our popular
fortunes are opposing this all over some
other mark just kind of self-help groups
that have emerged like in Brazil I mean
there's communities in Brazil and I'm in
again I feel funny telling you about it
because you know much would about the
night that they're just communities were
just people are starting to help each
other help bring food to the elderly the
most spectacular case that I know is the
favelas the government isn't doing
anything for them the crime gangs
stepped in to try to do something to
help whatever way you can and those
miserable conditions well there's things
like this are happening everywhere as I
mentioned the doctors and nurses are
just almost indescribable
there are major research institutions
like as well the coolest richer in the
forefront of working
to try to deal with this and there are
plans for going forward even on an
international scale this coming November
will be the founding meeting of the
calling of progressive international
that was initiated by the Bernie Sanders
in the United States and Yanis
varoufakis in Europe Navarre focuses the
center of the diem25 movement your
applied movement which is trying to
overcome the deep flaws of the European
Union while preserving the force of it
you're good very sound policies will
adopt into the area they're trying to
bring in the global South at the Forum
an International Union which will combat
the reactionary international which is
being formed in Washington right before
our eyes is very hard to find a Geo
strategic planning and the chaos of the
Trump administration but there is one
thing that stands out not much Trump
knows about it I don't know but it's
being clearly developed so reactionary
no an alliance of the most reactionary
States in the world
headed by the white house including both
Linares Brazil not a CC CC dictatorship
in each of the worst dictatorships in
Egypt's history the Gulf dictatorships
harsh brutal Islamist tators think join
the Israel right in the center of it
moving very far to the right nothing a
part of it the Modi's India Moody's
trying to destroy the last shreds of
Indian democracy to impose a Hindu
ultra-nationalist
crush Kashmir and so on so he's a
perfect member of a very close go to
Europe the Hungary your blood is turning
into the basically fascist States
beautifly the ilium of people like
salvini who wants to kill as many people
from Africa crossing the Mediterranean
as possible fleeing from horrible
conditions
kind of ironic in Italy was the first
major genocides of the 20th century were
carried out by Italy in Libya Maj Gen no
Italy is in the forefront of killing
people in the Mediterranean who were
fleeing from Libya a lot of things to
think about so salvini would be perfect
but other right-wing
ultra nationalist characters in the
world they can all join in this
reactionary international Brazilian
international will try to counter them
global organization well you look at the
level of state power it seems like
you're totally overmatched state powers
in the hands of the far-right but if you
look at the level of people around the
world way different they have most of
the populations with them now if we can
get to a stage where what people want
matters would be a very different world
and you can work on that at every moment
just the way the right-wing business
class is working on it for the other
interests at every moment if you leave
it to one side of class struggle and you
know what's going to happen but there
are actually two sides and the
populations of the world don't have to
be taken in by the right wing sadistic
demagogues they can act in their own
interests that's a possibility very much
like the 1930s in this respect my
childhood you know the memories would
come
the Depression was very serious and
there were a few ways out some countries
picked one way some pick the other one
way out was fascism the other way out
was social democracy in New Deal
liberalism well finally came to a major
war which in fact was won by the
Russians but in the West people don't
want to talk about that at the end of
the war at least for the West left
general popular mood of radical
democracy we don't want that old system
we want to move in the way of was gold
was radical democracy the business world
reacted very fast including the US
government on the British government the
Labour government instant you take a
look at men Britain in the United States
entered Europe in the South Italy first
Italy in Greece the first thing they had
to do was to crush the partisan
anti-nazi resistance and the incipient
social forms they had developed in
particular in northern Italy the
partisans had developed a functioning
worker based economic system worker
owned enterprises and so on that had to
be smashed brutally in Italy viciously
increased and you slogan right to
restore the old order that was the
important thing bring in fascist
collaborators but economy back in
traditional hands and crush the radical
democratic forces I was the first task
of Britain under the Labour government
and the United States in the New Deal
and those like the latter stages of the
war 1944 the rest of the world and it
was an effort to kind of build a
us-based international system which was
called an open system a meaning open to
penetration by us-based
capital and subject to us political
control some ways beneficial outcomes of
the ways pretty horrible ones but those
are the plans but the choice in the
1930s was fascism or some kind of
welfare state democracy not in countries
with different ways and in some ways
it's similar now there are other
respects in which had similar no I'm old
enough to remember the slogan of the
German Communist Party handed down by
Stalin everybody but us as a social
fascist we can't cooperate with him okay
so and Hitler isn't that bad a guy so
we're not going to collaborate with the
huge socialist parties not to try to
stop Hitler in the last free election
1932 the two major Left parties that
come as party to KPD social support in
the SPD outnumber the Nazis but they
didn't work together partly because of
the communist social fascist line partly
because the Socialists didn't want to
work with the Communists I'm seeing some
of that today too in the United States
for example there's a what's called an
ever Biden movement on the live saying
everybody doesn't matter if Trump gets
in because Ryan's a capitalist Pig so
let's get Trump and see the world
destroyed I mean I've been through this
over and over again in my life you may
remember in 1968 presidential election
pretty militant left at the time there
was a choice between Hubert Humphrey New
Deal liberal moving towards educating
the United States from Vietnam and
Richard Nixon I don't have to tell you
who he was
Humphries a capitalist Pig we can't vote
for him so that Nixon win and a couple
of million corpses in Indochina followed
but can't vote for cover this big no-no
history lives itself in very very
strange ways unpleasant ones but the
fact of the matter is that another four
years of Trump will be an unmitigated
disaster
the climate change is the major issue
barely being discussed but it's you know
we're gonna we'll overcome the corona
virus somehow great cost we're not going
to overcome other than a melting of the
Arctic ice caps and ice caps that's
gonna go on but the other harmful
effects like very harmful effects of
global warming or gonna go on at four
more years
Trump is of course in the lead of trying
to maximize the use of fossil fuels and
to destroy the environment as quickly as
possible I should say his the little
clown who's following him in Brazil is
doing the same thing current predictions
scientific articles predicted that in 15
years
2035 the Amazon is likely to shift from
being the net carbon sink absorbing
carbon from the atmosphere to being a
net carbon co2 producer it's a disaster
for Brazil and for the entire world but
who cares
it's more important for agribusiness and
mining to make some profits tomorrow so
let him destroy the Amazon which pretty
soon is going to turn into Savannah
you know thrush finished once it hits a
tipping point it just disappears but
that's a little bit like the
companies saying there's a catastrophe
coming down the road we don't make
profit from it
so you've had your friend Wilson ro and
Brazil his trunk was much more dangerous
because she was powers more dangerous
the rest of the world almost all of it
is trying to do something or other
throughout history Gunvalson are trying
to destroy it okay that's the main issue
there's another issue which almost
nobody talks about but it's just as
important we're racing towards terminal
nuclear war the Trump administration has
dismantled the beginning to dismantle
the last parts of the arms control
regime eliminated the Reagan Gorbachev
INF treaty which was protected us
somewhat from terminal the Open Skies
treaty which is from Eisenhower now
they're now trying to get this
announcing they're going to get rid of
that the New START treaty they're
finding all kind of ways to be evaded
interesting to look at the ways in the
time but Russia's pleading with the
United States to renew it Trump
administration saying though so let's I
mean there are people who are happy
about this with the arms manufacturers
are delighted massive great new
contracts for developing new means to
destroy everything maybe more contracts
on the hopeless effort to defend against
them so it's just a bonanza for the rest
of us it's a disaster anyone who's
looked at the history of the nuclear
period knows this kind of a miracle
we've gotten this far so let's make it
worse there's other things this is
specific to the United States the Trump
administration is working overnight to
stuff the judiciary at every level
Supreme Court down to the lower courts
with young far-right judges who
guarantee for another generation at
least nothing can be done nothing can be
implemented that's the least progressive
so no matter what the country wants will
be in the hands of Trump McConnell the
ultra rightists that's happening and it
goes on I mean we can see what it means
to the world but that's what we're
facing and so we have the same kind of
choice that was in the early 30s rather
similar forces personally their
interests the thirty conditions of the
Second World War you think we are facing
this kind of outcome awarded a robo war
and in what way this crisis can change
the balance of power
I don't think of global wars very likely
in fact it's a very safe prediction
there won't be no clear because
confidence that there won't be for very
simple we if we're wrong nobody's gonna
be around to cure so we're safe you know
however it's very likely well you know
the every year The Bulletin of Atomic
Scientists the main scientific journal
brings together scientists political
analysts to try to give an assessment of
the global security situation this kind
of symbolized and what they call the
Doomsday Clock
there's a clock which as a minute and a
certain distance from midnight midnight
means we're done you know goodbye nice
to have known this was started in 1947
right after the atom bombings and it's
oscillated over the years is there the
tenth trump years it's been moved closer
and closer to midnight
every year last year it reached the
closer to that ever been this year who
went beyond what has ever been
they abandoned minutes been turned to
seconds it's now a hundred seconds from
midnight and they gave three reasons
three they used to give to one reason is
the threat of nuclear war the other is
the threat of global warming now they've
added a third the deterioration of
democracy and that makes sense if
democracies collapse as is happening in
the United States and Brazil in Hungary
couple of the places there's no way to
counter the first two problems so that's
their assessment which i think is quite
reasonable so yes there could be a
terminal nuclear war we're getting
closer to eliminating these treaties is
of course that's us closer the United
States is not totally to blame for this
others over to the West has a very high
share of responsibility and also the
power to do something about it we have
the power to do this
of course it's much easier as this
happening in Brazil no to blame it on
everything on China no that's easy
the Hesburgh could blame everything on
the Jews but you can also try to look at
things realistically see what the
problems are then try to deal with we
can do that every single problem I
mentioned has solutions in hand nuclear
war the solutions of this reinstate
treaties reduce nuclear weapons in fact
if you really think about it get out of
the propaganda cocoon for a minute and
start to think there are major things
that can be done like take nuclear war
one of the real hotspots is the Middle
East Trump pulled out of the nuclear
agreement that considerably increases
the threat of nuclear war in the Middle
East is there a way it's claimed that
the Iran's nuclear potential nuclear
weapons are a threat fact of the matter
it's mostly a force but let's agree with
it let's say Iranian nuclear weapons
policies are a threat is there a way to
deal with and stop to think for one
minute it's a very easy way to deal with
establish the nuclear weapons free zone
in the Middle East
is that a problem certainly not with the
Arab states they have been pressuring
for it for 25 years
certainly not Iran they're strongly in
favor of it so they said great let's do
it there's not the g77 130 countries in
floor non-aligned countries strongly in
favor of that in your more or less and
support they'll talk about it much so
cracked all worlds in favor from one
state is called the United States every
time this comes up the u.s. in
international conferences us because
last one was Obama 2015 it's coming up
again and next January February its drop
selected Hillary to it okay why does the
United States veto the program which
would end any conceivable Iranian
nuclear threat again this time it takes
only 30 seconds to find the answer the
answer is Israel if you have a nuclear
weapons free zone the Israel's this
nuclear weapons establishment will have
to be inspected the US doesn't want them
in fact the u.s. does not even
officially concede that Israel has
nuclear weapons
and that's the reason they concede that
Israel has nuclear weapons you have to
cut off the military and economic aid in
Israel under US law okay
so therefore in order to protect
Israel's system of weapons of mass
destruction we have to face the likely
in the possible nuclear war turmoil and
destruction in the Middle East that's
the way the world works okay it's not
very hard to decode it's hidden and
nobody talks about it it's not the kind
of thing it's nice to talk about but
it's there then it doesn't take the
capacities of the quantum physicists to
see it it's right in front of
everybody's eyes as soon as you peel
away the thin layer of propaganda the
real are submitted to accept now this is
true in case after case to deal with
global warming they were very careful
studies detailed studies that conclude
very conclusively the unite in the
United States you could do this for a
fraction of the cost of mobilizing for
the second world war
okay it's not a huge problem but of
course you have to agree to do it not
rushed in the direction of maximizing
the thrill as Trump is doing today okay
and as there never Biden is on the left
or help me just lick the social fascists
as my child well that's the world we
live in we can do something about it we
solve by itself every problem is in
principle in hand and without utopian
solutions solutions even within the
framework of existing institutions and I
think this should be dismantled but
that's another story in fact there are
many other things that could be done
right now so you just take a look at oil
prices
very low for recently the oil companies
have been pleading with people to take
our oil what does that mean it means it
would be quite easy for the government
to take over the oil industry and then
dismantle them we don't want them
they're just destroying the world so who
wants a so climb up pay off the owners
though they don't deserve it and then
get rid of them and let's move on to a
sustainable world that can be done
there's numerous other things take some
very amazing just this morning for
example the Mitch McConnell Senate
leader who's the real evil genius behind
this he knows what he's doing he's not a
fool Mitch McConnell this morning
announced that the federal government
the stimulus that the federal government
is using is not going to go to States if
states don't have enough money to pay
police and firemen and schoolteachers
and so on and that's their problem
but as the way he put it is we're not
going to compensate the states for
making bad decisions in the past the bad
decisions were to give pensions to
working people and we're not going to
compensate the states for their bad
decisions that's with one hand with the
other hand we're going to pay off the
airline industries yeah exact amount
that they've spent in the last year's
rewarding themselves and their
executives with live acts that wasn't a
bad decision that was a good decision so
therefore we're going to pay them for it
and that's what's called neoliberalism
okay all across the board
every point you look you see the same
thing that's called class war by savage
brutal class warriors they know what
they're doing
clever on it and I can more or less get
away with it as long as others keep
quiet and so there is no way capitalism
can change with this this crisis we are
only going to see more capital is more
inequality what do you think it is you
can foresee some kind of change because
it's crisis excuse it pretty easy to
deal with also take stock buybacks which
is one of the ways in which the
corporations in rich rich investors and
management are they necessary they were
illegal until Reagan that was illegal
there weren't any cause the Treasury
Department enforced the law so you
couldn't do it but what about tax havens
tens of trillions of dollars in tax
seasons can that be stopped until Reagan
it was illegal there weren't any forever
Department enforced it isn't utopian to
say let's go back to the period before
Reagan when there was by no means of
paradise wasn't utopia but is it
impossible to imagine unraveling this
sadistic program of the past forty years
and going back to what there was before
of course we can go way beyond that but
right now if there was a government that
represented the population in the United
States instead of representing wealth
and corporate power but when they give a
stimulus when they hey if you decide to
pay off the airlines and the banks and
the other criminals have been enriching
themselves you decide okay we'll pay
them off you can put conditionalities
you get on into some industry you say
you have to commit yourself
no buybacks no tax havens workers on the
board of management the living wage the
cap on bonuses an end subsidizing fossil
fuel okay a lot of conditionality can
put in are they enforceable sure they
were enforced before a Reagan can be
enforced today that would make a big
difference without changing the
institutions I think they should be
changed too it's another story but you
can work for that while we deal with the
current crises including the huge crisis
that's right behind the coronavirus and
every global warming we can deal with it
but not if it's in this the world is in
the hands of sociopaths then we can but
but do you think that people are the
forces in the world
who believe that and then try to change
in the system actually can people be
organized to change to act and change
the system because we see have seen the
unions and the social movements are very
weak in many for many decades
you see the social forces capable to act
to change those things the social
movements able to act under the occator
she's actually not a little bit but not
but then they started to act and Brazil
reached its golden decade can happen
again I mean when the bull Senora hints
not such a subtle hint that you oughta
dismantle Congress and establishment is
a dictator and crowds mobilize critic
reaching for it other ones can be
mobilizing to denounce it not in a crowd
because they don't want to die from
fires but
two metres apart you can have a
demonstration like that yeah that can be
huge and you can do all sorts of other
things so sure this constant ways of
mobilizing not a but you have to be
willing to do it the way the workers
movement was able to do it in Brazil
into the dictatorship and the thing in
the beginning you talked about China do
you see any change in balancing in power
balance in the world is the power of the
United States in a way decreasing and
the China is rising
what do you see this in this global kind
of a mixed story
I mean China's rise from the overcoming
of poverty in China in the last 20 years
has been pretty spectacular actually
with all the faults of the Maoist era
the groundwork was laid then in rural
development programs oral health
programs and lots of others there are
things about China that you know here in
the rush of probably the flood of
propaganda so for example the compares a
China and India to the back in 1947
there were kind of similar powers
between 1947 and 1979 when China moves
in its new direction
China saved a hundred million people as
compared with India it's not a small
number 100 million people were saved in
China just by instituting health
measures development measures in the
countryside you don't hear much about
that but and that's including the
Chinese famine and everything else okay
finally finally you know by now there's
been economic successes rise from
poverty in the midst of a harsh
dictatorship with degrees of popular
control which were never reached in the
most totalitarian States and brutal
treatment of the Lakers in western China
and much ills
China has enormous internal problems
that the West doesn't have the
demographic problems ecological problems
the despite its rise and you know people
talk about the Chinese economy you look
at the economy per capita it's not that
great well if you look at other measures
like the UN has a Human Development
Index which takes many factors into
consideration
China's ranked about 90th in the world
at India around 120th so on the idea
that China and India are going to take
over the world is a little bit a lot of
internal problems won't rosy and the USS
Dayton is worried about it well the good
part of US policy school the Newark
first policy is to try to prevent
Chinese development to very cruel policy
let's prevent their development they're
developing two fists it's not a cruel
it's suicidal the China is in the lead
internationally in dealing with global
warming their emissions record is
terrible but they're in the forefront
they produce the majority of solar
panels high quality solar panels they're
way in the lead
same with wind turbines electrification
is far above any of all other countries
put together electric cars and so on so
I was trying to destroy it we should be
learning from them should be an
interconnected cooperative world we were
instead of harming other efforts to
we should be learning from them same is
true on say dealing with the pandemic I
mean us and Chinese scientists were
cooperating in China on working on these
things stopped why Trump pulled the u.s.
scientist out as little does that help
us
I mean we're following policies which in
order to harm others also happen to be
suicidal but good for short-term profits
of who could be but if you look at
globally us what's called soft power you
know the way you look at it and the way
people feel about it
country the u.s. soft power sharply
declining in the u.s. is probably the
most feared and hated country in the
world right now that's strong a couple
of years managed to destroy that just as
Wilson ro succeeded in destroying the
Brazil's they mentioned the world as
possible to do that but that's soft
power when the US says something
everybody has to agree we see that over
and over we saw it yesterday Israel
announced that it's planning to take
over to annex parts of the occupied
territories though the European Union
came out with a statement saying that's
not a nice thing to do you're violating
international law that we're not gonna
like you if you do that France made a
statement in Germany made statement the
United States made a statement Secretary
of State but they said it's none of our
business
it's an Israeli issue they can do what
they want what prevails the u.s. thing
do it everyone or Europe saying we're
unhappy about it okay that's an answer
the question will power lies in the
world same with the dismantling of the
run the trade agreement on nuclear
weapons the Trump administration decided
we don't like why because Obama did it
and anything Obama did within the office
is too sure that we were great men
that's basically the reason from the
point of view of security or anything
else it's ludicrous
York didn't like it in fact they hated
did they do anything about it
made a few comments things not nice it
goes ahead the Trump recently announced
what they call the deal of the century
in Israel fellas now the deal of the
century as everybody knows was written
by Benjamin Netanyahu and hand it over
to Trump's little baby-faced
son-in-law and he pronounced it suppose
China had produced a proposal for
Germany the France Russia anyway nobody
would even left this time immediately
everywhere Europe Latin America the
United States
it becomes the plan all the discussion
is is it going to work is it fair you
know too much of this but it's the plan
because it was announced by The
Godfather
okay well you look at military power by
the US is just so overwhelming that
oriented to talk about it and no other
country has a eight hundred million
bases all over the world troops fighting
everywhere take a look at sanctions do
you know any other country in the world
can impose sanctions u.s. has a third of
the world under sanctions everybody
sitting unless there's more than one not
and they're brutal harmful sanctions
very harmful Google hates them but does
it matter to take the sanctions on Cuba
basically a blockade of Cuba to try to
prevent it from development though
they've been on
sixty years does the world like the take
a look at the UN General Assembly every
year it comes up with the UN the vote
against the sanctions is overwhelming
last couple of years it's unanimous
Israel books with the United States of
course so Israel in the United States
opposed it everyone else opposes the
demand that at the end did everyone else
calls for what happens is it ended does
anyway even think of ending tickler
economic power economists usually
measured the purchasing power of crushed
GDP and loser measures but they're not
the only measures there's another
measure which is much more significant
in a world that's globalized under
capitalist framework how much wealth
world's will is owned by nation based
corporations so take the United States
how much of the world's wealth is in the
hands of us-based multinational 50%
spectacular number has never been
anything like that in history we look at
the separate categories finance
manufacturing agree to almost every one
US corporations are in the lead really
second nobody else in the enclosed I
mean the u.s. soft power is declining
but actual power is very deeply rooted
nobody else's clothes you know people
talk about trying to get off the dollar
which gives the u.s. an enormous
advantage let's talk about it it's not
happening you're not ready for China
like try to push it so I think
it's true that the u.s. is seriously
declining and of course is being
severely harmed by Trump just as Brazil
is being severely harmed by bull Sonora
but in the u.s. case the power so
enormous that it still remains of who
will you go back to the late 19th
century the US was by far the richest
country in the world
richer than other capitalist countries
put together it wasn't a major force in
world politics then I was second to
Britain but it was overwhelmingly
wealthy it has enormous advantages I
mean can you think of another country
where you can travel 3,000 miles and
think you think of in the same place
enormous with internal resources a
homogeneous population
you know this minorities but they in
assembling this tremendous tremendous
advantages over everyone else Brazil
could be like this go back to the 1920s
the business world was predicting that
Brazil would become what they called the
Colossus of the South the Colossus of
the north well for lots of internal
reasons in Brazil which would also go
through that didn't happen it was
beginning to happen under the Lula
government but then was beaten backed by
a right-wing Hailie - no but there's no
other countries that have that kind of
advantages
you still say that Trump is a tragedy
for the world and for the United States
nevertheless he can't be reelected this
year do you think this will happen or do
they have them Democrat strand is friend
to to overcome him to win the elections
it's not at all clear unfortunately he
might will win the election he if he can
manage notice that he's carrying out an
amazing scam he's got a group of adoring
followers who in fact he's harming in
every way he can think of you take a
look at the legislative programs almost
every program as a giveaway to the
extreme extreme wealth corporate power
harmful to his voting base but they
adore him and he's a clever politician
he knows that you can keep them in line
if you do two things one we went out
slowly on your savior I love you I'm the
only person working for you and on the
other hand you give them little gifts on
the side though about a quarter of the
population in the United States is
evangelical Christians large part of
trumps floating base so what you do is
say I'm opposed to abortion that's it
isn't slightest reason to believe it but
I'm opposed to abortion so I'll I'll
appoint judges who will ban abortion
I'll allow your mega preachers and your
preachers and the mega churches to get
involved in politics and violation
Constitution so I'll let you have that
and I'll give you a couple more gifts
like that
meanwhile I'll stab you in the back with
my social and economic policies and lead
the world to disaster how do you take
she Trump's bass if you look at it it's
mostly fairly affluent you know they're
not for no poor people very few work
with all the talk not much of a
working-class support but a relatively
affluent mostly petty bourgeois
population small store keepers and
insurance salesmen the world the
Christian traditional weights of white
supremacist and so on so I'll give them
things you know all the they like guns
I'll give them guns you know anything
that doesn't have any policy kind of fix
the Trump has turned this into an art
form the Republicans have been doing it
for years because they have to the
Republicans are the party of great
wealth and corporate power you can't
come to the voters and say please vote
for me I want to smash you in the face
this doesn't work so what they're forced
to do is pretend to be in support of
what a large part of the population
wants on so-called cultural issues and
when I say pretend I mean pretend we
know the history of this and the night
it starts with Nixon in the case of
Nixon this is the South was very racist
and segregations the Democrats supported
civil rights legislation the Nixon
realized we can get the southern vote by
being racists so that's the so-called
Southern Strategy there will be racist
we'll get the southern vote made a big
difference a couple of years later
Republican strategists realized that
they can get a large part of the
northern vote if they pretend to be
nattie abortion then they can get the
northern Catholic vote and the
evangelical vote
so they switched on a time you look back
earlier they were all pro-choice Reagan
when he was governor of California
passed strongest legislation ever in
support of women's rights choices but
when this revelation came all of them
Reagan the George HW Bush people
believed had some principle will the
rest of them quickly became advocates of
the ending abortion we can get votes
that way
and take a look at guns said are
interesting things and the United States
guns are a religion literally people
will fight to the death to have a garage
full of assault rifles that literally
I'm not joking
where did that come from we'll take a
look at it it came from the first great
public relations campaign in history in
the late 19th century after the Civil
War and when wars declined and in Europe
the gun manufacturers lost their market
I mean it was an agricultural countries
everybody had a gun but it was an
old-fashioned musket that you used to
drive a coyote's away they didn't want
the fancy stuff that the gun
manufacturers losing so they got a
brilliant idea let's invent a story
about the Wild West
another thing we also encountered and
euros old actually believed you know the
sheriff fist on the draw you know they
invented never anything like that
there was no Wild West Cowboys with the
dregs of the society and the guy who
couldn't get a job push cows around it
was all of this was invented a lot of
people fell for it like me when I was 10
years old my friends we'd play cowboys
and that's that sort of thing for a lot
of the public that became for the thing
that along comes the Supreme Court
most reactionary court in history maybe
modern history there was a case in 2008
where the court reversed a hundred years
of President on the Second Amendment you
read the Second Amendment in order to
maintain any will ordered militia of the
right to old or shall not be infringed
so the Supreme Court decided to cut out
the first phrase and say the right to
bear arms will not be infringed and
there was a very interesting decision
written by Antonin Antonia needs Scalia
this great scholar than leading
originalist we have to pay attention to
what the Founding Fathers is one that's
what we do we don't care what happens to
you read his judgment it's very
interesting it it's very scholarly you
know all kind of quotations from 17th
century in English law not one word
about why the founders wanted people to
have guns
not one word it's not a secret
first of all the United States had no
standing army and the British will be
the great power then so the British are
coming we don't have a standing army we
have to have malicious like the
Minutemen well that disappeared two
centuries ago well second reason we have
were slave-owning society we got to keep
the slaves under control virtually all
the founders are slave owners though
they were slaves revolutions going on
over all over the Caribbean so we need
guns to keep the slaves under control
the main one is the British were keeping
us from going over the Appalachian
Mountains they were keeping the
colonists stuck in the East Coast we
don't want the we want to invade and
exterminate the Indian nations and so we
need guns
the British were preventing the fact
that was one of the main reasons for the
Revolutionary War
not just settlers even great land
speculators like George Washington we
don't want to be stopped with it so we
need guns I have to go kill indeed
conquer their territory exterminate ok
those are the reasons see if you can
find a word about them in Scalia's
decision not for us that decision turned
the Second Amendment into Holy Writ if
you did a poll among Americans today and
ask him what's in the Constitution and
most of them would only know the Second
Amendment
you might try it but nobody knows
anything else just the second it's been
turned by amazing propaganda into a kind
of Holy Writ literally people are
willing to die for their right to
maintain a bunch of assault rifles well
then the Republicans pick that up and
say we work for you you can have it you
know you can carry assault worth when
the church we're for you that's the way
you keep the population under control
the other demagogues have done in their
own ways Hitler it's the Jews and the
Bolsheviks they're destroying
civilization we have to defend
civilization from them take Stalin's
counter-revolution what you want to
young kid you respect to the Republican
Party generally as they encourage that
way to the right basically have no
alternative 18 you talk about hate and
you said that you saw so much hate in
Brazil much more hate in Brazil than in
the United States
now some people are talking about
solidarity solidarity that this crisis
is bringing solidarity back you think
that that's change you can foresee
between hate and solidarity your
attendant early
you in 2018 you talk to us about hate
music do you hate you said that you saw
much more hate in Brazil that in New
Year in them in u.s. now some people are
talking about the the growing of
solidarity the crisis bring people
helping each other what do you think
about that hate and solidarity to for
it's kind of like the two forces we were
talking about before that's a kind of a
kind of a reflection of class conflict
is it in you know I'm not an expert on
this you know way more about it than I
do but the impression I have from a lot
of travel around the world spending time
in Latin America is that Latin American
dates are unusual in the class hatred I
mean you hear things from Brazilian Nate
leaks that no heroes were unless I go to
places of you know you're white
supremacists like condemning Lula
because he doesn't speak perfect
Portuguese it's just some kind of Indian
person doesn't deserve to be here
these people have to be humble and
they're supposed to be grateful for what
we give not climb beyond what they're
supposed to be
they don't hear things like that in most
countries it's there's a level of and
it's shown up in policy for white didn't
Brazil become the colossus of the self
well one reason is that Brazilian elites
basically have no responsibility in the
country know not to pay taxes they can
buy a home in the Riviera and I can send
their kids to Oxford nothing except for
they were rich mansion servants
that's all over a lot of Latin America
that still remained a kind of futile no
way
almost pre-capitalist culture we enrich
ourselves we take care of ourselves with
those other people are worthless now one
of the reasons they hated Lulu is he was
sort of changed it now one of these is
Indians doing in the university there
was this domestic servant thing but
there's nothing novel about that it's
just extreme in Brazil so you go back to
the second First World War
Woodrow Wilson leading liberal than his
Secretary of State Robert Lansing along
with the West general were called by the
Bolshevik Revolution why because it was
going to lead to the ignorant and stupid
masses taking over the world
we can't have that it means as well the
way Wilson put it himself is he heard
that with Negro soldiers coming back
from Europe you're hearing all sorts of
things about we would have rights
there are even Negroes laundresses who
are saying we ought to be paid a decent
wage now we can't have that kind of
fitna so we have to smash the Bolshevik
Revolution before it starts okay the
attitudes are not unique to Brazil but
they're amplified
my impression is you hear a lot more of
an American in fact if you look at you
compare Brazil with East Asia
why did East Asia develop and Latin
America didn't the Latin America has
enormous advantages the East Asia
doesn't have for one thing most there's
no international threats secured totally
secure East Asia certainly wasn't awards
resources
Latin America has an East Asian doesn't
what happened you look at these station
development programs the left-half
central no the import capital goods they
target investment so it will contribute
to development
well you look at Latin America import
luxury goods for the rich export capital
you know so commodities don't try to
drill it's not 100 percent saying that
but it's a substantial difference not
over time it matters now these are all
things that couldn't be changed they
started to change
not enough little could have done a lot
more that they did start to change I
really have to get another your message
to Brazil a message Brazilians take your
future into your own hands in trouble
