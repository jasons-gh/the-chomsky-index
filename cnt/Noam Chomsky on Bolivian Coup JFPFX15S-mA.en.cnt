so you made a public statement along
with Vijay Prashad about what's going on
in Bolivia and you use you called what
what the resignation of Brunel Saku why
is it important that we call it what
happened to ku well I should clarify him
it's Vijay's statement I was one of the
signers with some reservations actually
but you know when they publish these
things they often put it as my statement
but it's really his statement this was
before what happened and at that point
it wasn't obvious whether it was a coup
now it's obvious and when the military
comes out in the streets and tells the
president you're finished start shooting
people and so on that's good in fact
Bolivians by and large don't have
weapons so when there's an attack on the
presidential palace with weapons you
know a little military's behind it so I
think it's quite important to call it
what it was a military and with the
backing of the I meant Bolivia sort of
split between a indigenous majority up
in the hills mostly in the rich mostly
white the population of the lowlands
there's other splits within the
indigenous community and it has some
complexity I mean Morales was originally
very strongly supported by the
indigenous community if he had left
office in January he'd be treated like
these guys I'm hero but his decision to
run for office again was contentious
and he had also 2012 carried out
infrastructure programs that were pretty
strongly opposed by large parts of the
indigenous community so he had lost some
of the support and it was split but
that's no justification for a military
coup yeah the the OAS want us for us to
condemn the most recent election as
illegitimate do you think isn't evidence
to make that accusation well I'll tell
you there's a very good article on that
by a very good economist Mark Weisbrot
from the Center for Economic and Policy
Research you can look it up www SC C EPR
net they did a careful analysis of the
vote and the OAS report and I think he
shows pretty convincingly that the OAS
had absolutely no evidence the OAS is
pretty much an instrument of the United
States is there any ways other than
through the OAS that the US has
influenced Bolivia and an intervened
well you know I don't think it was a CIA
Coombs internal nobody can hold it the
United States was just too powerful now
of course he was openly supported it
there's no question about that
