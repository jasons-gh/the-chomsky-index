that's it austerity is a great device
for shattering the economy dismantling
the welfare state and increasing class
power weakening believer movement so on
so it's a good policy for them in that
sense it'll work it is a disaster for
the economy what's happened in England
is good example but and it's not a
surprise in fact right in the middle of
these austerity programs the
International Monetary Fund came out
with a study reviewing I think maybe a
couple hundred cases of efforts to
impose austerity during stagnation and
recession and they're all they'll also
always have the same effect
it makes the crisis worse it makes it
harder to pay off debt what's needed is
to stimulate growth and I think by now
Europe's finally beginning to recognize
that to an extent the ECB is taking some
steps to try to deal with what's plainly
the core problem lack of demand which
requires intervention the US has a
somewhat better record than Europe on
this respect that's why there's very
slow virtually stagnant but slow growth
in the United States while this
continued decline in Europe the stimulus
there was a small stimulus in the u.s.
it had to be kept small because there's
a lot of business another opposition to
it
and the Republicans are totally against
it but there was a small stimulus that
actually actually amounted to about zero
the stimulus was approximately identical
to the reduction in state and local
spending so essentially was flat
nevertheless it saved a couple million
jobs it should be expanded and renewed
but the political system which is in in
the hands primarily of financial
institutions just won't permit it and
there is a it's not a political party
anymore the Republicans used to be a
party there now some other kind of
organization which acts in lockstep
uniformity with a catechism and has only
two policies one is to block anything
that the Democrats try to implement just
try to block it and the other is to
serve the interests of the extreme of
extreme wealth and corporate power with
actually a abject servitude of course
you can't get votes that way so
therefore they've had to mobilize and
sectors of the population which have
always been there but haven't have
rarely been politically organized before
the Christian Right which is enormous in
the United States extremely religious
country nativists who are afraid of
everything they want to make sure they
have the guns and so on and other not
very palatable sectors so that's their
voting base that's why you had the witch
he saw in the and the Republican
primaries which are kind of a scandal of
the world but it's almost automatically
when one political organization
undertakes policies which can't possibly
get any public support there's nothing
to do but try to get support that way
but given that kind of dual policy block
anything that the Democrats try to do
and serve the rich in the corporate
sector very hard to get a stimulus
through and I think it could be done but
it would require that Obama used the
power of the presidency what's called
the bully pulpit try to mobilize popular
support he's been totally unwilling to
do that on any issue so there is a small
stimulus the Federal Reserve has taken
small acts to try to stimulate the
economy which have been successful
insofar as they've been carried out but
are much limited and in Europe is the
other way it's been mostly austerity
which just drives the
we don't
