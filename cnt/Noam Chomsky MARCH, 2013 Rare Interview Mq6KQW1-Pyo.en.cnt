this is good I mean you know this you
look at the arc
movements I think there's a kind of two
major streams that I think are both
important one is kind of policy oriented
so we should do something about radical
inequality you know we should have a
financial transaction tax or take away
corporate personhood and fix up campaign
finance and there's a lot of quite
constructive sensible suggestions on the
policies affect the other part which I
think may be more important that's just
forming communities I mean this is a
very atomized society people really are
alone I think some of the attractiveness
of the social media you know Facebook
everybody's got to talk about themselves
on facebook it's just there are any
communities you don't talk dear friend
you know your neighbors or something
like that and the internet kind of
community is sort of anonymous so you
can kind of feel I'm not I'm really
alone even if I'm writing about my date
last night you know they get a lot of
exhibitionism in the Facebook culture
that people wouldn't do privately a must
a very intimate friend and it's a partly
I think a reflection of the kind of
alienation that's imposed on the society
people really are alone it just didn't
just happen i'm in a massive efforts to
create this the best way to control
people's isolate them atomized them that
make them try to drive them to be
concerned just with themselves not
anything else and the Accu pie movements
without planning to just kind of broke
out of that they did create that people
naturally interact that way to have an
opportunity and when people can urged
and scotty park or GUI flies it down
here or wherever it might be they just
quickly formed communities of mutual
support and solidarity and helping one
another and participating you know
library its kind of striking that when
Bloomberg sent the troops in to break it
up one of the first things they did was
destroy the library I they destroyed
thousands of Brooks and I think that's
more than symbolic didn't have to
destroy the books that's essentially
telling people or you can't do anything
by yourself you want to have a library
we're going to run it for you same with
the health services and community
kitchens and everything else that's
really threatening because that does
help people break out of isolation and
recognize that you don't have to accept
subordination that going back to the
woman's move it again that's pretty much
the way it started it started with very
small consciousness-raising groups small
groups people will just talk to each
other about depression that everybody
felt for paper and regarded as anything
other than the normal life yeah that's
what life is when you can talk to other
people and you can see it's not a things
have to be we can do something friesen
it can spread very quickly and the civil
rights and it was kind of the same you
know it started of course it goes on in
fact young century has deep roots but in
the really modern period say since the
sixties it started with small individual
acts like a couple of kids sitting at a
lunch counter in Greensboro getting
arrested and hauled off next aid a
larger group came in the freezer you
hadn't Freedom Riders snick was formed
recently had a big popular movement
you
well you know full popular movements
have something in common but they are
pretty different now the Paris Commune
took over to tip over and grand the city
long as you want to find a certain kind
of a parallel in American history it
would be I think more like what happened
in western Pennsylvania in the latter
part of the 19th century when like in
homestead where they were with the mills
of the mines and so on this very
powerful of workers movement at the time
and they essentially to come over these
were worker run communities and in fact
the state had they call in the National
Guard to destroy them it wasn't easy
another parallel to the occupy movement
which I don't know I don't know how well
it's known is a resurrection city I
don't have anybody talks about that but
it's quite significant if you look at
you take the history of the civil rights
movement in the United States save
Martin Luther King great figure but look
at what happened to King I mean if you
listen to the speeches on martin luther
king day they typically and enthusiastic
rhetoric ends in 1963 with his I have a
dream speech he gave another I have a
dream speech a very eloquent one it was
the evening he was assassinated in
Memphis Tennessee and he was there to
support a sanitation workers strike and
it was on his way to Washington to try
to organize it for people's movement he
the speech was you know how to cut
biblical overtones the kind of used and
it it's it was basically the theme was
I'm yeah I'm I can see the promised land
say them from I like Moses I can see the
promised land I know I'm not going to
get there but you will get there and the
promise land that he was talking about
was not the right
vote it was rights for poor people he
was concerned about life in the slums
you know the refreshing look for
generally I mean it's now race class or
kind of correlated that were heavily
black but just laugh lady mean and then
he was killed and the four people they
especially in march from Memphis to
Washington at Coretta King his wife as
widow led the march and they went
through orbitz embattled places in the
south you know Birmingham and Selma and
so on they ended up in Washington they
set up a tent city in Washington
resurrection city where it was going to
be the base for approaching Congress to
try to get some legislation which would
deal with a plight of poor people well
Congress which was most liberal Congress
in American history I called the police
and came in in the middle of the night
smashed up the camp and drove them out
of the city that's resurrection city you
know tent city but because as far as
northern liberals were concerned if you
wanted to denounce racist Alabama
sheriff's that was fine but don't come
near us
it's pretty routine so for example in
the 60s in the anti-war movement every
group but it wasn't really or you know a
lot of separate groups all over the
place but they all had to learn some
lesson one lesson that they had to learn
pretty quickly is that if there's
somebody in the group who's dressed like
a Hollywood version of a hippie you know
and who's shouting off the cops or with
sprigs and windows or whatever you're
very likely to see him in court
testifying for the police because that's
their job you know try to turn activism
to something that will alienate the
public and you know break the wall on
give you grounds for refreshing so
they're all over I mean I was involved
with groups that were dealing with
resistance so young deserters and people
like that but we quickly learned that if
there's something really sensitive we
can't do it in a group we have to do an
affinity group if somebody's life is at
stake you know all right because this
chances are there's somebody around is
an informant and you know that's what
police do movement you can tell by
taking a look at the FBI cases they've
just been coming up with the terrorism
cases they're almost all in traffic you
know somebody joins gets in contact with
a bunch of guys who kind of loose ends
don't know what they're doing and
confused and suggest something to them
offer them some money at president
they're trying to have stuff at a fake
bombs i'm wearing dear restaurants are
almost to do
you
that's the right question
is why doesn't everybody do it because I
think people would just do it naturally
no you look around you do you you drive
them you know you drive to work there's
a homeless person asking for money you
know somebody else this guy doesn't have
a job you know the poverty everywhere
people spend hit you could go past the
hospital people crowding to the
emergency rooms as I can see the back
there you know and then you look at the
rest of the world not just rich areas
like this and it's that's shocking you
know since people are exposed to it I
think just automatic and i happen to be
exposed to as a child and I grew up in
her depression so people knocking on the
door for me to sell rags and things with
her
you
lots of ways to do it in fact you know
99 percent one percent wasn't in the
media a year ago now it's a routine
discussion if people are thinking about
things in a different way than they did
before just in a very few months of the
Occupy movement actually there's some
polls on it which maybe you've seen
there was a like a pupil which asked
people who has been asking people with
various times what do you think about
inequality and concern over inequality
shut up very fast after September just
from the effect of I assume it's the
effect of the Occupy movement which has
just permeated a lot of mainstream
discourse now that can be co-opting too
you know so sure powerful systems will
try to incorporate what they see is
working and turn it to their own needs
whether it's human rights or you name it
of course that's what they'll try to do
so for example after be two thousand
eight election which generated a lot of
enthusiasm or there was a right after
the election there was a annual
conference of the advertisers
association whatever they call
themselves and every year they give a
prize for the best marketing campaign of
the year and that year they gave it to
Obama he beat out Apple computers and if
you take a look at the business press
right afterwards which was interesting
they quoting a executive CEOs and so on
they're very excited about it they said
this is a new model for how we can
behave in the Republican in the
boardroom and so on we can use this
model that worked so well at deluding
people in the two thousand eight
election for sure no they don't i ran it
but they learn lessons from it the use
of human rights is quite an interesting
case but it's true of just like takes
eight there was a huge anti-nuclear
movement in the early 1980s it was like
80 huge them
erations millions of people try to get
rid of nuclear weapons and the Reagan
administration cleverly co-opted it they
came out and said yeah great idea were
all with you against nuclear weapons
let's have Star Wars that's how they got
the Star Wars thing through when they
defuse the movement made it sound as if
it was opposed to nuclear weapons of
course we know it was but there's of
course they would have even and can you
change the discourse sure I mean I don't
know what I mentioned about the meeting
with Lou body but we were quoting from
but it was kind of interesting so for
example what this was before he was
elected and he was quite popular his if
you looked at opinion polls he was
highest in the opinion polls but he
never won an election mostly it was
because they were both corruption you
know the election was bought off the
last minute is a huge flood of
propaganda in on advertising and so on
but I asked not run for it did he think
he ever would be able to win an election
if there wasn't corruption insulin he
said he didn't think would be possible
and the reason was he said he probably
says I know the mentality of the peasant
that's what I come from and when they go
into the voting booth and they ask
themselves it could somebody like me run
a country they'll say no has to be one
of those rich white goods so even if
they want me they're going to flip for
those other people a couple years later
he won the ninth already changed and
it's changed all over Latin America
indigenous people really you know for
fee for it's just a radical change so of
course it can be done and I the kind of
thing that he took me to see in the
suburb which you mentioned this is one
of the ways in which could be done and
they're funny love I'm in the in Bolivia
the around the same time about 10 years
ago be mobilization on the effort to
privatize water are led to a real
revolution in the country the first time
hundreds of years that the indigenous
population has been able to enter the
political arena and take over political
power that's it's kind of interesting
the way that governments are reacting
the governments and corporations still
want to privatize water but they learn
that the Bolivian method is a dangerous
because it led to a practically a
revolution they threw out the big
corporations and so on so with that was
in southern Colombia recently visiting
the villages and there they what the
government of Colombia is apparently
trying to do is to pick the villages off
for the region's off one at a time so if
you come into some for remote danger
villages and you give them a line about
how great the water will be if we just
don't buy your land up there where the
virgin forest is we can maybe get them
to accept it or a strikingly they're
resisting organizing and resisting but
these things that class with some of my
view the rich and powerful class were
never stops it's permanent they're
involved in a constant bitter class war
very self-conscious they want everybody
else not to practice our faith but
they're always taking for carrying it
out that's why they're rich and powerful
you
the fact of the matter is we can do just
about anything all right with all people
like us let's say we wouldn't be here
otherwise are pretty privileged and we
have the kind of privilege a few people
have ever had in history or have now and
if you have privilege you have
opportunities and the opportunities are
almost boundless I mean thanks to the
struggles of the past it hasn't always
been like this but thanks to the
struggles in the past there's a
tremendous amount of freedom I mean the
state may try to repress you but they
can't do a lot now making past the NDAA
let's say but they can't really
implement it against the will of the
population and it looked at it there's a
lot of I think there's a lot of
excessive concern in activist groups
about state repression it's not that's
not there sure they'd like to do it but
first what's always been there and it's
just kind of inherent than none of their
power systems and it's much weaker than
it used to be so it takes a you would be
there's this paranoia about
concentration camps you know they're
going to rock us up ndaa says they can
detain us indefinitely concentration
camps have been there since the 50s back
in the 1950s the Liberal Democrats
Humphrey and laymen introduced
legislation to set up the internment
camps in case people got out of control
I never followed to see what happened
but no the legislation was best but they
can't do anything about it I mean Madame
takes a surveillance systems okay they
shouldn't have systems we shouldn't
tolerate systems where everything you
say get sent to a central computer
massive supercomputer in Utah they need
to dissonant but if they have that data
where they going to do it I mean you
know nothing exactly give you
experiences with the FBI from resistance
days you can't do anything with it and
this they try though arouse
popular reaction so power really is in
the hands of governed if they're willing
to use it and so what can we do given
that we're people with privilege we have
an enormous number of things you can do
and there may be efforts to shack up or
something that you're not going to be a
center of them have your brains run out
it's not like El Salvador
I think kids are ready for it they just
have to pay attention that most most
people just don't pay attention either
because they think I range hopeless I
mean it's kind of driven into your heads
that everything is hopeless there's
nothing you can do to the powers are too
great you know and in fact the sense of
hopelessness in the country is
astonishing so for example you look at
polls over half the population thinks
that Congress ought to be totally thrown
out and replaced by your neighbors and
you know we'll do a better job approval
Congress's and single digits nobody
thinks I can do anything about it and
it's like these peasants and Brazil you
know how can somebody like me do
anything about it in fact some some it
take a look at some of the year then
takes a the 911 movement which is kind
of interesting not the content but just
the phenomenon you know the bush blew up
World Trade Center that kind of thing it
appeals but it has a sympathy at least
of forget the numbers I think it's about
a third of the population a huge part of
the population that means that a large
part of the population is willing to
accept the possibility that we're run by
a bunch of homicidal maniacs are trying
to murder as well but they don't think
they can do anything about it so I'll
lift a finger to do anything okay it's
way it is will I hide in the corner and
wait till it happened but when people
are kind of a what does the most
effective the kinds of compass
propaganda are the kinds that allow you
to see what's going on so you see 99
percent 1% the field I can't do anything
about it I'm not isolated alone I don't
talk to anybody people like me can't do
anything we're just we just have to
suffer there that's really effective
propaganda that's the way yeah that's
how slavery could last forever without
many slave rebellions
it's how women were refreshed so I take
say my grandmother's generation if my
grandmother had been asked if she's
oppressed she would have even known what
you're talking about that's life you
know room in her doormat that's life you
get to my mother's generation still
plenty of oppression but and she was
bitter about it but didn't think you
could do anything about my time you get
through today it's quite different
that's very much like for pheasants and
Brazil or the indigenous people in
Bolivia or you know the blacks in the
south after the early days of the civil
rights movement yeah we can do something
about it even if it's brutal and harsh
and we might get killed we can do some
you know it's that that transition is
very good and I think when you get back
to your question for a lot of young
people I think it's you know it's called
apathy but I suspect it's more
hopelessness powerlessness and people
can learn you're not powerless just take
a look at what's been done and take a
look what other people have done under
much harsher conditions in your lower
face and what's been done room right
here in your own country aren't you know
the 60s really did civilize the country
and it's a very different country from
what it was in 1960 and it's just it's
many young people just didn't give up
and didn't feel okay we can't do
anything actually sometimes it's kind of
dramatic like four years word what's
called McCarthyism which did intimidate
people tremendously I'm remember I lived
through it and people were just scared
out of their wit's if it the rain the
house on American Activities Committee
if people are cold they just trembled in
fear or what you do but in the 1960s
that feel like Abbie Hoffman I started
just making fun of them and they
collapsed
it's a very thin structure of power I
mean as soon as you submitted the
ridicule or you dismisses it if can
collapse and this has been understood
for centuries so you go back to say
David Hume who was not one of the great
founders of classical liberalism great
philosopher but he wrote to Brooklyn
Corbin I think it's call the foundations
of the theory of government or something
like that and in it he poses a kind of a
paradox he says in every society whether
it's you know the feudal dictatorship
military dictatorship of parliament semi
parliamentary system like England
whatever it is he says power is always
in the hands of the governed those were
voter being ruled ours always in their
hands so how come they just don't
overthrow the rulers I don't take things
for themselves this is well the secret
pieces always every society's control of
opinion and attitude if you can convince
people if the powerful can convince
people you just your you have to stay in
your slot that's where you belong and
that's no that's your role in life
there's nothing to be changed and then
the rulers can control them and you take
a look at the history of revolutions of
significant changes it's when people
broke out of it so not long before him
and he may have had this in mind in
England and century before it was a
major conflict between Parliament the
King the problem interrupt is basically
the bourgeoisie and landowners and so it
wasn't for general population and the
question is is the king of over the law
King Charles and sister that he was road
for Laura the parliament member jurists
and others were saying on Magna Carta
determined that the king is subject to
the law to the to the time the nose
oil and it really made her come to that
effect was later led to him soon led to
the brutal civil war I but that part of
it stuck it out and compelled the King
to sign something conceding that he was
not about the wrong he was for the
desert there's very few type at that
time the king was regarded a
representative of God and you didn't
fiddle around with God you know it's
serious business so the was essentially
standing up against a kind of divine
authority our society that meant
something that and breakthrough that was
very difficult but they did that led to
constitutional parliament not going to a
parliamentary monarchy which is
different from filmography
