we're now approaching the 800th
anniversary of Magna Carta unfortunately
it will not be a celebration more likely
a morning Magna Carta though limited
nevertheless had important steps forward
it established the concept of
presumption of innocence and due process
in what became anglo-american law in
limited ways but nevertheless of some
significance expanded over the years
it's by now an important part of the
even international legal system up until
recently that we're now in a period of
regression where the concept has been
virtually eviscerated so for example the
President Obama's drone campaign defines
guilty as targeted for assassination by
the US government defines due process as
discussion in the executive branch
branch I'm not making that up that's
official and there's many other cases
the point is that the powerful do seek
to protect themselves one of the ways
they seek to protect themselves is by
massive surveillance of the population
that of course goes way back but it
reached its modern form with the US
invasion of the Philippines early 20th
century after the invasion which killed
a couple hundred thousand people it was
necessary to undermine and destroy the
nationalist movement which and the
remnants of it that persisted and the
u.s. instituted a extensive technique of
surveillance of the population using the
highest
that was available in the day I was able
to develop a system which allowed the
conquerors to undermine destroy
eliminate the residues of the
nationalist movement that had resisted
the American invasion actually the
residue of that traces that continued
until the present day those methods were
quickly applied at home in the usual
manner they were part of Woodrow
Wilson's Red Scare the harshest
repression that's taken place in the
United States same methods were used
repeatedly in the future more advanced
after the US overthrow of the democratic
government of Guatemala 1954 extensive
surveillance was techniques were
developed which facilitated the
operation of the death squads other
modes of repression which have turned
Guatemala into a total catastrophe up
until the present similar methods were
used in 1963 overthrow military coup
which overthrew the independent
government of Iraq CIA was enable able
to provide detailed information for the
coup regime which incidentally brought
Saddam Hussein into a significant role
to murder and eliminate the dissidents
and so it continues the most extreme
case of it is the huge NSA surveillance
system which was revealed mostly by
Edward Snowden and of course there are
counterparts in the private sector with
extensive surveillance being carried out
by the major in corporations what is the
motive
the motive is that systems of power
typically regard populations including
their own population as an enemy which
has to be controlled that's
understandable in conquered countries
like say the Philippines or Guatemala
you could slaughter them in the domestic
population in the more free and
democratic societies you can't slaughter
them but there's still a problem the
reason is that according to mainstream
democratic theory even at its liberal
end of the population or what are called
ignorant and metals and outsiders who
have to be spectators not participants
and you have to know a lot about them to
make sure that they remain marginalized
extensive surveillance is one of the
techniques that's used for that it makes
it possible to go after and undermine
sectors of the population that might try
to break out of the spectator role and
become active in the political system
and which in ways the powers powerful
systems don't want and it's been used
over and over time to run through the
record here and will be in the future
it's not irresistible especially in the
more free and democratic societies there
are ample means open to undermine and
dismantle this system of control and the
surveillance of provision domination but
it's a hard task and it takes energy and
dedication but that's the task that free
and independent citizens who value their
rights who value freedom must undertake
