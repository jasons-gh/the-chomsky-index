anyway mr. Chomsky thanks very much to
accepting this interview for focus
magazine I would like to focus this talk
if you agree on how our social
organization could change in the future
and what we all can do personally to
help this change to turn out to be
beneficial for our self I think if you
look over history the he the
nation-state and the contemporary
formless and mostly a European invention
and it was imposed in Europe with
extreme savagery Europe was the most
savage region of the world for centuries
were all the nation states were being
formed in the 17th century for example
in the 30 years of war probably 40% of
the population of Germany was white and
it's just been one horrible war after
another the reason is that nation-states
are just not well adapted to the
character of the populations so culture
language social interactions and so on
we're molded into a form that is alien
to most people a citizen but so there's
a complicated set of conditions people
both is it the strong sense of fear of
international organizations and taking
away our sovereignty and our rights on
the other hand there's support for them
it goes along at the same time yeah but
it's three because in Europe we doesn't
feel that we don't feel that that's
nothing like I mean it's a completely
different I mean Europe a lot of
European countries really likes to be
part of something bigger because yeah
maybe the politician are scared about
losing the power but not the people
because it's really keen um going
through the you know the Europeans is an
unusual Society it didn't develop the
way he did I mean European societies
developed out of existing
feudal societies monarchies and so on
yep they didn't wipe out the indigenous
population or start over the United
States is a blank slate yeah so do you
see in the future some alternative on
our you know present social organization
social work yeah you you you wrote about
a lot a lot more I think there are
significant alternatives there my
opinion at least there they should be
they're not utopian they're they should
be eminently implemented in
manufacturing industry that joblessness
in the United States is at the level of
the Great Depression
about one out of six workers is
unemployed and furthermore it also
points out they're not going to go back
to jobs because the manufacturing system
is being all about outsourced as a short
and so on and the counterpart to that is
that the financial institutions are now
approximately a third of the economy
gross domestic product if you go back to
city 35 years there were maybe three
percenters now so these are parallel
phenomena and they one consequent aspect
of them is that they're kind of what we
call middle-class life by home buy a car
working people enjoyed this
disappearance and this leads to a
society with extreme internal tensions
which couldn't blow up and pretty ugly
ways you can see signs of it at the same
time the manufacturing industries which
could very well work produce it are
being dismantled and that doesn't mean
just shipping factories of roll out it
also means destroying communities
families the workforce and so on well
there is an alternative in say in one of
the manufacturing communities the
workforce and the community could take
over the factories there's nothing in
economics that tells me that's
impossible okay that would both
reconstruct the industrial economy and
provide what is what the country
desperately needs is like high-speed
rail for example it wouldn't be as
profitable for the banks and therefore
it's not even it's not even on it's not
on the agenda and the consciousness that
you can take over your life and do
something with it
is out of people's minds I'm the extent
to which this has disappeared is pretty
striking
you know our readers and myself to you
they probably wonder what they can do /
still do I mean what we can do
personally to double this globalization
it's a kind of revolution or at least
for somebody I mean where somebody was a
revolution was a big growth for the
corporation for for the the financial
powers how to turn it out as a personal
beneficial for us first of all you know
globalization is a the term
globalization is property and the term
a globalization just means international
integration and everybody look I suppose
of that everybody's favorite definitely
but what's called globalization there's
a very specific form of international
integration designed by mainly designed
by multinational corporations of the few
states that serve their interests and
it's designed in their interest so if
you looked at the World Trade
Organization rules they're not first of
all they're not free market rules
everything very heavy protectionism yeah
a lot of it is another thing to do with
trade as do with investor rights and has
almost nothing to do with the needs of
and of the mass of the population of
working people or farmers and so on it's
not designed for their renter its
corporation and another corporation may
be the same corporations in different
colors ring banks financial institutions
corporations and so on they're the ones
who designed it it shouldn't surprise us
that it's designed in their interests in
fact the real supporters of
globalization in my opinion are the
people who meet in the world Social
Forum every year yeah I mean they're
bringing together people from all over
the world walks of life so this is
something that we can do yeah but then
what ain't what is living to create a
global system of interactive interaction
of solidarity of community of mutual
support and take over institutions as in
the example that I mentioned in the
interests of workforce and communities
and there's no reason why every
institution shouldn't be run by
so-called stakeholders you don't have to
accept the framework imposed from
concentrated power which is very closely
linked to state sovereignty but is also
always a matter of territory at the end
you know maybe now with what the
internet and that is the good
we say about information about
possibility to travel and so long it's a
change but it was exaggerated I mean the
change say the late 19th century from
sailboats and horse carriages to the
Telegraph it was a much more dramatic
change right you know it meant changing
months to seconds
modern the communication is increasing
interaction but nothing nothing like the
the railroads the telegraph telephone
those are really dramatic changes much
more than the Facebook right now much
more than email yeah
but the inter communication is has many
it has many effects I don't think it's a
substitute for real communities there's
something maybe people did maybe younger
people don't feel this way but to me at
least it feels kind of alienating not
too
a personal interaction but only email
interaction that's on the other hand
there's a lot of advantages they have
all sorts of friends I've never met no
yeah people like communicate but it was
easy for me to come and contact you and
to have these into the field so you know
maybe it develops also I wouldn't
exaggerate the effect of multinational
corporations either when multinational
corporations are state based almost
entirely they depend on the home state
critically for subsidy for protection
for support
yeah helping well so and so on so that
so they're very much state based systems
right ecology is usually fairly neutral
like a hammer doesn't care whether they
use it to build a house or to crush
somebody's skull that's your choice how
do you think right I thank you very much
for your time and I like to job thank
you very much thanks
