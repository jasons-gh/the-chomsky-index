somebody will stand up for what we want
even though he's not saying so he looks
like the kind of person who might do it
it's quite interesting to look at the
comparisons that are made is compared to
Kennedy and to Reagan I mean Kennedy and
Reagan were media constructions Reagan
particularly he probably didn't even
know what the policies were but he was a
creation of the media wasn't
particularly popular incidentally but
they created the image of this wonderful
cowboy who saves us and so on and so
forth the Kennedy Kennedy administration
they were more in control but they
understood they were the first ruling
group to understand the power of
television and they created a kind of
charisma through good public relations
so an image of Camelot this marvelous
place wonderful things happening the
great president you look at the actual
actions that was her test it's the
president who invaded South Vietnam he
launched a major terrorist war against
Cuba go on and I he was responsible for
the his administration was responsible
for the establishment of the Brazilian
neo Nazi dictatorship who took place
right after the assassination but the
ground was prepared by the Kennedys that
led a horrible plague of repression over
Latin America and on and on but the
images there and imagery is very
important when you're trying to control
a dissident population as you know it's
not a fascist country that's a bad
analogy but the similarity to fascist
propaganda techniques is quite striking
and it's not accidental the Nazis
explicitly consciously openly took over
the techniques of American commercial
advertising and said so the fuse a few
simple ideas stress them over and over
or make them ablam erous that was
American commercial advertising in the
nineteen
and it was the model that the Nazis
explicitly adopted and it's the model of
business propaganda today so yes that
the Obama phenomenon I think reflects
the same alienation of the population
that you find in polls which say they
were large eighty percent say the
country is run by a few big interests
well Obama says we're going to change
that the no indication what the change
is going to be in fact the financial
institutions which are his major
contributors think it's fine so no
indication of any change but if you say
change people will grasp you say change
and hope people will grasp and say okay
maybe this is the Savior who will bring
about what we want even though there's
no evidence for sure so I think the
Obama phenomenon and the alienation go
hand in hand would you see any be
friends let's say between a maquina
moonstation aleckson 00 McCain is
another example of the very effective
propaganda and creation of imagery I
mean if a suppose there was some Russian
pilot who was bombing civilian targets
in Afghanistan I was shot down and
tortured by the American run Islamic
fanatic terrorists there would we say
he's a war hero would we say he has a is
an expert in the end strategic and
security issues because he was Obama or
bombing civilian targets no you wouldn't
but that's the image that's been created
a McCain his heroism and his expertise
and strategy comes from the fact that he
was bombing people from 30,000 feet and
shot down not nice that he was tortured
too bad shouldn't happen crime and so on
but it doesn't make you a war hero or a
or a specialist and the foreign policy
that's all the public relations creation
I mean this the public relations
industry is a huge industry very
sophisticated
and probably something like a sixth of
gross domestic product goes into
marketing advertising marketing
techniques and so on and that's a core
element of the ciety that's the way you
keep people separated from one another
subdued focused on something else and
explicit as I say it's all discussed in
public relations propaganda but a good
back to the question is would you see
any difference in tens of foreign policy
i think mccain is maybe worse than bush
he's doesn't say much because you're not
supposed to say much about issues but a
few things he's had said are pretty
frightening he could be a real loose
cannon yeah yeah that might explain the
sympathy to judo past worse Obama as a
way of service talking well I think
Europe actually the American
establishment itself was afraid of bush
a bush came under unprecedented
criticism from right in the mainstream
for example when his national security
strategy was announced in September
2002a calling for preventive war
virtually announcing a war in Iraq
immediately within weeks there was a
major article in foreign affairs the
main establishment Journal condemning
what they called the new imperial grand
strategy and not on principle grounds
just it would be harmful to the United
States and right through there's been a
lot of criticism and the Bush
administration it's a very narrow
spectrum of policy but their way at the
extreme is not off the extreme of
radical nationalism extremist radical
nationalism and the McCain is probably
in the same territory Obama very likely
would move back to the center right
where the Clinton administration was
it's called the Democratic Leadership
Council sort of a center-right grouping
not extreme
more more pragmatic and its dealings
with people after the the Bush Doctrine
itself is an interesting example the
so-called Bush Doctrine of preventive
war you know brazen and contempt for
even allies and so on the doctrine
itself was not new I did Clinton's
doctor it was even worse taken literally
the Clintons doctrine officially was
that the United States has the right to
use force to protect access to markets
and resources that's more extreme than
bush but they presented it politely
quietly not in a way that would alienate
even allies so the Europeans could
pretend they didn't hear it you know of
course they knew it and in fact probably
approved of it the European leaders but
the Bush Doctrine bush the arrogance and
brazenness and extremism and ultra
nationalism of the Bush administration
that did offend the center the center
the mainstream center and the Europe so
yes they'd like to see someone more
polite followed in the same policies no
do you see a rule for the left in your
right to states at some point how that
would kind of I think this country over
Vienna organizers paradise I mean if you
look at public opinion which is very
well studied it's remarkable so I mean
on this is what you've done the main
work on health burger not to talk about
if we had functioning democracy the
United States would have had a national
health care system decades ago publix
always wanted it that seems to run
foreign policy I'm in tech say you ran
you know the next big issue coming along
the public has very said every
presidential candidate including Obama
says we must maintain the threat of
force against Iran keep the options open
it happens to be in violation of the UN
Charter but this is an outlaw state so
nobody comments on that but not the
public a large majority the public says
we should not have threats we should
enter into diplomacy
the public holds that large majority
like 75 percent that Iran has the rights
of any signer of the non-proliferation
treaty the right to enrich uranium for
nuclear power but not nuclear weapons
and strikingly a very large majority of
the public thinks that we should support
a nuclear weapons free zone in the
region including Iran Israel American
forces deployed there and so on that
happens to be around in official policy
and in fact the United States is
committed to it if you formerly it would
it sign but no candidate could even
mention this possibility if the if the
United States were a functioning
democracy in which public opinion
influence policy this issue would
probably be settled many others too it
takes a cubic I mean for 45 years of the
United States has been dedicated to
punish Cubans we have the internal
documents from in candidate and so on
you got to punish the Cuban people
because that because of what they called
their success the successful defiance of
US policies going back to the Monroe
Doctrine 1823 the monitor doctor and
established the US right to run the
hemisphere the Cubans are successfully
the fullers the public thing and it
falls haven't taken since the 1970s
about two-thirds of the public's as we
should enter in the normal diplomatic
relations with Cuba it's just the way
the rest of the world does but the
extremist fanaticism of the
establishment includes the whole
spectrum here Kennedy is the one that
started it won't hear it no political
candidate will ever mention it and the
same is true when a host of issues so as
I say it should be an organizers
paradise I think the possibilities for
the left are extraordinary that's one of
the reasons for the clamping down on
under opinion on expression of attitudes
and so on and in fact it is a pretty
activist population so if you there are
more people involved in activism on one
or another series issue today than in
the 1960s it's just kind of Cebu and
there are many popular movements now
which never existed in the past and it
takes a the Solidarity movements with
the third world that's something totally
new in the history of European
imperialism and it came from mainstream
America in the 1980s there were rural
churches evangelicals right from the
mainstream thousands of people were
going to Central America to live with
the victims of Reagan's terrorist Wars
to help them to try to protect them
maybe a white face will protect them and
so on and this is thousands or tens of
thousands of people actually one of my
daughters is still there Nicaragua but
this never happened in the history of
imperialism I mean nobody from France
went to live in an Algerian village to
help the didn't protect them from you
know French atrocities it was it wasn't
even an option but we considered it but
in the 1980s it developed spontaneously
not in the elite centers so you didn't
find it in Boston but he did find it in
a rural Kansas and Arizona and it's now
spread all over the world so you have
Christian peacekeepers and have run in
other words or the global justice
movement that developed here what's
called ridiculously and
anti-globalization these the propaganda
says that it began in Seattle didn't
begin in Seattle they began in the third
world but if hundreds of thousands of
Indian peasants is storm the Parliament
that's not a fact if some people do
something in a northern city that's a
fact so the mass popular movements in
Brazil in
and so on they didn't exist until a
northern city became involved but it did
become involved and it's now spread over
much of the north as well as all over
the south and I speaking about the
intent of the unti pluralization
movement husband is plenty movement by
the same time there's a feeling that
maybe either stuck and in that respect
what do you think about the idea of
establishing a fifth international or
some form of organization that could
come up with an alternative to the
current over and sees them well I've
when I've talked that at the meetings of
the world Social Forum which are always
in the south and I've mentioned that I
said it seems to me that this might be
the seeds of a real international and in
my view the first international I mean
what was called the first international
was important but he's very localized it
was parts of Europe and it was
essentially destroyed by marks when he
couldn't control it the second
international collapsed before the
Second World War the third international
was taken over as a propaganda
institution by the Soviet Union and the
fourth international was marginal
Trotskyite but this is the first
authentic international or at least the
seeds of it not just the world social
forum but that makes a the Via Campesina
last time i went to porto alegre brazil
to could the world social forum the
first place I went was to the
international meeting of the Via
Campesina the international presence
organization very lively very exciting
this represents most of the population
of the world and it was really exciting
to be the the world social forum as well
I mean this is authentic globalization
these are people from all over the world
all you know parts of life interacting
discussing and and going back and trying
to implement ideas about social change I
think it will fail it's too early but
its failure will raise the level of
action for the next right so I think it
makes sense what you say that it is
maybe the seeds of the first authentic
international the United States and
elsewhere feeling that the institutions
don't work for us they work for someone
else for themselves perception which is
accurate and if that can be can coalesce
and be organized and moved to use the
freedom that we do enjoy that's very
significant prospect well I think that
in Europe is very worrisome is the
Americanization of the European politics
which I assume that is happening
everywhere and even the left has lost
its language for example even laugh when
leaders do not speak about working class
there's big about me the class I quite a
struggle has completely disappeared
things is that so there is a very
worrisome development where the American
language is now appearing in Europe and
at that cosine bursar with the enormous
weakness of the layer that
Americanization seems to be paradoxical
because at the same time United States
influence is going down here yeah you
see Europe that is becoming more and
more American intent of the politics
political parties have lost its potency
and value rather than political parties
particular leveling parties became
server personalities with media networks
and politics became a show the
theoretical show as you said the very
beginning slogans came out without any
meaning how do you splain that that at
the time that america is declining right
estate is declining the council and
political values and meaning of the
United States establishment is becoming
made on well that's a large topic but
just to sort of pick a few elements of
it if you look over a longer historical
sweep Europe was the most savage and
brutal region of the world
for centuries at establishing the
nation-state system in Europe arrogance
is the most extreme kind
