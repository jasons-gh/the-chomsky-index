on the question of chess-playing
programs I only described the way I
thought one ought to evaluate why not
the first ask does it is it an
interesting question at the current
moment of science to figure out how
people play chess the answer that's
probably no it's not an interesting
question of the current phase of our
understanding of the mind but let's
assume for the sake of argument that it
is an interesting question so just for
the sake of argument when we take a look
at the progress on program let's say it
does as well as Kasparov or you know
Grandmaster now we ask does that program
tell us anything about the way humans do
it and the answer to that is flat
no they're designed so as not to tell us
anything about the way humans do it the
programs are designed to exploit the
capacities of computers which are
different than the capacities of humans
so they have deep search and fast memory
you know I kind of stuff so we therefore
throw out the systems instantly at least
on scientific grounds because they don't
do anything so they're studying what's
probably a dumb question and they're
giving an answer which is totally
useless
so what's the point well as far as I can
see the only point is either advertising
getting research grants or maybe taking
the fun out of playing chess if there's
some other point I don't know what it is
I felt this for about 40 years I should
say and I've never been able to convince
anybody so maybe I'm wrong the general
attitude remains the one that I quoted
from Herbert I know that this is the
sort of core just like Drosophila no
it's the sort of fundamental question in
the field and listen I mean as far as I
can see and have always felt it's
totally pointless questions with the
waste of time I mean maybe something
useful come out on the side you know
like maybe by accidental lots of
spin-offs like you know maybe it'll help
somebody figure out more complicated
software ideas or something anything can
always have side effects but as a
research programs and seen any make any
sense if that's the core program of the
field and I think we just get rid of a
few okay let me try to ask my possible
question here then in your talk about
well in this talk you've described in
the natural science methods and ways of
doing things that are useful but then
obviously a lot of research money is
going into these things which are
apparently much less useful
isn't quite the point insightful I think
is the thing you know a lot of things
are worth doing even though they're not
useful because they give you
understanding understanding is a value
in itself but these things don't even
give you any understanding all they do
is maybe fool people or something like
that so what I'm wondering is is there
is there a connection in your opinion or
what do you think of the idea that there
might be a connection between the kinds
of things that get funded that you know
lack real progress in science and the
kinds of things that get funded in the
economy and politics and so on well
first of all I don't regard this that
the science so is from what I was saying
but most of it doesn't seem to be
science at all it seems to me kind of
high or maybe engine may be sort of
badly organized engineering or something
like that
but within real science you know people
make mistakes but I think there are you
know there's reasonable interaction
about what's the right thing to do on
sort of a rational basis I'm just you
know they're self advertising and power
trips and so on and so forth but we move
toward subjects that have no
intellectual substance you move towards
more integrity not because the people
have better genes but because nature's a
hard taskmaster and it doesn't allow you
to fake so the more you understand the
harder is fake so you get more honesty
just kind of like that in areas like say
the economy and the political decisions
and so on the stuff is usually for power
interest doesn't mean only marginal
things to do very low order factors are
things like humans human significance or
anything like that which again is pretty
it you know I'm not terribly surprising
just look at the institutional
structures in society comes in a
position influence decisions you know
what their institutional roots are sort
of predicted kind of run trivial
assumption thank you very much I'd like
to close with this comment if somebody
makes a computer that can do the sort of
analysis that you do then I'll believe
that the team's nothing don't forget you
can't make you can't design programs
that do simple things like talking like
a three-year-old I want to raise a point
with the chess-playing computer I think
it would take issue at the fact or with
your opinion that they're useless right
now or they don't tell us anything I
think if we they might be looking at it
the wrong way to say the computer plays
yes but it doesn't model human thought
makes it useless I don't think that's
not useless it would be useless even if
it did model human thought maybe it
would be interesting but useless it's
not only useless which is not
necessarily a major but isn't it
possible if you look at it from a
different viewpoint to say can we design
a machine that can solve a problem
within a limited domain that humans had
difficulty with in which case I think a
chess-playing computers does very well
there's no point to designing programs
that will solve in general that will
solve problems within limited domains
there would only be that's like an
engineering problem the thing wouldn't
it be useful to build a big machine if
you build a big machine that helps you
make a bridge but there was no point in
building a big machine and similarly
there's no point in constructing a
program that will solve some arbitrary
problem that you can do undoubtedly for
example it's trivial you can do it you
can do it in your spare time if you've
taken the first semester of computer
science to write a program that will run
through some decision procedure for some
simple part of mathematics okay once you
learn the decision procedure you can do
it so what but maybe we're on taking
steps towards something because but that
has to be shown see that's if somebody
came along and constructed some big
machine big machine I constructed maybe
it's a step toward something useful but
maybe but I'll wait until I see well my
point is that it seems kind of selfish
to think that feeling telogen so that we
can have or the only way we can solve
very very complex problems is to use the
human brain nobody believes that you
know you want to do weather forecasting
an easy human brain okay
mystical analysis of winter weather
patterns certainly using computers going
away beyond the human brain that's not
good intelligence that's you know you
want to solve take it a problem you look
for the best methods of doing it for
example if you want to solve the
decision problem for some elementary
branch of mathematics you'll use
decision procedure that's not the way
humans do it right because you have a
goal you want to solve that problem for
whatever reason
that we only see the reason you try to
understand what humans are doing is
because you're interested in human
beings right that's if you're interested
in human beings you want to understand
what humans are doing that's part of
logic if you're interested in solving a
problem you try to solve that problem
okay like if there was a purpose to
playing chess you know if it was a
purpose the winning chess championships
there's algorithms I mean you make a
slightly different game you make up a
different algorithm there's no point to
it it's like growing machines who are
they I think there is a point that's the
point the point is that we know if it's
doing a good job or not but look we can
set up endless numbers of tasks and we
can design computer machines do those
tasks doing arbitrary tasks you know
sometimes it may turn out that having
tried an arbitrary test you'll get
something of some value but you got to
show that so like suppose somebody said
look I can build a machine which will
you know randomly interchange the chairs
in this room and I can do it very
effectively maybe can maybe can't this
very point in building well I would
argue that the point for chess-playing
computers is that they experiment with
brother - I think theories right now one
is the chunking theory that berliner
used this and there's the other one
which just kills it the hardware theory
has any intellectual interest there is
related to any problem you can show that
it is you gotta show it's worth doing if
you have to say look here's the way I do
it and there's no reason why it's worth
knowing the answered that question
tell me the reason the reason can't be
that it beats somebody in a chess game
because that's of no interest well what
I'm saying is that maybe we could use
the chairs in the room we'll get
something that's useful for some purpose
to take any task you like you know a
crazy faster bike you could work on a
machine that would do it as fast as
possible and you know it's not
inconceivable that as a result of having
done that absurd thing something useful
might come out but that's not the way
you do science unless you can't think of
anything
people in genetics didn't study
Drosophila because well you know let's
do something of random they looked at
their sample because their particular
questions to ask anyone know the answers
to them in Drosophila happened to be the
right system the best system as far as I
knew to look at those answers similarly
this guy who's looking at me because
they just say okay I'll try to save him
because he picked them because of the
simplest organism with a wiring diagram
worked out come on know something about
wiring diagrams I mean doing rational
inquiry you're trying to understand
something and you organize your task
your research program so it may leads
you to understand it you don't just do
something in the hope that something
will turn out well I don't think that's
true right now what is the goal well
what we have in the world are just we
have a huge environment and we have to
do if you want to maybe compute it is
you have to be able to make searches
from a wide variety of places I mean we
have so many choices we can do I can
walk back to my chair I can stand here I
could skip back to my chair you know we
get some window study then ask a
question that's worth having an answer
to show the chess playing is the way to
answer that
question but he's doing them
