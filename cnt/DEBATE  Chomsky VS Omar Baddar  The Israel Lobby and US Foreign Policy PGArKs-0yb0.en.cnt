hello i am your host Cano Hakeem and you
are watching the Arabic our
on april third the american-arab
anti-discrimination committee presented
a conference with professor Noam Chomsky
and all my bed Dodd the lecture focused
on presidential elections chirps urges
in Iraq and current US policy towards
the middle east last week we brought you
the first part of the conference with
professor Noam Chomsky speaking on the
US foreign policy in the Middle East on
today's program we will be bringing you
the second part a mini debate between
professor Chomsky andromeda thud the
executive director of the ad cma their
mini debate was perspectives on the
israel lobby without further delay let
us now go to Boston University with
professor Noam Chomsky and online a bit
um let me first start by saying that it
was exposure to professor Chomsky's
analysis roughly roughly nine years ago
at age 17 that sort of got me to begin
to think critically about world affairs
so I have tremendous respect and
admiration for him and I'm actually
honored to be sharing a panel with him I
am got a message recently from a student
at Brandeis University somebody who
clearly knows nothing about either my
views or professor Chomsky's views about
the Israel lobby and basically he was
outraged at the thought that I would be
debating professor Chomsky saying a
debate is supposed to be between people
who disagree with each other and here
you have professor Chomsky debating some
guy from an Arab organization yeah right
some debate which I guess is a really
good point given the fact that there is
a monolithic view that all Arabs
subscribe to at birth or something which
apparently professor Chomsky happened to
get in the wrong line at that
subscription process or something I uh
you know but in reality within people
who actually understand these really
Palestinian conflict and who share a
critique of US policy towards it there
is a a debate over what actually drives
that policy on one end of the spectrum
you have people like professors miramar
involved who argue that the Israel lobby
essentially overrides independence US
policy preferences to the detriment of
the US interest and they go as far as to
say that the invasion of rock was the
large part to to these where lobbies
influence and on the other end of the
spectrum we have people like Steven
Jones and professor Chomsky and others
who basically say that the Israel lobby
really hardly has any independent
influence and that it only appears to be
powerful because its agenda happens to
mesh pretty well with that of the
centers of power in the US and
furthermore those policies are not
basically harming us interests as
defined by those centers of power um now
I think that neither perspective is
entirely accurate and that while
mearsheimer will definitely exaggerate
the extent of the Israel lobbies
influence on foreign policy I still do
think that
a strong argument could be made that the
Israel lobby has driven policy in a way
that was harmful to us interests now
when I talk about the Israel lobby I
basically except a variation of the
definition of mere Sharma and Walt of it
not the original one that came out in
their paper that was a bit too broad and
vague and for that matter bordered
tautology in that it basically said
anybody who's ever lobbied for the
interest of Israel is part of the lobby
but they take a more sophisticated
definition of that in their book which
is the one that I sort of like think is
somewhat accurate so when I say the
lobby i'm talking about national
organizations whose primary an explicit
purpose is the promotion of Israel's
interests in the United States so we're
talking about groups like a pack the
Zionist Organization of America the
Israel project Christians United for
Israel as well as media watchdog groups
who's basically primary purpose is to
tilt media coverage in Israel's favor
groups like camera and honest reporting
and others and then on top of that there
are allied groups to the lobby those are
groups or organizations whose even
though the interest of Israel are not
their primary focus they nevertheless
happen to basically mesh with those of
the manor organizations and here I'm
talking about the broader right-wing
Christian evangelical movement think
tanks basically their views of analysis
on world affairs are tinted through
Israeli eyes like the Washington
Washington Institute of Near East policy
and other organizations that basically
happen to share the views and the
interest of major pro-israel
organizations and in mainstream
political science literature basically
the determinants of success for interest
groups have been fairly outlined you
know they include things like membership
size financial resources unity
institutional complexity access to power
coalition building and so on and I don't
really have time to get into how these
were a lobby measures up on each one of
these but suffice it to say that it
measures up very well in fact the Israel
lobby is extremely powerful in a way
that basically every mainstream
political scientist does acknowledge if
you
want those details basically you can
read for example the meerschaum revolt
book and then you look at US policy
towards Israel you see that Israel is
the single largest recipient of US
foreign aid receiving roughly 3 billion
a year a three-fourths of it this one
working yeah all right um you see that
Israel is the single largest recipient
of US foreign aid receiving roughly 3
billion dollars each year two-thirds of
which is military aid and that's about
to be converted into entirely in its
entirety to military aid as well you
also see that Israel is the only country
that receives that aid all-in-one
allocation at the beginning of each
fiscal year is not basically required to
account for it Israel receives
privileged intelligence from the United
States and it's allowed to develop
nuclear weapons when many other
countries obviously under the threat of
force over the thought and then you look
at US policy towards the
israeli-palestinian conflict to
reiterate something that professor
Chomsky just said essentially there has
been a practical solution on the table
not a perfect one but a practical one
for over 20 years now which calls for
Israel to withdraw from the occupied
territories to facilitate the creation
of a Palestinian state the Palestinians
accepted this so that the Arab League
and virtually the entire international
community through the United Nations and
Israel is single-handedly essentially
blocking the solution and the US is
backing them up I mean even not just
with continued military and financial
support but also diplomatically the US
has vetoed over 40 UN resolutions that
are critical of Israel's violations of
international law and human rights which
is to put that in perspective is greater
than the number of vetoes used by all
other permanent members of the UN
Security Council combined on all matters
so is kind of an obscene figure so you
look at the Israel lobby and you say
it's powerful and then you look at US
policy towards Israel and you see
unrestrained support and people might
feel tempted to come to the conclusion
that the Israel lobby is responsible for
this policy
but it's not quite that simple because
there are other forces that could
account for that policy as well for
example Israel has been of extreme
strategic utility to the u.s. they
defeated Nasser's nationalism in 1967
which the u.s. really needed they
protected King Hussein's regime during
the events of black September from
Syrian intervention they supplied
weapons to apartheid South Africa and
the Contras in Latin America at a time
when it would look bad for the u.s. to
do that directly and in fact illegal and
basically Israel is the dominant
military force in the Middle East and
it's a stable one so that makes it it's
extremely important for the United
States strategically so even the u.s.
grant strategy could also account for
you a support for Israel furthermore US
military aid that goes to Israel
basically huge parts of it something
close to seventy percent comes back to
US military corporations so in essence
US military aid to Israel is a form of
subsidy to US military corporations so
you can see that the defense
establishment would also be in favor of
this strong relationship so given the
fact that the defense establishment the
u.s. ranch strategy and the Israel lobby
all advocate a policy when you have
multiple players it becomes a bit
difficult to isolate and assess the
influence of one particular player and
in this case that's the Israel lobby and
the way to resolve this is to look at
cases where the Israel lobby alone
contradicted basically was in conflict
with the other forces that support this
current policy now unfortunately the
record does not resolve this problem
because the record shows mixed results
so for example professor Chomsky and
others have pointed to the 2005 incident
when Israel sold sophisticated military
excuse me sophisticated military
technology to China against us wishes
the u.s. essentially humilated Israel
and the lobby didn't say a word they
forced Israel to apologize publicly
which they did in 1993 there was the
incident where Israel was working out a
deal with North Korea
by which North Korea would not would
cease to provide long-range missiles to
Iran in return for Israeli investments
in North Korea which you know when
you're talking about missiles to Iran
this is something of serious strategic
national security interest for Israel
and the u.s. in an effort to isolate
North Korea was basically able to compel
Israel to end the deal and in both those
cases the lobby you know didn't say a
word and even in cases where the lobby
did get active protesting for example
there was the case of 1981 when the
United States wanted to sell the Reagan
administration wanted to sell advanced
radar systems to Saudi Arabia these were
a lobby essentially threw a fit and they
got very active and they gave the
administration a very difficult time and
they almost canceled the deal only here
the defense industry namely Boeing and
United Technologies basically who had
hundreds of millions of dollars on the
deal basically got together and said
that they were not going to allow this
to happen and sure enough you know in
cooperation with the Saudis and with the
administration that was bent on getting
this through they were able to crush the
lobbies opposition and the deal actually
went through so all of these cases
demonstrate the limits of the Israel
lobbies influence but on the other hand
um mearsheimer and Walt can point to
cases where the Israel lobby did
overcome administration opposition so
for example in 2002 aerial drone
launched operation defensive shield in
the West Bank killing hundreds of
palestinians at a time when Bush
basically was trying to gather up
support for the Iraq war so he did not
want to be on bad terms with the Arab
world and so he demanded that basically
Israel and it's encouraging a couple of
days later he clarified that he meant
that Israel should end it immediately
and a day after that Condoleezza Rice
got on TV quite upset saying immediately
means now we expect the Israelis to end
the incursion now and in response the
Israel lobby essentially swung into
action there were a hundred thousand
emails that were sent to the White House
from from Christian evangelical
coalition's basically a pact applied
pressure on Congress and the next thing
you know Congress is passing resolutions
basically supporting Israel's
encouragement in defiance of the
administration's requests to the
opposite
and eventually Bush essentially caved he
realized this was not worth the fight
and he said that Israel had responded
satisfactorily to his call but Israel
had actually done no such thing so this
is one example of the lobby overcoming
US administration opposition another
would be the settlement building that
goes on virtually every president up
until the second George W Bush opposed
settlements quite explicitly and in the
case of George Bush the first the
opposition was so intense that he
actually threatened to cut off loan
guarantees to Israel and you know there
are comments heated comments on the
record from james baker and and pushed
the first basically showed that they
were quite upset about this but in the
end the settlements continued and the
settlements continued until today so i
think the what the pattern that you see
emerging is that when we're talking
about the israeli-palestinian conflict
the israel lobby seems to be able to get
its way over administration opposition
but when you're talking about broader
strategic issues the lobby does not
stand a chance in the face of more
powerful players and what's important to
note here is one might say well the
israeli-palestinian conflict is not a
strategic interest so the US isn't cared
that much but the problem here is that
this is not entirely true is that US
policy towards the israeli-palestinian
conflict has been very costly for the
United States on many fronts the obvious
ones being national security and the
United States image in the world and
then of course in terms of strategic
positioning in the Middle East and for
that matter and more details about
access to oil and things like that so on
this particular issue you can say that
the Israel lobby does override
independent US policy preferences on the
israeli-palestinian conflict to the
detriment of the United States and we
can I know running out of time so we can
talk more about that well there isn't
going to be much of a debate because I
basically agree with almost everything
you've said and I've written it many
times on I think you're right in taking
the narrow definition of these are la la
baby even in the book the walk Mayer
shimer sometimes define the lobby so
loosely that it becomes close to
pathologist but if we keep to organized
groups like for example
Christian evangelicals who as you say
we're instrumental aim i don't agree
were instrumental in overcoming
administration opposition to the
operation defensive shield destruction
of janine yeah that's a big group of
Christian evangelicals are probably in a
third of the Republican vote maybe a
quarter of the population huge electoral
block but the government does not go
along with them they their position is
that the US should support every Israeli
action everything blow up the Temple
Mount in which they've tried to do and
the US government doesn't do that their
reason for doing it is because they're
dedicated anti-semite their position
probably the most extreme they want a
lot of them are except the particular
interpretation of the rapture
interpretation of revelations which is
what's going to happen is there's going
to be a war you know Gogan mago and all
that business and then there'll be a
great war and Armageddon everybody that
will be slaughtered and the those who
are saved namely us will rise to heaven
what happens of the Jews they're not
saved ok so that's anti-semitism at its
most extreme level and yes they do want
to support the Israeli policies because
they'll lead the war but the US
government doesn't go along with it in
the case of operation defensive shield
notice that if that's used as an example
then the lobby argument is in a serious
self-contradiction Walton mearsheimer as
you point out try to claim that Israel
drove the United States to the Iraq war
on the side that's completely
contradicted even by their on evidence
but suppose we accept that is true the
logic that you outlined is that the
lobby wanted that the lobby harmed us
interests by forcing the u.s. to accept
the Janine operations even though it was
undermining support for going to war
with
rack or you can't have both positions
either the lobby drove us to the war
with Iraq or the lobby harmed the effort
to go to the war with Iraq but not both
so I don't think that example shows much
and in fact I don't know of any evidence
the u.s. cared one way or another
whether Israel smashed up jeaneen yeah
it it caused a lot of problems and what
to adopt the standard racist terminology
what's called the Arab Street we don't
talk about the British Street or the
French Street but there's a thing called
the Arab Street namely the population
and yeah the population didn't like it
in fact Bush is much more unpopular in
Saudi Arabia than modern age odd or
Janine or Osama bin Laden but the
question is whether anybody cares about
that I mean as long as the us-backed
Pyrenees are able to completely control
their own populations then US government
didn't care that much about the
populations and they have been able to
do that the most value than oldest ally
of the United States and the region is
actually Saudi Arabia through the oil
that most of the oil is it's also the
most extreme fundamentalist tyranny in
the world and if you look at what harms
US policy we know not just now but way
back back in the 1950s in 1958 President
Eisenhower asked his staff why there's a
campaign of hatred against us in the
Arab world and the National Security
Council highest planning agency just
given an answer they said there's a
perception in the Arab world that the
United States supports harsh brutal
tyrannical regimes and impedes
development and democracy and does so
because it wants to control their oil
they went on to say the perception is
true and that's the way we should do it
so yeah that harms us interests if you
think that the so-called arab street is
something that the u.s. cares about is I
that persists until today
right after nine eleven the Wall Street
Journal did a study of the kind of Arabs
they care about what they called money
Muslims rich guys you know directors of
multinational corporations bank managers
that sort of thing people very much
embedded inside the u.s. nominated
system and asked them you know why they
were antagonistic to the us- basically
the same reasons they did add the
sanctions against Iraq as a major reason
and also repression of the Palestinians
but focused on the same reasons us
sports harsh and undemocratic regimes
Tara knees blocks democracy and
development and does so because it wants
to control our oil okay that it's not
you with Israeli Lobby that's pushing
that that's the way the US has
determined its strategic goals not only
in the Middle East the same everywhere
else yeah same policies around the world
nothing special about the Middle East
there are as far as the just one factual
comment as far as the scale of the lobby
in the sense that you correctly define
it in political science terms you know
money membership that sort of thing
that's been analyzed in detail by
stevens unas and i advise you to look at
it and it turns out it's one of the
smaller lobbies it's dwarfed and it's
totally dwarfed by the business lobbies
which is totally overwhelming and even
by things like the lawyers lobby or the
real estate agents lobby and so on i
mean it's it's influential but it's
influential i think largely because as
you say it conforms mostly to US policy
the I don't consider the cases that you
mentioned very let's take the George
Bush one case which is an interesting
one which seriously misunderstood that's
the other example that's standardly
given for the power of the lobby George
Bush number one and his Secretary of
State James Baker where that took the
most extreme position against the
Palestinians and support of Israeli
expansion of any president but they did
it in secret so they weren't getting any
lobby support of pressure for it
I mean we now know was that I mean
actually the documents were known that
they were kept quiet they took the
position they supported the coalition
the Israeli coalition government
position the Shimon Peres you suck show
me your position that there can be I'm
quoting it now no additional Palestinian
state between the Jordan and the sea
meaning Rory is a Palestinian state
namely Jordan and the can't be an
additional Palestinian state and the
fate of the territories they said has to
be implemented and accord with the
wishes of the government of Israel that
was endorsed in what's called the Baker
plan the December 1989 Baker plan which
endorsed exactly that position that's
the harshest position anti Palestinian
position has been taken by any American
president I was George Bush the first
the lobby pressure bobby probably didn't
know about it but yeah that's the
position they took it's kind of like
saying that the Jews don't need Israel
because they already have New York so
there have to be an additional Jewish
state it's very much like that if
anybody were to say that he'd be called
a Nazi you know but that's the position
that George Bush the first and James
Baker took no pressure from the lobby
the conflict was over something else
Yitzhak Shamir would happen to be
unusually abrasive he would wait until
James Baker showed up in Jerusalem and
right at that moment I've recently
announced we're setting up a settlement
than such-and-such a hilltop okay you
don't treat the godfather that way you
have to be more polite you have to do it
the way she moan Paris does you say
thank you master we will not settle any
more settlements just like you say and a
week after you leave we'll put up the
outpost and build it then everybody's
happy exactly what happened with
Condoleezza Rice on her last trip
that's the way you're supposed to behave
if you'd behave to abrasively to the
master he's not gonna like it so
therefore they made a week threat to
withhold funds which of course didn't
live up to but I don't really think this
had anything to do with the lobby
however this entire discussion
illustrates two points one white for me
personally it illustrates why don't even
get into this discussion I haven't even
written about it I think one paragraph
somewhere because something mildly or
maybe seriously distasteful about the
whole discussion in my opinion as I said
a nation is dying in front of our eyes
okay and we are focusing on an abstract
discussion which may be appropriate for
some seminar somewhere about the the
various factors that influence policy
which overwhelmingly coincide but
sometimes differ and we're asking well
you know which one is more influential
in the few cases that they differ
actually I I basically agree with you
wear for this abstract discussion where
US major US interests in the sense of
interests of those who matter where
they're involved Israeli Lobby has no
effect on issues don't matter much to
the United States yeah the lobby can
have an effect just like the Armenian
lobby can have an effect on the Armenian
law became very close to a couple months
ago to seriously harming us relations
with one of his most important allies
turkey over the Armenian Genocide but
they came pretty close and there you
know that's what lobbies can do but
where any serious interest is concerned
they're just old to get lost that was
true on the China case 2005 was
particularly striking again in two
thousand the North Korean case was a
very important case North Korea had
agreed to stop sending any missile
technology or any other advanced
military technology to the Middle East
the entire mentally
in return for Israeli recognition and
the Clinton administration simply told
them no and for Israel that is a very
serious significance there was a big
fuss couple months ago bout Israel
allegedly bombing some site in northern
Syria which is supposed to claimed had
North Korean support well whatever tiny
element of truth there might be to that
there would be nothing at all like that
or even any threat if Israel had endowed
the US pressure and we get a real issue
I think you find that's what happens as
far as the arab street is concerned the
u.s. don't care any more than Saudi
Arabia does however there's another
point that should be made let's take
this abstract discussion which
personally I find distasteful about
which factor and policy which of the
many factors and policy that almost
always coincide has more weight and
let's ask does it have any practical
consequences how the discussion turns
out okay so suppose we decide with
Walton mearsheimer that in cases you
know that there are cases of serious
concern to you know powerful American
interests where the u.s. backs off
because of the lobby well if that's true
there is a consequence a tactical
consequence one consequence I could stop
writing books i can stop writing
articles stop getting talks all over the
place stop getting vilified nothing all
I'd have to do or you'd have to do or
anyone else concerned what the problem
would have to do is put on our ties and
jackets go to the headquarters of
corporate headquarters of Lockheed
Martin Intel chula Packard that
Microsoft the warren buffett exxon mobil
and so on and politely explained to them
that their interests are being harmed by
a lobby that they can put out a business
in 30 seconds with their political clout
and economic force ok games over we've
won does anybody do it i mean does
anybody even bother to laugh well
yeah I mean it's laughable if there was
a if the few being interest looking out
for themselves didn't like what was
happening wait there's nothing about it
and what they're doing about is
investing in Israel not under pressure
of the Christian evangelicals or a pack
but because they find it useful to have
a powerful state most powerful state in
the region actually with military forces
that are more with air and armored
forces that are larger and
technologically more advanced than any
NATO power little on the region outside
the US and that is totally subordinate
to the United States Israel made a
decision a long time ago that it would
sacrifice security for expansion which
makes it totally subordinate to the
United States has to do with the US
wants very loyal performs any task
that's wanted right on the periphery of
the major oil-producing regions the
Pyrenees who run the oil producers
really don't mind as long as they can
control their own populations so it's a
system that works for the interests of
the few big interests who look out for
themselves and we see it in their
behavior if we think they're being
misled well we should explain it to them
so that they'll change their behavior
and put the lobby out of business but as
far as I can see that's the only
practical consequence to this discussion
otherwise it's an abstract discussion
which can have often some seminar room
about the relative weight of two factors
and policy formation that almost always
coincide but sometimes conflict and
while that's maybe an intellectually
interesting discussion I can't get much
involved in it when we see a nation
being killed under our eyes just a
couple of things to point out
um if if I thought that this discussion
was entirely of no consequence up to
basically activism to end the occupation
and so on I would consider it
distasteful as well the only thing is
that i think if you operate under the
assumption that the reason why the u.s.
supports the masteris policies that
israel carries out on the occupied
territories is because of the influence
of a lobby then the natural course that
what that leads people of conscience to
do is to say okay well all we have to do
is present a counter voice and sort of
like try to drown the other voice create
a counter force and that would influence
policy in the correct direction but if
you take the view that the israel lobby
has no influence and that the u.s. is
not really susceptible to lobby pressure
then that might give people the
impression of this thing is entirely
hopeless if the israel lobby does not
influence policy we certainly would not
be able to and therefore advocating up
for basically a palestinian human rights
would be an endeavor that is not worth
taking so I think for me I'm invested in
saying that there is a lobby and if you
counter it you can be effective as a way
of getting people to basically get more
involved in the issue now the argument
here is that the reason why the Israel
lobby gets away with what it does with
regards to the israeli-palestinian
conflict is because this is an issue
that does not matter before US
policymakers and my arky materials
precisely the opposite is that it does
take a couple of examples so you know in
the u.s. grant strategy in the region
they're genuinely afraid of Iranian
influence now the fact that the US has
allowed the conflict to perpetuate and
that fact that Iran is able to basically
take advantage of that by you know
spreading its influence throughout the
region by taking advantage of popular
hostility towards Israeli policies I
mean this is something of serious threat
to the US um if there was no conflict
Iran would have nothing to play on to
spread its influence and so
strategically speaking it seems of
crucial importance for the United States
to take active steps to end the conflict
on the question of oil for example um
you look at saudi arabia um
there's a reason why they're pushing for
the Arab initiative basically to resolve
the conflict as well they presented it
again in 2007 basically they're
desperate to end the conflict because
the conflict is a major source of
popular discontent throughout the region
and if Saudi Arabia is going to continue
to basically till the United States line
this is going to cause problems for it
in terms of governmental stability so
again here you have a case where it
seems that you know oil companies Sarah
certainly have an interest in the
stability of the Saudi government and
the Saudi government thinks that this is
an important issue to resolve for
stability so it seemed that it would
follow that all companies would be in
favor of basically putting pressure to
end the conflict so now like the way I
look at it is you know going to the oil
lobbies and actually talking to them and
explaining these things does not become
so outrageous an idea and if you want to
take it a step further so take for
example you know especially with the
potential election of McCain if the u.s.
actually invades Iran or bombs it for
that matter it's going to need the
logistical support of Persian Gulf
countries now given the current climate
in the Middle East um those government
are going to have a very difficult time
basically about giving that logistical
support for the US their survival is
seriously at risk now if the u.s. gives
something in return for these regimes to
pacify their populations you know
looking at it harshly from a strategic
perspective from the US the best thing
to do would be to resolve the
israeli-palestinian conflict to
basically make things easier for the
broader grindr grand strategic plan for
the united states in the region so
basically what I'm arguing here is that
the perpetuation of the
israeli-palestinian conflict is of
basically it's a strategic arm for US
interests in a very serious way that US
policymakers should take seriously and
the last thing on the size of the lobby
basically you have poles that are taken
of Congress and their staffers who
basically consistently show that they
view the Israel lobby as one of the most
influential lobbies in Congress Bill
Clinton refer to them as basically said
a pact was
that a packed lobby is better than
anybody else does in Washington so we
have this recognition on behalf of
Congress that the Israel lobby is
influential and so if it is correct as I
and most Americans think it is that US
policy generally speaking is influenced
is over influenced by lobbies and then
you add to that the fact that Congress
acknowledges that the Israel lobby is of
tremendous influence it follows that the
Israel lobby does have significant
influence on policy and the last thing I
want to point out is the Israel lobby
boasts of its ability to defeat people
running for political office basically
it or not till the line I mean there are
countless statements by a pack members
and many others who basically say you
know we've cost so and so the election
and you know we hope that people will
get the message now and you can actually
see that in effect when you look at
presidential candidates falling over
each other trying to portray themselves
as extremely supportive of Israel for
the obvious reasons and I'm thinking if
a lobby has that much control over the
political survival of people running for
office and in Congress then they de
facto if not episo facto have an
influence over policy because nobody can
talk you know basically take on a policy
that the lobby would consider
unacceptable again I have only a small
factual disagreement and agree with the
main thrust the factual disagreement has
to do with the power of the lobby and
here I won't go through the details but
I just suggest that you look at Steven's
unas is careful detailed analysis of it
which shows that there's almost no
effect on candidates running for office
the most passionate supporters of Israel
are mostly in safe districts look like a
Nancy Pelosi nobody's going to run
against them and the lobby has basically
no effect of course they claim to have
an effect the Armenian lobby will also
claimed to have an effect that you can
find two or three scattered cases but
basically on Congress the effect is very
marginal now it's true as you say that
Congress thinks of the lobby as
very powerful but that's the reason for
that is that the real lobbies they just
take for granted like they're not going
to tell you that the business lobbies
powerful or they you know the
telecommunications lobby or the farm
lobby I mean sure that's what we're here
for we work for them they're not
powerful that's who we are you know
Clinton's not going to say the
telecommunications lobby when the 1990 i
shifted policy in 1996 to win the
election because of funding from them he
did but you don't talk about that
because that's the way the system works
yes there's nothing to discuss that's
like saying I'm you know I'm breathing
air or something so sure they don't
refer to the real lobbies but as far as
the rest is concerned you were actually
giving an argument in favor of what I
said I think if I don't happen to agree
with you on the analysis of the
situation entirely but suppose we accept
your analysis completely the US policy
with regard to Israel Palestine is
harming the interests of the few big
interests who run the country okay like
the ones I mentioned Lockheed Martin
ExxonMobil Intel Microsoft
hewlett-packard all the ones who seem to
be very happy with the present situation
so US policy is actually harming their
interests well there is a tactical
consequence namely we're wasting our
time here we should be going to their
offices and explaining to them that this
marginal lobby which they can put out a
business in 30 seconds is harming their
interests as if they can't figure it out
for themselves but since they somehow
can't figure it out for themselves will
explain it to them and that's over there
as far as the induced passivity try to
find an argument against that tactical
consequence I'm sitting right up to walk
mearsheimer many times no answer because
there is no answer if it was harming
their interests they would do something
about it what they are doing about it is
supporting a just what I described
using investments in Israel and he is
fine maybe it's a minor nuisances here
and there but they do it as far as
making people passive I think the
opposite is true if you convince people
that the lobby is all powerful then
there's nothing much to do about it we
can't stop the lobby from functioning if
you think it's the US government which
is following certain policies that we
don't like there's a lot that we can do
about it we could turn this into a
functioning democracy in which popular
opinion matters and it's not just on
this issue but on a whole range of other
issues and that's what we should be
doing you are watching a mini debate on
the Israel lobby between professor Noam
Chomsky and Amida Buddha part of a
conference sponsored by a DC ma on US
policy in the Middle East we'll be back
with more of the debate after this short
program ID you are watching the Arabic
our a program of views views culture
cuisine and the Arab American experience
to watch today's program or any of our
previous programs log on to www and now
back to our program and speak as loudly
as you can I know sometimes we have to
set up our questions with a couple of
fast if you have to do that try to limit
it to 30 seconds 45 seconds so I'm going
to try to call around
go here and then here here seems to me
that the most powerful tire luggage is
the fact that they can attack people in
academia people who write about
Palestinian rights and about what Israel
is doing people who try to organize to
do something about it that's where the
lobbying is really powerful and very
effective and trying to keep people to
get in 10 years you know all the kinds
of things that they've been doing so
that's where we get me and our
organizations we struggle with them all
the time the United States government's
not struggling with them yeah so that
one point went to me the other group is
that no God keeps mentioning siemens
unas and peace I just want to announce
its going to be speaking at Tufts on
April 25th and 26th there's a conference
organized by New England United and my
urge you all to come and you can look up
knowing United on your website will be
more information about it there on the
first point just brief comment up as you
mentioned Walton mearsheimer give
several definitions of the lobby one of
them is the narrow in which I agree you
focused on there's another one that they
give which is that the lobby is just
those people who dedicate themselves to
supporting Israel's interests no matter
what well the problem with that
definition it includes practically the
whole intellectual community after 1967
not before but after 1967 when Israel
formed a real service to the United
States you the intellectuals just had a
love affair with Israel so I mentioned
dissent before the Democratic Socialist
journal if you check it before 1967
Israel's barely mentioned or maybe
mentioned with contempt afterwards you
get Michael Walzer and Irving Hal and
passionate scientists they take a
journal it takes a Norman Podhoretz you
know can't get him more extreme an
advocate take a look at his book making
it which was published in early nineteen
sixty seven
norman finkelstein who's very assiduous
researcher went through all this and he
made some interesting discoveries as he
mention Israel doesn't care you know
1967 that turns out there's a big turn
and when you talk about pressure on
universities no university has to submit
to a pack pressure they do it if the
majority of the faculty agree that
that's what they want to do otherwise i
can tell me get lost so we're now
talking about the lobby and the large
sense of the word which includes the
media the lobby doesn't influence New
York Times editorials and you know we're
just talking about the educated world at
large which almost reflexively supports
US government policy except in narrow
ways you know can't give a principled
objection and supports Israel insofar as
it's perceived to be you know associated
with the fundamental the US interest so
that's a real struggle i agree with you
a major one but i don't and it's true
that the lobby is in the forefront
because they're the ones who launched
the vilification and the slanders and so
on and so forth but they can be blocked
if it weren't that they were supported
by the general community so it's a
battle that is seriously
and we do at those American ships
hovering there and I wonder if you have
any insights well I don't know anything
other than what I read there are reports
in the Israeli press now that Syrian
that Syrian Army is mobilizing in
preparation for a possible Israeli
attack and the scenario that they talk
about is a Hezbollah action in
retaliation for the move Nia
assassination in Damascus which they and
many others blame on Israel and it's
clear that Israel has been sort of
itching for a chance to invade again and
do what they fail to do last time harm
caused by law they probably helped them
so it's not impossible but my own guess
is it's if it takes place it would be
only as part of a broader action against
Iran I'm the only real concern of Israel
in the US about Hezbollah which has been
pretty quiet in fact from the Israeli
withdrawal in two thousand until two
thousand six there wasn't a single
rocket firing attributed to Hezbollah up
till july two thousand six what they're
concerned about is it is a deterrent to
us attack on iran so if the u.s. decides
to attack iran or Israel decides to
attack Iran Hezbollah rockets which may
be more advanced now are a deterrent
they can reign on Israel you know that's
a deterrent and they want to eliminate
it so my guess is if there's an attack
it'll that's what it'll be instantly the
same is true of this whole discussion of
missile defense in Eastern Europe which
is causing serious riffs with the
Russians I mean for the Russians it's a
serious problem because these systems if
they ever work our threat to the Russian
deterrent and in fact they're placed in
a position which makes them a threat to
the Russian deterrent you can read that
US strategic analysts explain it but the
official pretext is their defense of
Europe they're defending Europe against
it
an attack I mean you know that's at a
level of Ronald Reagan putting on his
cowboy boots and quaking and terror
because the Nicaraguan army was two days
from Harling in Texas you remember that
incident people can laugh because we're
disciplined around here but Europe is
about as likely to be hit by an Iranian
missile as it is by an asteroid so if
you're interested in defense it might be
putting up an asteroid defense system
unless the Iranians are dedicated to
being vaporized in one second they would
never send off a missile with the
nuclear weapon if they had one you know
because of the obvious reaction so what
the missile defense system is for the
only function it can serve apart from
being a threat to the Russian to turn
hence the US first strike weapon is as a
threat to Iran it's telling it ran no
matter even if you get missiles and
nuclear weapons you're not gonna be able
to use them we can hit you first and you
can't react a missile defense all
together is a first strike with them
it's pretty well understood on all sides
it's saying we can deter a retaliatory
strike so we can strike you first with
impunity and that's the way it's
understood on all sides and if I think
as well as regarded pretty much the same
way Lebanon is in terrible shape now I
mean it's a it's a real pity because
it's it's a wonderful country has every
reason to live in peace but it's being
torn apart to a large extent by outside
pressures
um I question for another top speed how
if I'll you think I your views on mr. on
the melodies have been affected by your
growing up as a Jew in a Jewish family
yeah well I I grew up as an intensely
Jewish environment in fact Jewish ghetto
pretty much and was a Zionist youth
leader and so on and may surprise you
but my views as a Zionist youth leader
in the 1940s are about the same as what
they were are now I was part of what was
the Zionist movement that was opposed to
a Jewish state and it was a substantial
part of the Zionist movement in those
days there wasn't an official commitment
to the Jewish state until 1942 it was
maybe in people's minds but it's not
official in the United States
incidentally it remained remained a
substantial part of the most called the
Zionist movement in Palestine to that
was against the Jewish state for the
kinds of reasons I mentioned and in
favor of arab-jewish cooperation they
were socialists so arab-jewish
working-class cooperation that was the
part of the Zionist movement I was
connected with and no circumstance has
changed so your the tactics you think of
change but so from and I wrote about it
likes from 1967 to 1975 there was a real
chance in my view to institute what's
now called the one-state solution Israel
could have moved to create a federal
arrangement inside sis Jordan Jordan to
the sea which they controlled with a
Palestinian and a primarily Palestinian
primarily Jewish entity to be federated
that lead to further integration and
circumstances allow and that would end
up with some kind of democratic state
that option it would if you're
interested I wrote about at a time this
book a lot of articles it was just total
anathema on everyone's on every side
everybody hated in 1970 1975 was over by
the time the Palestinians had committed
themselves to an independent state and
the world had accepted
what has become the total international
consensus on it through state settlement
this proposal was gone an interesting
question you might ask is why it's
popular now when it's completely
unfeasible whereas it was anathema when
it was feasible so why is it that the
new york times in the New York Review of
Books and so on publish articles aren't
now when they would have been willing to
slaughter you when you suggested it when
it was feasible I think you can make up
an answer to that which is not too
Pleasant but I'll leave it to you but
yeah I certainly influence it's one of
the main reasons i'm interested in this
one of the main reasons way I studied
Arabic for years and call it yeah this
was major winters Roger radio free be in
1994 I take you and Israel shock a noted
Israeli dissident speaking on religious
fundamentalism in Israeli domestic and
foreign policies so 14 years later has
religious fundamentalism disappeared
from Israel is it getting stronger
what's the status well minor correction
that was Israel chaka giving a talk and
I introduced him okay old friend with
and if you remember the meeting was
practically broken up but yeah okay yeah
but yeah it's stronger now I'm much
stronger everyone agrees on that if
actually look at the who the settlers
are the illegal settlers and the
occupied territories the ultra religious
ones are their way out of proportion to
their numbers in the population and for
them it's fine if you live in the West
Bank it's like that now when I go home
I'm going to a Boston suburb okay nice
boss and sober about them to them in the
west lexington you know that's what the
West Bank is it's the nice pleasant
suburbs for Jerusalem and Tel Aviv also
happens to be sitting on the major water
supplies and breaks up the Palestinian
territories and so on but and you can
live there subsidized I didn't get
subsidized
the Lexington but if you move to the
settlements in the occupied territories
the illegal settlements you get
subsidized so you get a nice house you
know a superhighway taking it right to
the Tel Aviv and Jerusalem you don't
worry about Arabs because they can't be
seen there off somewhere else and you
get paid for it so sure people move and
the religious settlers way out of
proportion to their numbers and there is
an increasing growth of fundamentalism
not just there but all over the world I
mean Christian evangelicals have the
kind of political clout now that they
didn't have 30 or 40 years ago in the
United States nothing like it I mean the
numbers were about the same but they
weren't organized as a political force
then and in Israel Palestine on all
sides and in fact throughout the region
fundamental of Islamic fundamentalism
and Jewish fundamentalism were
increasing part of the reason is
understood that's a great part of it as
far as Islamic fundamentalism is
concerned remember that's what the US
has been supporting all along the thus
most extreme Islamic fundamentalist
tyranny in the world is Saudi Arabia by
comparison Iran looks like you know a
secular or heaven but and that's been
that's the leading US ally and it's been
the same elsewhere and for good reason
the main enemy has been secular
nationalism that's dangerous secular
nationalism can lead people to seek
alternative paths of development
independence and so on so the US has
been supporting extreme fundamentalism
and in fact as secular nationalism has
been destroyed as it has to a large
extent in Lebanon to both internally
because of its internal a lot of
internal problems but also externally by
force something replaces it and what
replaces it is quite often no religious
fundamentalism I suspect that's
partially true in the United States too
we have a country where eighty percent
of the population thinks the government
is run by the
you know a few big interest looking out
for themselves not the people and I
can't do anything about it people aren't
just going to give up they're going to
turn somewhere else and one of the
places you can turn is to mega churches
you know these are phenomena that you
see all over the world one of the
effects of the us-run terror wars and
murders in national security states in
Latin America has been a rise in
Protestant fundamentalism actually it's
complex because in the 1980s the US was
a war with the Catholic Church but
that's because the Catholic Church in
Latin America committed a grave sin they
went back to the Gospels and took him
seriously they're a radical pacifist
message which you're not supposed to pay
attention to and they were organizing
peasants to read the Gospels and think
of what they mean and so on so they had
to be wiped out and there was a
two-pronged effort the u.s. ran the
violent side the Vatican defrocked them
and so on and it did pretty much
undermine them and one of the
consequences of considerable rise in
Protestant extreme fundamentalism I mean
people don't just don't give up when you
destroy their hopes they turn to
something else and it yes it's increased
to get bacteria thank you for coming if
we hope you'll come to other lectures
