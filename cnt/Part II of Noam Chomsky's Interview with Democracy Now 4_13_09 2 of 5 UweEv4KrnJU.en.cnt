this is democracy now democracynow.org
that was Bob Marley so much trouble in
the world I'm Amy Goodman is to return
now to my conversation with noam chomsky
about the economic crisis and how the
Obama administration's handling it why
do you think Obama chose to surround
himself because those are his beliefs I
mean his support comes from the his
constituency it is basically the
financial institutions just take a look
at the funding first campaign I mean the
final figures haven't come out but we
have preliminary figures and see mostly
financial institutions I mean the
financial institutions preferred him to
McCain they're the main funders for both
part you know main core funders for both
parties but considerably more to Obama
than mccain they would learn a lot from
campaign contributions in fact one of
the best predictors of policy around is
Thomas Ferguson's investment theory of
politics as he calls a very outstanding
political economist which essentially
Diskin Amin to say it in a sentence he
describes elections as occasions in
which groups of investors coalesce and
invest to control the state and he takes
a look at the you know the formation of
campaign contributors and it gives you a
surprisingly good prediction of what
policies are going to be it goes back a
century the deal and so on so yeah it
can predict pretty well what Obama is
going to do there's nothing surprising
about this it's the norm and what what's
called political democracy would you
have let Citibank would you have let
Citigroup would you have let the AIG
fail there are other possibilities so
the government could just take over the
viable parts on parts of them are
functioning parts are dysfunctional like
the toxic what they call the toxic acid
farts you know the financial
manipulations well one thing you could
do which has been suggested by a number
of economists like
Baker just take over the good parts
essentially nationalize and put them
under public control the nationalized
means public control if you have a
democracy here but if you had
functioning democracy we've been let
them be under public control and the
parts that are responsible for the huge
losses just let them go off by
themselves in fact that would be the way
of taking care of the AIG bonuses their
own screaming about in fact as Baker
pointed out just spin off the the parts
that were involved in financial
manipulations and caused the crisis let
him go bankrupt and let the executives
try to get the bonuses from a bankrupt
firm okay with no legislation necessary
that's what should be done with
Citigroup in fact interesting its kind
of happening you know after the
breakdown of glass-steagall they did
were again they made use of it under
Reubens direction among others to take
bring in insurance companies and other
risky investors now they're divesting
them and they're going in the direction
of becoming you know commercial bank
necessarily it's not the first time this
has happened pull focus on the news
today you know saying you know let's
slow down and so on well he's the one
who under Reagan who helped bailout
Citigroup last time they crashed that
time they were citibank they had
followed World Bank and IMF instructions
and lent huge amounts of money to Latin
America and were assured by the World
Bank that so fine you know markets will
take care of it etc well and it crashed
Paul Volcker came in he raised interest
rates very sharply third world countries
as payments are tied the US interest
rates couldn't pay the debts the IMF
moved in took care of it and essentially
recapitalized Citibank that's the way
the system works you make risky loans
you make a lot of money if you get into
trouble we're here to bail you out
namely the taxpayer and how do the
Republicans differ from the Democrats
and this what do you make of you see it
is just a minor
footnote that Republicans are some of
the governor's like palin like Jindal
are saying they're not going to take
stimulus man I mean we basically are a
kind of a one-party state I think see
right Mills must have pointed this out
50 years ago this is a business party
but it has factions Democrats and
Republicans and they're different they
have somewhat different constituencies
and different policies and if you look
over the years the population has gently
majority of the population has tended to
make out better under Democrats than
Republicans very wealthy have tended to
make up better than the Republicans and
Democrats so their business parties but
they're somewhat different and the
differences can have an effect however
fundamentally their the pretty much
along the same lines of the so take say
the current financial crisis actually it
began under Carter the late Carter
Administration is the one that began was
pushing for financialization of the
economy a huge growth of speculative
financial capital deregulation and so on
Reagan carried it much further and
Clinton continued and then with Bush it
kind of went off the rails so there are
differences but differences within a
pretty narrow spectrum and anyone who's
a little off the spectrum like Nobel
laureates and economics or a couple of
millimeters off the spectrum they're
basically on the outside you can
interview them but they don't show up
but at the economic summit how does the
global economy and our own economy
relate to the issue of war and u.s.
foreign policy well actually you had a
pretty good interview with Joseph
Stiglitz about that a couple of months
ago in which he discussed the
relationship of the heaps talking about
the Iraq war and as you'll recall he
pointed out correctly that the Iraq war
which first of all is going to cost
trillions of dollars I also had the
effect of sharply increasing the price
of oil predictably
and he's as he pointed out we could sort
of paper that over for a while by a
housing bubble so there was a huge
housing bubble which anyone with eyes
open could see I mean for a century
housing prices had sort of tracked you
know the economy GDP then all of a
sudden they shot way beyond the trend
line which means there's a bubble when
it's going to burst and you get into
trouble but the housing bubble which was
supervised by Alan Greenspan and with
the Democrats actually started under
Clinton it replaced the tech bubble
under Clinton and it gave an illusion of
prosperity which so you didn't see the
effects of the horizon oil prices which
went very high but if you trace all the
connections yes there's a clear
connection as he pointed out between a
war and the economic crisis in fact it's
deeper than that the u.s. is just in a
class by itself and military expenses
it's basically matches the rest of the
world and it's far more advanced well
that's drawn from somewhere now that's
money that's not being used to develop
the economy now in fact you have to add
a footnote here because part of the very
high level of us violation of free trade
principles is that the economy itself is
based on military spending to a
substantial extent so the modern you
know information revolution computers
the internet fancy software and so on
but most of that comes straight out of
the Pentagon my own University MIT was
one of the places where all of this was
developed under Pentagon contracts in
the 1950s in the 1960s in fact that's
another critical part of the way the
economy works the public pays the costs
and takes the risk of economic
development and if anything works maybe
decades later let's handed over to
private enterprise to making profits
that's a core element of the economy of
course we don't from it the third world
to do that that's considered a violation
of free trade when they do it
but it's way our economy works and it's
kind of complement agree to the
too-big-to-fail doctrine of
protectionism for financial institutions
but the general we do not have a
capitalist economy we have kind of a
state capitalist economy in which the
public has a role pay the costs take the
risks bail out if they get in trouble
and the private sector has a role make
profits and then turn to the public if
you get the trophy
