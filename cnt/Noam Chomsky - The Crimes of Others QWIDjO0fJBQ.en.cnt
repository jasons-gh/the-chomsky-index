when do you think it's right okay for an
individual in the United States to
denounce human rights violations in
another country as compared to when do
you think it's either hypocrisy or
interference now I'm talking an
individual not government again it's a
question of priorities there are you if
you're our human rights violation
somewhere makes sense to criticism
period it makes sense to criticize them
if you can do something about them if
you can't do anything about them it's
just posturing but if you can help the
human rights activists or press people
or whatever they're somewhere else
sure you should do it the question is
always priorities time and energy are
finite can't get around that and the
question is how do we compare how do we
decide how to distribute power energies
when there are human rights violations
and they're very clear criteria for that
they are almost a hundred percent
violated but they're extremely clear
what you do what you prioritize is what
any moral human being does the
predictable consequences of your own
actions that's what should be
prioritized I mean somebody else's
actions you can criticize them but
there's no particular moral value to it
unless I can somehow improve things the
one thing you can improve is what you
are doing so overwhelmingly our priority
ought to be our own engagement in human
rights violations which we can change
and incidentally that's kind of
independent of scale even if the ones
we're carrying out or not so terrible
and the ones that somebody else is
carrying out or awful but we can't do
anything about it then elementary
morality says let's focus on ourselves
the practice is almost the reverse
almost a hundred percent the reverse and
furthermore it's kind of irreversible I
mean that this great pleasure taken in
the crimes of
others especially if we can't do
anything about them if some enema stick
if it's an enemy if some enemy commits
horrible crimes and we can't do a thing
about it
it's just irresistible to posture
heroically about their crimes for one
thing it's costless because you can't do
anything about it for another thing it
shows that know who you are
another thing is you're gonna lie like a
trooper you can say anything you want
and if anybody says says well man maybe
that's not quite accurate you can come
back say oh you're a genocide supporter
you know you're in favor of Holocaust so
there's the whole stream of techniques
is available so just perfect an
intellectual it's just a lot of you know
I think you see it all over the place I
mean there's even a new literary genre
that developed in the last 10 or 15
years which is very highly respected and
that is castigating ourselves for not
criticizing strongly enough the crimes
of others that's that's just marvelous
for one thing you're criticizing
ourselves so look how are all you are
and you're criticizing ourselves for not
doing enough about the crimes of enemies
which we can't do anything about and in
fact if you look at the literature on
this it's it's shot it's astonishing and
it's carried out like almost to a tee
it's like a caricature of itself and the
people are nice people actually I know
some of them yeah perfectly nice people
perfectly decent they think we ought to
really sacrifice ourselves you know
castigate ourselves for not doing enough
about say Pol Pot's genocide which there
was no suggestion about what to do about
but then well totally ignore everything
we're doing
