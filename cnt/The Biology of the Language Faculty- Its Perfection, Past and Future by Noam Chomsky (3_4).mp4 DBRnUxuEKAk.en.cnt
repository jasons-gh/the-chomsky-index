expression like is it a topical ization
or a declarative or something else or
the information that scope let's say all
of that seems to be another kind of
semantic information and these seem to
correspond very closely and I suspect if
we knew enough would correspond exactly
to external merge for argument structure
and internal merge for everything else
so to the extent that that turns out to
be correct it gives more reason to
suppose that we're on the right track
another visitor Adam for a well-designed
system would be that it had its
stipulate no levels of representation no
significant subsystems except for the
two interfaces which presumably have to
be there although even that can be
questioned but at least the semantics
and sensorimotor interface let's assume
ur there and a well-designed system
there shouldn't be any others well work
of the 1990s pretty well showed I think
that you can dispense with the
descendants of what used to be called
deep structure and surface structure but
not only dispense with them but you do
better by eliminating them if you keep
to the simplest possible compositional
function namely merge that leaves one
level it's the level which is the result
of the application of all syntactic
operations that's the output of those
and the input of the operations that map
to the semantic interface now that was
at the time that was called LF
terminologies become confused LF is the
phrase out the term LF technical term LF
is now often used for the semantic
interface sadism of the name for what
used to be called LF but terminology a
part which that most introduces and
confusion there is there was
at these efforts to get rid of any
residue of surface and deep structure
did leave the level which has the
properties i mentioned properties of LF
in the old sense you can get rid of that
too if you develop a specific version of
Prince principles that have appeared in
repeatedly in the structure of lint in
the investigation of the structure of
language since the 1950s and in fact are
all over traditional grammar to in some
of the form namely a principles of
compositionality so if you give a
certain version of the properties of
compositionality or more recent terms of
sick Lissa tea or stricter cliff city
then you can get rid of LF as well the
way to do it seems to be to suppose and
again this is computationally makes
plenty of sense that instead of the
entire syntactic object being
transferred to the two interfaces in a
one-shot deal it's transferred to the
interfaces as it's constructed so as
some piece of the syntactic object is
constructed its transferred over to the
semantic and phonetic it's not really
phonetic sensorimotor interface and it's
there interpreted and you're not allowed
to modify the interpretation by any
subsequent syntactic operations so it
will stay the way it is I which of
course is a huge computational saving
means especially on the phonological
morphological side so you don't have to
go through these operations over and
over again because it's going to be
stable those that if you look at it
closely getting beyond what I can try to
explain that technically but turns let's
call these units that are transferred
over phases okay turns out this very
good reason to believe that is the
interior of the phase that's transferred
not the whole
good reasons for that which I won't go
into the reason basically is that
everything out of the Interior can move
on so you know by internal move the the
that this pretty good reason to believe
that there are two fundamental kinds of
phases maybe only to at least two one is
basically verbal headed by some
functional category that says I'm a
verbal phase and another clausal headed
by a functional category that says I'm a
clausal phase these are usually called
sea and the naturally and there's pretty
good reason belief that they exist the
so it appears to be the case is that in
Italy the design properties are such
that at the at these two phases the
interior of the phase is handed over by
the sensory motor in the somatic system
and they're interpreted and there's no
further access to their interior you can
it can't be modified by any further
syntactic operation now that enormously
reduces complication and it has other
important consequences I mentioned
before that in a sentence like say what
John saw a lot or for that matter John
saw John we have to be able to know
somehow whether the thing that appears
to that appears twice was created by
internal merge or external merge because
of the duality of semantics is going to
have a different interpretation
depending on which it is well that
information is available at the phase
level in fact exactly these two phase
levels at the verbal phase and the
clausal phase that information is
available but at any other position and
the computation is just not available it
takes a little work to show it but you
can't
so if there's going to be a correct
identification of copies so you'll know
that John saw John is ok but it means
two different John's the if there's
going to be a correct interpretation of
the copies then seems that for that
reason alone you need these two phases
same turns out to be true for feature
features that don't have any intrinsic
semantic properties what are called
uninterpretable features like say
nominative accusative case or plural or
singular agreement on a verb actually on
the inflection limit the verb attaches
to these don't have any intrinsic
meaning they just have a value depending
on the structure in which they appear
and that information is also available
at the phase level not before and not
after which supports again from another
point of view the conclusion that it's
precisely at this level that transfer
takes place and there are other things
of that nature so I think there's a fair
amount of evidence that not only that
construction come that computation goes
phase by phase meeting sensible
computational principles but that these
are in fact two phases and that can
plausibly be thought of as a consequence
of the strong minimalist thesis if
language is going to be perfectly
designed it looks as if that's the way
it ought to work now I don't want to say
that there incidentally this does not
mean this has been misinterpreted so let
me stress it it does not mean that there
is no further access any anywhere and
language use to the internal parts of
the computation that can't be true in
using language in speaking or
interpreting at the very least you bring
together the semantics and the
sensorimotor expressions which are
generated separately but use both of
them of course so there must be some
kind of homunculus sitting there which
has access to everything that's going
on and in fact a lot more because in
language juice you're not restricted to
what you hear of course it's easy to
show that people interpret what they
hear on the basis of expectations and
background assumptions and you know
overrides the phonetics of what they
hear very often and so on so yes there's
a homunculus who's using everything and
it's a reasonable proposal is that what
appear to be global properties of
expressions either phonetic or somatic
could well belong to the component of
the whole system of human thought an
action that involves the homunculus
bringing everything together including
both the somatic and the phonetic side
and there are other further problems
well they're each a an optimal principle
of computational efficiency like going
on to them I lost track a couple of
minutes yeah an optimal principle of
computational efficiency would be that
the information of it that when you have
a syntactic object any information about
it that's relevant to further
computation ought to be very easily and
quickly identifiable by algorithm by
some optimal algorithm and what that
means is that all the information should
be in a particular lexical item that was
the basis for the construction of it
what's projected and old for a structure
theories in the case of the verbal phase
and the clausal phase it should all
relevant information should be in the V
and the sea and that turns out to be
true like what's relevant in a verb
phrase for further computation is the
kind of verb it is and not say the kind
of object it has or prepositional phrase
that's in there and so on
so we have that property seemed as well
established the we're called the heads
of the phases which are incidentally
very easily determinable by algorithm
and where they're not you can show
interesting problems the the heads carry
all the information and those are things
that are identified well without going
on with this there are plenty of
problems which I won't go into but if
you want a good summary of them there's
a good paper by in the last issue of
syntax journal syntax by Beck's and
Roman which gives a whole pile of
problems most of them I think can be
handled properly but there are some that
clearly remain as topics for further
inquiry I'll assume that this is more or
less correct and just make a few more
comments about about it well as I said
before it's extremely easy to find
problems any infinitely many problems
whenever you look at linguistic or
apparently linguistic phenomena and you
then have two approaches that you can
take one is to develop some technology
to characterize the problem to describe
it and what's sometimes called given us
giving a solution but it's really giving
a kind of read ascription which may be a
valuable step towards organizing the
material for further inquiry and maybe
that's as far as you can go well if
that's as far as you can go then the
technology has to be attributed to
universal grammar part of the genetic
component and the language is more of a
mess than we hoped huge problem for any
study of evolution of language if
anything like that never comes along the
other possibility would be to try to
chip away at it and see if you can get a
principled explanation for at least part
of it and often that's possible and
moving towards smt well let me just
finish by illustrating what I have in
mind with one particular problem
actually it's an old saw and thinking
about how you might move towards a
principled explanation for it
the old soul is what's called ecp and
linguistic terminology so if you have a
sentence like he wondered who saw a lot
you can turn it into a declarative to an
interrogative and by moving either who
or what to the edge of the sentence of
giving the proper scope and making sure
that something appears after wonder to
give proper scope for the internal
question so you can get either the
sentence what did he wonder who saw or
who did he wonder what saw well the
first one is not a bad zens it's a
little deviant but I think for
irrelevant reasons the second one what a
determine who saw is total gibberish who
did who did eating who did he wonder
what saw this complete gibberish and
it's not obvious why that should be true
I mean one seems is easy to do as the
other but it's a very solid principle of
solid observation and holds in many
other cases well as far as I'm aware
there's only one proposal around in the
literature that seems to have anything
serious to say about that it's called
the vacuous movement hypothesis about 20
years ago it's based on an observation
namely that in who saw what or I wonder
who saw what there's no overt evidence
that the who has actually moved to the
scoville position you don't hear it you
know and then you could propose a
principle which says well if you don't
hear it you don't move it at least
overtly it still has to be moved covered
Lee somehow to give you the scope of
interpretation so that's the vacuous
movement hypothesis and it pretty much
covers the data there's only the two
problems with it however one is that
it's a new principal it's stipulated no
particular reason why should be true
just makes as much sense for the
opposite to be true the other problem
