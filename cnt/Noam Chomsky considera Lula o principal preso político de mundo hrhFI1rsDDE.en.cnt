8 and 23 and now here in the current brazil newspaper you will see the interview on 
full text made by jacob brasil and literary autonomy with the philosopher 
American sociologist and political activist noam chomsky 
during the conversation we think he analyzed the new weapons of imperialism used 
against venezuela cuba iran and brazil comparing the bolsonaro ad line for 
the philosopher squid the main political prisoner in the world 
we will follow so we are here interviewing the champions who would like 
to start by talking a little bit about your famous 1988 consensus book manufactured 
you talk about the role of the media and the press and in building consensus of the 
Brazil we recently had the election between haddad to move a new moment 
with regard to whatsapp internet and the way with social networks intervenes 
in the process how do you compare this to what you're not back there in the years 
80 regarding the operation of the pasta company 
then I, in relation to the mass press, I think the situation remains similar to 
way i wrote actually me and my collaborator adword deceased herman 
we recently updated the manufacturing homs book after the 
internet became a more present phenomenon however we decided not to 
publish it because things have not changed so much with a name since the new phenomenon of 
social networks changed things a lot brazil is a dramatic example of the strength 
extraordinary use of social networks through them the campaign to demonize 
political opposition with lies and distortions was very successful especially 
because for many Brazilians they were their only source of club information with 
eggs today na juliano see only the big company that is already well 
right but it was totally off the radar something that had never happened and 
apparently had a lot of success convincing people with all the 
types of hideous lies about what would supposedly happen if the pt were the 
years later the sound this was one of the factors that interfered in the election but 
the main factor was to silence the political opposition put Juan Antonio 
big would have something to say about it i don't know if bolsonaro are aware 
enough in the world to know who or whom he limits to the example of an employee 
benito mussolini recognized that great and needed to be silenced when 
grammys was arrested the Italian prosecutor said 
we need to silence this man for the next 20 years because voice alone is very 
dangerous to be heard there students I am there another river 
this is exactly what the right-wing coup did for Brazil last summer 
of course if squid could appear publicly he would win the elections 
so it was necessary to do something against him to put him in solitary confinement 
stop you from making any communication silence your voice 
then comes the social media campaign was grotesque and probably a 
indication that there will be a trend of what will happen more and more in the world 
angel or the weekend in fact something similar also happened in the states 
united in 2016 but not in such an extreme way 
cambridge analytics a right-wing data mining company 
worked together with facebook that gave them detailed information of 
habits of the American population before that, the American electorate 
makes it a surgical target through specific ads aimed at people 
on a relatively large scale exactly how much effect really 
caused it is hard to say 
we also saw something similar in germany in 2017 in the last federal election where the 
far-right party the aft was much better than anyone 
imagined one of the hidden factors for this the role of a company in texas that 
works to staple netanyahu le pen and other great new people this 
texan corporation teamed up with the berlin press with the office of 
facebook which obviously has a lot of information about attitudes interests 
and concerns of people across Germany and did the same thing 
target ads and messages to the right people assembled to appeal to 
them and coerced to vote for a fdd which probably increased considerably 
your number of votes 
curious that this was mentioned in the german financial press but not in 
everyday press that has remained silent about it this is the kind of 
phenomenon that we will see more and more brazil was an extreme case and of course it has 
a special impact here because of the confidence of a large part of the population 
with social media such as detachment, which facilitated the success of the 
demonization and vilification of the left after they managed to silence the voice 
of the opposition I don't need to explain to you the totally fraudulent nature 
the overthrow of the dilma and also the right-wing campaign to reverse the 
conquests in the years of the squid government found jonathan of the goals for the game 
the entire cast of 2011 the champion eight 
Paulo imagine that you have recently followed the budgets of interset 
Brazil about the squid case when you look at the Brazilian judiciary as 
it can be described as a judiciary of modern democracy and that also 
there is a lot of cooperation between the Brazilian judiciary and the Ministry of 
united states justice and the judiciary of switzerland all starting from 
assumption that brazil has a solid democratic system in its 
division of powers 
well the revelations of neither the mold in ita 7 made it absolutely clear that the 
Moorish judge was anything but a hero contrary to what was presented by the 
Moorish press was fully involved in corrupt efforts to 
trying to guarantee the squid's arrest it became public that even the ministry itself 
public did not have sufficient evidence for an indictment and the judge 
encouraged to get rid of those dangerous figures so that the coup on the right 
could continue 
it's interesting that the longer the corruption takes response but it launches 
attacks to be able to suppress there showing with the corrupt he is and gets even more 
clear the profound attack on Brazilian democracy whose last actions took place 
recently 
the three of the cup and rainy in relation to the cooperation with other judiciary we 
we can only speculate but clearly contact with the department of 
United States justice what they did exactly we have no information 
you need the same other countries the ford is hard 
say at least in the united states during the trump government that supported 
intensively those efforts what direct actions they employed we 
we just don't know but the hince revelations are dramatic 
another thing that caught my attention was the revelations that I live 
carefully left out of the investigations the years of fhc government 
this is very important because all kinds of horrible things happened in that 
at the time for example the worst crime of touching because the destruction of 
amazonia has precedent in the fhc government where it grew at a speed 
incredible maybe the biggest of all and apparently 
there was a lot of corruption or the insistence of preventing fhc from being investigated 
while trying to fabricate accusations against squid is a very serious thing 
so according to any parameter squid is the main political prisoner in the world 
[Music] I'm in Curitiba 
recently my wife valeria and i visited squid just before 
squid elections was very optimistic at that 
occasion he thought that despite having been silenced there would be a great 
pt chance to win and this before the massacre campaign on social networks 
I was informed today you probably know this better than I do 
squid was being transferred to a maximum security prison inside 
from sao paulo we're pretty much one or the other we're just 
us this is one more effort to ensure that your voice will be silenced one more voice 
to silence for 20 years until the squid's security is at risk I 
wonder what's going on I think comparing it to work the 
mussolini is not exaggerated this rescues a phrase from max about him 
once as a tragedy afterwards as a farce 
Another dark element of the Bolsonaro government has been the drumming of 
war against venezuela there are many rumors about military involvement 
Brazil in venezuela there was a tightening of the siege of venezuela brazil 
has stopped supplying food to the neighboring country 
many food specialists who used to go to venezuela during the 
squid government are no longer doing this we must interpret current policies 
from bolsonaro and campuses to venezuela the long 
the suspect who worked just follows as a mere lackey the orders of the 
united states he tries to turn brazil into a 
vassal state mostly run by the united states 
In this context, the United States is conducting a war against Venezuela on sanctions. 
horn and made the Venezuelan crisis a catastrophe it has already killed dozens of 
thousands of people the main common rosangela goalkeeper 
Venezuelan economist francisco rodrigues who is a serious analyst and 
honest and linked to the opposition stated that if sanctions continue they will kill 
hundreds of thousands of people the sentence is his the sanctions have transformed 
a manageable crisis in a catastrophe osmar handball lame where trafficking 
As for sanctions, international law has not yet reached the level 
to deal with them however sanctions must be considered acts of war 
entirely illegitimate in the case of venezuela they have a 
clear objective as in the case of iran simply crushing the economy and so 
punish the population to force it to submit to American orders 
this compares to a serious arc of war it does not depend on the opinions to 
respect of the mature government this is another issue 
only then would you say that much of the support that works today is based on 
support of the year in the united states so i think the game then local on the street its 
story I don't think bolsonaro has support 
international today Brazil became a kind of bag 
of laughter internationally is quite dramatic when compared today with the 
situation that lived with squid because squid was probably the most leader 
respected world highly respected by all sides were right-wing or 
left already bolsonaro just look at the g20 meeting 
in japan people were making fun of him 
in the mainland municipalities it is not even necessary to talk about the countless statements 
measures that transformed brazil literally a big joke to 
difference in relation to the squid era is shocking official however it has the 
support from the united states that the most powerful force in the world then is the 
enough to at least hold on while he's willing to deliver 
brazil for american investors following all american guidelines 
of how to behave internationally he will be at least protected if the 
Brazilians will tolerate this is another question carlos leite 
let's translate the terrifying west book which you put the 
united states as developers of quasi censorship techniques through the 
media and advertising almost because they are not specifically described as 
censorship techniques as they do not interrupt the discourse how to fight them 
if a goal the first would like to point out that the comment that follows 
it's not original I'll paraphrase george orwell 
I'm sure many people take their best-known book to the revolution of 
but few have read the introduction to this book the reason for this is that it 
was published was suppressed censored and was only discovered thirty years later 
oil papers is a very interesting introduction, it is directed to 
england people is an introduction to the book the animal revolution and 
says this book is obviously a satire on the totalitarian enemy only that people 
from free england shouldn't feel confident because in this 
england unpopular ideas can be suppressed without the use of 
were and john aidos cause of an hour on the west of the river 
then he starts to discuss and list the reasons for that 
and one of them is because the press is owned by the rich 
who have every interest in not seeing ideas and information appear 
the second reason that I see as the most impactful concerns good education 
if you studied at the best universities like break or oxford 
you simply have installed in you the understanding that some things don't 
can be said we can go beyond there are also things that don't 
can not even be thought of and challenges 
today with it becomes of your nature not to even be able to think of some 
things in that sense we can for example the 
vietnam war the worst crime of the post-war period to the end of that 
conflict in 1975 there was an extremely interesting moment in which the main 
intellectuals had to write and can stay on the nature of it i wrote 
about that time and it's very interesting understood through that 
we call bomb hawks the conservatives read like the hawk 
said if we had fought harder we would have won it was a stab in the 
back a movement against the war he prevented us from winning but pigeons are 
much more interesting are always the extreme liberals acted as guardians and 
they said this is the limit as far as you can go and no step beyond that number 
for we are everything so the main of these liberals anthony mills commentator of 
new york times very contrary to the vietnam war 
said the war started with clumsy efforts to try to do good good 
because they went wrong doing good because it was us because all we 
we do is good this is like the doctrine of faith a 
religious fanatic of those who need to go to pray in a sanctuary if we did 
it can only be an effort to do good there is no need to ask questions 
this is the truth that is installed in you years 
the man then he says started with fumbling efforts to do good 
although in 1969 it was clear that it was a disaster that we would not be able to take 
democracy to the people of south vietnam at a cost that was acceptable to us 
so all we were trying to do was to bring democracy that's why 
want to made use of chemical warfare to destroy crops and livestock and so 
confirm populations in concentration camps because it supported a front 
of national liberation from vietnam but we said it was to bring democracy 
the flocks mount the Portuguese particularly alarming 
is that at that time there were public opinion studies on many topics and a 
of course it was about the war about 70% of the population understands the 
war not as a mistake but there is something fundamentally wrong and immoral but 
you just couldn't say it publicly and that position remained 
for many years without ever being commented on then among well-educated intellectuals 
the spectrum is located between if we had tried more we would have won 
we were stabbed in the back until disastrous efforts to do good and take 
democracy for the people of vietnam was what i was talking about 
if you have a good education there are things that you just can't get 
thinking are like religious fanatics who cannot conceive of the idea that 
god may not even exist they cannot imagine that the 
united states may not be trying to do good in the world even though throwing gas 
on the palm or with aerial bombing the b 52 in urban areas is always an effort 
to do good or the blood of the Lord took from everyone who 
think of the agreement see the discussion around the war of 
iraq you can't find a commentator in the stream that can 
say what it already is because it was obvious this is an example of that aggression as a 
hideous international crime since it had no justification not 
there is a better example for people like obama the iraq war was an effort 
a mere mistake, this is a line similar to what they said 
Nazi generals about the war on two simultaneous fronts made by hitler one 
clumsy effort but we don't respect you for that assessment though 
respect western intellectuals who say things very similar to Goias 
the subject is the case where you can't just think I think that 
coming back to your question is the break necessary it's like you're dealing 
religious fanatics it is necessary to try to break with certain 
conventions that say there are things you can't just 
speak you cannot just think 
obviously this is the debilitating task and journalists who publish books like 
this it can be done but it is difficult because it is something that is deeply 
rooted in the press the books at school you never heard a word 
questioning this until you get involved with social movements 
so it's a struggle but it's worth it 
the interesting case the vietnam war most of the population disagreed with the 
intellectual consensus that of course can never be debated in an examination of order 
and the wind or two suns where the speech of 90 of the cases what happens 50 years 
then it is quite interesting the director of the institute who continued 
generate research with these results honest social scientists finally 
asked the question why are people saying this coming up with the answer 
obvious they thought american boys shouldn't die 
would that be the only possible answer you could easily investigate this 
you could have asked that question but you just couldn't think of it 
it's also that you've always had a life story involved in the movement 
anti war and the international solidarity movement and at the same 
time a very critical intellectual production of the post structuralist tradition 
especially French can 68 how do you combine it from the point of view 
of the unity of the struggles because many of your fighting colleagues are people with 
which you maintain great intellectual controversies 
this is an important point for us Brazilians in cuts of 
energy speaking to us there are only two questions that need to be answered 
one is about the intellectual bases in French structuralism what is your 
intellectual base the second is what is your positioning 
in my perspective the intellectual base is very narrow and its 
reactionary politics maybe I agree with these people opposed to the war 
of Iraq but not in the analysis used I have already written about it in detail but they are 
two separate questions of different types 
one on intellectual integrity the other the implications of adopting certain 
perspectives what are the implications of opposing large narratives or saying 
that there is no such thing as objective reality and it all comes down to relations of 
power i think this is highly reactionary 
and wrong send to again already enjoys 
cushion is rising today 1
