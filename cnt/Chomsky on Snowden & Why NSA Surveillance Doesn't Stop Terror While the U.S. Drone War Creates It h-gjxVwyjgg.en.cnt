on democracy now democracynow.org the
war and peace report I'm Amy Goodman
with Aaron Matta we're spending the hour
with MIT professor author and activist
Noam Chomsky we sat down with him Monday
I asked him about the significance of
the leaks by National Security Agency
whistleblower Edward Snowden and whether
he should be allowed to return to the
United States without facing any charges
he should be welcomed as the person who
carried out the obligations of the
citizen he informed American citizens of
what their government is doing to them
that's exactly what a person who's has
real patriotism not the flag-waving type
but real patriotism would do so we
should be honored not just allowed back
it's the people the government who
should be on trial I was talking to a
friend who is saying you know when you
talked about Edward Snowden what about
the issues of terrorism and having to
spy on those who might want to hurt
others if they want to the first of all
it's pretty we can raise this question
but it's academic because they're not
preventing terrorism you recall when the
Snowden revelations came out the
immediate reaction from the government
highest level keith alexander others was
that these NSA programs had stopped I
think they said 54 so acts of terror
gradually when the press started asking
questions it was whittled down to about
12 finally it came down to one and that
act of terror was a man who had sent I
think $8,500 to Somalia
that's the yield of this massive program
so and it is not intended to stop
terrorism it's intended to control the
population that's quite different you
have to be very cautious and accepting
the claims by power systems
have no reason to tell you the truth and
you have to look and ask well what is
the truth and the system is not a system
for protecting terrorism after you can
say the same about the drone
assassination program that's a global
assassination program far away the worst
act of terror in the world it's also a
terror generating program and they know
it from high places you can find
quotation after quotation where they not
I take this one case that I mentioned
before this child has was murdered in
the drone strike and after having
watched his family burned to death by
drone strike and what's the effect of of
this on people well it's to create
terror the close analysis have shown
that that's exactly what happens
very important book by Akbar Ahmed this
well important anthropologist whose
Pakistani of studies tribal systems had
worked in the Northwest Territories and
so on and it's called the fissile wonder
drone and he goes through in some detail
the effect on tribal societies of simply
murdering but from their point of view
just murdering people at random the
drone attacks remember are aimed at
people who are suspected of maybe some
day wanting to harm us
I mean suppose say that Iran was killing
people in the United States in Israel
who they thought would might some day
want to harm them they could find plenty
of people would we consider that
legitimate it's again we have the right
to carry out mass murder of suspects we
think might harm us some day now how
does the world look at this how does the
people look at this in this
village where this child was said that
they're terrorized by constant drone
strikes all over northwest Pakistan
that's true now it's over most of the
world the US war so-called war against
terror has been a smashing success
there was a small group up in the tribal
areas of mostly Pakistan and Afghanistan
al-qaeda we have succeeded in spreading
it over the whole world now they're all
everywhere you know West Africa is
Southeast Asia you know simply
generating more and more term and I
think it's you know it's it's not that
the u.s. is trying to generate terror
it's simply that it doesn't care
