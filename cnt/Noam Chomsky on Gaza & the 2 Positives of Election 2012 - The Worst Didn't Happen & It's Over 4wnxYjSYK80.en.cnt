Israel and Palestinian leaders in Gaza
have agreed to a tacit truce following
days of violence in the Gaza Strip at
least seven Palestinians including four
civilians have been killed in Israeli
attacks on Gaza since Saturday a Israeli
civilians have also been wounded by
Palestinian Rockets the temporary
ceasefire was brokered by the Egyptian
government but both sides said they're
prepared to resume attacks if it fails
well on Sunday I spoke about the
situation in Gaza with the world
renowned political dissident linguist
author MIT professor Noam Chomsky he was
speaking in princess the 32nd
anniversary of the coalition of peace
action known Chomsky recently returned
from his first visit to Gaza which he
entered from the Egyptian side of the
Rafah crossing as a member of an
academic delegation attending a
conference that causes Islamic
University this is noam chomsky talking
about his experience there it's kind of
amazing and inspiring to see people
managing somehow to survive as
essentially caged animals subject to
constant random sadistic punishment only
to humiliate them
no protects their Israel in the United
States keep them alive basically been
want them to starve to death but the
life is set up so that you can't have a
dignified decent life if I one of the
words you hear most often is dignity
they would like to have dignified lives
and the standard Israeli position is
they shouldn't raise their heads it's a
pressure cooker could blow up you know
people can live like that forever you
just grow that you described it in a
piece you wrote as an open-air prison
it's an open-air prison as soon as you
you know we've all been in jail for
civil disobedience and salinity
overwhelming feeling everyone gets is
somebody else is in total control of you
there's an arbitrary authority who can
control anything you do stand up sit
down
find something to eat you know go to the
bathroom whatever maybe they'll
determine it you can't do anything and
that's basically what it's like living I
mean you know there's people find ways
to adapt but it's just a constant its
constant subjugation to an external
force which has no purpose except to
humiliate you now of course they have
pretexts everybody has pretexts but then
nothing anything this was the first time
you were there though you've written
about this for decades I've written
about it forever and tried to get in a
couple of times from the Israeli side
but could the source close so this is
the first time I made it and themes the
region and how hard was it to get
through from Egypt
a lot of bureaucratic hassles and the
birders still apparently controlled by
the Mukhabarat you know the old security
services who were close to the liver
under Mubarak there close to the Mossad
clusters really at the CIA and and a lot
of it's hard to know how much is just
bureaucrats trying to make life
difficult for you and how much is
planned harassment I mean for people
like us you know was it matter so we
wasted two days but for the Gazans it's
no joke I mean anything if you want to
go through something like passport
control is it for three hours while they
doing pointless things that's just more
humiliation well you were there the
freedom another Freedom Flotilla ship
tried to get in through from Scandinavia
what was the response on land the
Estelle yeah we had a lot of excitement
people like to you know obviously we're
happy to know that somebody knows
they're there and that people are
actually willing to risk something
because it's not it
to try to break through and we had a
press conference at the port and to my
amazement it was actually covered in the
most reactionary newspaper in Israel
sheldon adelson's a newspaper Israel how
young look at him made a fair report of
quoted the press conference even at a
clip of it but for the people there it's
just a sign you haven't forgotten us
maybe we'll get out some now and we're
speaking for the first time after
President Obama was just re-elected your
thoughts well there are two good things
about it the one is the worst didn't
happen and it might have the second is
it's over so we can put it behind us and
get back to work exactly what you said
today I'm the whole electoral
extravaganza in my view oughta take
maybe five minutes of the time of an
activist because it's a farce I mean
there's some differences it's not zero
impact so you decide ok I'm going to
deal with it this way five minutes
finished now I go back to it matters by
changing the circumstances so you don't
have to endure things like this every
four years
and with something like as to what
you've covered as you said forever um
what gives you hope well it's the usual
thing do you see everywhere that you've
seen everywhere a lot more now that
people's resilience they just don't give
up under the worst conditions horrendous
conditions people still you know fight
for the right and don't just succumb an
immunity it's a lesson for people from
the West I mean you know we we talk
about repression but undetectable by
comparison with what most people in the
world face and if they can struggle on
there really harsh and brutal conditions
tells us we ought to be doing a lot more
professor Noam Chomsky just back from
his first trip to Gaza this is democracy
