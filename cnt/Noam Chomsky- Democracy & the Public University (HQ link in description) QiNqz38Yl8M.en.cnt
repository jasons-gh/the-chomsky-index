good afternoon everyone and welcome to a
conversation with noam chomsky we
apologize for the delay and some of you
will know there were issues with our
registration system we wanted to make
sure that we got everybody in that we
could so thank you for bearing with us
on that one mr. Chomsky is a native
Philadelphian he studied University of
Pennsylvania receiving his doctorate
1955 but will not say near accepted the
teaching position at the massachusetts
institute of technology has been at MIT
ever since nineteen sixty-six he was
appointed the ferrari hard professor of
modern languages linguistics 1976 to
professor and now he is professor
emeritus of linguistics almost still
active as a teacher and scholar he's a
linguist philosopher a cognitive
scientist and also this is what brings
us here in this particular part of the
day a political activist
authored more than 150 books are
renewably the best known living academic
and I pulled the most cited with all
living authors it's of course his role
as political activist a self-declared
libertarian socialist at least to this
particular event and he comes by that
title very honestly in 1967 with his
essay entitled responsibility to
collections published as the New York
Review of Books emerged as a leading
academic critic of American domestic and
foreign policy and most specifically the
war to be a nap I was saying to him
earlier that I first heard his name in
this very room in 1968 as an
undergraduate student when we were we
were having conversations at curls in
about war in Vietnam this was followed
in 1969 the book of essays American
power and the new mandarins many or
follow professor Chomsky has been I was
spoken in his criticism of many aspects
of modern society to me institutions
media perhaps especially corporate
capitalism military and not only in his
tree so not one to issue controversy he
has called Canada's Human Rights
Commission quote outrageous unquote and
the legislation which created it
hypocrisy quote unquote
in the process earning accolades from
figures holiday that some of you may
know as relevant can interview with CBC
he gold our former prime minister luster
Pearson or by moscone him a war criminal
and basically he's been critical of a
lack of adequate security on the
canada-us border complaining the
American government was much too laughs
when it came to its northern border so
all of us are provocative always
interesting I give you don't come ski
and Rebecca
we're all honored here
start by really big question which is
what is it makes a public university
remember there's a technical definition
the publican spirits depends on who was
in charge of the administration the fine
accents and so on either the government
or the private institution the
government is public university it is a
private institutions a private
university actually that's just
technical and the boundaries are
extremely flexible as I say take my own
University where my team technically a
private university
I got there making 55 through the early
seventies factors probably probably 90
years in the academic programs the
Pentagon not just from pentagon funny
the political science department was
openly funded by the CIA that's 100
techniques but since then the funding
has shifted but for interesting reasons
having to 90 the economy but you know it
like I say technically trident but from
another point of view is from the
administration is private or trustees
are not specifically responsible
responsible to state authorities now the
other entity go down the street to the
University of Massachusetts that's
entirely but also gets harder
right here has a huge biggest private
world private diversity but again we're
not I think most of us are not imagining
a time of day so I wonder if you could
talk more about that relationship
between democracy and public
universities sort of not just in the
technical sense of well actually the
details are revealing so while my team
was completely tentacle funded like in
1968 I was in a lab was hundred percent
by the Mithraeum services but that lab
was also in the center of any more
resistance in the country I mean
resistance not protest so several of us
moving they were on the verge of blowing
Joseph that was all under Pentagon
funding and there was interference I
mean I for years 25 years was teaching
undergraduate courses and
issues change the community
absolutely no man fun because the
university didn't shut down and get a
lot of students a lot of students who
came out in fact were involved in the
activism the 60s about were doing so it
was funded it was probably just
completely free interestingly as it's at
work corporate further through the
latest period it introduced more secrecy
and no seniors in campus there was no
more work I was actually on a
understanding pressure and whether he's
into the data is that in 1969 under law
student pressure was during the Brits
and vacuum ism it was protest about
military labs which were administered
violating was reaching kind of crisis
was nobody wanted so everybody did we
can do when there's a crisis was that
faculty committee which is defined as
internet chalices or it turned out
that's publishing we'll look at a palace
mission but a man not exactly right this
is but roughly was like this about half
the Institute budget was administering
the military labs the little turd labs
actually did classified secret military
work that was kind of a joke to like my
wife work that was a military left it
was partly open everybody would have
people went up and back to Senator
technically in the secret that the
kidney academic Simon's open again this
one I tryna porous distinction so about
half his military labs the other half
was the academic budget of the academic
budget i think in 69 maybe ninety
percent was pending unfunded no more
work exceptional science department the
political science department was
involved in
pacification programs in Vietnam
naturally under the rubric of a Peace
Research Institute but the dance secrets
in an American actress was to have but
outside political science department
there was a world acceptance isn't
anything that a boy does cadets on
military occupation through the 1970s
and after the present a pedagogue there
is a new more recent study some kind of
estimating details later roughly what
happened is that Penn funding decline
funding from the National Institute of
Health and the other government health
related Institute's increased as it were
corporate funding the shift from the
Pentagon to the National Student Health
and so on that has to do with something
that's not too well understood except by
the business world they understand but I
don't think economist understand
more works they were turning the
high-tech security they were just
helping that the Pentagon was a
technique for eluding taxpayers into
providing funds for the injured the
benefit of private corporations so a lot
of mordor was going on for example
developing computers the internet YT
revolution lasers just about hold
high-tech economy we don't live in a
capitalist society nothing remotely like
there's the innovation the initiative
the funding and so on comes in many ways
for the state sector and for business
that's great you know they way around
they brother gets bright so great at a
taxpayer pays for it on the assumption
you know we're keeping we're saving
yourself from the Russian
that's basically the system well 60s
theme running engine economy was
electronic space and the Pentagon's a
cover for that it's shifted now the
cutting edge in economies were biology
based so you should think of other
government institutes like NIH officials
from bill but that largely has to do
with where the autonomous would like in
the nineteen fifties and sixties around
in my tea and some of the other
researches university systems all over
the country the Lighting's extreme with
all over Stanford North Carolina around
the research university to get small
startups those are faculty members who
are using the government-funded research
and development to set up small
businesses and back in there were
electronics based and if they were
successful than me bought out by
Raytheon I tech the high tech companies
now if you around the campus the startup
sir and genetic engineering technology
that pharmaceuticals and the buildings
around
arnis these guys who want to milk the
research and development that's going on
under W auspices of the University and
that's the basis for a lot of the
eternal the action is going to be back
but it really took off after the Second
World War dramatically it was plenty
before but nothing like this partly
because I'm just changes in the nature
of science and technology like in the
1950s say when i got there i thi--like
exactly an engineering school like you
went there when the build things or
build a bridge or make electric circuit
or whatever it may be and now if you
want to do that stuff can go to
wentworth institute some other place mit
society person you study basic science
and basic math and you take pretty much
the same courses whether you're in
aeronautical engineering or Electrical
Engineering their wounds that adapted
but not much that the reason is the size
has just changed this was a period in
which really for the first time the
advances of science could significantly
affect that technological development
and the technology changed fast because
under sofa student learns technology
hey they won't be able to get a job 20
years from now technology will be
different if they learn fundamental
science they can certainly change the
same strim of the biological base areas
from zoo and at the same time for great
corner from the kingdom and has to do
with other things changes in the economy
structure can talk about it before but
efforts build a kind of business model
for everything brother and that includes
corporate funding while the corporate
funding has an effect for one thing it
attendants to a dr research towards
short term applied work I mean when the
Pentagon of the NIH is funding something
they're thinking about the long-term
health because when work for someone is
funding something they want to live in
themselves
they went in tomorrow so you end up
getting more short term applied research
and he once again secrecy the first it
was no secrecy
korean ability you can walk in 24 hours
a day
the it just were perfect eyes the
corporation can't force secrecy but they
could make it clear you're not gonna get
country renew something is out but have
been real skins the facts are made it
electric pages of Wall Street Journal
the scandals were secretly in the
university so their credit cheapening of
course a defective which you'd expect
when the business models impose that
shows up at lots of waves but to get
back to your question you just can't
draw mechanical conclusions from a
source of a lot of people friends of the
left
her actions of the forces from the FBI
so we were to starting the hypothesis
that that universities are in some way
or gamma function of engines of
democracy how does the idea of public
mass figure in there given what you just
private university which means you have
to pay tuition you did the tuition isn't
Harvard minutes tuition a public
university supposed to be free
that used to be the case in fact even
the private and the public universities
have changed radically since the 1970s I
hear from about the United States so by
now the get a personal example a couple
of months ago I happen to be giving
folks in mexico mexico city at the
national university the university had
said come on a desk students a pretty
high quality facilities students for
students but faculty the low salaries by
our sins are specially when a fish the
university's perfectly respectable
university free
ten years ago the government tried to
slightly raised tuition it was a
national student strike national that
they go back to us in fact one of the
main administration buildings on campus
I've discovered is still occupied by
students in the city mexico city there
is a public university which is already
free but open admissions since I've
never they have compensatory courses
because a lot of the students don't have
the right back room I was there to
people talk to students faculty
pretty impressive happy go from there
Mexico's of course of poor country I
went from there to California which may
be the richest place in the world
kalkaji they are consciously destroying
the best public education system in the
world I mean the california public
education system was pretty amazing the
universities were great universities
this lower tiers state colleges lower
college other universities well quite
high level they used to be free tuitions
of blue sky high in fact it's very
likely been talking about it now that
the Berkeley and UCLA two stars and
system proudly privatized for the role
of private universities now if you look
at P & tuitions
and the rest of the system is lowered
and quality occasionally were ended less
funding and so on you know that's one of
the richest places in the world in fact
next year this year I gets from the
first time more than I think less than
half of the cost with the university is
provided by publix early those leads
tuition that's true in many states in
the United States no well these are all
steps towards a privatizing society and
creating a kind of a two-tiered society
which is geared for the wealthy the
privileged and the rest of you can you
survive so now she can those are big
processes not just new persons
economically driven you can see that by
the very Mexico to the United States
Mexico's workman very richest country in
history
in fact couple of economies have looked
into the actual economics of it public
education in the United States totally
free Reza Bell less than 2% of the first
domestic product approximately I think
figure was about four months worth of
administrative waste in the
dysfunctional health care system is a
privatized health care system with a
total disaster naturally twice the per
capita costs of anywhere else running
for outcomes lot of the district costs
that i think the figure was about four
months of mission wasters own like that
from the bone education that fraction of
the incomes of
these are social positions in the United
States and what's public universities
must be like Mexico it should be free
that should be open alysha made option
for open admissions and resources should
do it to make sure it work that the
kinds of rising tuition fees increasing
reliance on student fees for operating
budgets and now all these things do you
think that these are just sort of mean
to what extent of a part of its or
general divestment from public sphere
public institutions and that part you
are headed toward the university but
this has a really good study
do it if you get back to get any
settings a lot of changes you gonna be
the seventies but one crucial thing
change with regard to the universities
and the 60s the late sixties electoral
successful late 60s were period a lot of
activism and terrified the business room
Tennyson terrified liberal intellectuals
across the spectrum they were in
terrified the stems are a control of
this too much democracy
which you can read two pages of opposite
ends of the spectrum loose powell who is
a corporate lawyer soon became the
Justice
it was written to the Chamber of
Commerce to their education committee
timber covers who made in business lobby
and that's the picture of the right in
the spectrum in competitive memorandum
was said to me that it was totally
paranoid but he reflected the paranoia
of the business world the business world
is basically totalitarian they're used
to running everything that if anything
has a controlled world's falling apart
that's a typical aspect movement of
military intent fellas but it shows up
in foreign policy in the lone voice so
his picture was that it was very
standard that the whole university
system and effect media
has been taken over by raging Marxist so
real if you know anything about the
facts you'd laugh if you don't
understand that this is a natural
natural perception that that out there
in metallic you can't allow anything get
out of control and it's true things were
partially out of control it also Herbert
where kuzu was teaching some students at
Harvard Nader was popular so we got to
do something to the wood about restore
the balance so do something to make sure
that in the universities in television
in the media you know there's at least
some small voice that says in the United
States is not nazi germany and maybe
something in American history is of just
extermination
like this you really haven't read it get
the citizen it's directed the business
world he says look good we are the
trusting that business world's trustees
of the universities we're the ones who
make the decisions that we provide the
tax forms that we own the media we ought
to mobilize instead of letting disturbin
mark lutheran Ralph Nader steal the
world away from us we went to mobilize
and use our power to as he says restore
the balance that he's very strong and
not attacking academic freedom is the
massive sacred doctrine to maintain it
and we are supporting academic freedom
by restoring balance move from ninety
percent control to ninety-eight percent
control the balance will be restored
that's the Reagan and perhaps follow you
know those suggestions are acknowledged
by the business world in all kind of
ways and I think one of them is rated to
issues I can't prove but it's at that
time that raising of tuitions begins and
that's a disciplinary technique if the
kids in the 1960s it could assume sure
you remember this you know I can take
off for two years and become a political
activist and work for women's rights
civil rights or something and then I'll
come back and pick up my career well
thats dangers it frees people to think
that's a terrible idea so what you want
to do is travel so that maybe some young
guy thinks he wants to be a public
interest lawyer are you made sure that
he comes out of law school with a
hundred thousand dollars in debt he's
going to go
says no choice what's he's in there
internalize the culture sub T he'll be
state and the same
so is it could have been it's a kind of
a disciplinary technique will add a lot
of other things too to the business
models are the universities also well
let's go to the other end of the
spectrum which is in Weymouth more
interesting there's a book you've read
about it is called the crisis of
democracy it's a very important book
instead making said before it's the
first publication of the Trilateral
Commission trilateral commission is
liberal international editions in the
three traffic major state capitalist
societies North America Western Europe
and to get the tenor of it that's what
the Carter Administration was drawn from
entire track that's what they are
to the three major areas well what's the
question democracy you really have to
breathe see crisis of democracy this is
too much work usually what they said is
segments of the population that are
usually passive and apathetic and
obedient are entering the public arena
and pressing their demands you know like
men elderly and the workers farmers
population special interests when Rufus
that's too much pressure on the state
they get few little special interests as
what group it isn't mentioned the
corporate sector and that's correct
because they're the national interest so
they have to be controlling
but there's pressure from the special
interests and you have to somehow paint
them back and establish what they called
more moderation of the body keep them
down with regard to the school's quite
interesting they said that is it their
words they said need institutions
responsible for the indoctrination of
Lyon are not doing their job ok schools
universities churches that are not
indoctrinating neone properly this is a
properly various suggestions to control
the media state-controlled media was
there to matters area free this liberal
school together inspected well the two
ends inspector are almost identical than
that tells you something that out of
this comes a lot of impacted I don't
have any was studied it that I can't
prove it but my strong suspicion is that
the attacks on public universities
including things like tuition quite
possibly come out of this out of this
whole mentality it was related to things
happening in the economy that's the
period when post where he got to be the
sort of dismantle the productive economy
was dismantled the move towards
financialization of the economy
but this was one of them try to reimpose
discipline so we don't have problems
from these students who were
indoctrinated properly conception is
quite real it says drink pocket the
study to change the way studies I think
it lock it would did but I think that
all these confluence of all of these
things and it's lend in the period of
this increasing repression which you're
living in schools of everywhere else
remember a since all of us in economy of
the United States's almost insane can
directly that the smallest set in motion
the kind of a vicious cycle in which
there was an increasing concentration of
wealth but everyone knows that the
United States highly illegal
quality it's in the top fraction of one
percent of the population the second of
the population so small so I picked up
in census afternoon kind of
sophisticated analysis in wealthy pick
them up but turns out the cup one-tenth
of one percent of the population has
just gotten spectacularly wealthy that's
CEOs hedge fund managers you that people
are playing
things like that enormous wealth why
maybe they don't like to believe it in
political science courses but political
says no an open though sure that wealth
entails control of the political system
so we ask concentration of economic
power increases political power is
concentrated the same way and it is used
to increase the concentration well so
over these years if you look at fiscal
policy corporate government city
regulation these are all government
legislation designed to increase the
concentration of wealth so you get a
vicious cycle they'll get a capitalist
system this would be self-regulating
because it means during the 50s and 60s
when the new regulation was around there
were any financial crisis starting in
the 70s the 80s with deregulation is cut
some financial crisis but in a
capitalist system every time if you
actually have some crisis citigroup
tanks okay think of our business
that's what happens in heiresses an axis
and what happens is that the bankers and
the investors and so on they go running
their bills now Catalina for another
rich old story from attic in the last 30
years so there's nothing self-regulating
about it we're seeing it right now it'll
win obama obama came into office and the
economic crisis the first again do is
the economics tea or me pick the guy who
created in crisis
it was even coming in the business
journals were for Lulu we picked the
guys who created the crisis he excluded
all of all other critics including very
prestigious Nobel laureates Miller's all
out so of course they design programs
that much benefited the guys who created
in prices to taxpayers to the citizens
of Boston Ashley a trillion dollars
worth of bonuses altitude but the golden
sacks the world wars culprits just
announced extended needed a half million
dollars of compensation for these guys
in one pits of 1% being increase for
their CEO who picks his word that census
salaries
these are all things happen to get the
whole society but maybe well for the
last 30 years during in population real
incomes of premium segment people are
getting by but much better work highland
security debt that's going up and asset
inflation
it's heavenly harp program it was just
an interesting article by the inspector
general of the tarp program the tarp was
available tonight he's the guy who's the
inspector general tiring bitter article
worth reading his name's Neil Barofsky
he pointed out that that bailout program
was actually a legislative bargain the
banks who were responsible for the
crisis would be bailed out country
catalyst principles but there were they
some compensation for the victims so
they would be efforts to stop
foreclosures post and provide 82 so
people who say their homes
with what he says pastor Martin was
implemented yes which Beth the half of
the people who had voices from the
political system the rest nothing
student words okay that's what happens
in the system with very high
concentration credibly by concentration
of wealth a very small sector of the
population and within political power
it's happening right in front of your
eyes it's getting worse and worse
they're setting the stage for the next
crisis then I'm going to build out again
in fact they have he points out for us
within the same article that the credit
rating agencies now are coming in the
fact that when a corporate went
investment put a bank tanks it will be
mailed out there counting that in with a
giggle credit so they're putting a cheap
credit which gives an extra advantage
that's our version of captains it's a
little bit suit you want to call it a
night
it's a system of economic and political
benefits from the extreme wealthy and
the rest can survive somehow they Canada
that's what happening the university so
all of these things are combining even
the soul roll having parallel there is a
cultural aspect like the fear of student
independence the sphere free event is
very frankly freedom is everything so
you want to make sure people that you
were properly indoctrinated and control
like
choices here insecure can take chances
in fact if you listen to Helen Greenspan
these people say talent before the West
collapse he was
district they read his testimony to
Congress every year but he's crowing
about the wonderful economies controlled
ease the ministry he says straight out
its best feature is what he calls
growing worker and security that's the
best economy and that makes sense on his
associates growing worker and security
means the working people are afraid to
ask for a raise engagement for decent
working conditions or some tender to
jobs and so I must grab on anything they
can that's great mixing color be more
healthy by standard economic principles
and so us growing workers trees great
thing that has same students if they're
insecure they're going to go out the
streets
I mean you could also argue that the
people who are in charge of
indoctrinating those students are also
this important
my schedule ization in the labor force
at the academic waiver for that's right
because you have to discipline both
students and teachers when the
Trilateral Commission goes after the
institutions responsible to the
indoctrination of the young they're
saying it's the teachers the you know
the minister jean church figures the
people charging this are out of control
it would not but they for them to look
like that but they're outta control
Anthony and what's called casualisation
labor force or convex tenure and Sonia
that's ways of disappointing faculty an
academic freedom always had two aspects
freedom to teach and freedom to learn
that you gotta come back really
University University the military
defecting university in 1568 the whole
university was closed down for a couple
of weeks literally a couple of students
for when were students those of you tur
the activist movements probably know
like Albert
students did they decided to pelicans
very conservative quiet campus 68 inside
organiz a sanctuary for the dirt going
on
so some kid decides he wants dessert
instead of just go to jail he organized
a sanctuary and stay with to leave FB I
don't cry and that they're into mission
was much better they did it very young
marine dessert or gesture he knew what
he was doing a lot of briefing go
through it in the consequences work guy
they wanted to do it so they started
press conference in the student center
students
well in about three days all this was
closed literally there was thousands of
students in the student center 24 hours
a day doing everything
was that the Institute herself
officially devoted a full day just to
consideration of the uses of technology
and society Balu this domain
technological is from the world the
question never literally people to do
the work so March was nineteen
sixty-nine they would set aside for
scotland's rally sorts of things on the
uses of technology in the society that
came a lot of things like the Union
Concerned Scientists the whole culture
the place changed
it wasn't 68 but it's just a change
place through specific that's a kind of
thing new version it would be open to
the ridge right from the University
concern itself with the use of
technology not saying they should
that's not the Institute's child but it
can be open to letting these issues be
discussed in the native and it was done
very constructive
ok
one of the issues in is a school of
public affairs that's beaten down by
Peter book he's the head of barrick gold
well what should be done I'm feeling is
that I should say and mining is an
excellent international skin it's
extremely destructive as environmentally
destructive its destructive communities
all over the place instead and tennis
way of the lead has the worst record in
the world and gold mining is definitely
the worst seem so myself so I think what
the book global therapists do naught to
do is investigate money and not
investigated but offer a voice for
people who have no voice you go down to
like the sovereign entities and protect
themselves remaining well they have
but
that's a perfectly fine research and
teaching engagement for University and
have a bit controlling pretty good
active actions but I think you see
things like that
trapped by leaving what to carry on
indoctrination
