about this intersection the Michelle
Israeli thing about connections between
arts and science you know one of the
fascinating things about this film as we
see Michelle's process as an artist as
he is trying to engage with your ideas
and his misunderstandings and in other
currents of thinking I wonder if you
could talk about your own practice of
doing science what does it actually look
like for you what is your process you
know creating an artistic what what
would be a problem like right now that
you would say you're dealing with in
your work or in a particular aporia
currently currently well the point that
Michelle emphasized correctly is at
least has been a driving force to me not
for everyone in the field
is to try to show what ought to be true
demonstrate what ought to be true it
ought to be true from various reasons
some of which indicated in the film that
the basic essential nature of language
is first of all uniform for all
languages which is why children can
learn any of them and is also
fundamentally very simple when you look
at the date of the language it looks
extremely complex but that's true of
anything you don't understand if there's
anything you don't understand it looks
close we can place the idea is to try to
see if you can extricate from the
complexity fundamental principles which
somehow make things fall into place
which otherwise didn't make any sense
like the one principle that was
mentioned at the end of the film about
seeking minimal structural business you
can pursue that much farther and a lot
of things fall into place including the
meet the way in which quite complex
sentences are interpreted if you
continue to pursue the idea that there
just has to be fundamentally simple
processes that interplay in a way which
yields observed complexity so that's the
basic
well technical questions about this
