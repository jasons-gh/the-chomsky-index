hello ladies and gentlemen please will
come in Metropole cinema once again for
those of you who are here yesterday it's
my great pleasure to welcome all of you
at almost linguistic colloquium I'm not
a linguist so I will not say anything
clever about your field I am very happy
though as a Dean of our Faculty of Arts
that distinguished specialists in the
field of linguistics from all around the
world are here today and I'm
particularly happy to welcome once again
professor Noam Chomsky from MIT
and I wish you good luck with your
debates I hope some substantial
publication will come out of your
colloquium and I will store it in my
library so thank you very much enjoy
almost if you are not from here and will
come once again so the ladies and
gentlemen colleagues and friends it's
both my privilege and duty to officially
open the second year of the linguistic
conference on income
the second time does not yet create a
tradition but we are going to do our
best to continue and prepare another
alinka in 2016 not 15 and even that ever
even a year again therefore I hope this
is not the last time you visit all
emotes and that many of you will come
again to contribute your papers posters
or active attendance to the healthy and
rich progress of former linguistic in
the middle of Europe so I welcome you
all very warmly and hope that you feel
stimulated and satisfied with the
experience as for today some of you have
already attended the morning workshops
and talk sessions but this is the first
opportunity for meeting all together to
listen to the first plenary talk apart
from the participants of our linka
conference there are also many guests
here who came to see only our first
invited speaker the number of audiences
registered made us changed a building
for this venue but we hope that this
inconvenience will be sufficiently
compensated by the comfort provided in
this traditional emotes picture space
the own Linko conference is organized by
the members of linguistic section of the
Department of English and American
Studies of the Faculty of Arts in
Pulaski University in all modes and it
is funded with the help of the European
Star
shall project money one of the
organizing team is also Professor Joseph
Emmons who will now introduce our first
plenary speaker well I'm very pleased to
see everybody here and to have this
opportunity to introduce my thesis
supervisor he once told me when I was
upset about paying some kind of summer
tuition he said don't worry you'll have
plenty of money later well it's almost
true what I'd like to say about
professor Chomsky of course has mainly
to do with linguistics and you could say
cognitive science rather than some more
general aspects of his contributions
because of this being a linguistics
conference now professor Chomsky has he
was educated at the University of
Pennsylvania all three degrees taken
there with his supervisor professor is
Ella Harris and he also received at the
same time during his PhD studies the
Harvard Junior Fellow award which seems
to been very well attributed at that
time seem to have very good results and
since then he's been officially at MIT
well in fact usually physically at MIT
but he certainly has contributed and
spread the word so to speak of formal
linguistics and mentalism shall we say
to use in early term and he's received
now honorary degrees from as far as
close as I could count around 20
countries or maybe even more
now but I don't think there's too much
point in going over various other
honours that he's had the Kyoto Prize
and cognitive science research in the
1990s and being invited to give the
prestigious John Locke lectures at
Oxford University earlier than that in
the I guess late 60s or it could have
been the 70s I don't know and I mean so
many other honors and achievements but
what I'd like to just shortly emphasize
is I think for really revolutionary
contributions among probably many more
revolutionary contributions but I think
can be very specifically attributed to
Noam Chomsky and at the same time made a
huge difference in my own intellectual
life and the life of I would say all of
us or all my contemporaries and some of
these things are not some of these four
things are not actually specifically
thought of today as his some of the
great pillars of his contributions the
first one I'd like to mention is that
it's actually Noam Chomsky that
introduced the notion of widespread use
of ungrammatical or unacceptable
sentences as judged by the native
speaker of a language as a sort of
fundamental data of syntactic theorizing
I think before professor Chomsky these
were at best from here in their
anecdotal but the idea of Chomsky's idea
professor Chomsky's idea of introducing
a formal science of the generative
grammar meant that you when you have a
science you have to know what the
scientific theory specifies and you have
to be able to say what it doesn't
specify and what it doesn't specify our
ungrammatical sentences which you don't
find in
but you do find in the intuitions of the
native speaker and very often the dative
speaker linguist and there were from
time to time
episodic criticisms of this method but
even recently in an article in the
Journal of linguistics it's been shown
by various by people who started out
with the assumption that native speaker
judgments are not reliable and native
speaker linguist judgments are not
reliable they ended up showing very
clearly that they're the most reliable
source of grammaticality and belonging
to a grammatical system of a given
language and all this every linguist
today has to take into account that this
is the fundamental method of finding the
appropriate data in syntactic research
many of course disagree with it are
constantly trying to debunk it or
whatever but it's absolutely central and
this is professor Chomsky is the person
that introduced this and made it a
standard a second thing that professor
Chomsky did which is almost the other
side of the same coin is when I was a
student at various levels in psychology
and in linguistics because I took a
couple of courses in structural
linguistics before I discovered
generative grammar
it was absolutely widespread in
unquestioned that some kind of data
collection and data or in data labeling
by what American linguist called they
called himself descriptivists or in
psychology people said behaviorists or
in philosophy people said empiricists
but in any case that notion of just data
collecting and labeling and storing that
was science or at least that was
linguistic science and we know start
with things like professor Chomsky his
review of Skinner this was gone this is
gone and I think it's they
to him that it's gone it may creep back
in various forms but it disappeared I
remember speaking to a young
psychologist at Stanford University
which is not a you know it's certainly a
highly respectable place a few years
after I got my degree who said I had my
whole career mapped out for myself at
Stanford University with what
experiments I would run and I don't know
what organisms afterwards and I've had
to change my whole notion of what my
field his field psychology was because
of this basically debunking of
empiricism and I think know'm Chomsky
very much to have rid in my intellectual
world of this well it was a kind of a
plague I think it was so unquestioned in
the 1950s and early 60s a third thing
I'd like to say which also I think
sometimes has been somehow eclipsed or
forgotten is that in the area of
phonology with Morris Halle his
colleague and made concrete in the book
sound pattern of English the idea that
phonology is a mental system with its
own operations that it's an abstract
system that it's not a system of
labeling or of collecting data but it is
a system with its own principles and in
some way its own logic and I that is was
encapsulated or made concrete by the
sound pattern of English and it seems to
me that so many of the things in that
book can still be used to great
advantage many people because they think
mostly of things like the mobile you
could call segmental phonology which was
more controversial but there are other
things in that book that work to my mind
next to perfectly like for example the
stress contour patterns and also another
important idea was the fact which was
anathema again to American structuralist
that syntactic structures and syntactic
categories seriously and centrally give
rise to the patterns the sound pattern
of English and of other languages and I
think that that contribution remains a
stellar contribution that is just so
important for now and for the future and
I hope that in the areas of phonology
certain other trends can be overcome and
we can return to this notion that the
phonological theory and phonological
analyses is a very central part of
linguistic analysis and the fourth thing
is a little bit harder to formulate and
I'll will hardly say anything but from
the very beginning I think professor
Chomsky has had a certain intuition
about the hierarchical structure of
sentences whereby they can these
structures can be very large but at any
given moment in a derivation of a
sentence there are this sort of two
domains one on top of the other and the
what you could call in traditional
grammar the dependent clause if you want
to but that's been generalized there's a
kind of a space whereby that you can
look at things and maybe remove things
and then there's a higher clause where
you do operations and where you that you
move things to and this has remained
central in his thinking from the
beginning there's a way to interpret his
very first sort of theoretical principle
in syntax the a over a principle in
these terms
certainly anybody that knows the history
of generative syntax knows that the role
of this concept called sub J sin see is
very much the notion that there's a
lower domain from which you extract to
the higher and in some way they have to
be of the same type where that's exactly
what the research program is to define
what it means of the same type and today
in minimalism there's the notion of two
phases where the lower phase is a kind
of area that you can look
while you process the upper phase and
then when that processing gets done the
lower phase becomes opaque and then you
repeat recursively again the same
processing in higher domains and I think
this latter thing is not has no danger
of somehow at least in the near future
being forgotten but what may not be
appreciated is the continuity of that
insight from the very earliest work on
say wh-questions and things like that
and successive sic licit e to the
present so these are quite four
different for quite different areas the
sort of the philosophy of science
especially human science the struggle I
would say against empiricism the
invention and absolute central role of
grammatical ungrammatical sentences as
intuited by the native speaker often by
the native speaker linguist the
interesting elaboration of a theoretical
phonology that's integrated in some
sense with syntax and the fruitfulness
of that inquiry still today I only wish
it were done more intensively and
finally this notion of a syntactic
derivations with a kind of notion of I
just kind of slightly misusing the
original sense of the phrase but this
sort of a over a principle lives down in
minimalism in the notion of the current
phase and the previous phase so I am so
happy that all these things are part of
the intellectual landscape today some of
them just taken for granted and I'm even
more happy to be able to introduce the
person that invented them and and that
promulgated them and that talked
enormous numbers of linguistic or
language analysts to use them profitably
so this is just a part of the work of
Professor Chomsky and that work is
ongoing and
going to here I think a very demanding
presentation of some of his recent ideas
and developments and I'm so proud to be
able to give the floor to him first of
all is this elaborate equipment working
you can hear okay then I'll suffer
through it
well that might perhaps be useful to
begin by sketching that what seemed to
me the most significant issues they
often tend to be lost in the pursuit of
intriguing technical details one is that
I think there's good reason to expect
that the core of syntax and virtually
all of semantics must reduce to quite
simple principles one reason is that
they're all unlearning there have been
heroic efforts to prove otherwise but
they barely touch the actual issues and
they've been shown to be a hopeless
failure when they're clear enough to
investigate the second reason is that
all of these are without significant
analog that elsewhere in the animal
world again contrary to widespread
speculation a third reason is that the
capacity for language appears to have
emerged quite suddenly and very recently
in the evolutionary record and the
monster ibly has not evolved for at
least 50 to 80 thousand years probably
shortly since shortly after it emerged
well if this is more or less accurate
than the conclusion that I stated at the
beginning follows at once well to say
that
these conclusions are controversial
would be a vast understatement as
linguists among you know on the contrary
they're vigorously denied I won't try to
review the record of claims and evidence
once again but would simply urge those
who are interested to look closely into
the topic well if these conclusions are
basically accurate as it seems to me to
be the case then the study of language
would be very well advised to follow a
maxim of Galileo's which has been the
driving force in modern science
ever since namely that nature is simple
and that it's the task of the scientists
to show it if it looks complicated and
diverse you haven't understood it yet
and in this case there are reasons such
as those I mentioned that go beyond the
general methodological and
epistemological ones the most elementary
property of language is that each
language determines an unbounded array
of hierarchically structured expressions
each of which has an interpretation at
two so-called interfaces the conceptual
intentional interface the leading what
is in fact the language of thought and
one or another sensory motor interface
and depending on the modality of
externalization and we now know that
there are many possible modalities we
can refer to this as the basic principle
in the best case the basic principle
would reduce to the simplest
computational operation that can yield
this result the operation that's found
in any computational system and this
operation along with general principles
of computational efficiency that our
language independent
organism independent maybe just
principles of the natural world these
together should yield the should account
for the observed properties of somatic
interpretation of expressions and would
also provide the basis for their
externalization sound being the usual
but not the only case the hypothesis
that this is basically correct has been
called the strong minimalist thesis SMT
this was all referred with it well
what's the simplest computational
operation found over in all
computational systems the simplest one
is an operation that takes two objects
call them x and y that have already been
constructed because it's recursive and
forms a new one call it Z and it does so
without modifying X or Y or imposing any
further structure on them specifically
without imposing ordering turns out to
be important that that's the operation
that's been called merge and recent
literature basically amounts to set
formation emerge has to logically
possible cases that called external and
internal merge the latter internal merge
automatically yields what's been called
the copy theory of movement presume that
you're familiar with this Smt holds then
that the basic principle reduces to
merge and two independent conditions of
computational complexity well from these
elementary and minimal unavoidable
assumptions alone a number of important
conclusions follow one of them is an
explanation for the strange and
ubiquitous phenomenon of displacement
which one finds everywhere in natural
language after since the 1950s it's
always seemed to me still
seems to me that the ubiquity and
centrality of the phenomena of
displacement their central role in both
syntax and semantics these have always
seemed to me to be a sufficient reason
to rule out all versions of phrase
structure grammar no matter how rich
they are that's theories of human
language because they cannot in any
sensible way accommodate this phenomenon
since the origins of generative grammar
this ubiquitous central phenomenon of
displacement has always been assumed to
be a curious imperfection of language
human language it's a feature that's
never introduced into invented and
symbolic systems but under SMT it
follows that it's the simplest case it
has to appear unless it's barred by
explicit stipulations it would be in
other words of curiosity if it were not
found everywhere so the long-standing
assumption is exactly the office should
be the opposite and correspondingly in
any approach to language that blocks
displacement under internal merge any
such approach carries a heavy empirical
burden as to explain why it's adding
unnecessary complications and if we're
sure that's true of any extra mechanisms
that are devised to try to yield the
consequences that come free under
internal murders under SMT well a second
conclusion related to this is that
internal merge with a copy theory of
movement that provides the correct forms
for semantic interpretation that
includes quite intricate cases but of
course it provides the wrong forms for
sensorimotor interpretation these forms
are derived by another operation again
of minimal computation namely the one
that deletes copies and there's good
reasons for that that minimizes
computation but that means that the
observed expressions what we actually
hear posed quite serious perceptual and
parsing problems these are the familiar
and filler gap problems anyone who's
worked on parsing and perception that
was that those are quite complicated
problems so in fact what we find if you
think about this is a deep asymmetry
between the two interfaces the poor
principles of language design satisfying
SMT are well adapted to the conceptual
intentional interface but the yoke
problems for perception and parsing
these are conclusions that are supported
by many other properties of language use
acquisition of language well these are
important facts I think and they provide
some additional reasons for returning to
a traditional conception of language as
essentially an instrument of thought
external externalization of course
occurs but it would be a secondary
phenomenon in part reflecting kind of a
reflex of properties of the sensory
motor systems systems independent of
language in fact had been around for
hundreds of thousands of years before
language emerged and it also follows
that the various uses of externalized
language in particular communication are
even more peripheral to the core of
language that's contrary to very widely
held doctrines that actually have little
basis and I think are pretty clearly
refuted if you think these things
through well a third conclusion is that
we have an immediate explanation for a
long-standing puzzle goes back to the
1950s the first period in which there
was an effort to try to
state the properties of language
precisely the question is why do
languages universally adhere to a
computationally complex ug principle of
structure dependence of rules why do
they always ignore the simplest
processing principle which relies on
linear order it's exactly contrary to
what computational efficiency would for
processing efficiency would suggest and
of course also ease of communication but
it's Universal as far as we know no
exception all constructions and all
languages so that's a puzzle
long-standing puzzle and the asymmetry
of the basic principle does account for
that does explain it and it's the only
known explanation for this very curious
phenomenon of ug there have been many
efforts in the computational cognitive
sciences to show that somehow you can
pick this up from data if they've all
totally failed they were immediately and
it doesn't really matter if they would
succeed which is almost inconceivable
because they're asking the wrong
question the question is not how its
picked up in an individual case but why
it's always chosen contrary to ease of
processing and ease of communication and
that question is not even addressed by
these failed efforts a fourth conclusion
is a suggestion about another curious
phenomenon namely the fact that
languages plainly have unvalued features
the features that are assigned values in
certain structural positions again
that's something that's never built into
artificial invented systems if you take
a look at these features they in fact
and mark the two phases that Joe
mentioned
which I think are well-motivated on
grounds of computational efficiency and
it could well be that their only
motivation their only motivation and
language design is to mark the phases
all assume here that the phases are CP
clause and V star P essentially
transitive verbs reasons discussed
elsewhere all leave to the side the
controversial status of DP which seems
to have conflicting conditions with
regard to this
I'll also assume here finally the
discussion of SMT and its consequences
that are published in a recent paper of
mine projection problems of projection
lingua about a year ago henceforth I'll
just call it V o P and I want to go on
to ask how these can be carried forward
well that paper argues that it was a
mistake in x-bar theory and its various
descendants to restrict phrase structure
grammar to ex eccentric instructions on
the contrary to end eccentric
instructions the I think that's a
mistake
on the contrary EXO centricity is very
common it includes all cases of internal
modes of move and many others if you
look at efforts over the past roughly 50
years since x-bar theory was introduced
considerable artificiality and
complexity has been necessarily
introduced in the attempt to impose endo
centricity it's discussed in VOP and if
we drop the stipulation barring EXO
centricity a lot of things follow that
one thing that follows is there is no
notion of specifier spec I'll continue
to use it here just for expository
purposes but have to bear in mind that
it's excluded by this
instead also again just for expository
purposes use familiar notions like trace
but that just means a special kind of
coffee
well the PFP argues further that
projection introduces no new category
that's contrary to race director grammar
and all of its variants and descendants
it also follows from that that tree
notations that are commonly used are
highly misleading and probably should be
abandoned because the reason is that
there's no label for the branching root
the root that branches that's just not
there
you can't avoid this in a tree notation
but it's not there in the system if
there's no new category introduced by
projection as there shouldn't be the
there is a labeling algorithm to be a
special case of minimal search under SMT
the labeling algorithm seat seeks heads
within its search domain and it observes
v.i.c the phase impenetrability
condition which means it doesn't search
too far so it searches a short distance
in its search domain to try to find the
labeling head in in head xpeke
instructions that labeling is trivial
the minimal search just finds the head
finished and then you can apply all the
usual operations the interesting cases
are XP YP constructions just sets you
remember the set XP YP where neither XP
nor wifey is a head in that case the
labouring out the labeling algorithm
automatically finds two heads it finds X
out of XP and y out of YP these are the
heads of the two non head constructions
and there's no label unless they happen
to agree in that particular case the
label is the
err of the agreeing elements the raised
element that reached that position is in
what Luigi reads equals its criterion it
follows from this disgusting VOP that
internal merge is successive cyclic it's
driven by labeling failures that
continues until the criterion is reached
and that fears descriptively to be the
case and it follows from these
elementary assumptions well there's some
striking and consequences from this one
of them is an explanation for a very
puzzling phenomenon and discovered by
Paul postal about 40 years ago what's
called raising the object the poles were
40 years ago was unform a label in any
existing theory of fact you have a lot
of evidence the facts are right and that
remains true but still wasn't formulable
but he did show convincingly that in ECM
constructions exceptional case marking
instructions like say john expects to
leave don't expect bill to leave and
that kind of construction where bill is
semantically the subject of leave it
actually is in its it's raised from the
embedded subject position of the
embedded clause it's raised to the
surface object position and a lot of
things follow from that which is very
strange phenomenon for the person who
learns language is definitely no
evidence for that zero but the fact is
it happens and yields somatic
consequences which a person who knows
language is aware of that was important
paper by cytoplasmic about 20 years ago
we added further evidence and they
showed how the result could be it
obtained within
systems that apply elsewhere what
happens is that the embedded subject
rises to the specifier of expect the
higher verb and then that verb raises
higher to the phase head v-star on that
double raising you restores the original
word order but with a different
structure which yields surprising and
interesting semantic effects and the
puzzle of course is why should such
rules apply restoring the original word
order but changing the structures and
again with no empirical evidence
available for the language learner
that's one of innumerable illustrations
of the unlearn ability of syntactic and
semantic structures they require they
can't be learned there's no evidence and
there is a solution as to why this must
take place provided by labeling theory
that's discussed in the OFI and I'll
assume it shows some further problems
with it there's another puzzling
phenomenon that might also receive the
natural explanation in these terms
there's an interesting paper by rusty
and Richie a couple of years ago
they pointed out that in spec head
constructions and where the specifier is
the sentence subject agreement tends to
be richer than in long distance
agreement with the subject remaining in
situ as it can optionally an accusative
impasses that's actually the opposite of
what you'd expect on perception and
parsing grounds the reason is that in
the spec head construction the agreement
is adjacent so it's very easily
detectable and so it doesn't have to be
signaled by a visible morphology that
whereas in the long distance case it's
not easily detectable and
you'd expect the visible morphology
would show it but it's the opposite the
visible morphology is there the rich
morphology in the case where it's not
needed for perception parsing and again
there's the reason may well be that in
the spec head construction rich
agreement is necessary for labeling
that's what gives the paired label it's
not necessary in long distance agreement
there's no labeling issue that again
looks like a case where optimal language
design conflicts with efficiency of
parsing and use and I think if you look
more closely that's a very familiar in a
very widespread phenomenon every case
that I know of where computational
efficiency inflicts with communicative
efficiency communicative efficiency is
simply ignored it's not been seen to be
a factor in language design which would
follow from the asymmetry of the
interfaces that I mentioned which itself
follows from SMT well another
long-standing puzzle has to do with the
status of the head head instructions
suppose you have two heads which one is
the label is actually a plausible answer
to this in terms of an approach to
categories which has been developed in
considerable detail several volumes by
huggy Ferreira
also discussed by aleck Moran's the
basic idea is that the substantive
elements of the lexicon are roots which
are unspecified as to category and
they're category as nominal or verbal or
whatever derives from merger with a
categorical functional element like N or
V that says what kind of category they
are what this amounts to is that all
languages are
the kind of idealized proto semitic that
we're kind of works like this suppose
furthermore that roots alone are too
weak to serve as labels just don't have
capacity to do so then it turns out that
if you have a structure say k our work
as a categorical marker like n and r is
a an unstructured root it'll follow that
K is the label you can't just labeling
algorithm won't see R which is the right
answer and that's what you want to turn
out it will also turn out that other
kinds of head-head structures are just
unlabeled which is what we want
so the problem dissolves maybe
completely let's see in a moment there's
some independent support for the
conclusion another question that arises
is what the widget reads these calls
unpublished paper the halting problem
the problem is why is there no further
raising from a criterion dr. richie
provides a characteristically
elegant solution to this but it has a
problem it requires postulating an extra
category for projection in the manner of
all variants of phrase structure grammar
from the beginning and all their
descendants and as I've just mentioned
this should be dispensable and there is
in fact a straightforward answer that
doesn't require this unwanted assumption
so it takes a the sent no no I'll write
some things in the word later but these
are simple enough so I don't have to
bother
so take the sentence if they wondered
which book he read here the phrase which
book is in a criterion and the
construction the embedded construction
is labeled it's labeled with a pair q q
the one question marketer one of the Q's
comes from this
fire which had which book the other
comes from the sister CP which is a cube
so you get labeling I suppose enough
that which book raises further was out
of its criteria position that would give
a sentence which book did they wonder he
read which of course is no good for the
usual reasons that are discussed in pio
pio won't review them the lower copy of
which book is now invisible to the
labeling algorithm which therefore
labels the embedded construction just q
that is yes or no question and in that
case of the things follow has to have
rising intonation and the second
properties but that's just simply not
interprete belen that position the joke
that's gibberish so it doesn't matter if
the WH phrase raises because it yields
gibberish let's say the outcome crashes
and essentially impossible to raise from
the criterion and specs specter cases
there's one other case that subject
predicate constructions but in these in
these constructions the subject
transfers to the interfaces within the
CP phase so it's not accessible for
raising out of the criterion some
interesting exceptions to this to which
I'll come back in a moment
he said kita Hara has pointed out that
in Japanese raising from the spec you
criterion is quite okay unlike English
and he argues that the reason is that in
the Japanese is a question particle kha
and he points out the talk and double as
the counterpart of English whether so
raising from the spec Q position does
yield the grammatical sentence fact an
embedded question there
further properties of this which he
looks into in a paper that's going to
come out soon well let's move on to some
additional problems there's one
long-standing puzzle which has always
been bothersome
there are a number of apparently
exceptional properties of subjects the
two of them or have been central to a
lot of thinking and remain recalcitrant
that one of them is a EPP the extended
projection principle the others ECP the
empty category principle and they have
some cross linguistic variation well all
of these have to do with subject so you
might suspect that the properties could
be unified and given a principled
explanation which would also account for
the parametric variation and since this
is a CP property you'd expect it to
extend somehow to the second phase V
star P if all of this can be put
together it would be a substantial
further step towards establishing SMT
and I think that's possible in terms of
labeling theory again this actually
becomes fairly intricate so I'm going to
keep to a general outline I'm going to
put aside some apparent exceptions and
problems these are going to be dealt
with in a forthcoming paper but I don't
put a couple things on the board well
begin with ECP 30 years ago and his
issue is an Italian syntax Luigi Ricci
explored the differences between English
and Italian with regard to ECP and he
traced it to a parametric difference of
richness of agreement rich agreement and
Italian and null subject languages
generally and the impoverished agreement
and
English type languages without null
subjects
so let me adopt that basic framework I
think it's basically correct so I'll use
English and Italian but it's these two
categories of languages assume further
that with retweet agreement English T
the inflectional element is similar to
our it's unable to label it's two week
with an overt subject aspect TP
construction is labeled namely by the
pair five five the paired agreeing
features but suppose these subject
raises in English to spec of CP moves
one step further it's therefore
invisible to the labeling algorithm for
the usual reasons and if this happens in
Italian the spec TP construction is
still labeled by the strong agreement
features of T but in English where all
you're seeing is T it's like a isolated
root has no features and can't be
labeled so it follows that English must
satisfy e CP but null subject languages
can ignore it just as a result of
richness of agreement given the standard
labeling theory and the same reasoning
applies to EPP standard projection
printing so the subject has to be overt
for labeling of spec TP in English but
Italian since T alone suffices to label
TP in Netanya so it follows that English
satisfies EPP but null subject languages
don't have to
well it's generally been assumed that
null subject languages have a no pro
expletive that's probably just modeled
on the English case already earlier
studied but then see there's any need
for that it simply may be that they just
like subject period since these are
unnecessary for labeling with a strong
tea
well that carries us part of the way
towards unifying ECP and EPP including
their parametric differences but it
becomes interesting when you look onto
the second phase more interesting so V
star P and here I'll have to write
something I don't know how many of you
will be able to see this but take the
sentence just Oh what's happening pardon
oh I see Oh brilliant okay so this is
Tom read a book simple sentence and I'm
going to put all sorts of Greek letters
here to refer to later
this is the trace of Tom and then
whatever follows with the right number
of right brackets so that's Tom read a
book okay just raised Tom to the the
external to the surface subject position
from spec v-star feet usual way and
let's compare it with the v-star case
here the head is not see but V Star and
give it a different name just to keep
them separate so John here's the root
the root remember is this is going to be
the sentence they expected John to wind
say the ECM case so this is expect this
is beta here's T of John again and
here's whatever follows okay so the the
analog to the T in the CP case is the R
in the V star P case is any of this
showing up there it is
okay I don't see anything so just take
your word for it okay so take that's the
CP case in the V Starfy case tom-tom
read a book and they actually they say
they expected john to win this is the
expected john to win part in the first
tom read a book tongue as racist raised
from the trace position that was spec of
e star p word based position in to the
second one john has raised from the Tres
position as well and notice that the
john is in the same structural position
as the subject Tom in the CP case first
well are is universally too weak to
label Universal English or Italian so it
follows that the analog of EPP for V
Starfy that's going to hold for both
English and Italian t varies
parametrically but R doesn't it's
universally too weak that takes care of
the very strange object raising
phenomenon that was already mentioned
EVP is necessary I'll come back to
apparent alternative which is
interesting but EPP is basically
necessary for the V star P case no
parametric variation and you're forced
to get this odd raising phenomena and
remember again how odd it is there are
rules which restore the original base
order but imposing a different structure
yielding different semantic
interpretations and everybody knows this
with no evidence at all so it must be
that it follows from deep-seated
principles which are not specific to
this construction that's there's a
general point that's often overlooked
but should be kept in mind whenever you
have which might call exotic phenomena
meaning phenomena with essentially no
data like this has absolutely no data
but there's plenty of phenomena with
almost no data for them like say
antecedent contained deletion or
parasitic gaps and a whole bunch of
others whenever you have a phenomenon
like that it must follow from already
established principles that are they're
independent of this if any of these
phenomena are handled with new rules you
know the answer is wrong because it
can't happen
there's no way to invent for the
language learner to invent new rules
there's no data at all okay so there's a
general methodological principle that
when you have exotic phenomena and
incidentally that's almost all phenomena
of all semantics and most of syntax when
you have those you cannot introduce new
rules to deal with them do devices they
have to follow from something that's
around already which is a hard problem
to solve and a challenging one but one
that's required in any serious science
of language well here's a case where I
think you can solve it now suppose we
replace the substantive nouns Tom and
John by a WH word like who in both cases
okay what happens now this is a word
that can raise further
well the relevant constructions ro this
very well as usual I'm going to see if I
can make it so that will be readable
we're not going to get sentences like
who do you think you know Tom who do you
think read the book things like that so
you'll have called this gamma who do you
the star think this is here so I don't
want to get those out of the way that's
Tom who do you think I'll call this what
I call this gamma I think that what I
want I can't you see my oh I'm gonna
call this epsilon for reasons that will
become clear later who do you think and
here we have this could be bad
Delta alpha as before I don't know
that's readable
that's who do you think that read the
book
let's move it of course I'll come back
to it let's take a look at the second
one that'll be who all that Jana like
that one did you
and then comes call this Delta then
comes this who did pretty who expected
who did you expect to leave okay those
are the two extended and sentences
they're parallel I think them if you
take a look at the first one that's easy
notice that that one's blocked so ECP
from the star P is blocked for English
it's observed for English you can't
raise it so you don't get the sentence
who do you think that read the book
that's that's a ecp constraint but you
can violate it for Italian as we've seen
but in to prime the other they can both
be violated into prime and in in the
second case the V star P phase you can
always raise the thing sometimes why is
that we'll take a look at CP it's well
known that ECP canned meat for the CP
case can be violated in English if the
complimentizer deletes okay so if
instead of that you have
zero then it's okay
you can say who do you think read the
book can't say who do you think that
read the book so there's a way out of
the ECP violation for English namely
dropped the complimentizer is this still
up there yeah okay good magic that's a
phenomenon it's called that trace filter
but notice that that trace filters
stated backwards
it's the violation of ECP by that
deletion
that's the idiosyncratic case when you
call it to that trace filter it looks
the other way around so that's bad name
for the constraint the real point is
that ECP holds generally but there's a
trick in English you can drop to that
and that allows you to escape the ECP
violation instantly it's a variety of
similar phenomenon other languages
Canadian French bunch of others this is
review of all of these in a paper by or
shlonsky and Luigi rates a couple years
ago there's also a kind of an exception
and it in English looks like an
exception Knicks oven as you know let's
pointed out that there are dialects in
English where you do escapes of that
trace filter it's probably a case where
that is there phonetically but it's
missing in the syntax it's kind of like
the residue of it's purely phonetic the
similar phenomenon and languages that
where you have inflections remaining and
see after they've been inherited by T
west-flemish and others they're just not
functioning but they are phonetically
that looks like the seven cases well in
any event we know that in English you
can violate DCP if you get rid of the
complementizer and then if they get rid
of the complimentizer the who actually
just
insitu doesn't have to rate it can't
raise to spec CP because there's no C so
the ECP doesn't arise just stays where
it is
the next phase it can raise to the
matrix position
well that that works but let's take a
look at what the order of the rules
would be just to make clear what's
happening so the order of the rules is
first inheritance meaning the features
on the phase head c and v star are
inherited by the next head down T and
are respectively that's for reasons
which are extensively discussed
elsewhere - you get internal move of who
in alpha that's the epp case 3 you get
labeling of alpha as Phi Phi criteria
labeling again for C goes to 0 that's
optional in some cases that allows who
to remain in c2 and still to be
accessible the internal move on the next
phase and finally 5 you get transfer
hold or for a second on the question
transfer flat don't come back tonight
but that's if you have that order of
rules which is a permissible order then
you get around the problems about EPP
and DCP at the V star feed level
well what about Trent what transfers
notice that the phase head see has
disappeared so you can't transfer its
complement because it's not there the
natural assumption which I'll make is
that phase hood which is a property of C
is inherited by T in the first step
along with all other properties of C so
all inflectional functional properties
of C are inherited by T includes the
five features includes tents includes
the Q feature all of these are inherited
and phase hood is inherited - but face
hood is in is activated on t only when C
is deleted otherwise C is the phase if
you get rid of the phase head the
inherited feature phase hood is
activated on T so what's transferred in
the top one the CP case is beta the beta
is what's going to be transferred and
that notice preserves the computational
simplifications of the phase
impenetrability condition that's
strongly motivated on computational
grounds it yields what traditionally was
called strict security you don't have to
look at what you've already dealt with
in further operations big computational
saving that saved it also follows that
movement must be successive cyclic
universally it's going to have visible
effects in some language that means
successive cyclic moving through V star
P that has visible effects in a couple
of languages Indonesian recent work on
think West African language were chosen
just as you find with seat beat in that
case with many languages well notice
something further a gamma is a single
phase okay to single phase that includes
who and everything follows T because
because
alpha has already been labeled right
that was labeled on the first phase
before seed deleted now C is deleted so
the CP phases D phased by disappearance
of C but there's no reason to assume
that the labeling down below that the is
no reason to assume that the movement of
who up above D labels alpha alphas
already been to label there's a
principle there
the basic principle which we need
elsewhere is that memory is that the
phase level things just keep happening
when you get to the phase level you
remember everything that happened in
that phase and it's all accessible now
that's for example the principle that's
needed to distinguish copies from
repetitions in many other cases so the
point is that the phase level gamma if
some level here alpha has already been
labeled that information stays available
and alpha stays label I mean if you want
to think of an expository device purely
expository you can think of labeling as
assigning the feature label to a
head-to-heads that are labeled against a
t and the third step down there and
nothing removes it once it's there it's
stuck that's just for exposition you
don't need the extra features just a way
of talking about phase level memory
well that analysis works for CP that
doesn't involve any new principles which
is what we want but there is the
familiar methodological question that I
mentioned why does any of this happen a
copular complementizer deletion and its
counterparts and other languages like
cookie is what i called an exotic
property is not much evidence word so
the analysis oughta be motivated by non
exotic constructions so now let's look
at these
our feet which have already written well
noted recall that the raised object
saying John expected bill to leave the
bill expected John to leave I guess it
was the raised object John is
structurally parallel to the subject in
the CP take a look at them you see
they're structurally parallel so you can
duplicate for step by step for V star P
in the step here what you want to say is
that feast
if if the star goes to zero it will be
identical to that deletion in the
idiosyncratic English case if it if the
star goes to zero then just as in the it
is syncretic that deletion case the
object which is now within beta just can
stay in situ it's now at the edge like
the external argument and the subject of
CP after C deletion and it can be
subject to extraction the next phase so
we get to the next question
why should V star become invisible
notice that this is going to be
universally because it's always there's
no that trace filter for the V star P
this is universal well it's a good
reason for it
recall that our raises to V Star okay
that forms a kind of a unit we have to
ask what the unit is but it's an amalgam
of V star R of some kind
when our raises to V Star it forms that
element and that's universal okay no no
parametric variation well what exactly
is that element here we have to take a
look at the notion of head raising there
is a conventional treatment of head
raising which assumes that when you
raise a head to a higher head than the
raised element is it joined to its host
right so when you raise v2 t you would
join v2 t but if you think about it
that's exactly backwards the
conventional treatment has everything
upside down but would you raise V to
inflection
the inflection is a join to the V it's
not that the V is a join to the
inflection okay that's universal so all
the treatments of head raising are
backwards they should go the other way
when you raise the head
to a higher head the higher ones are
joined to the one that's raised not the
other way around
the amalgams basically para merge so if
we so we have to change the conventional
theory of head raising quite independent
of this and when there's no problem with
that a conceptual problem the head
raising is a unique operation anyway and
it works the way it works there was no
particular reason other than tradition
for picking the old way and the
tradition happens to be Ramon so we pick
the right way and when you do that that
when you raise r2v star V Star is a
joined the are not it's not that ours
are joined to V Star and that's what we
want it's an R expect in this case verb
is raised to V Star and V Star just says
you know you're a verb it's a feature of
well but that means that V Star is
invisible
it's joined to our pair merge to our
it's not going to be seen by the
labeling algorithm and then it's
invisible so we get what we want are all
of these stars always invisible hence
you always lose face hood and therefore
the embedded who can stay in situ its
accessible in the next phase and you get
what appears to be a violation of ECP
universally so there are principled
reasons for the analysis in that series
there this here
there are principled reasons for a non
exotic construction namely V star P
that's everywhere and if you and that
analysis simply carries over
automatically to the exotic construction
of that deletion in English and other
counterparts and other languages well
that pretty much takes care of ECP and
EPP and including the parametric
variation for both of the phases that
these are the cases involving subjects
and there are analogs in V star P after
object raising if you think it through
the analysis consists of a lot of small
parts each one is OK in itself in accord
with SMT but they have to fit together
very precisely you think it through they
have to fit together in a very complex
way in those special assumptions but
they just have to fit and they do yield
a range of interesting conclusions which
suggests that there probably is
something right about this I suspect
it's on track
well time the result to say a couple of
words about a few problems that kind of
however around the periphery so let's go
back to this ordering again suppose that
the second one raising of I am doesn't
take place it suppose you just don't do
it okay well then what happens is the
object doesn't raise okay and then the
next thing that happens is that our
raises to V Star it's copy will be
invisible in alpha usual reasons and
that'll be labeled by beta with no head
raising that all works which means that
if you want to ensure that head raising
takes place it's necessary for the
second step to proceed the third step
I suppose the order of the second and
third step is optional just do either
well then in that case raising of object
will be optional actually lies anakin
site though argue that it is optional
they give some evidence that it is
optional there's also some counter
evidence but could be worth looking into
this that that's the reason why they
find that object raising is in fact an
optional optional operation it's just
that there's no necessary order of two
and three well if that's true you get a
way to approach a question that i didn't
mention but a tricky one so consider
again the who do you think who do you
think left that kind of case before you
raise who to the matrix to the matrix
specifier before you get to that the
object of think which I call Delta down
there or up there the object of think
has to raised the speck of Epsilon right
that's object raising normal object
raising you have to raise the object of
think CP to respect of epsilon after
that the root think raises the V story
get the original order but there is a
question how is epsilon going to be
labeled it's not like the raising of
object case because in this case what
you're raising to the specifier of
epsilon doesn't have the relevant
features it's not a noun phrase okay
let's see if it doesn't of the regular
features he shouldn't get labeling a lot
of other problems about the status of
that construction if you look at it but
none of these problems arise if Delta if
there remains in situ as it can if the
order is optional so there's an
independent reason to think that the
order may very well be optional and then
you don't have to raise
Delta you don't get the labeling and
many other problems well there's a
machine shop by pointing out that
there's some related issues interesting
ones about the order of operations so
take number one and two up there one and
two and in that list of orders notice
that their counter sickly it's always
been a problem so first you introduce
the phase head see then that gives
inheritance to tea under one which is
prior to two and then I am of internal
merge of who you get that in alpha and
that gives EVP that's a counter cyclic
order that's the analysis of EPP which
is carried over from P o P and many
earlier papers but it's problematic why
should you have counter cyclical artery
and Epstein kita horror and sealians eks
group that's published a lot of
interesting stuff they point out that
there's a further problem the actual and
I won't run through the details but do
you think it's through the counter
cyclical ordering requires a
substitution operation which is ternary
not binary even though it's very
narrowly ternary and we don't want that
if possible actually eks have a
interesting alternative it doesn't have
that but I think there's a simpler
approach which has more general
consequences you go back to t.o.p again
it takes over from earlier work the
assumption that all operations apply at
the phase level that's what's forcing
the counter seek Lissa tea but Santa
Epstein pointed out years ago that that
can't be true for external merge
external murders has to fly freely for
the phase even to be constructed and in
fact every approach the language even
those that vigorously deny it
every approach the language has either
external merge or some more complicated
counterpart that's true of construction
grammar or a unification grammar or
categorical grammars whatever you like
they all have to be able to form
syntactic objects somehow so the
simplest ways external merge that all of
these other approaches pick a much more
complicated way the usual choice is
concatenation which is much more complex
than merge for one thing it imposes
order and for another which is not often
noticed concatenate the concatenation
operation yields structures not strings
and you have to have an operation that
deletes the structures that's kind of
just usually taken for granted but it's
there so it's a much more complex
operation so either you have external
merge applying freely that's the best
case we have some more complicated
operation than you have to have a
argument for that active construction
grammar has another problem that has to
explain why this more complex operation
is bounded why doesn't it just keep
going if it did you wouldn't get
constructions lots of problems I want
you to go through them but I don't think
that's a viable alternative for reasons
like that anyhow in this framework and
in any framework external merge has to
apply everywhere so the simplest
assumption would be that merge not just
external merge applies anywhere that
would include internal merge it would
then follow that internal merge can
apply prior to introduction of C and
inheritance so you could invert 2 & 1
there right could have it the other way
around
now that wasn't done in earlier
approaches for several reasons which I
think we can now overcome the first
reason why it wasn't done is that
transfer the operation transfer has to
know whether internal merge has applied
if has to know that and all in order to
distinguish copies from repetitions okay
I have to distinguish John saw John from
John was seen John latter okay with copy
deletion first not and you have to know
that at the transfer level so it looked
as if everything has to apply there then
you see what's happened but with phase
level memory that's not necessary
I mean if at the what you can assume and
what makes sense I think is that
operation is just a fly freely all the
time when you get to the phase level you
have to ask what's going on in this
phase and you have phase level memories
so you know and then you can evaluate
everything and see if it's worked and
send it off to transfer and they can
forget about it for later operations
that's the basic structure there's
another reason which is a kind of a
lingering idea carried over from early
work that each operation has to be
motivated by satisfying some demand but
there's no reason to would retain that
assumption we can assume that operations
are free
the outcome of the operation is
evaluated at the phase level for
transfer and interpretation at the
interfaces and everything works fine so
then you can invert the order and
everything works without the counter
cyclical that's mentioned for v-star but
the same carries over to CP and that's
true whether or not seed the leaves
well that overcomes the eks objection to
the former treatment of EPP no longer
requires a weekly
ternary operation in addition to merge
so you can do things simplest possible
way with no parallel parallel
derivations then getting put together by
a ternary operation well I'll stop here
there's try to indicate that quite a lot
of consequences can follow if you pursue
the simplest possible assumptions
consistently to their limits a lot of
things that look exceptional problematic
do fall into place exactly how far this
can go will for you to determine
well of course thank you doesn't seem
quite enough but thank you professor
Johnson we have a plan for a question
session which cannot be too long
we had a PhD seminar in professor John
skis works and we collected some
questions and we are going to alternate
questions from the PhD seminar with
questions from the floor although I
can't see the floor because of the
lights that somehow will solve that and
Anya Kazan Cova who's certainly the most
enthusiastic a PhD student we have and a
very good one is going to read the
questions from the seminar we will
probably try to limit total time spent
in the question session to maybe about
20 to 25 minutes so it will take maybe
two or three questions from the seminar
and two or three questions from the
floor
yeah probably start with seven
yeah that's what airplane trips are okay
so question seven according to the
principle t linear order of words is
only a peripheral part of language if
the position and the structure changes
it shows in the linear order the order
is often the only obvious and none
ambiguous information and I use it in my
argumentation do you have any
suggestions how to avoid this problem
the reason I suggest that this comes
first this it's a pretty far-reaching
question and it's one that doesn't apply
just in the study of language it applies
in all of science all of science beyond
the most trivial level what you
presented within any science is a lot of
data none of it makes any sense it's a
big jumble and the idea is to try to
make some sense out of it and what you
do in the sciences in the modern
sciences at least since Galileo is to
try there's a from was actually a nice
phrase about this which I quoted in P o
P from the Nobel laureate address of the
Nobel laureate in physics and
jean-baptiste pirahna who pointed out
that the whole goal of science is to
replace complex visibles by simple
Invisibles that's science if you're not
doing that it's something else
it's data organization you know flower
collection but if you're which is okay I
mean sometimes it's useful but we
shouldn't confuse it with science if
it's science since Galileo it's an
effort to satisfy Galileo's Maxim nature
simple if we haven't figured it out it's
our problem data are complex you get
complex this
suppose you try to find simple
Invisibles and that's what this is about
the data that you're presented with does
of course include linear order actually
that's not entirely true
remember that's true with thee if the
modality is sound if the modalities sign
you get a more complex system because in
sign you have a visual space different
modality and there's different kinds of
arrangements those of you know something
about sign know how that works but
whatever it is the data are presented in
some sensory modality and the same is
true of experiments and physics or
biology or anything else the data are
presented in some sensory modality and
scientific work begins when you take
this messy complicated data and you show
that there's an account there's an
explanation of crucial aspects of it in
terms of simple Invisibles which I think
in the case in languages don't involve
order and I think what you're pointing
out in question 7 is yes the definition
of the sciences here's a case in point
for linguistics the sensory motor system
it's just a property of the sensory
motor system say the articulatory system
that you can't talk in parallel and you
can't talk structures so whatever is
going on in your head there's going to
come have to pass through this
superficial filter which requires linear
order and that has nothing to with
language whatsoever that's a property of
the sensory motor system which was
around for hundreds of thousands of
years before language ever emerged an
externalization just can't help passing
through one of the sensory motor systems
which gives you presents data that look
very messy and complicated and the trick
is to show something internals going on
that explains it
so I think that's a very important
question thank you
Thanks this is just a question about the
complexity of the lexical element T so
you proposed the T could be parametrized
and whether it was weak or strong with
weak T acting like loops roots and being
unable to label yet T in English also
has some five features on it which are
visible for the labeling algorithm when
there's something specifier so I think
I'm not quite understanding how the
information is organized so as to
achieve that as a result well I'm
assuming Ritchie's story that in the
null subject languages the inflectional
element what I call T here in the null
subject languages they're inherently
rich in English type languages they're
empty so in English the thing T is has
basically no properties it'll become
tensed if it's in in a CP it will be non
tensed if it's in infinitive it will
have whatever features the C tells it to
have but and once those features are
inherited if the T itself simply still
remains weak despite having those
features and therefore it alone can't
label if there's a specifier around you
get the Phi Phi labeling and it's if you
can put it metaphorically it's kind of
strengthened by the presence of the
strong features and the specifier and
then you get the two of them paired you
get a label same with our if they're
ours always weak it does get the
features from B store but it's still
weak so unless there's a specifier their
own label that's the idea
it has been stated that one of the main
motivations for pursuing the minimalist
program is the idea that languages
language constitutes a perfect system in
the sense of being as economical as
possible where is this presupposition
precipitory supposition coming from
considering that evolution often tends
to create structures that are far from
perfect regarding their ultimate use
notice that there are two notions here
one is about constituting a perfect
system the other is a system that's as
economical as possible biology evolution
tries to find the system that's as
economical as possible and sometimes it
turns out to be remarkably close to
perfect you take a look at the evolution
of various kinds of eyes and it's quite
astonishing how perfectly they work and
if you look at the origins of by now
fair numbers of amount is known about
the evolution of the eye order gearing's
work and others and it's very few
possibilities it turns out for all
phototropic entities including probably
plants only a couple of ways in which
can work because of the nature of
physical law and it works to yield
something with remarkable
characteristics you can pick up one
photon of light no it can't be more
perfect than that sometimes evolution
tries to get the most economical system
and it comes out a mess just like this
states actually everybody knows that
that's why we have back problems the
spine is very badly designed and
apparently it's not just humans
according to neuroscientists who work on
it it's all big mammals
so apparently cows have back aches too
but they don't know how to complain
about it but said that if you look at
the spine if you think if an engineer
would look at the spine they could
figure out much better ways to do it and
you sort of know why from the
evolutionary history the spine was not
didn't evolve as a way of keeping you
upright or even you know on four legs it
evolved as a way of protecting a nerve
and evolution can't do what's called
hill climbing can't go up a hill and
then come down and start over that's to
keep going from where it is so once this
was evolved to produce a to protect the
nerve it just had to do the best it
could from then on and turns out to be a
bad job but evolution is trying to get
the most economical system and sometimes
quite perfect
sometimes a mess but what about language
well here comes as the linguist among
you know there's a huge burgeoning field
of what's called evolution of language
it's a very strange field for many
reasons for one reason is languages
don't evolve so there is no such thing
as evolution of language the languages
aren't organisms they don't evolve they
change but they don't evolve and what
evolves is ug the language capacity
interestingly most of the people who
work in this field say ug doesn't exist
I don't know how they reconcile that
because that's the only thing that can
evolve the capacity for language well
about and the other reason why it's
strange is that there are basically only
two facts known about evolution of the
language capacity one of them is known
with a high degree of confidence you
know there's a kind of a speculation a
high degree of confidence is that there
has been no evolution of the language
capacity at all since our ancestors left
Africa all humans seem to have the same
language to pass
you take a child from tribe in Papua New
Guinea somewhere and raise them here or
be indistinguishable from a local child
and conversely they don't seem to be
group differences in cognitive capacity
some individual differences but I don't
see any groups if there's anything it's
extremely marginal so whatever this
thing is it hasn't evolved and at least
say 50 60 70 thousand years something
roughly like that well you go back about
maybe fifty thousand years before that
and there's no evidence that language
existed at all that's the second fact
the second fact is that in the
archaeological record you don't have
tape recordings obviously but in the
archaeological record there is what
Palio anthropologists call the Great
Leap Forward big changes that seemed to
take place pretty suddenly they were
roughly around seventy five thousand
years ago what you find in the record is
for example elaborate tool-making front
there the Neanderthals the last living
non-human comment that had extremely
complex tools in fact so complex that
modern humans can only duplicate them
with instruments but they're all the
same no matter where the Neanderthals
were over a couple hundred thousand
years they made the same tools identical
no creativity so whatever happened they
made a tool and that was it
and the same is true in other domains
starting around seventy-five thousand
years ago you suddenly get a burst of
creativity and things like tool making
and lots of other things you get the
beginnings of symbolic art
representation that it shows up you know
really dramatically with cro-magnon like
let's go so
and that's fantastic but that's what led
Picasso to say that for oh man in
hominids invented everything that we
know I actually got into the less cool
case before they were closed off 60 or
70 years ago it's amazing but but you do
get this beginnings of symbolic art you
get complex social structures which you
can tell from the archaeological remains
you get recording of astronomical events
and quite a lot of things happened it's
generally assumed that that was a
reflect that the cause of what led to
that was the emergence of language it's
hard to imagine any of this happening
without language so there's a guess
possible guess but might which probably
emerged suddenly roughly at that time
well you think about the numbers and
what it tells you is that language
emerged suddenly and it never changed
there's no later evolution those numbers
are very small and evolutionary time if
you want some details about this have a
look at some of the current books like
Ian Tattersall one of the main probably
of anthropologists as a recent book
called the Masters of the earth or
something like that and were summarizes
what we know today and that's seems to
be essentially the picture but if
anything like that is true.you it almost
follows almost instantly that what
emerged was very simple some slight
rewiring of the brain some small
mutation which would have had no
selectional pressures at all because it
would have happened didn't one person
remember but mutations don't take place
in a group though selectional pressures
it would what if the form that it would
take would just follow from natural law
might look complicated like say a
snowflake looks complicated
but because it's but it follows from
natural law there's no selectional
pressures on snowflakes
it's a case of complex visibles and
simple Invisibles finally figured out
the natural laws and language ought to
look like that so I think that's a
motivation for guessing that language
ought to be extremely sinful there's
other reasons which I mentioned like the
fact that it's almost entirely on
learning the contrary to what's claimed
every effort to try to show that
something can be learned has just except
very superficially has just collapsed
any of the kinds of things I mentioned
it totally unwearable even simple things
like structure dependence and so on and
essentially everything about semantics
but even word meaning when you think
about so it looks on learn herbal looks
as if it it has no analogues elsewhere
there's nothing in the animal world that
even remotely resembles the basic
principles or anything else and it's
hard to see how that can any that can be
the case unless in fact it is really a
very economical but the task is to show
that what ought to be the case is the
case that's the standard problem of the
scientist
so I was wondering if you could clarify
a bit this see deletion operation I
understand that it it has to be there to
have its features inherited and then go
away but what kind of operation do we
have that can get rid of something from
the structure that's not the sort of
thing you can get from merge in any no
other than deletion operation
it's probably an idiosyncratic operation
which says take away the see has
intrinsic properties like say force you
know a Maya clause and my imperative or
something and there's got to be some
operation says is lose this property I
mean it's the kind of operation that we
see all the time in phonology and the
question is well can you have an idea
Socratic counterpart to it in syntax and
probably so I think it's not the only
deletion operation yeah it's kind of
like copy deletion except in the syntax
since that was a short-answer home I
just had a ask a footnote did I hear an
implication that perhaps infinitives at
least in the standard situation of
infinitives are not CPS at any level
well I'm assuming that there are
infinitives that are CPS like in English
the 4/4 to infinitives but others like
say ecn cases are not safeties in fact
probable that the T there that the T
itself may have no properties at all and
then the question is why does T why
would the exist if it has no properties
at all and I think a possible plausible
answer to that is that the features of C
cannot the unvalued features of c can't
stay there for Mark Richards reasons
they have to go somewhere otherwise you
get crashes and they can't code the V
star because V Star already has features
so there has to be something in between
that's going to pick up their features
maybe that's all tears I think it's time
for another question which theories of
lexical primitives and the phonological
form interface do you think are the most
promising in particular
do you favor distributed morphology Nano
syntax neither aspects of both or some
other approach my field it's mostly an
open question at least remain and I
think there's there are takes a
distributed morphology which I hear a
lot about with some vendors and the
office right next to me but the
there's a rich very rich version and
there's a more restricted version the
richer version is Alec more answers the
way there's basically nothing and though
for no phonetics at all except that the
that all the phonetics has introduced at
some peripheral level the the whole
syntactic operations all from phonology
in fact just deal deal with formal
features that has a problem when he
deals I mean the problem is how do we
know that the thing that comes out cat
means cat why doesn't it mean dog that's
it well the standard way of answering is
well in the lexicon you have both of
them together but in this rich version
of distributed morphology you don't post
the phonetics only is coming out later
on and then there's some story about how
you can put them together which I don't
find very convincing
that's the rich theory of distributed
morphology there's a narrower theory
which seems to be much more plausible
which holds for example that to be
specific they take English there's the
morphology only permits a certain number
of slots gave the very few slots that
you're allowed to fill and sometimes you
get competition so when I say a past
tense of a verb you have a slot that
only one slot and two features tense and
number and you can't get them both in
because there's only one slot so
naturally if attempts because numbers
redundant okay that's another form of
distributed morphology and that I think
is very plausible and it generalized a
lot of cases but
that's doctrine on the matter this
attends how it works
you figured
I wanted to ask whether there's an
ontological difference between permits
and uncertain edge between a pair emerge
and set merge and whether this goes
against the SMT yeah set merge is just
essential ease of set formation a pair
merge is pair formation it's different
from set merge and first of all formally
it's the next most complicated operate
the simplest operations are set merge
form sets
next most complicated would be form
pairs make the sets a symmetric and
there there are things in language that
look at a symmetric like take say
adjective modification the result of
adjective modification is still nominal
right so it looks like the adjective is
a symmetrically connected to the noun
now there are further reasons for this
you can put arbitrary many modifying
phrases on a noun you can have you know
the man was tall or thick predicate and
a tall angry man
tired of tired of his job you know on
and on endlessly that's always been a
problem in generative grammar back to
the beginning because you can't have
phrase structure rules which extend
indefinitely without any internal
structure and these things can be added
they don't have in they may have
internal structure but they don't have
to you get unstructured sequences of
modifiers of arbitrary length and there
aren't any phrase structure rules no
matter how rich the system that can do
that you go back there papers by howard
lastname and other
we'll try to deal with this but the
obvious way to deal with it is to simple
is to simply suppose that these things
are a symmetrically assigned to the head
and you can keep a symmetrically
assigning them indefinitely you can have
indefinitely many relative clauses
attached to a noun let's say
indefinitely many adverbs attached to a
verb and all of these things look like a
symmetric operations that was attached
an adverb to a verb it's still verbal
and kind of ignored in the in the way
the syntactic operations work and
probably had move on just like that
except I think it's the opposite of the
way it's always been described so sure
there is an ontological difference
they're just different operations that
one of them introduces as symmetry the
other dozen tribution of the minimalist
program do you think it is necessary or
useful moving linguistics for good first
of all the minimis program so-called is
just a seamless continuation of what's
been done from the beginning I can go
back to the 1950s the first actually the
late 1940s my undergraduate thesis the
main goal was to try to get the simplest
possible formulation for normal
scientific reasons the simplicity is
essentially the same thing as
explanation
the fewer stipulations and assumptions
you have the deeper your explanations
that's why science aims to try to get
things as simple as possible to get the
explanations as far-reaching as possible
and every step has been like that
so say
shifting from having the generality and
think the early work in the fifties I
assume that the infinite generative
capacity was in the transformational
component but based on some observations
of Chuck Fillmore's turned out that you
could get a simpler analysis if you put
it in the base component so that's a
change there's difference in syntactic
structures and aspects in this respect
now that's just an attempt to find
deeper explanations with simpler
proposals and everything x-bar theory is
the same a phrase director grammar was
sort of abandoned I think correctly in
the 1960s because it's just way too
complicated you know why do you have VP
arrow V and V why don't you have VP
arrow p CP or something I'm it's all
stipulated and that was eliminated by
x-bar theory which however introduced a
mistake I think namely in the centricity
that was a bad mistake revised it but it
was an effort to make it simpler simpler
and everything else all the way through
the minimalist program just goes on with
that so it's just part of the normal
effort to try to develop a science of
language as distinct from data
collection okay but you can always do
there is one innovation in the
minimalist program which kind of led to
its name it suggests a different
research program by the early 90s a
number of people I was one major Brodie
was another couple of other people
thought it kind of had the feeling that
enough has been learned so that we can
try something more ambitious the more
ambitious thing would be what's
sometimes called approaching ug from
below so start by assuming that you have
the simplest
possible language simplest possible
system and see how far you can go
somebody around here were in courses of
mine in the 1980s you may remember that
every advanced class began by saying
let's see what the simplest possible
system would be and then let's try to
build from there
and it always collapsed you went a
little bit farther just got hopelessly
complicated by the early 90s it seemed
that that was getting better you know
that you could actually continue quite a
distance by approaching ug from below
that's strong minimalist thesis but
that's a research program the research
programs are not true or false this is a
very funny thing in the literature which
I notice all the time Peter having
refutations of the minimalist program or
arguing at the minimalist program isn't
minimalist enough for various other
things all this is totally meaningless
you can't say that about research
programs you can say a research programs
premature ill-conceived
you know other things but it can't be
true or false it's just incoherent and
the question you have to ask is is it a
research program that's productive
well these are what I've been talking
about are simply efforts to show that it
can be productive can explain things but
and how far can it go well I think
there's some reasons to believe the ones
I mentioned that it should be able to go
all the way for the evolutionary reasons
that I mentioned but that's a hard task
I showed that there's an awful lot of
complex visibles out there as everyone
mr. Chomsky thank you so much for this
stimulating afternoon and for the
tremendous efforts it was to get to this
place which is not exactly next door you
Boston thank you thank you very very
much
okay
