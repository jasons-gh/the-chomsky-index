before China Taiwan well that's an
interesting story
over the last generation the neoliberal
program is impossible the Washington
Consensus have been imposed on large
parts of the world but there has been
resistance one region of resistance was
he station
most of these station East and Southeast
Asia have somewhat resisted this that's
why you get the great growth period they
did not accept the rules of the
Washington Consensus the rules so for
example to say South Korea was
remarkable industrial development that's
I want to quite completely rejecting the
rules the very much the way the American
colonies had before the Meiji
Restoration just violate the rules
radically and so radically that in South
Korea for example the export of capital
was not only blocked but you could get
it dismantled before they weren't
fooling around yes
