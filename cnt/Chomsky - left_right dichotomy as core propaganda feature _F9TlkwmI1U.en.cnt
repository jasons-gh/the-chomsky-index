the United States it's not a palette
Aryan states propaganda line what you
get is something much more subtle but
similar namely a vigorous debate within
a framework of fixed and unquestionable
presuppositions and at those
presuppositions order brought there are
the propaganda line so take that and
I'll say the war in Vietnam anything
like war in Vietnam the presupposition
is well quote from the left end Anthony
Lewis
we began with blundering efforts to do
good but by 1969 we found that it was a
disaster which was too costly for
ourselves so therefore we should get out
that's the left the right says you're
selling us out we can win if we go in
and fight harder all that assumes that
the u.s. attack against South Vietnam
was a defense of South Vietnam that it
was an effort to do good and then we can
debate tactics that's that's perfect
propaganda if dictators had any brains
they'd do the same thing but what's
interesting is the nature of the
criticism it's purely tactic
you thought the tactics weren't going to
work how they worked fine so therefore
the everything was right the only
question you can ask we can ask that
question about the Russian invasion of
Afghanistan or it takes a the Russian
invasion that takes a Czechoslovakia in
1968 tactics were crime and kill a lot
of people so over the moment well we all
know it was wrong
no matter who worked it's irrelevant it
didn't matter that they didn't kill many
people what mattered is what they were
up to but that kind of question you
can't ask about ourselves if you ask
that about ourselves in fact it doesn't
even happen but there's a hole just to
prevent the heresy even though it barely
exists there's a very impressive array
of devices that have been constructed
just in case the heresy of being honest
ever arises there are even terms that
are used like moral relativism moral
relativism means we apply the same
standards to ourselves that we apply to
others or moral equivalence notion I
think was invented by Jean Kerr Patrick
Patrick as far as I recall to prevent
looking at ourselves or it takes a Adi
Americanism that's a notion that's used
don't as far as I know only in
totalitarian States so in the Soviet
Union old Soviet mean to be anti Soviet
with a terrible crime if under the
resilient generals to the ante Brazilian
was a crime now were the Russian
dissidents and aggression Krishna they
were opposed to the policies of the
state a favor of helping the people but
in an intellectual culture that has no
conception of democracy it becomes an
