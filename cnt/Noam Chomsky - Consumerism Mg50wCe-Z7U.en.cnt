to consumerism were abandoned by 50% and
requires consumers imagine 50% of people
or something suddenly refuses to buy but
we're committed so the question is are
we committed consumerism and what would
happen if people stopped wine
well the consumerism is doubtless
drilled in here in fact part of the
reason one of the reasons economies are
kind of speculating as to why the
economy is in such a rotten state why is
there been such low group and one of the
speculations is that it is very much
it's becoming kind of a craft economy
where you can't sell people things they
need you know like or want like say a
refrigerator or a car or something like
that I mean they wear things that people
want it I mean I remember when my
parents got a refrigerator you know it's
like a big thing and that's a Cardian
big piece of ice every day and that sort
of business so there's a reason to want
a refrigerator but you know Gillette has
just spent how many billions of dollars
on some new razor blades there's going
to be identical to the one they had
thirty years ago and the question is why
anyone would want that you know well the
economy is more and more being driven to
that so Nike for example puts out a new
line of sneakers every six weeks there's
a place called the gap I'm not exactly
sure what they sell jeans I think or
something but whatever they do they
change their line also about every six
weeks no automobiles there's this is
true and services to like if you you
know you want a long-distance carrier or
an insurance company or something this
little hundreds of different things
which are all alike you know and in fact
everyone's kind of trying to find some
niche to try to force people to consume
things they don't want you know and
that's pretty inefficient so that may be
driving down the economy you can see why
it's being done if you want to maintain
the smug prosperous Americans and make
profit on all of this
try to do if you want to start there
plenty of things that people need like
us public investment investment in say
infrastructure meaning things like
education and health and roads and
bridges you know the kind of things that
matter to people that's going way down
in the last twenty or thirty years
that's another effect of this economy
well you know those are things people
really want like it'd be nice to have
our kids educated you know and it would
be nice to get the you know pollutants
out of the environments or advising and
dying of cancer you know and all kind of
things that are nice but people put
private industries make profit out of
those I don't think the answer to this
is to stop buying you know I mean that
maybe that's okay maybe it isn't okay
but if unless the structure of power is
changed that's not going to have much of
an effect of them to put people out of
work it's the structure of power that
has to be changed why should decisions
over investment be in the hands of
private tyrannies who for their own
purposes would prefer to have to spend
you know once about 1/6 of gross
national product in marketing
meaning trying to induce people to buy
things they don't want ok that's a big
piece that's like over a trillion
dollars a year
why should decisions be in their hands
to do that rather than to then in the
hands of the public which might make
quite different decisions like for
example to improve schools or to get
people health care in order to have mass
transportation system you could use or
something like that I think that's the
question the question is ultimately
really one of the mocker see who's going
to control who decides that's the
question
yeah that's right oh is it the question
was people here being downsized many
others their will to do it that's what
Alan Greenspan is and the Clinton
administration cheering about worker
insecurity you know which is from their
point of view good for Americans so yeah
but you know you can say the same about
I mean we're people scared and it's when
they were slaves I'm gonna take slavery
did the slaves have reasons to be scared
and honey reasons to be scared does that
mean they accepted slavery well their
slavery volts all the time you know the
kinds of things that we're scared of are
pretty minor is compared with what most
people in the world face very minor in
fact and if you know if we if we're
unable to make the effort to deal with
these problems that's pretty sad and I
think that people are not that scary I
think they are made to feel helpless
they're made to feel yes there's a free
market economy and it's doing all kind
of wonders and if you feel rotten
there's something wrong with you you
know and there's nothing to do a better
in any way because it's immutable
economic laws it's kind of like arguing
against a law of gravitation or
something so they feel helpless but
they're not you know none of this stuff
is immutable laws they're not helpless
that plenty of opportunities to do
things it's happened plenty of times in
the past actually we've been through
this ourselves in the past the 1950s
were very much like today in the 1920s
or even worse you know I'm in the 1922
labor movement Ollie smashed mostly
about violence and it was like you know
end of history utopia the masters and
all that sort of thing a couple of years
later the whole country was blowing up
the 50s was again a period when it was
thought that the Beast had been caged
you know everybody was passive and
apathetic and you know consumerist and
so on well 1960s came along you know
again whole place blew up
this is a recent history trace it back
in the past it goes back as far as you
can go there's no reason to feel
helpless and but I think it doesn't make
sent a lot of sense to pick away at the
margins I mean maybe these are good
tactics but if so they're organizing
tactics like anti-consumerism might be a
tactic to get people to think about
deeper problems but in itself it's not
you know it's not doing anything to the
system I don't think
