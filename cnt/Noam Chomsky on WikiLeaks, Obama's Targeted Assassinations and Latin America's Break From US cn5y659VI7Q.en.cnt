blow BOTS this is democracy now
democracynow.org the war and peace
report I'm Amy Goodman is who returned
to her interview with noam chomsky I
spoke with him last week in the
courtyard of the King Juan Carlos first
Center at New York University I asked
him about WikiLeaks I don't see anything
that's come out of WikiLeaks was a
legitimate secret I mean WikiLeaks is a
service to the population a son should
get an award for presidential medal of
honor he's the whole WikiLeaks operation
has helped inform people about what
their elected representatives are doing
that should be
a wonderful thing to do like that's
interesting nothing really sensational
scum out but it is interesting to know
for example that when the Obama
administration actively supported the
military coup in Honduras kicked out the
democratic government and put in what
amounts to the military-backed
government that they knew exactly what
they were doing because the embassy and
learned from WikiLeaks that the embassy
and in Honduras had presented the
detailed analysis right at the beginning
of the food that it's felt the president
said the others unconstitutional it's
illegal you know so us so yes they knew
exactly what they were doing Obama and
click motor saying well I said sure or
for example when and Patterson the
Ambassador to do Pakistan some of some
of the most interesting revelations she
supports US policy in Afghanistan and
Pakistan but she didn't warn that US
policies of assassinations
pressures on Pakistan and so on carry a
real danger they carry the danger of
radicalizing Pakistan's and we're
opposition to these policies is enormous
and maybe creating even a situation
where its nuclear facilities would be
accessible to jihadi elements so it's
creating terrific thing effect Pakistan
when we're dangerous the US security in
Afghanistan this is nothing well it's
good to know that they were getting that
information they were getting that
information from analysts don't people
write about it and know about the fact
that they were getting it from the
embassy significant you think about how
these policies were escalated and in
fact it's quite striking that the
policies are undertaken in ways which
almost as soon as they're consciously
trying to increase the threat it takes a
the assassination of Osama bin Laden a
small minority of people who think I was
a crime
I don't think you should have a right to
the other countries apprehend the
suspect remember is a suspect even if
you think he's guilty apprehend after
his appt rina didn't defenseless
assassinated throws body into the ocean
civilized countries don't even notice
that was undertaken at great risk the
Navy SEALs were under orders to fight
their way out if there was a problem if
they had had to fight their way out they
would have gotten air cover and probably
intervention we could have been a war
with Pakistan Pakistan has a
professional army they're dedicated to
protecting the sovereignty of the state
very dedicated to it and they would take
this lightly war with Pakistan with the
other disasters huge nuclear facilities
laced with radical Islamic elements and
not a big part of the population with
rollover but they did it anyway then
right after it but when Pakistan was you
know totally average time we're drone
attacks in Pakistan it's kind of
smashing when you look at the planning
that's quite a the criminal
what do you think the u.s. increased
reliance President Obama increasingly
using drones to attack people in
Pakistan and Afghanistan yen and Somalia
and beyond good comment about that made
by guilty Drazen he's a military court
he was the military correspondent for
The Wall Street Journal now for some
other military analyst he pointed out
accurately disasters doing of Osama bin
Laden which keepers that he said that
there's an interesting difference
between bush and obama i mean i'm now
paraphrasing in my own terms not his
terms of the way i would have said it as
bush if push the bush administration
didn't like somebody they kidnap them
and send them to torture chambers if the
Obama administration sighs they don't
like somebody to murder them so you'll
not have perfect Ranbir's over that
tells us something else I just take a
look at the free the first Guantanamo
detainee to go to trial under Obama try
all names military commission whatever
that is the first one was a very
interesting case and sews a lot the
first one was Omar Kotter so what was
his crime his crime was that when he was
15 years old he tried to defend his
village against an attack by US forces
in Afghanistan
so that's the crime their furs repairers
to Santa bugs Avant on alone eight years
and his torture chambers then I came up
for trial under Obama and he was given a
choice you can plead not guilty and stay
in blunt and i'ma for the rest of your
life or you can plead guilty and get
another eight years so his lawyer's
advice been simply guilty well that's
justice under our constitutional law
president for a fifteen-year-old kid
defending his village against attacking
army and there was nothing said at the
worst part is there's not a said about
actually the same is true of the Earl
aki killing you know the American cleric
and the Yenisei was killed by drums he
was killed next one was killed shortly
after her son was killed there was a
little talk about the fact that he's an
American citizen he should just murder
American citizens but the New York Times
headline for travel waiting skilled said
something like West celebrates death of
radical cleric fertile isn't death is
murdered and the West celebrates the
murder of a suspect is it that deaf girl
there was something almost 800 years ago
called the Magna Carta this is a
foundation of American law that says
that no one shall be subjected to a
violation of rights without due process
of law and a fair and speedy trial it
doesn't say if you think somebody's
assisted should kill do you think the
media is improved at all as you assess
it over these decades right now it's
better than it was
a great fan of the media but I think if
you compare them and say the 50s and 60s
it's considerably improved because
there's competition and guess people
have access to other information it puts
pressure on the establishment meeting I
don't think so in fact it's more
monopolized than it was then I think
it's got some countries change not so
much more civilized country that was if
you think back what things were like in
the 60s first of all you know takes a
woman's right I mean an American history
up until quite recently under law women
were basically property they were the
property of their fathers and their
husbands summon in the early years the
country the argument against women
voting was that wouldn't be fair because
then the husband would get to the
Society of the wife as to what you stole
you know and in fact until the 1970s
that women didn't have a guaranteed
right to serve on juries because there
was it could do that kind of thing if
you go back to the universities in the
early sixties my university it was
obedience to differential white males
well that has changed that's changing
many other respects you mentioned gay
rights have been putting out of the
words not many years ago I'm there laws
against Sonny and up until recently
maybe still it's it's the same an angel
I was just a dramatic k Sarafina follow
it's one of these great mathematicians
of the Titan century Alan Turing it was
also a British war hero and he's the one
who because pretty much decrypted the
German codes and says written for an
attack he was a homosexual in the early
1950s that's against British law early
1950s he was objected to treatment to
cure this disease and the treatment was
so perf testify the committee to earth
oh well that's a long time ago that 1954
I promised her Cameron was just asked
with her time has come to issue a
related pardon that's the hundredth
anniversary of his birth and he said no
he violated the British law no pardon
for that so ok
he kills basically filled this war
heroes great mathematicians only by
language law so you know that's that's
changed a lot maybe not in Cameron's
office but it has changed in many ways
and that's effective the media because
you know the people working there a lot
of them went through this experience
Noam Chomsky what gives you hope well
lots of right here for example take the
Occupy movement verdes striking the
dramatic or take where we are today
we're at a meeting those mac loads North
Americans Latin America what's happenin
Latin American the last ten years is
just spectacular in the in the last ten
years for the first time and since the
Spanish and Portuguese coppers that's
half a millennium
Latin America has freed itself what
substantially freed itself from Western
domination and control me mainly us in
fact it was a very dramatic example of
it just a couple of weeks ago at the
Eaton's are gonna sounds for a
conference this is very important it was
not a person Secret Service scandal but
that's what the word really interesting
things that happens there's a
hemispheric conference there was two
major issues there was no declaration
because she couldn't get agreement the
two issues were Cuba and drugs the whole
hemisphere wants Cuba to be admitted to
the hemispheric to the summit the u.s.
refuses US and canada refused on drugs
practical whole hemisphere is pressing
fruits decriminalization they're
suffering the front of the other one to
get fitness over-flexes the demand for
drugs is here the supply of arms is here
and they suffer from us so they move
towards decriminalization us in canada
refused you wouldn't enter isolated
hemisphere and in fact there's a new
organization just once a year ago so
that which formerly excludes the US and
canada excludes everything else it's
quite possible that that may replace the
Organization of American States which is
us run one side of it is this is
kicked out of military bases in South
America they're also moving towards
dealing with some of their internal
problems which are severe the other
thing that's exciting there is the role
of popular movements under mass popular
movements of indigenous people working
people others have just been been
extremely successful and substantially
changing policies that serviced our
experiment so the Occupy movement gives
you home Latin America gives you a lot
of interesting things happening in the
world but I think consciousness is
changing and a lot of things I mentioned
the attitudes kids 18 to 24 just really
bad but I think that can be changed to
MIT professor Noam Chomsky world
renowned scholar dissident and linguist
he's taught more than half a century at
the massachusetts institute of
technology where he's institute
professor and professor of linguistics I
interviewed him last week here in New
York at the 45th anniversary celebration
of nakhla the North American Congress on
Latin America where he was being honored
