no tomorrow there's a party for the one
percent here in the neighborhood in an
era in which Hollywood celebrates idiots
as culture heroes against the wall
street is there good news for the
ninety-nine percent and what kind of
rules would you be looking for the good
news is people like you before
interested in overcoming the extreme
narrowness of the spectrum of political
discussion you talked about the enormous
inequities and oppression that the
society last night people who are
engaged in trying to end the extremely
ominous threat of nuclear war
environmental catastrophe and that's the
good news but that's always on a class
war goes on all the time it's usually
one side the business classes are very
dedicated to class war they never lent
constantly fighting it the question is
whether there will be an opposition if
there isn't of course they will forward
areas like the last generation of the
vicious class war with no response
that's the general neoliberal soul of
the population around the world and you
see rising opposition that stupidness
mothers are entering into the class
