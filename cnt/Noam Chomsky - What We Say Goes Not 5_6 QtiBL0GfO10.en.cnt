you've got a question I think up with
put this one here gum microphone I know
thanks for your talk tonight I'd like to
ask when you I'm up here yes ok when you
envision the world in 50 years or 100 or
500 or down the line anyway what hopes
do you have for Humanity that seem
realizable to you give you a line from
the confucian analects which it just
happened to mention talents oh it's in
my mind my favorite line from the
Analects is a definition of the
exemplary person presumably confuses the
master himself he's defined as the
person who keeps on trying although he
knows there is no hope I don't think
it's that grim there's some hope but if
you just look at projections they don't
look good projections indicate that five
hundred years from now these species may
be barely surviving the two major
threats to decent survival and they're
both getting worse one of them is
nuclear war which is getting worse
threats getting worse for the kind of
reasons I mentioned and that's
essentially terminal you know the way
out after that the others of the
environmental threat which is huge
nobody knows exactly the details but
there isn't much question that it's
quite severe and that the longer we wait
the worse it's going to get and nothing
is being done about it and that's
primarily true in the United States
we're not only is nothing being done but
there's no plan to do anything I happen
to mention this afternoon and a talk on
the environment that I just seen a study
of the
republican senatorial candidates there
are I think 48 of them and there was one
in the group who thought that we should
take anthropogenic global warming
seriously that is the idea that humans
contribute to global warming that was my
castle who lost in the primaries to
Catherine O'Donnell so now at 0 so out
of 48 Republican candidates none of them
think that science even exists we should
go we should do what we like because you
know Rush Limbaugh tells us it's fine
and sarah palin says it's great and
unfortunately a substantial part of the
population agrees and there's a huge
propaganda campaign run by the business
community they're not coy about it they
announced that they're running a
propaganda campaign to convince people
that it's all the kind of a liberal hoax
and these are serious institutional
problems the we're right at the center
of it if we don't do anything about it
nobody else is going to do very much and
so there's two two major reasons for
thinking that the chances of our being
our humans being around an any
functional state and 500 years are not
very high hello are you mr. Chomsky what
do you think the impact of art is like
Elaine O'Hara Slavic you know bringing
awareness to violence and bombing and
war can have on on the general public
well that's for the general public to
decide you have to take a look at the
very vivid description tech just take a
look at that painting that indicates
parts of the world that the United
States is bombed red spots where it's
bomb frankly the whole world is red
and it isn't even complete and its
continuing does any other country have a
record like that you might ask yourself
it's an interesting question well you
know the answer that's what it means to
say we say go what we say goes and we
have the force to prove it the United
States maybe you know maybe it doesn't
maybe the industrial production is
shifted abroad maybe we act where we
look like a third-world society in terms
of infrastructure you know trains
medical conditions and so on but there's
one dimension in which the u.s. is
supreme namely the capacity to destroy
the u.s. spends about as much on
destruction as the rest of the world
combined it's much more advanced
technologically more advanced new
fantastic means of destruction being
developed constantly that's what your
tax dollars are going for and and these
are not theoretical systems they're used
all over the world that's what those red
spots are and is you could look around
the world right now and they're being
used and new ones are being threatened
like Iran to deal with this terrible
threat of Iran and so it's not that Iran
is a nice place the Iranian government
is a threat to its own population but
that's not the reason why the u.s.
concerned with it the US allies are an
even greater threat to their own
population so that's not the reason but
so if exhibitions like this are
effective or you know goya's famous
wartime paintings and others will
Guernica Picasso's Guernica you know
books you know Johnny got his gun you
know the whole pile of war literature if
that's effective maybe people will do
something
hello and I wonder what is your opinion
about the role of the International
Court of Justice to bring double stunt
to read less double standards in this
world if you think this institution will
be it will be more effective in order to
bring more justice and bass in this
conflict works that fits that's a good
question it fits very much into this
system the International Court of
Justice was part of the UN system there
was precedence but it's basically part
of the UN system that was formed right
after the Second World War the United
States was instrumental in establishing
it and the united states joined the
international court of justice but with
a little-known reservation the
reservation was that the u.s. accepts
its jurisdiction except with regard to
international treaties which means that
the u.s. is exempt from the UN Charter
the basis for modern international law
it's exempt from the Organization of
American States Charter which bars any
interference in the affairs of other
states similarly the u.s. finally signed
the Genocide Convention after 40 years
but with a reservation saying it does
not apply to the United States and all
of these things have been implemented
these are things people and learn in
elementary school when the US was
carrying out a major terrorist or
against Nicaragua and Nicaragua is a
state you know so it can do something
about it so it appealed to the
International Court of Justice and its
case was actually handled by a
famous Harvard Law Professor well-known
law professor Arab chaise but most of
the case nicaragua's case was thrown out
by the World Court because they were
appealing to international law and the
u.s. is exempt from international law so
and the World Court rules are that a
country can you know is exempt than if a
country excuses itself than you can't
it's not under their jurisdiction and
going back to 1946 the u.s. is excused
itself from international law so
Nicaragua couldn't charge aggression
which is what it really was or even
international terrorism they were the
Nicaraguan case was restricted to a
bilateral us Nicaraguan treaty which
Nicaragua said was violated well the
World Court ruled in favor of Nicaragua
even on those narrow grounds accused the
United States of what it called unlawful
use of force which is legalese for
international terrorism it ordered the
United States to pay I think with 17
billion dollars or something in huge
reparations Congress responded this is
democrat-controlled congress by
increasing the aid to the Contras the
terrorist force attacking Nicaragua the
New York Times responded by dismissing
the World Court as a hostile forum so
therefore insignificant you can tell
that it's hostile because it ruled
against the United States the Nicaragua
brought the broader resolution of the
Security Council at twice in fact twice
the Security Council passed resolutions
calling didn't mention the United States
call it endorsing the World Court
decision and calling on all states to
observe international law the United
States veto them both times Europe our
vassal can help by abstaining so they
couldn't vote against it you know but
they abstained it made about maybe two
lines in the in the press and it's
forgotten how many people even know
about it
ok that's the World Court it's fine
institution if it can if it can function
that's not the only case I mean look
this front pages every day or talk about
you know the israel-palestine
negotiations I mean it's ludicrous if
there were serious negotiations there
would be some neutral element conducting
them and on one side would be Israel in
the United States and on the other side
would be the entire world because there
is a dispute and it's been going on for
35 years since the u.s. vetoed the first
Security Council resolution calling for
a two-state settlement on the
international border its continued since
then run through it but the US and
Israel unilaterally oppose the the world
on this and furthermore they both agree
that that talk about settlement
expansion is like a joke that's a minor
footnote the question is the settlements
not settlement expansion they're all
illegal perfectly obvious in fact the
World Court ruled on this a couple of
years ago the World Court ruled on the
settlements and said they're the
unanimous decision including the US
Justice and a separate declaration
saying that the settlements are in
violation of the Geneva Conventions core
of international law in fact Israel
itself agreed that this back in 1967 the
US when it was still part of the world
also agreed that they were illegal that
disappeared under Reagan well that's
what would happen if if there were
negotiations now there's some farcical
proceedings in which we're not supposed
to notice that the United States is not
a neutral arbiter its participant
against the rest of the world that's the
World Court on that case and it's the
same elsewhere the world is not ruled by
law they may you may teach that in you
know courses on political science or
something but the world is ruled by
force
this is the fact we may not like it but
it's fact and since we have most of the
force Bush can say things like what we
say goes even though it doesn't quite
work this is Bush one incidentally the
good bush hi you talked a lot about US
policies and things that you don't
appreciate are there any actions that
we've taken that you do like anything
the US has done that you do like you
could ask that about any state why pick
the US states are not moral agents their
systems of power and they typically work
in support of their constituency which
is domestic concentrations of power this
radical idea incidentally goes back to
Adam Smith supposed to revere Adam Smith
butts very important not to read him
freedom turns out that the mythology
about him was mostly totally false but
one of the things he pointed out he's
talking about England of course this is
in wealth of nations he says that in
England the quoting it now the principal
architects of policy are the merchants
and manufacturers they were the people
who own lingual at the time and they
make sure that policy is designed so
that their interests are most peculiarly
attended to taken care of no matter how
Grievous the effect on others including
it's not only the people of England but
particularly the victims of what he
called the savage and justice of the
Europeans abroad as an honest person he
was considered certain primarily with
england and india which it was very
bitter about that's way it works thank
you
