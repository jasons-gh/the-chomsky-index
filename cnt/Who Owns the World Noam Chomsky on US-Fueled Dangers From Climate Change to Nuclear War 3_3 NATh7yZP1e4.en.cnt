the war and peace report were on a
hundred city tour today in Portland
Oregon I'm Amy Goodman as we continue
our hour today with world-renowned
political dissident linguist author and
professor emeritus at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology Noam Chomsky his
recent talk entitled who owns the world
in a few weeks we'll be commemorating
the 50th anniversary of the most
dangerous moment in human history those
are the words of historian Kennedy
advisor Arthur Schlesinger is referring
of course to the October 1962 Missile
Crisis the most dangerous moment in
human history others agree at that time
Kennedy raised the nuclear alert to the
second-highest level just short of
launching weapons he authorized NATO
aircraft with Turkish or other pilots to
take off fly to Moscow drop bombs
setting off a likely nuclear
conflagration at the peak of the missile
crisis the Kennedy estimated the
probability of nuclear war perhaps fifty
percent it's a war that would destroy
the northern hemisphere President
Eisenhower and warned and facing that
risk Kennedy refused to agree publicly
to an offer by her stuff to end the
crisis by simultaneous withdrawal of
Russian missiles from Cuba and us
missiles from Turkey these were obsolete
missiles they were already being
replaced by invulnerable polaris
submarines but it was felt necessary to
firmly establish the principle that
Russia has no right to have any
offensive weapons anywhere
the borders of the USSR even to defend
an ally against us attack that's now
recognized to be the prime reason for
deploying missiles there and actually a
plausible one meanwhile the United
States must retain the right to have
them all over the world targeting Russia
or China or any other enemy in fact in
1962 the United stree cently learned the
United States had just secretly deployed
nuclear missiles to Okinawa aimed at
China there was a moment of elevated
regional tensions all that is very
consistent with grand area conceptions
the ones I mentioned that were developed
by Roosevelt's planners well fortunately
in 1962 per shift back down but the
world can't be assured of such sanity
forever and particularly threatening my
view is that intellectual opinion and
even scholarship a hell Kennedy's
behavior is his finest hour my own view
this is one of the worst moments in
history inability to face the truth
about ourselves is all too common a
feature of the intellectual cultural so
personal life has ominous implications
ten years later in 1973 during the
Israel Arab war the Henry Kissinger
called a high-level nuclear alert the
purpose was to warn the Russians to keep
hands off while he was so we have
recently learned he was secretly
informing Israel that they were
authorized to violate the ceasefire that
had been imposed jointly by the US and
Russia when reagan came into office a
couple of years later the united states
launched operations probing russian
defence
flying into Russia to probe defenses and
simulating air and naval attacks I mean
while placing Pershing missiles in
Germany that had a five minute flight
time to Russian targets they were
providing what the CIA called a super
sudden first-strike capability the
Russians not surprisingly were deeply
concerned actually that led to a major
war scare in 1983 there have been
hundreds of cases when human
intervention aborted first strike
launched just minutes before launch
that's after automated systems gave
false alarms that we don't have Russian
records but there's no doubt that their
systems are far more accident prone not
just a near miracle that nuclear war has
been avoided so far meanwhile India and
Pakistan have come close to nuclear war
several times and the crises that led to
that especially Kashmir remain both
India and Pakistan have refused to sign
the non-proliferation treaty along with
Israel and both of them have received us
support for development of their nuclear
weapons programs actually until today in
the case of India which is now you SLI
war threats in the Middle East which
could become reality very soon once
again escalate to dangers well
fortunately there's a way out of this a
simple way there's a way to mitigate
maybe end whatever threat Iran is
alleged to pose very simple move towards
establishing a nuclear weapons free zone
in the Middle East the opportunities
coming again this December there's an
international conference scheduled to
deal with this proposal it has
overwhelming international
support including Antonelli majority of
the population in Israel that's
fortunately unfortunately it's blocked
by the United States and Israel a couple
of days ago is real announced that it's
not going to participate and it won't
consider the matter until there's a
general regional peace Obama takes the
same stand now he also insists that any
agreement must exclude Israel and even
must exclude the calls for other nations
meaning the us to provide information
about Israeli nuclear activities the
United States and Israel can delay
regional peace indefinitely they've been
doing that for 35 years on Israel
Palestine virtual international
isolations along important story that I
don't have time to go into here so
therefore there's no hope for an easy
way to end what the West regards as the
most severe current crisis in no way
unless there's large-scale public
pressure but the can't be large-scale
public pressure unless people at least
know about it and the media have done a
stellar job in averting that danger
nothing reported about the conference or
about any of the background no
discussion apart from specialist arms
control journals where you can read
about it so that blocks the easy way to
end the worst existing crisis unless
people somehow find a way to break

the University of Massachusetts and
Amherst his talk was entitled who owns
