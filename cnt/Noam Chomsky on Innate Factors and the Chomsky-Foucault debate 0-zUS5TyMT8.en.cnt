I mean the debate was not about the
importance of social factors of course
they exist the debate was about what has
taken to be contentious but shouldn't be
the existence of innate factors that's
very commonly denied and Foucault in
fact was denying it but it's just
incoherent to deny it if you deny it
then our cognitive and social behavior
would be like some imagined organism if
you can imagine one that doesn't have
any genetic program that determines what
kind of organism it will be and nothing
that determines that'll be an insect or
a mouse or a human or whatever and it
therefore will be nothing it'll be some
you know amoeboid style reflection of
accidental data a lot of scientists have
argued that philosophers too so Quine
for example famously I would say
infamously argued that language but it
would hold free yelled it for all
behavior in fact all theories is just
the result of some it's a kind of an
accidental collection of behaviors they
constructed by developed through
conditioning I mean that's essentially
like saying we're all amoebas amoeboid
not even an amoeba because an amoeba has
internal structure it doesn't doesn't
that doesn't make any sense you can't
have any structure in an organism unless
there's some form of predetermination
that form of predetermination will
provide scope it'll also impose limits
and there's just no way out of that
that's practically logic
