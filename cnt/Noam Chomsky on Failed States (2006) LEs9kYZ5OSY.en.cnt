Thanks
I think a useful place to start might be
with a recent academic study by an
Oxford professor of traditions of war
which contrasts two leading paradigms in
the study of Just War what the author
calls the brodien and Republican
interpretations first paradigm traces
back to hugo grotius
famed 17th century humanist who founded
the dominant framework of thinking on
laws of war within this paradigm law war
is an act of states and Just War
proposals are means to humanize to
introduce humanity in warfare it's one
tradition the contrasting Republican
paradigm traces back to Rousseau and the
uprising against monarchy and feudalism
in the late 18th century including the
American Revolution this paradigm blends
war with justice with liberty equality
individual and community rights whatever
else may fall within our concept of
justice well these positions are of
course idealizations the real world is
more complex
the formal implementation of efforts to
introduce humanity into warfare do not
simply disregard the questions of
justice but they do put them to the
margins they're not central to the
codification of the principles of world
order and practice with single exception
of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights which has a pretty tattered
history well despite real-world
complexities the differences between
these two approaches to Just War
think deserve attention in considering
both the issues that are addressed and
those that are ignored we might ask
whether that itself is just there are at
least three major sources of insight
into the concepts of Just War the first
is the scholarly literature the second
is the underlying notions of human
nature that underlie our moral judgments
and the third is the International
codifications so I'd like to say a few
words about each of these topics I think
it may help to indicate in advance where
I'm heading in brief my own conclusions
are that the literature merits careful
attention but is ultimately not very
instructive about just war secondly that
the notions of human nature should be at
the heart of the discussion although
serious inquiry into this is still in
its early stages and third that the
codifications are seem to me sensible
but actions in the real world
all too often reinforce a famous maxim
of Tacitus that the strong do as they
can all the weak do as they must so
let's start with some remarks on some of
the current literature on just war one
of the most recent studies is Michael
Walters book arguing about war which
merits particular attention and not only
because of the high praise it's received
but also because Walter is responsible
for the largely responsible for the
recent revival of Just War Theory the
strengths I think the book reveals both
the strengths and the weaknesses of Just
War Theory the strengths are that many
of the conclusion seem plausible enough
at least to me but
particularly those conclusions that
pretty much reiterate standard
codifications the weakness is that
despite the book's title arguing about
war it's very hard to find an argument
you might try that as an experiment and
more accurately while arguments are
sometimes detectable they rely crucially
on such premises as seems to me entirely
justified or I believe or no doubt and
there's almost no effort to bring in
relevant background information and
evidence
Walter gives to paradigm examples which
in which case he simply asserts that the
wars are just in fact so obviously just
that argument is unnecessary the two
examples are Afghanistan and Kosovo
he describes the invasion of Afghanistan
as a triumph of Just War theory which
stands alongside the bombing of Serbia
in 1999 as a nun controversial case of
just war no argument is felt to be
necessary although in either case it
doesn't take much effort to think of
possible evidence that might bear on the
pronouncement that these are triumphs of
Just War theory and these are
considerations that would certainly be
brought by brought up by just or
theorists if the responsibility for the
military action lay elsewhere well for
lack of time I'll skip illustrations but
can come back to them if you'd like to
be clear I'm not asking whether the
bombings of Afghanistan and Serbia were
right or wrong maybe they were maybe
they weren't I'm asking a different
question namely what does Just War
Theory have to say about it and I think
if you look closely you'll find that the
answer is that it has nothing to say
about we're left with assertions of the
authors that state violence was
justified
uncontroversially so and any
consequences whether anticipate or not
our entire Lee no doubt the fault of the
official enemy
well another recent and also highly
regarded inquiry into Just War theory is
by moral political philosopher Jean Elka
Elstein the paradigm of Just War she
writes is the bombing of Afghanistan and
she adds that nearly everyone with the
exception of absolute pacifists and a
few lunatics agree that the bombing of
Afghanistan was clearly a just war
argument ended in reality nearly
everyone excludes substantial categories
of people of the majority of the world's
population for example even in Europe
far more so in Latin America and also
leading Afghans who had been fighting
the Taliban and including u.s. favorites
and virtually all aid agencies working
there but what's relevant is that this
constitutes the sole argument to
establish that the war was just in fact
uncontroversially so the facts are
irrelevant and though further argument
is needed well Elston does provide
criteria for just war so we at least
have the rudiments of a theory four
criteria I'll read them first criterion
the war must be openly declared or
otherwise what otherwise authorized by a
legitimate Authority second it must
begin with the right intentions third
forces justified if it protects the
innocent from certain harm as when a
country has certain knowledge that
genocide will commence on a certain date
fourth it must be a last resort after
other possibilities for the redress and
defense of the values at stake have been
explored well
the first two conditions are vacuous
declaration of war by an aggressor
confers no support whatsoever for a
claim of Just War and even the worst
criminals claim right intentions the
third and fourth conditions sound
reasonable but they have no relevance at
all clearly to the case of Afghanistan
so therefore else tons perish paradigm
example collapses entirely under her own
criteria he had just one word on the
classic modern work Michael Walters
Justin unjust Wars which I believe
you've been reading my personal
judgement is that his conclusions are
generally very reasonable also pretty
much in accord with the conventional
reading of the United Nations Charter
but what's relevant here is that the
conclusions just about invariably rely
crucially on the ubiquitous phrase it
seems to me and so on and you might test
so just as an illustration tek witty
regards as the hardest question in his
words that is the british bombing of
urban centres in germany up to the end
of the war waltzer concludes that such
bombing quoting him after the immediate
threat posed by hitler's early victories
had passed was entirely indefensible
maybe so but if you check you'll find
there's no argument apart from the
statement that the policy seems cruel
well I think it does seems cruel to me
at least about what does Just War Theory
have to say where does it enter into the
argument and why are relevant facts
disregarded there are after all relevant
facts
well the character the theory is
revealed further when we look at the
examples that Walter gives about a half
a dozen examples which are just listed
no argument or discussion to show the to
show that Just War theory applies
leaving in his words no doubts the
examples are mostly unconscious although
one might we'll ask why some of these
examples are chosen but not others for
example the Russian invasion of
Czechoslovakia is given as a case where
there is no doubt but not given is the
Israeli invasion of Lebanon which I
suppose had about a hundred times as
many casualties and many more during the
22 years of occupation of Lebanon
southern Lebanon in defiance of Security
Council orders so maybe there's a reason
maybe there isn't but whatever it is
it's not given that's all examples
except one the last example of a case
where Just War theory applies leaving no
doubt is the Egyptian challenged Israel
in 1967 that's the sole example in the
long period covered we're just were
theory allegedly demonstrates that a
preemptive strike that was just beyond
all doubt
well maybe the selection of cases and
the conclusions are correct and maybe
they're not but what's relevant here is
the Just War Theory plays little if any
role in the argument which reduces
pretty much two declarations of personal
preference well I won't go on that these
are to my knowledge fairly
representative selections from the most
highly regarded literature and I think
it's fair to conclude more generally
that we learned very little about Just
War from Just War theory although we do
learn something about the prevailing
intellectual moral climate in which the
theory is presented and honored well
it's not turn to the second source of
potential insight second source of
potential insight into just war theory
that is their intuitive moral judgments
well here we are turning to what was
traditionally called moral philosophy I
think it's more aptly described as moral
psychology in modern terms and after the
divorce of science and philosophy in the
mid nineteenth century a century before
that David Hume had done his classic
work on what he called the Springs and
origins of human nature human recognized
that knowledge and belief are grounded
in what he called a species of natural
instincts part of our inherent mental
nature he recognized also that something
similar must be true in the domain of
moral judgment his reason was that our
moral judgments are unbounded in scope
we are constantly applying them in
systematic ways to new circumstances in
a manner that's intelligible to others
hence they too must be founded on
general principles that are part of our
nature
although beyond what he call their
original instincts meaning the narrower
instincts that we share with animals
well that insight which I think is
accurate should lead directly to efforts
to develop something like a grammar of
moral judgment that's an enterprise very
much like the inquiry into the
principles that are encoded
somehow in our brains that permit us to
do what you and you and I are now doing
and more broadly to produce and
understand linguistic expressions over
an unbounded range and used
in a way which is appropriate to
circumstances and intelligible to others
even though they may be quite new in our
own history or unexperienced in fact all
of history well as was recognized a
century before Hume these principles
must be universal
hence grounded in our nature and the
basis for acquisition of any particular
language today we would say that the
principles of language and moral
judgment are part of our genetic
endowment part of human biology in both
cases they're culturally specific and
universal aspects in both the case of
internal faculties of language and moral
judgment these things can be studied
they're part of science in fact studied
in rather similar ways inquiry into the
moral faculty in these terms was
undertaken by the leading American moral
and political philosopher of the late
20th century John Rawls who relied
explicitly on the analogy of two
linguistic theories that were being
developed in the 1960s at the time that
he was writing his classic work theory
of justice Rawls in fact put this aspect
of his work aside under severe criticism
by moral philosophers turned to core
issues for him though the criticisms
were reexamined and I think adequately
refuted in a doctoral dissertation a few
years ago by John McHale who is now a
law professor at Georgetown forthcoming
book of his based on the dissertation
develops this and also presents
empirical investigation of moral
judgments in puzzling thought
experiments that have been designed by
moral philosophers this experimental
work reveals that intuitions in these
quite puzzling cases are typically
instantaneous and reflexive in adults
and children with systemic changes
through early childhood development much
as in other aspects of development he
then goes on to develop a theoretical
explanation in terms of fixed principles
that can be regarded as a development of
roles theory of justice and the much
earlier work of Hume and other classical
writers on our natural instincts there's
another book soon to come out by Harvard
primatologist and cognitive scientist
mark Hauser a carrying such enquiries
further includes comparative studies and
more general ideas about what he calls
the moral organ analogous to the
language organ other sub components of
the cognitive systems that are a core
part of our biological nature well in
recent years these topics have become a
lively field of theoretical and
empirical inquiry the for many points of
view incidentally this is a study of
principles that underlie intuitive
conceptions of justice and rights and
their cultural variety their limited
cultural variety and their universal
properties that could someday provide
foundations for a more substantive
theory of Just War but it remains
largely a task for the future though
it's underway and interesting and
interesting ways well finally a couple
of words on the codification of these
intuitive judgments in the past century
they all keep through the period after
World War two
although the earlier conventions have
very clear and significant contemporary
relevance a conventions of 1907 for
example can come back to that if you
like the post Second World War
codification of the laws of war that
consists primarily of the UN Charter the
Geneva Conventions and the Nuremberg
principles later adopted by the General
Assembly
well as you know I'm sure the Charter
bars the threat or use of force except
in two instances if authorized by the
Security Council of the United Nations
or under Article 51 of the Charter in
self-defense against armed attack until
the Security Council acts the phrase
armed attack is conventionally
interpreted in terms of Daniel Webster's
principle which extends armed attack to
cases where in his words the necessity
for action is urgent is instant
overwhelming and leaving no choice of
means and no moment of deliberation any
other resort the force is a war crime
in fact the supreme international crime
encompassing all the evil that follows
and the words of the Nuremberg Tribunal
I was high level UN panel meeting in
issued its report in December 2004
included among others former National
Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft
it concluded that article 51 needs
neither extension or a restriction of
its long understood scope it should be
neither rewritten nor reinterpreted last
September the UN World Summit reaffirmed
quoting that the relevant provisions of
the Charter are sufficient to address
the full range of threats to
international peace and security
these summit and further endorsed the
responsibility to commit ourselves to
helping States build capacity to protect
their populations from genocide war
crimes ethnic cleansing and crimes
against humanity and to assisting those
which are under stress before crises and
conflicts breakout the summit granted no
new right of intervention to individual
states or regional alliances whether
under humanitarian or other
professed grounds and it established no
responsibility to protect the contrary
to it was widely alleged in news reports
and commentary the high-level panel of
December 2004 had reached the same
conclusion in words that were
specifically directed at international
and intellectual opinion and state
practice in the West in recent years its
words were these for those impatient
with declaring article 51 to be
appropriate as formulated the answer
must be that in a world full of
perceived potential threats the risk to
the global order and the norm of
non-intervention on which it continues
to be based is simply too great for the
legality of unilateral preventive action
as distinct from collectively endorsed
action to be accepted allowing one to so
act is to allow all allowing one to so
act as to allow all now here the panel
is proposing the principle of
universality namely that we apply to
ourselves the same standards we do to
others if not more stringent ones now
that's perhaps the most elementary of
moral truisms and it's the foundation of
Just War theory if that theory is to be
taken at all seriously the principle
however is flatly rejected in the elite
intellectual moral and political culture
of the most powerful states and six plis
utley rejected by official doctrine that
includes the expositors and advocates of
Just War theory also includes a
substantial legal literature it's pretty
easy to della straight there's plenty of
material on print about it well in this
and we can draw some conclusions from
that in this connection and by saying
that it's worth remembering some
eloquent were
on the principle of universality
foundation of Just War theory in any
serious moral theory the comments by
Justice Robert Jackson he was the chief
of counsel for the prosecution at
Nuremberg he informed the tribunal that
if certain acts of violation of treaties
or crimes they are crimes whether the
United States does them or whether
Germany does them and we are not
prepared to lay down a rule of criminal
conduct conduct against others which we
would not be willing to have invoked
against us we must never forget that the
record on which we judge these
defendants is the record on which
history will judge us tomorrow
to pass these defendants a poisoned
chalice is to put it to our own lips as
well the supreme international crime for
which the defendants were hanged at
Nuremberg was defined clearly enough by
justice Jackson at Nuremberg he proposed
to the tribunal that an aggressor is a
state that is the first to carry out
invasion of its Armed Forces with or
without a declaration of war of the
territory of another state illustrations
of that too are easy enough to find and
others are on the horizon it's again
noteworthy that these considerations are
virtually excluded from the dominant
intellectual and moral culture in the
West rather generally although we have
no difficulty at all and applying them
to official enemies
well once again there's nothing special
about our own country in this respect
except that it's more powerful than
others such invasions with regard to the
acts of one's own state are close to
universal they disfigure intellectual
history as far back as you go to the
maxim of Tacitus that I quoted we may
add an observation by President John
Adams
power always thinks it has a great soul
and vast views beyond the comprehension
of the week I think that's another
near-universal again all too easy to
illustrate from the traditional practice
of governments and the educated classes
within them well to return to the
beginning what can one learn from Just
War Theory my feeling is that from the
literature on Just War we learn mostly
about the prevailing moral and
intellectual climate in which we live
scientific inquiry into moral psychology
and its roots in our nature may someday
provide important insights but practice
cannot wait for that day any more than
engineering has waited for physics or
medicine for biology for centuries in
these cases which are much simpler ones
and much more accessible to inquiry than
human nature thirdly the codification of
laws of war has over time had a notable
civilizing effect but the gap between
professed ideals and actual practice is
much too large to be tolerated in my
opinion thanks

[Applause]
your chance to talk repeat that
questioners won't be filmed so you can
feel free to talk
sir I was just wondering if you believe
that the United States of America has a
responsibility to intervene in cases
where just war says that it is justified
to intervene do I think that there's a
responsibility to intervene in cases
where Just War Theory concludes that it
is correct to intervene that the
question personally I agree with the UN
Charter the high-level UN panel of
December 2004 and the UN World Summit
which I quoted but I can't really answer
the question because as far as I can
determine you can tell me if I'm wrong
Just War Theory never tells you anything
it doesn't tell you when it's proper to
intervene what it tells you is I think
it's proper to intervene well you know I
I may also think so but there's a big
gap between assertion and argument
between surmise and evidence so if you
can tell me we're just War Theory
entails that we ought to intervene we
can consider the question but until it's
don't done we can't really consider the
question sir I was wondering red yes sir
I was wondering do you believe that it
would have been right to reassess
article 51 of the UN Charter and you
believe that by not reassessing and not
rewriting it it loses relevancy I'm
sorry I didn't get it by by say it again
by not reassessing it not recess you're
writing it you believe it loses its it
has been reassessed repeatedly for
example by the high-level UN panel of
December to that issue news report on
2004 with many distinguished
participants I mentioned Brent Scowcroft
but there are others yes that's exactly
what they did they reassessed the UN
Charter and their conclusion is what I
read the UN World Summit last September
again reassessed the UN char
and that's what it concluded maybe there
should be a further reassessment fine
then let's undertake it and let's
consider their arguments or other
arguments but we can't say that it
hasn't been reassessed and we can say
that we haven't paid any attention to it
well that's possible in fact true but it
certainly has been reassessed by very
respectable and leading figures and
their conclusions in my opinion at least
are pretty justified however I get back
to the main topic I don't think just
were tell theory tells us anything about
that when we judge these things we're
judging them on another basis on the
basis of actual evidence about what
happens in particular cases in terms of
our fundamental moral principles which
we should try to explicate and apply
like the principle of universality
that's the way we should reassess it
also we should I think think seriously
about the statement that I quoted of the
December 2004 panel that was directed to
people like us it was directed to
intellectual opinion in the West and can
read it again but what they said is the
foundations of world order based on the
principle of non-intervention and the
affairs of others not forceful
intervention is too important and too
fragile to be destroyed or the
consequences will be terrible because
for one to act is to grant the authority
to all at least if we believe in
elementary moral principles that's a
heavy burden to bear maybe we can come
up with a different conclusion in some
cases actually personally I think we can
but has to be argued
cerca de Greco he said that it's
possible that article 51 needs to be
reassessed but you mentioned earlier
when you were referencing Walters book
that he said that the Israeli preemptive
strike was just or that he said that the
Israeli preemptive strike was justified
you also stated that his arguments did
not really have justification by his
theory however in the case of the
preemptive strike he does say that there
are several criterion that are necessary
for the Israeli attack to be justified
specifically the fact that these
Egyptian army was standing at a state of
readiness that the Israeli army was
incapable of holding so under Article 51
even though Egypt had not yet invaded
Israel that they they were not at war
however what Egypt was doing tactically
put Israel at a severe disadvantage so
under our modern definition of war it
seems to me that that ought to be it
seems to me it seems logical that it
ought to be called an act of war what
Egypt was doing putting Israel at such a
disadvantage so doesn't article 51
definitely need some reason article 51
clearly does not apply write read
article I we can argue that we can argue
that it was justified but we can't say
that article 51 justifies it not under
Daniel Webster's characterization or any
other one that's accepted by the
international community we might argue
and here's where I think you could make
an argument that if you consider the
range of issues that arose at the time
the preemptive strike was justified
maybe one can give such an argument but
the point is that no argument is given
to that effect
none of the relevant facts are
considered and this is regarded as one
of the half dozen cases where Just War
Theory entails that the use of military
force was legitimate just were theory
doesn't entail that women tell anything
it would
tells you is will i michael worth Walter
believe this was justified but without
giving any reasons and without looking
into the background if you look into the
background it's a lot more complex than
that it's a lot of literature and
scholarship on it the US didn't agree
there were all sorts of possibilities
you could have taken I mean I don't want
to if you want to run through the
background but it's quite intricate and
complex going back to the question of
free passage through the Straits of
Tiran and whether that should be brought
to the World Court which the US and
Israel refused to do and he insisted on
involves Israeli strikes against Syrian
targets all sorts of things so yes
there's a complicated background you
could look at them you could decide
maybe that in the light of these complex
these complex circumstances perhaps
Israel is entitled to make a preemptive
strike but that's not what's claimed
what's claimed is that without looking
at any evidence Just War Theory whatever
it is it's not easy to determine Just
War theory entails that this is one of
the half-dozen cases in the last century
in which the use of force was no doubt
legitimate and the only case in which
preemptive strike was legitimate and we
can also raise the question of
universality I mean I don't believe and
I'm sure you don't believe that Iran has
a right to say carry out terrorist acts
in the United States right now but
undoubtedly it's under serious threat
and undoubtedly the threat is simply
overwhelming as compared with Iran's
capacities but with the outrageous to
suggest that of course and if it's
outrageous to suggest that why is it
legitimate in this case I mean for one
to act is to give the right tool and we
can give a whole lot of other examples I
mean let me give an even more outrageous
one okay
not because I accept that of course but
just as an example nobody I know of
whose semi sane that goes out every
December 7th and celebrates Pearl Harbor
Day however if we use these arguments
you can do it
Japan on December 7th attacked US
military bases in Hawaiian to
effectively to US colonies territories
claimed by the u.s. Hawaii and
Philippines
attack military bases the Japanese were
perfectly capable of being of reading
what was being written in US public
journals and in fact US intelligence
which it cracked the Japanese codes know
that they knew about it and what was
being written going all the way up to
the high military command being reported
by you know political commentators in
the New York Times was that the United
States was that b-17s were running off
the Boeing assembly line that designs to
be able to burn the to the ground the
what they were called the antiques in
which the Japanese lived these wooden
cities burn em to the ground with their
b-17 attacks and furthermore b-17s were
being shipped from the Atlantic where
they were needed to Pacific bases in
preparation for such attacks well you
know is that a threat
yeah that's a pretty serious threat is
that justified Pearl Harbor I mean not
in 10 million years but if that doesn't
why does why is this justify
my birthday incidentally so I have a
special interest in that day sir I can't
see I'm sorry I really sir appear
cadet Hobson I just want to know if you
thought our operations in a war were
pre-emptive or preventive and sorry I
couldn't hear the first point do you
think our operations in Iraq are
preventive or pre-emptive and do you
think that our operations in Iraq or
just or unjust well the there was
interesting terminology and that the
administration presented it and in fact
the National Security Council described
you know they had that in mind but more
generally as pre-emptive work but it
certainly isn't preemptive work by any
stretch of the imagination more
accurately you could call it preventive
war okay you say we have to prevent a
potential attack against us personally I
don't see much justification for that
even if you accept that they believed
all the reports that Colin Powell was
giving it the UN Security Council and so
on even if we accept that all that was
believed it doesn't seem to me that a
preventive war in such a case is
legitimate and as you know the world
didn't think so either there were
international polls taken on this and
outside the United States and to Olympus
to a more limited extent England you
could barely find a country in the world
where support for it was above 10
percent in fact the only two exceptions
in the international polls that were
taken were India and Israel but both of
them had something different in mind
what they had in mind was their own
repression of occupied territories
Kashmir and the occupied territories
yeah they liked the idea of preventive
war by the powerful but they weren't
talking about this how are the rest of
the world
almost non-existent you know ten percent
or less was is it and again we have the
same question if preventive war is
legitimate under those circumstances
it's legitimate for everybody okay that
means it's legitimate for Iran today I
mean to take another case it is simply
undeniable I read it right in US
official documents and that the United
States has been carrying out a terrorist
war against Cuba since 1960 I mean at
first it was with direct participation
more recent years is just with tolerance
but that it happened isn't even
questionable no John F Kennedy assigned
his brother Robert Kennedy the task of
running the terrorist war I was to be
his highest priority Robert Kennedy's
official more or less official
biographer historian Arthur Schlesinger
who was well-known historian it was a
Kennedy member of the Kennedy team a
Latin American advisor he writes that
Robert Kennedy's task was to bring the
terrors of the earth to Cuba and if you
look back at the record it was no joke
and it continues now still based on US
soil and the u.s. harbors happily
harbors terrorists who were involved in
it does that give Cuba the right to
carry out terrorist acts in the u.s. to
prevent this did it ever give them the
right well I don't think so I'm sure you
don't think so but if preventive war is
legitimate why not and in fact you know
and there are many other cases where it
takes a Lebanon in 1982 when Israel was
preparing the attack and in fact trying
desperately to conjure up an excuse for
the attack they were bombing Lebanon
hoping for some retaliation that could
be used as a pretext and that was a
serious attack killed probably maybe
20,000 people you know destroyed a large
part of southern Lebanon
much of it did that give Lebanon the or
the Palestinians in Lebanon the right to
carry out the terrorist acts in Israel
prior to it to prevent the war well I
certainly don't think so I'm sure you
don't but if preventive war is
legitimate under such ambiguous cases as
Iraq why isn't that legitimate so no I
don't think it was just I think it was
aggression sir walzer's legal as
paradigm mom when he describes that he
also describes three provisions one of
which being the human rights provision
saying that it is justified to intervene
if human rights are being violated what
do you have any credence to the argument
that Saddam Hussein was in fact a tyrant
that did violate human rights no he said
even though even though there were other
reasons given for war such as WMD and
additionally aggressors or Walzer also
describes aggressors as also being
Justin to go against the war to get good
a war against and when when and did he
ever lose his status as an aggressor
from the first Gulf War thank you he
lost his status as an aggressor when he
was driven out of Kuwait just as Israel
lost its status as an aggressor when
after 22 years it pulled out eleven but
and I can give plenty of other examples
close to home but as for the human
rights violations they were horrendous
and here is one of the cases where it
really is important to look at facts
before you make decisions and we know
the facts not secret so yes Saddam
Hussein carried out horrendous human
rights violations in fact he's on trial
for him right now but have a look at the
trial Saddam Hussein is on trial for
crimes that he committed in 1982 killed
he's charged with killing probably
accurately killing about 150 you're
signing the death warrant for
and fifty or so Shiites who were
involved in an uprising yeah that's a
crime that 1982 happens to be an
important year in u.s. Iraqi relations
this should be headlines in a free press
in my opinion it was a very important
year 1982 was the year in which Ronald
Reagan dropped your act from the list of
states supporting terrorism so the US
could starts providing him with
extensive aid including military aid
including means to develop biological
and chemical weapons and missiles and
weapons of nuclear weapons
he was dropped from Donald Rumsfeld the
next shortly after went the firm up the
agreement the next charge against Saddam
Hussein the ones going to come along
it's been announced is a much more
serious crime the atrocities against the
Kurds in 1997 1988 they all unfold
massacres Halabja yeah they were
terrible molecule 100,000 people u.s.
didn't object in fact the Reagan
administration blocked efforts in
Congress even to protest against it
furthermore the support for Saddam
increased and continued in fact Saddam
was given an extraordinary privilege
remarkable I mean he was allowed he got
away with attacking a US naval vessel
and killing 37 soldiers of seamen in
1987
that's pretty astonishing nobody can get
away with that but we were supporting
the Reagan administration was so
strongly in support of Saddam right
through the worst atrocities even let
him get away with that I mean in 1980
this continued after the end of the war
with Iran after the worst atrocities in
1989 Iraqi and nuclear engineers were
invited to the United States to take
part in a conference I was in Portland
Oregon in which they were a trained in
how to develop
weapons of mass destruction missus 1989
that furthermore George Bush number one
told us why it was being done they said
we have to provide aid to Saddam because
it's of our responsibility to help us
exporters and because he contributes to
stability in the region in fact that
continued only thinking after the
invasion of Kuwait after he was driven
out of quake you know jurrac was
practically bombed in the rubble
the US had total control of the area
there was an uprising April March April
1991 Shiite uprising in the south
probably would have overthrown it there
were rebelling Iraqi generals a good
chance he would have been overthrown
well the Bush administration determined
that they would essentially permit
Saddam the crush it they used military
helicopters other armed equipment they
don't have to do that that led to a huge
massacre and it was described you know
you can go back and read the New York
Times right after that they said well
you know it's regrettable but there's a
consensus among the US and its allies
being Saudi Arabia and Britain there's a
consensus that I'm virtually quoting
that Saddam Hussein offers more hope for
the stability of the region than those
who are trying to overthrow him that's
1991 you know yeah the human rights
violations were horrendous
does that even do with invasion no
nothing
professor Chomsky I'm most regretful
that I have to interrupt the flow of
your thought and your and your a very
interesting presentation unfortunately
we are constrained by military time to
end at this time and but I am happy to
say that the that the occasion the
opportunity for those of you who did not
have an opportunity to ask your question
here may come out in the rotunda I
certainly hope it will there is a
reception immediately to follow but
first sir sear on behalf of the class of
2008 I like to present you with this
gift as a small token of appreciation
for speaking with us site thank you sir
[Applause]
[Music]
I usually leave gifts for my
grandchildren dope and they get a big
kick out of it but I'll change the rules
this time I don't know if you can see it
but it's a wonderful picture
[Applause]
