I hope you can hear me and that the mic
is is functioning properly well ladies
and gentlemen and Friends it's a great
pleasure to welcome you tonight to the
Museum of Modern Art's and to this
lecture by Professor Chomsky which is
being held in conjunction with a major
exhibition on East Timor which is can be
seen in the downstairs in the restaurant
and I hope that you will be able to see
it after this this meeting it will be
open for half an hour afterwards the
format of tonight will be that I will
make a very short opening address I will
then turn to Jean Boveda who is a nice T
Maurice who's now studying at Campion
hall to give something of an impression
of what it has been like to actually
live through the years of the Indonesian
military occupation and to particularly
dwell on the developments which have
happened within the East Timor E's
church the Catholic Church of East Timor
and the way in which that has focused in
and helped to sustain the growing
nationalist resistance in East Timor
Arnold Cohen will then follow Arnold has
been almost single-handed the architect
of keeping East Timor in front of the
public eye in the United States during
16 years when it was extremely difficult
for me for much of that time to really
be able to hold it as an issue of major
public concern because of the way in
which the press and those who could
report what had been going on in his
team or were excluded and were banned
from visiting the territory and also
from what Professor Chomsky will be
talking about in the fourth presentation
the International matrix which is kept
East Timor
in the position that has been in during
the past sixteen to seventeen years I'm
a specialist on Indonesian history and
to my shame it took me nearly ten years
to actually realize what was happening
in East Timor I remember the first
indication that something was pretty
seriously wrong is when I was sitting in
a restaurant leiden and Red's that's
five Western journalists two Britons
Australians and New Zealand had been
shot and killed while covering the war
at Valley Bo in October of 75 and I
thought well it's a bit odd for five
journalists and cameramen just to be
wiped off the face of the earth just
like that just fulfilling their duties
and it was not until 1983 when I was
asked to review the book written by
James Dunne an excellent book on East
Timor called Timor people betrayed that
I realized what had happened to them
that they had been shot in cold blood by
the Indonesian army and that not only
they had died but somewhere around a
hundred thousand temari's out of a
population of six hundred and eighty
eight thousand had died in the first
three and a half years of the Indonesian
occupation alone per capita and in terms
of the suffering per square inch in East
Timor certainly perhaps greater than
that even of Pol Pot's Cambodia in the
following year after 83 we tried to hold
a meeting to coincide with a visit to
Oxford by jose ramos-horta who later
came as a visiting fellow to Stan's
knees and like Arnold has been very much
instrumental in terms of holding the the
cause of his team or aloft in the UN and
in major international circles in the
circles of diplomacy and international
Nations for very long period of time he
has been a principal advocate of East
Timor's rights of self-determination and
the rights for a future which the people
of East Timor can decide for themselves
and when we organised a meeting in New
College barely 20 people turned up it
was a beautiful hall as large as this
but 20 people were there
and I think it's a measure of the change
which has been wrought during the past
year a change which occurred because of
the massacre the santa cruz massacre and
the way in which that massacre was
reported in the West
two of the journalists and photographers
who were there at the time Steve Cox who
took the photographs some of which you
can see downstairs in the exhibition
Peter Gordon who headed the Yorkshire
television team which made the very
moving documentary on his team Oh which
was shown in January last year both are
here tonight and it's due to the courage
of Peter and Steve Chris whena who
actually took the footage the video
footage in the cemetery itself and many
others who supported that work that the
world knew about what had been going on
something of what had been going on in
his team oh it was certainly not the
first Massacre area Branca like
ludicrous there been many massacres
which had punctuated the bloody rule and
occupation of the Indonesian since 1975
but this was the first time that it was
actually shown across the world
Australian customs officials and
authorities tried to in fact confiscate
the tape so sensitive was Australia to
the ramifications of showing that film
and it's to their credit and to their
enormous courage that's we know today
what we do know about his Timor in a
room like this can be filled almost a
capacity in order to hear a talk on his
team or no doubts the character of the
main speaker tonight professor Chomsky
has been a major draw we've hijacked him
from the Philosopher's for one night and
we're very pleased to be able to do so
but it's also I think very much due to
the publicity and to the awareness the
growing awareness which has enabled such
a gathering
to come into being we'd like to send a
message tonight to the people of East
Timor that they have not been forgotten
that they have a hope for a better world
and that Oxford which has a link now
with the presidency in the United States
can have an influence on events perhaps
larger than one might think there will
be a student club and student society
association which will be founded called
the Friends of East Timor should be
founded some Ann's and the founders are
here tonight and if you'd like to to
know more about it you can get in touch
with me or for others who are involved
with work on his team or so without
further ado I will turn to Jurong Boveda
who is a graduate student at Campion
hall
working on a thesis to do with
nationalism and religion in his Timor
and most of all he has been a personal
witness to the events which we will be
talking of tonight thank
[Applause]
[Music]
when I first went to Australia in 1987 I
was invited to give a talk at one of the
universities in Melbourne I was quite
nervous at the time because my English
wasn't very good and before it told
there was a student who came to me and
asked me where I was the speaker and I
said yes she then went on saying that
she knew quite well about the plight of
the timorous people and that she was
very upset about her government's policy
on his Timo and then she asked me where
exactly is Timo was and she wonder
whether it was somewhere in the northern
suburb of Victoria and of course I said
yes
but a bit further north so we literally
went through all the suburbs around
vitoria and we ended up at the top end
of Australia which is Darwin by then she
realized the mistake she made that she
simply had mistaken East Timor
with one of the original tribes in
Australia well what exactly I want to
say tonight
it's nothing complex
the simple fact that the timrie struggle
still survives today it is mainly due to
the Catholic Church and its priests in
East Timor and by this I don't mean to
undervalue and to undervalue the spirit
of nationalism of the timorous people
themselves and nor do I overlook the
efforts of individuals and groups
solidarity's around the world but there
is certainly an explosive phenomenon
which has taken place in East Timor over
the last 17 years and this phenomenon is
the real religious element which I'm
going to describe it briefly in the
following terms
first and foremost since the Indonesian
invasion of East Timor in 1975 the
Timmers church has adopted an attitude
of mutual accommodation with humorous
people throughout the 17 years of
occupation the Catholic Church in East
Timor has given all sort of supports and
in several ways to the suffering is
numerous people in other words the
timorous Catholic Church has been the
only and real haven in East Timor under
those seventeen years and continues to
be
and secondly as a team research begins
or began to look at the Bible from the
underside that is from the perspective
of the suffering numerous people many
stories came in mass in big numbers and
converted to Catholicism from 30% of
Catholics in 1975 when the unisons when
the Portuguese government left the East
himo the number went up 60% and now the
total number of converted of those
converted to Catholicism is something
around 95 percent if the figure means
anything at all
it must mean that this is a potentially
important unifying factor for it he
marries people in the face of the real
threat
inflicted upon the timorous people only
part of the unit in government and
thirdly if the struggle of his team
whistle survives this is mainly because
the stimulus church has restrained
himself itself from becoming part of in
Indonesian bishops conference and this
simply means that while socio-political
structures in each team or having
suppressed to a certain degree the
Catholic Church itself when the ninety
percent of population re still directly
answerable to the Vatican and this is in
some ways seen in a very political and
diplomatic terms in the Vietnamese
people in fact we are still independent
from the Indonesians and in recent
government is entirely aware like
numerous people themselves that this has
been the only main stumbling block on
its way to fully integrate East him into
the Republic of Indonesia
well I am bringing up my toll in this
formula because I wasn't worried that I
was going to give this tall tonight so I
should conclude my views in that I will
not be surprised if sooner later the
team race and in unison confrontation
will take a different level of conflict
that is the religious one because we
have to bear in mind that although the
Indonesian state is not Islamic state it
is nevertheless the largest Muslim
country in the world in terms of
population and to come to the schema
itself we are looking at something like
600,000 people and given that 95% of
timorous people are now Catholics we
could soon face a very different
struggle a very different fight of
confrontation or conflict that is the
religious one between the East imerys
and the innocence
well as the timorous all I want to say
or perhaps to appeal to you first of all
I should thank you for coming and I'm
sure what Professor Chomsky is gonna
tell us will be most interesting but my
only appeal is that last year the
British aid to the Indonesian government
amounted to some 15 1 515 million pounds
well this might be insignificant but it
all together Mike's son - over 2 billion
dollars that the Unison government has
been receiving from the international
community all I want you to do is to
write to your MPs not we stop the aid to
the Indonesian government because after
all the Indonesian government is very
much an age dependent but all I want you
to do is to ask your MP and to ask
British government that any forthcoming
aid to the Indonesian government will
have to be connected to the human rights
situation not only in East Timor but
also in Indonesian Thanks
my thanks first of all I'd like to thank
John Leslie for his work over the past
year and a half on this exhibition
without which it would be impossible the
quality of this is largely due to him
and to the courage of the photographers
one thing that I'd like to say regarding
the level of awareness of East Timor
over the years I'm reminded of an
incident in early 1979 when a Somalia
like situation was brewing in East Timor
largely owing to Indonesian military
operations I was sitting in a coffee
shop in New York with jose ramos-horta
who was then the representative of East
Timor his independence movement at the
United Nations and the waiter in the
coffee shop asked Jose where are you
from and Jose I said Brazil and I said
Jose eh why did you do that and he said
I'm just tired of explaining to people
you know I just really I really want to
you know take some time off and not be
bothered it's just too long and too
complicated well later that year some
awareness started to breakthrough in the
American press and Noam Chomsky was
responsible along with people from the
team arees Catholic Church and other
people with connections to that church
Noam Chomsky who was giving some talks
at various places where there were
editorial writers for large American
newspapers and Gnome was pointing out
what was going on in East Timor
and the editorial writers and other
people were quite chagrined that they
couldn't really point to much of
anything that they had said or done and
then when refugees and other people
showed up with evidence we were able to
get in and see them quite quickly and
they were rather the major newspapers
were rather anxious to do something at
least for a time of course they would
never admit but it was because Noam
Chomsky had raised questions about their
professional performance but in any case
it all fits together because if one
skips ahead to the period surrounding
the Gulf War professor Chomsky
coincidentally was coming to Britain to
speak at a conference put on by the
Catholic Institute for international
relations in London and he pointed out
quite properly that Britain in the
United States were going after Sodom
Hussein yet nobody had thought of
bombing Jakarta in response to what the
Indonesians had been doing for all those
many years in East Timor as a result of
this some journalists in the British
press became interested in going to
Timor and investigating the situation
notably you of Shaughnessy for the
observer but not only him there were
other people in addition to Yorkshire
television who to that credit were
already interested in we're already
investigating the situation but all of
these various trails led to the 12th of
November last year because were it not
for if
on the part of people like Noam Chomsky
the church people from East Timor it
would have been impossible to spread the
kind of background awareness that that
enabled the journalists who were there
at the time to to have a receptive
audience on the outside and you know
were not for the efforts of these these
people the American Congress would not
have become involved to the extent that
there was there was a basis of concern
when the massacre took place last year
and with in recent weeks US military
training to Indonesia was cut off it was
the first sanction of any kind that the
United States has carried out against
Indonesia in in the 17 years since the
invasion of East Timor we're in a
situation now where the the
president-elect of the United States
Bill Clinton has made a statement made a
statement some months ago during the New
York primary saying that American policy
on East Timor had been unconscionable
and he would do much more the real issue
of course is how much will the the well
entrenched interests business interests
and other kinds of international
financial interests that have prevented
action directly or indirectly on the
teamwork question these the 17 years how
well they will succeed in getting
and stopping any action before it begins
but one thing is for sure that the the
the work of the teamrees independence
movement and staying alive all these
years against tremendous odds I mean if
one looks at the photographs downstairs
from people in 1975 most of these people
who were known then are either dead or
in prison or house servants for the
Indonesian military and yet a new
generation has sprung up that refuses to
be intimidated and so all of these
factors combined with the absolutely key
role of Yorkshire television in in
getting filmed evidence first of the
long term pattern of Indonesian
atrocities and second and most
importantly of the massacre that took
place last November assures that we're
not going to return to a the kind of
silence that existed many years before
and I think that you know this
oxford-educated American President may
have a little more than he's bargained
for in Congress and from the
international media and so I think
knoweth not on that note Noam Chomsky
can tell you a little bit about the
context that brought us to where we are
today Thanks
[Applause]
the let me begin with the title of the
exhibit 1974 92 years of silence images
of resistance the title is appropriate
I'll at a slight quibble in a moment but
it does meant a lot of course and I'd
like to concentrate actually on what it
omits namely the years of silence prior
to nineteen seventy seventy four which
in my opinion are critical for
understanding what has been happening in
relation to East Timor sentiment since
that time and also provide an extremely
illuminating insight into the nature of
Western civilization I think if we're
willing to take a close look at it the
years of silence with regard to
Indonesia in the they go back actually
almost 500 years that's the first
European settlement but let's start with
the end of the Second World War at the
end of the Second World War there was a
new world order as it was in fact called
which was unusually well and carefully
designed the reason that that was
possible was because there was one
global power that had a historically
unprecedented degree of wealth and
military force at its command and
intended to organize the world in the
interests of domestic power centers and
did so in a sophisticated and careful
way it happens to be a very free society
maybe the most free in the world and
there's an enormous amount
was done so the contours and character
and details of the planning are quite
well understood and they're not run
through the whole story but the basic
outlines are pretty clear actually the
basic outlines were perhaps put most
lucidly by Winston Churchill in 1945
when he was talking about how the world
should be organized and he said that the
government of the world should be in the
hands of the rich nations the rich
countries the rich men who are living at
peace in their habitations rather ample
habitations the satisfied nations who
already have what they need and they
should run the world he said our power
has placed us above the rest the rest
should stay in the servants quarters and
if they start to try to have some
influence or control though this cause
problems but we're already satisfied we
already own everything so as long as we
run the world everything will be fine
the rich men living dwelling and peace
within their habitations the people in
the servants quarters repeatedly are not
all that happy about it there's an
expression of that in this morning's
Guardian the chairman of the South
Commission Judas narara has another plea
which will not be listened to for a
different form of world order but they
keep making these unseemly noises and
doing unpleasant things and they have to
be controlled often stamped in the face
to show where they belong that's
basically the history of the world
there's a domestic analogue
as well now the actual architects of
policy put they describe the matter less
lyrically than Churchill and somewhat
more explicitly and they also didn't
exactly share his conception of where
Britain was going to fit into this
system much to his dismay out of
politeness I'll leave out what they said
about it privately but the the general
idea was the same just a different
different choices as to who was going to
run the show and the general idea was to
be that the mansions of the rich had to
be reconstructed primarily what were
called the great workshops Germany and
Japan German based Europe and Japan and
its periphery they were going to be the
centres of the industrial world
subordinated to the United States of
course Germany and Japan had just
demonstrated their prowess in the
preceding years and the in fact had only
made one mistake they didn't do it and
subordinated to the United States they
did it on their own and that doesn't
work as Saddam Hussein learned in 1990
as long as you carry out your atrocities
under orders or subordinated to the
master it's just fine
you can read that every morning and the
British press these days but if you do
it in defiance of the master that won't
work but in 1945 they had learned their
lesson and now they had to be
reconstituted but
under the under US domination and the
other Kissinger put the point some years
later other powers have regional
responsibilities which they are to carry
out within the overall framework of
order managed in Washington that's the
way the world was supposed to be by the
time Kissinger said it it was getting
hard to impose those rules but in 1945
it wasn't very difficult so Japan had to
be offered what George Kennan one of the
leading architects of policy State
Department planning policy planning
staff Japan had to be given what kenan
called its empire toward the south
western europe had to be granted the
opportunity to exploit africa's can and
put it for its reconstruction britain
would share with the united states and
running the energy reserves of the
middle east but with the united states
on top and western hemisphere would be
completely in the hands of the united
states and everyone would be kicked out
including Britain and France and that's
roughly the story Southeast Asia had a
role in this Southeast Asia as the
policy planning staff or the State
Department put it was to fulfill its
main function as a source of raw
materials and markets for the
reconstruction of Europe and Japan
of course to extend and strengthen
overall us power as well now with in
Southeast Asia Indonesia had the key
role simply because of its wealth
Indonesia as Kenan going back to Kenan
again who was leading a leading figure
in designing the post-war world Kenan
described in 1948 described the problems
of Indonesia I'm quoting the problems of
Indonesia are the most crucial issue of
the moment in our struggle with the
Kremlin it's 1948
so not a small role the phrase struggle
with the Kremlin is a code word for
conflict with independent nationalist
forces and tendencies that interfere
with the service role of the south they
may have a connection with the Kremlin
or they may not that's more less
incidental it's the it's their
independence that's intolerable they are
hungry nations interfering with the rich
men who were supposed to rule the world
and that's not their role their role is
to be servants the if you read through
the American Planning record these
dangerous elements are described
regularly as ultra-nationalists or
radical nationalists or sometimes
communists the Kremlin itself was an
enemy largely for the same reason it had
pulled out of the third world in 1917
and this one high-level planning study
could it the problem that the Communists
opposed was
their unwillingness or inability to
complement complement the industrial
societies of the West they were radical
nationalists big powerful ones in that
case but little ones are also
unacceptable the there's a more general
problem sort of another aspect to this
problem of radical nationalists who
interfere with the proper rule of the
world by the rich men that's problem
which became quite serious in Indonesia
it was described by President Eisenhower
in the mid 50's he said the he was
complaining about what he called the
ability of the Communists to appeal to
the masses something which we have no
capacity to duplicate he said somehow
what we're trying to offer the masses
doesn't get much enthusiasm among them
and his Secretary of State John Foster
Dulles added that the the Communists
appeal to the poor who are always trying
to plunder the rich that's the big
problem of world history and somehow
since when we call upon the rich to
plunder the poor it's hard to duplicate
this appeal to the masses nobody ever
figured out exactly why some failure of
public relations involved well when you
can't suppress you know if you can't
deal with these criminals who are trying
to plunder the rich or the other
criminals who are appealing to them if
you can't suppress them in one or
another way you may have to turn to the
ultimate weapon namely extermination and
in fact that brings us to Indonesia
Indonesia was supposed to be in this new
world order granted a kind of nominal
independence but under Dutch tutelage
the general
idea was as an early CIA memorandum put
it that we were in favor of recognizing
the nationalist the national aspirations
of the former colonial powers but that
has to be balanced against the need of
the needs of the former colonial powers
themselves and when that balance raised
the problem there was never any question
about which which interest was going to
win out in Indonesia there were
essentially three forces there was
president Sukarno the leader the
nationalist movement who was an
independent nationalist and therefore
already unacceptable then there was a
mass based popular party the Indonesian
Communist Party which was needless to
say totally unacceptable and thirdly
there was the army which more or less
shared u.s. aims and was therefore
always referred to as the moderates or
the pragmatist Pratt these are technical
terms that you have to understand
pragmatist is somebody who does what we
want we are pragmatic by definition
because we always do what we want and
others are pragmatic if they go along
with it and moderates are those who you
know are pragmatic so these are some of
the terminology of political discourse
you have to master if you want to become
a professor or somewhere so the army
were moderate and the Communist Party
was just more of these guys trying to
plunder the rich they were engaged in
what was called in those days concealed
aggression or internal aggression that's
a term that refers to political
victories by the wrong people that was a
problem all over the world
has been the Indonesian I should say
that there was a lot of concern that
there would be an internal victory by
concealed aggression but is by political
means since that was the only mass based
party and that obviously had to be
stopped Kennan and again in 1948 said
that if there was if the Communist Party
did manage to take power internally that
would be an infection he said that would
spread over all South Asia and caused
enormous problems and of course was
unacceptable and recall that Indonesia
was regarded as the major issue in our
struggle with in third-world nationalism
at the time struggle with the Kremlin
and codewords team are actually was
mentioned in this internal planning I
can only find one reference to it by
leading State Department Roosevelt
adviser Sumner Welles who mentioned back
in the early 40s that he thought when
they're talking about future of various
parts of the world that Timor ought to
has a right to independence but he said
it would certainly take a thousand years
so we don't worry about that the there
was an army Massacre and repression the
moderates did their job in 1948 and
still Sukarno remained in power the
United States was never very happy with
that the CIA began to support right-wing
parties that didn't work they supported
a an insurrection in 1957 and 58 that
was put down the u.s. then turned to a
classic technique for overthrowing
civilian government one that's used over
and over again namely cut off any pay or
assistance or support to the government
but maintain in fact even increase
military aid that's a natural way to
overthrow some
government after all who's going to
overthrow it that's actually as far as I
can see what was going what lies behind
the Iran the iran-contra story of 1980s
from the early 1980s the United States
was trying to overthrow the government
of Iran and a classic fashion supporting
the military cutting relations with
civilians as one of the leading Israeli
figures very LeBron II who was later
identified as being involved and this
says he said in fact over BBC and had a
very good program on this in 1982 he
said if we can find an Iranian general
who can shoot down a thousand people in
the streets we can restore the situation
that existed under the Shah and that was
done in Chile it was it was also done in
Indonesia so that's the policy that
began in the after the failure of the 57
58 58 rebellion now there was there was
a lot of concern about the prospects
enough was going to work one of the
leading us specialists on Indonesia
Parker worked with the RAND Corporation
and the Millett Pentagon he in 1962 he
urged his contacts in the Indonesian
military to in his words to strike and
to sweep their house clean
a year later William Kentner another
professor teaching at University of
Pennsylvania worried expressed his
concern over again this concealed
aggression the danger that there might
be just a political takeover from inside
by the only mass based political party
which would be a total disaster
and he therefore said that with Western
help free Asian political leaders
together with the military must
liquidate the enemy's political and guru
armies now the prospects of liquidating
the enemy's political armies were
uncertain Walker again and 1964 wrote
that he was concerned because the
Indonesian military he said probably
lack the ruthlessness and discipline
that made it possible for the Nazis to
suppress the Communists in Germany
however it turned out that his pessimism
was I should say incidentally that this
was the same concern that the Kennedy
administration felt about the Vietnamese
generals and and recently released
documents Kennedy's ambassador to South
Vietnam Henry Cabot Lodge in 1963
complained about the same thing he said
the South Vietnamese just like the
discipline and violence and savagery of
the Nazis and they can't do what we want
them to do we don't know how they're
supposed to have reserves of violence
but we can't seem to get that organized
well in the case of Indonesia turned out
that the pessimism was unfounded and
when six in Pokhara in fact pointed this
out a couple of years later there were
six Indonesian generals assassinated in
October 30th and 1965 and then this
Suharto took over and then came this
huge bloodbath and a couple years later
Parker said that the assassination of
the generals elicited the ruthlessness
that I had not anticipated and led to
the death of a large number of communist
cadres they did act like Nazis
thankfully and somewhere around half a
million or nobody really knows half a
million to a million some number of
people were slaughtered and the hugest
bloodbath since the Holocaust
mostly landless peasants and the
Communist Party was wiped out no more
fear of any popular political
organization and the generals were
firmly in power and this Carnot soon
disappeared the we don't know a lot
about the u.s. involvement in this the
documentary records those not been
declassified but there's enough to know
that the u.s. supported the coup openly
gave a are the only we haven't read the
government that is reacted with
enthusiasm to the massacre it's only
hesitation which is repeated in internal
documents as the fear that if the if US
support for the massacre was too overt
it might play into the hands of Sukarno
and undercut the good work that the army
was doing in the the public domain we of
course have a complete record and that's
extremely illuminating there was total
euphoria all over the West as the
corpses the piles of corpses mounted
it's hard to find an exception to this
Robert McNamara who was the Secretary of
Defense testified before Congress
shortly after all the basic facts were
known about the slaughter he was asked
about the u.s. policy of aiding the
Indonesian military in the early 60s at
a time when we were extremely hostile to
Indonesia and he was asked whether this
paid dividends and he said yes in
retrospect it had
dividends referring proudly to the
hundreds of thousands of slaughtered
people the blood was still flowing at
that time later he wrote privately to
President Johnson that u.s. that what
was particularly helpful he said was
bringing Indonesian military officers to
the United States the places like
Harvard where they got what he called
the right orientation and learned the
skills that they were able to employ
with such efficiency in Indonesia
Freedom House published an advertisement
by a group of a hundred and fourteen
people who described himself as the
moderate segment of the intellectual
community in which they lauded the US
war in Vietnam because it had provided a
shield for what they referred to as the
dramatic changes that had taken place in
Indonesia the most dramatic being the
this huge bloodbath in fact that was the
logic of a Vietnam war from the
beginning was to ensure that there would
be no infection spreading from Vietnam
and the idea was that the resolve that
was shown by the United States in
attacking South Vietnam what's called in
doctrinally correct terminology
defending South Vietnam from its own
people another case of internal
aggression as it was called the resolve
that the u.s. showed in attacking South
Vietnam and the rest of Indochina
encouraged the Indonesian generals and
others in the neighborhood like in
Thailand and Philippines and so on to
take things into their own hands
strike and sweep their house clean as
Cantor put it and to end any threat of
other infections that might spread
McGeorge Bundy years later he was the
National Security Advisor thinking back
over this period said that in retrospect
he thinks that after the Indonesian coup
in 1965 it was probably unnecessary for
the United States to continue the war in
Vietnam thinking it over he says we
basically got what we wanted at that
time by end of 1965 Vietnam was pretty
well destroyed anyway and Indonesia was
back under control and other places the
with infections weren't spreading so we
probably made a tactical error by going
on and costing ourselves too much pain
and dollars the Time magazine and I'm
one of the typical responses had a cover
story on what they called the West's
best news in four years the title of the
story was vengeance with a smile it was
11 pages about what they described as
the boiling bloodbath that took 400
thousand wives about which they were
just euphoric and enthusiastic the
leading political commentator the
political comments of columnists of the
New York Times James Reston actually
that phrase leading political
commentator is another euphemism it
means the State Department spokesman in
The New York Times
his job is to publish leaks that he got
from some State Department official the
day before and look like a big thinker
because of this and so on the he
published an article called this is well
into 1966 when everything was known was
called gleam of light and Asia and he
said we shouldn't be so downbeat about
the bad news from Vietnam there's also
good news in Asia there's a gleam of
light namely
Niva he said the United States is being
kind of reticent about its role in all
of this but in fact they're just kind of
you know they don't want to show off I
said the u.s. role was really much more
significant than Washington is letting
on
without direct US aid and involvement
and encouragement the Indonesian
generals would never have been able to
carry this off
they just out of some form of masochism
but a year ago I went through the whole
record of New York Times editorials on
the on the topic in those years and
they're pretty remarkable they're
uniform
full of euphoric completely full of
praise for what they called the
Indonesian moderates though they
recognized that the moderates had
carried out what they called a
staggering mass slaughter but that
didn't change the fact that they were
moderates and that's right remember
because they were pregnant this is
working for us and the they said that
the staggering mass slaughter carried
out by the moderates does raise a
critical question for Washington but
they were happy to see that the question
had been answered correctly the critical
question was whether Washington should
openly embrace and support the moderates
or whether it should do it more quietly
and Washington had
chosen the right path it had Washington
didn't embrace the new leaders to
fusilli they said and because that would
have hurt them and that was very wise
that's the only critical they meanwhile
Washington as I was giving them generous
aid which is the right thing of course
but it was very nicely handled there are
other possible questions that might come
to mind
they weren't raised and in fact I can't
find them raised anywhere in western
commentary you might feel equally
masochistic look back at the British
press in those days and see what was
said as far as I can tell I've only
sampled outside the United States it was
pretty much the same euphoria over the
gleam of light in Asia with this
extraordinary massacre the and by 1977
there had been a complete role reversal
one of the leading Asia hands
George MacArthur wrote that the convey
Indonesian Communist Party had as he put
it
subjected the country to a bloodbath in
other words they had put their necks
under the knife and a another communist
atrocity and so it goes to the president
just recently the Christian Science
Monitor had a review article on
Indonesia in which it said that after
his 1965 achievements referring to
Suharto many in the West were keen to
cultivate Jakarta's new moderate leaders
Suharto after he had done his job
properly here in England the Economist
shortly after described Suharto as a
person who is at heart benign perhaps
thinking of his attitude towards
transnational corporations
though the economists recognized that
there are what they called propagandists
for the gorillas who talk about who
talked about the Army's savagery and
torture and other fabrications of that
source the these people are
propagandists for the guerrillas rather
than say distinguished human rights
activist is because they have completely
the wrong story to tell and so it
continues the Indonesian generals
fortunately acted like the Nazis carried
out a staggering mass slaughter
destroyed the danger of the concealed
aggression by a political party that
might have tried that plunder the rich
are interfered with the rich men who
rule the world
so naturally everyone is euphoric their
only concern is that maybe will it'll
what will look bad if we're to openly
euphoric so you've got to do it quietly
the way Washington did well as I say
this casts a quite an interesting light
on Western civilization one really has
to read the originals in order to
appreciate it these are just samples and
they're quite astonishing that's the
context for the East Timor invasion the
and now just a minor quibble about the
title the silence speak mostly about the
United States here which is where I've
looked at it closely in fact
comprehensively the silence didn't begin
in 1974 it began in 1975 in 1974 and 75
there was considerable coverage of East
Timor surprisingly the coverage was in
the context of the collapse of the
Portuguese Empire which caused much
concern at the time because there was
fear that that might stir up
radical nationalist currents around the
world interfering with the service
function I was taking very seriously and
context there was there was surprising
amount of coverage of East Timor the
silence began really on December 19 not
that there was truth but there was
coverage the silence began in nineteen
in December 1975 with the Indonesian
invasion from then on there's a sharp
decline in coverage it reaches 0 in the
z-row
literally in the United States and
Canada two countries I looked at it
reaches zero in 1978 which is the year
in which the atrocities Pete and in
which in fact Jimmy Carter took some
time off from his sermons about human
rights to increase US aid Indonesia
because they were actually running out
of arms in the war against this tiny
country at that as the massacres
increase the coverage decline hitting
zero as they peaked in 1978 that's what
led to that Somalia like situation that
Arnold was describing the the US was
providing crucial military and
diplomatic support to the invasion
that's not that issue the US was
providing 90 percent of the arms when
the arms supply began Windell increased
the flow of arms at the United Nations
ambassador Moynihan he takes credit in
his memoirs for having us he puts it
rendered the United Nations utterly
ineffective in anything it tried to do
about Timor under State Department
orders because as he says the United
States wanted things to turn out as they
did he knows how they turned out then
next sentence says within a couple of
months they killed 60,000 people a
proportion of the population comparable
to what the Nazis had done in Eastern
Europe during the Second World War and
then sort of
the next topic that's why he is regarded
as a leading exponent of international
law and human rights and the need to
follow you know always trotted out to
talk about how holy and great
international law is and how terrible it
is that all sorts of third-world maniacs
undermine the United Nations and so on
and so forth the diplomatic and the
military support was critical and not
secret but silence wrong stories like
those propagandists for the guerrillas
that The Economist is worried about who
are trying to impugn impugn the noble
character of this man who is at heart
benign well there have been just coming
up to the present in 1990-91 there was a
kind of a surprising new focus on
teamwork
and as Arnold pointed out I was in the
context of the Iraqi invasion of Quaid
which was remarkably similar a big
powerful country invading and conquering
and the next thing a small oil producer
teamwork is effective that's for certain
but it apparently has rich oil reserves
in the Timor Sea between Timor and
Australia the two invasions are not
entirely comparable historical actions
never are so hard that probably killed
about well
how many times probably 100 times as
many people I guess in in the invasion
of East Timor and but aside from in
general there had striking similarities
and it was hard not to notice them and
they were indeed notice there were
various tortured explanations given as
to why we were being noble and defending
Quade from Saddam Hussein and also being
Noble and supporting Indonesia while it
was destroying East Timor I'll put aside
the explanations which again have to be
looked at to be believed but there were
some people who said it straight to
their credit one of them was the Foreign
Minister of Australia Gareth Evans who
simply pointed out that there is no
binding obligation not to recognise
acquisition of territory by force but
the world is an unfair place littered
with examples of acquisition by force so
let's be honest about it at the same
time the Australian Prime Minister Prime
Minister Hawke said big countries cannot
invade small neighbours and get away
with it the weak will feel more secure
because they know that they will not
stand alone if they are threatened now
that all nations know that the rule of
law must prevail over the rule of force
in international relations they know
this because of the righteous Anglo
Americans who have established that
lesson of course he was talking about
Iraq and and quake these were side by
side in England British intellectuals
lectured with gravity about the nobility
of their ancient traditions while
British Aerospace entered into the
biggest military deal with any Southeast
Asian nation right after the principles
of international
than uphill this with Indonesia right
after principles of international law
had been held and upheld in quake all of
this goes by without anybody batting an
eyelash occasionally you get a few words
of explanation of how it really makes
perfect sense but that's about it
actually we're going through that right
now it's kind of amazing to see how
compartmentalised minds can be big front
page story in the British press Louis a
couple of days or weeks has been matrix
Churchill in that whole business the
fact that Britain was in fact as
everyone knew for years I don't know why
they seem surprised about it
Britain in the United States were of
course helping to arm their friends
saddam hussein who was a moderate he was
a moderate upholding stability and in
fact he committed his first crime on
august 2nd 1990 when he stepped out of
line up until then you know he's just
massacring kurds and things like that
which is no big deal and so of course
they were arming him and in fact keeping
the british machine tools industry going
and so on and so forth that's on the
front pages at the same time Britain as
I think Peter Carey with all the details
but I think that Britain has now become
the leading military supplier to
Indonesia you can't make a distinction
between Suharto and Saddam Hussein
they're the same you know just clones
basically so on the one hand were
agonized about the past error
what happened they'll be an inquiry an
investigation about the sending arms to
Saddam Hussein at the very same time the
British military industry is trying to
whip up more armed cells for Indonesia
and that can go by and two sectors of
the mind without any interference
between them some curious thing about
the way brains are hooked up curious
thing that you see constantly when you
look at International Affairs and
political culture in
November 1991 there was another revival
of concern over teamwork what happened
as the Indonesian made a tactical error
namely they carried out a massacre in
front of television cameras that is
always a mistake for those of you who
hope to be national leaders the
massacres have to be carried out when
nobody's looking or at least when the
press pretends it's not looking you
can't carry them out while the
television cameras are focused on them
that's a mistake that countries have
found over and over again and when you
make this mistake there's a routine that
you go through you set up an
investigating Commission which deals
with it and it gives some light taps on
the wrist to the people responsible for
the massacre and then your friends
abroad laud you for the magnificence of
your willingness to come to terms with
this kind of marginal deviation from
your usual high principle and everything
goes back to where it was that was the
game that was played with regard to
Indonesia as well this time didn't
entirely work for one thing that
television films did yet shown I don't
think they've had been shown in the
United States television I just read the
newspapers the limit to my masochism but
they have been in in England they there
was also the mistake of beating and
practically killing a couple of Western
reporters through American reporters
British reporter that doesn't look very
nice all right so the matter has
remained that in fact there were
consequences one consequence of the
November 1991 massacre was that
there was a sharp increase in the
arrangements for oil leases in the
Indonesia in the Timor Sea Australia's
Gareth Evans comments that I quoted
before were in the context of a treaty
that Australia had signed with Indonesia
to exploit temari's
wealth raises a number of other
questions you know one might ask what
the reaction would have been say if
Libya had joined with Iraq to exploit
quaity oil in the fall of 1990 but let's
put that aside after November 91 the
dozens of Western oil companies from all
the major countries raced into the Timor
Sea to use these new opportunities to
steal teamers
resource resources thanks to the
Australia Indonesia treaty which is now
being questioned before the World Court
that was one consequence second
consequence was here in Britain Britain
stepped up its military sales to
Indonesia a third consequence which is a
little different within the United
States which was interesting and
surprising and significant for the
future there was in the United States
Congress actually terminated the
military aid Indonesia now that means
they terminated the arrangements for
Indonesian officers to come to get
training to get the right orientation as
I had put it in Boston it was an
interesting sidelight through this on on
here it is on the anniversary of the
dealy massacre there's a the Boston
newspaper has an article on November
12th which says headline Indonesian
general facing suit flees Boston and it
starts by saying an Indonesian general
accused of contributing to the deaths of
as many as 200,000 people has fled the
Boston area after being sued by family
members of the victim lawyers who filed
the suit said yesterday when people in
charge of the massacre and dealing he
was apparently coming to Harvard the
Kennedy School of Government where they
have a special program for third world
murderers to teach them how to do it
better next time and Harvard denied that
he was attending school there but that
was apparently a lie this happened last
year I should say and it's becoming a
pattern and an interesting one that
others could follow last year at Harvard
they had a another clone of Saddam
Hussein and support the general gramacho
of Guatemala as another moderate ease
the State Department the favorite in
fact for the next elections he was the
guy who was largely responsible for the
genocide 'el massacres and the
Guatemalan Highlands in the early 1980s
which also led to a lot of euphoria and
support in the West I should say he was
there were reports in the Central
American press that he was coming to
Harvard I suggested to some local
activists that they look into it Harvard
denied it but it turned out he was there
and on graduation day the same law firm
served him with subpoena on graduation
day so it was hard to miss and he fled
the country and in facts forfeit of the
suit and I was 10 million dollars now
they did it again within
in general and that's probably the same
story it's a interesting tactic they
will become really interesting when they
start applying it to the people who
can't flee to their own countries then
we'll really be in business anyway these
things these things happen they happen
because of intensive work of a very
small number of people in fact primarily
one Arnold Cohen has been carrying this
thing on his shoulders so basically
alone with occasional help from someone
else for since the beginning and it's a
remarkable example of what people people
can do it has gotten to the point where
Indonesian generals can't come to
Harvard anymore because they're going to
be they're gonna have to flee the
country because of the reaction to their
atrocities and where Congress will
actually cut back and eliminate military
meaning it will probably still go on but
some through some more devious means if
the same thing happened in the United
Kingdom it could make quite a difference
a major difference especially now that
Britain has become the major I think the
major certainly one of the major
military supporters that's the most
important lesson the bear in mind in my
opinion Ben Anderson who's one of the
world's leading specialists on Indonesia
just gave some talks in Australia in
which he expressed his feeling that
there is a fair chance for the first
time that Indonesia may want to rid
itself of what by now it's becoming
something of a nuisance he quoted the
Foreign Minister of Australia of
Indonesia who said that Timor is like a
sharp piece of gravel in our shoes and I
think that tells us something if we make
that piece of gravel sharper perhaps one
of the world's major atrocity stories
may finally be
Thanks
I think we have some time for questions
it may be that some people need to go
and please do so if you need to depart
now but there will be 10 minutes for
questions which come up after of any of
the three presentations which are made
particularly from Professor Chomsky
store so we just have a Intermezzo for
about a minute we settle themselves
there is a chance for you to ask
professor Chomsky or drongo Vida or
Arnold what it has been like to to hold
the reports in the United States in
terms of the East Timor issue and where
developments might go from here and what
sort of pressure might be applied
particularly here in the United Kingdom
where an unconscionable level of
military assistance and aid is still
going without question government to
government to the Indonesian generals
yes
that was low
he's asking better people the end with
your your presentation and say please
take up your pens and write to your MPs
15 million in overseas development age
goes to Indonesia every year
but you said since that haze is useful
it should not just be cut but it should
be made conditional would you like to
add anything to that
well practically what I want you to do
is to write here MP and to ask him to
intervene on behalf he marries people in
terms of not cutting the aid to the
Unison government but to attach strings
to the aid itself that is to put
conditionality on a I guess that's what
I really want to say
are there other questions
odyo assistance to indonesia what is it
may depend on what is the Oda assistance
mainly spent on
some of my tongues going on forestry and
quite close to the stuff is going on
bursaries
a trade provision for the purchase of
sophisticated telecommunications
equipment to allow the central forest
office to communicate with its offices
around
see
right well our last Arnold perhaps to
add some things but the questioner asked
is is T more unique
or there are other variants of which
Irian Jaya West Irian and the Republic
Maluku soliton the RMS which briefly
attempted to get a secession from the
Republic in 1952 52
what has happened in these areas I would
just like to preface or any reply by
saying that there is a very significant
difference between East Timor and the
other two areas which have been alluded
to in 1948 the Prime Minister of
Indonesia the soon to become a vice
president of Indonesia Mohammed Hutta
made a public statement about what the
boundaries of the Republic would be this
was at a time when Indonesia after the
second police action was still deeply
marred in its own guerrilla war against
the Dutch and he said that as far as we
are concerned the boundaries of the
Republic will be exactly the same as
those of the Netherlands East Indies
which of course did not include from
1913 with the demarcation of the East
West Timor boundary which was
internationally demarcated East Timor so
East Timor is a case of breach of
international law whereas as far as
Republic of the malakas or erienne it is
something which has occurred within an
area schism has been claimed on his part
in the Indonesian Jakarta view of the
Republic the RMS is interesting because
within Indonesia it is I perhaps stand
corrected as far as arch is concerned
but it is the one case of an attempt to
secede from the Republic 5758 were
federal revolts have been federal roads
but the RMS was an attempt to secede and
it was very much a legacy of a colonial
past
namely that
various special credits very special
arrangements a very special culture grew
up in the Republic in the South malakas
rather like the Marshall races of India
the Ambani's were used in the colonial
army they they spoke Dutch they had a
sort of Dutch acculturation and
religious acculturation because most of
them were Protestant which set them
apart from at least culturally and
religiously and turns the historical
experience somewhat apart from the rest
of Indonesia and then when their public
gained its independence in 1949 its
formal independence they saw all these
goodies drying up and they were
reluctant to go and sort of eke out an
existence in the sort of allow type
suburbs of Amsterdam and they wish to
fight for their own independence but
that is to a large extent being
extinguished and a third and fourth
generation have now grown up in in in
the Netherlands who don't want to go
back to Indonesia particularly who have
now become acculturated to Dutch society
and that to some extent has one done as
far as Irian Jaya is concerned this is
very much more akin to the situation in
his team all with the proviso that it
does form a part which is being claimed
and I think I would turn to maybe the
only thing I would add to that is simply
to say that the legal rights that these
teamrees have are really the only thing
in the international sense that they've
had going for themselves all these years
that is the Indonesians don't have a
right to East Timor now the situation is
very bad in West Irian but it's a
separate case it has to be solved in its
own terms as do these other regional
questions it's not in any way to to
undercut or minimize what's happening in
these places but the legal rights are
something that these teamrees have to
hold on to good deal life I mean now in
Washington you have various moderate
scholars and and policy types who didn't
really want to know about each team you
these team or before saying well look
you know let's solve these team or
problem by democratizing Indonesia and
somehow these teamrees will get their
rights I say you know what kind of talk
is this I mean the the team Arisa
are supposed to make some kind of
backroom deal you know you know maybe
we'll we'll help you at some point you
know maybe something will happen I mean
the only reason that there's there's all
this talk at all is because of the
massacre last year and the fact that you
know the the situation continues to be
serious and it won't really go away I
mean just the other day a leading
columnist of the New York Times one of
their more decent commentators mentioned
these team or as one of three issues
that Bill Clinton should address so it's
it's quite different than it was you
know 25 years ago when James Reston was
calling it a gleam of light in Asia and
and in in terms of television they're
more programs that have that that are
looking toward putting something on the
air and something was just on a couple
of months ago and so this is a serious
problem next to the silence that exists
to all these years but the idea is is
that the the legal rights of the
theories have have to be held quite
separate from any other issues with
regard to the
the question was about watermelon
Nicaragua has the decline in US military
aid to Central America to Indonesia been
accompanied by in a company by rise
there any Israeli well actually that was
going on already in the seventies in it
was 1978 I believe in 1978 the Vice
President Walter Mondale went to
Indonesia is spreading the message of
human rights remember that was the soul
of our foreign policy in those days and
he was very impressed with what he saw
in Indonesia so impressed that he
contacted Washington from there telling
them they got a really send and they
Asia some advanced jet planes this was
right at the peak of the massacres and
East Timor and there are various
congressional restrictions on that it's
hard so they got Israel to send them
American planes Skyhawks I think in 1978
to help help out the good work that
Indonesia was doing for human rights
there that's exactly what's going on in
that connection 1980s I don't know these
things are not easy to determine the
United States is unusual country and
that we actually can know we can get to
know what know what their aid is going
sometimes takes over work but there are
Ricker's and they're more or less
accurate and if they're not you can get
somebody in Congress or somewhere to be
out the right ones most countries you
can't find out so I for example I think
it would be extremely difficult to find
out say what Belgian aid is going to
vary
country's least I don't know anybody has
tried to do it and I suspect if you
tried to do it it would be very hard I
don't know what the situation is like in
England in the case of Israel that's you
know these are all state secrets I mean
you can learn about them and from one or
another leak or something of that kind
so all kinds of things are going on that
you know you can only find out about by
investigative reporting and all kind of
inquiries and so on and so forth it's
not that the United States doesn't carry
out clandestine activities of course it
does plenty of huge ones
but at least things like direct military
aid are pretty public so for example it
is possible to learn say too late you
know a couple of years later that during
the late 1970s when the carter
administration claimed that it was
cutting down cutting out aid to
guatemala as the atrocities were really
peaking that that was just a lie the
pentagon printouts show that the
military aid went at approximately the
normal level
right through the 70s barely changing in
the case of Indonesia after the
Indonesian invasion of East Timor there
was a public statement that the u.s. was
imposing a six-month arms ban on
Indonesia until the situation sorted
itself out I think was Ben Anderson it
figured out Ben Anderson who I mentioned
before discovered that that was another
lie and in fact none I had that six
month ban been so secret that the
Indonesian had never heard about it
until I heard this announcement but also
during the six-month ban the United
States actually approached Indonesia
with offers for new counter insurgency
equipment you know counterinsurgency
aircraft and so on so if you if you work
in relatively open countries like the
United States and probably England you
can probably get the answers to these
things but in most countries very hard
to penetrate and most and people don't
try interestingly
there's
what has been the reaction
and why do you think
more support
well regarding the ASEAN countries
initially when East Timor was invaded
Singapore was quite upset and abstained
on the first UN vote remembering the old
period of confrontation with Malaysia
worrying that the Indonesian could
potentially harm them under wrong
circumstances now due to the fact that
ASEAN is is a regional alliance I think
the Indonesian were able to whip
everybody more or less into line and and
you know everyone more or less goes
along with everyone else's policies and
so they were able to enforce some kind
of regional discipline one of the
problems about not more about the fact
that there's not more support from the
south is that the Indonesian have been
able to call on certain countries that
are with Indonesia and OPEC and so that
automatically takes out certain
important countries then they say a
country like India sees go in the early
60s and doesn't really want anybody
bringing up issues like this and so they
able to separate say an important
country like India they're able to co-op
certain Islamic countries on basis of
Islamic solidarity and essentially use
their old position as leader in the
third world an old position that really
you know dated back to the 50s - to
really call in a lot of favors I mean
for example when East Timor was first
invaded the then foreign minister of
Indonesia had been very close to what
was then Yugoslavia and they got the
Yugoslavians essentially to help them
within private diplomatic channels and
amongst the Eastern Bloc and other
non-aligned countries not to do anything
and so the Indonesian is being a big
powerful you know third world country
after all I mean now the fourth largest
country
the world if the dissolution of the
Soviet Union and the Tea Murray's in
terms of third-world support had on this
side at the beginning the the former
Portuguese colonies in Africa and a
number of other countries were helpful
but the former Portuguese colonies in
Africa as we know if had their own
problems quite severe and so I think
that is largely what slide behind the
black support from the South but I must
add that the the policy on East Timor
that's enabled the Indonesians to do
what they've done all these years has
been you know military and economic
support from the West and Japan so and
and if the United States and other
countries want this problem to be solved
under the rubric of the United Nations
the opposition of certain southern
countries is not going to make terribly
much of the difference I mean it
certainly didn't on on Kuwait and other
places
right
Thomas can you do here noise nothing
embarrassing what was
yes I mean Kuwait's is essentially a so
the well you know every country is an
artificial creation it's just a question
of how many people you could kill before
you know you got the boundaries fixed
where they were in the cell the things
called countries are the relics of
European savagery I mean Europe after
all conquered the world in a very savage
and brutal fashion and had left it a
wreck and the you know I sort of try to
pick up the pieces after the Europeans
got through with it but boundaries have
been put here and there and so on and so
forth and you know you kind of stick to
them like the organization of African
states insists upon keeping to the
totally idiotic boundaries that were
imposed by European colonialism simply
because they know they're right in doing
it because they know that once you start
getting those up your you know you've
got Yugoslavia I mean you have to pick
the best of a lot of rotten choices
after the European savagery swept
through and decided it wasn't worth
exploiting any longer in the case of
Iraq and quate that's you know that's I
mean the British simply drew the
boundary where they wanted it from all
the region and the boundaries were drawn
in such a way as to ensure that well in
fact it's it's you can read it and a lot
of the British records are open now
dealing with this and they're very
explicit and back around the first world
war Britain decided that it didn't have
the power any longer didn't have the
force to control the Empire
with troops it was just Britain was
declining couldn't do that any longer so
therefore there were a couple of
measures that were selected one of them
which in fact was strongly supported by
Winston Churchill was to use poison gas
and particularly against Kurds he
thought they were particularly good
choice and that he said will strike a
lively terror in the hearts of
uncivilized tribesmen and he was very
angry about the squeamishness of those
in the foreign officer who didn't like
this idea in fact that was used there's
Lord George couple years later insisted
that Britain undermine the disarmament
conference of 1932 it was true there was
a big disarmament conference which was
trying to put a barrier against
bombardment of civilians and Britain
succeeded in preventing that measure
from going through because as Lloyd
George put it privately we have to
reserve the right to bomb the niggers
and that's that's the British tradition
and that's British culture
you got to reserve the right to bomb the
niggers you got to use poison gas if you
want to against uncivilized tribes and
these measures were required once you no
longer had the force to just control the
Empire directly the other technique that
was used and this brings us more
directly to Iraq and Kuwait is to I
should say and certainly that if Britain
were really a free country this is the
kind of thing you'd be learning in
elementary school you know it wouldn't
have to wait for somebody to tell it to
same holes for the United States and
every other country generous as far as
the other technique that was used which
was suggested by Lord Curzon and the
parliamentary commission during the
First World War was to create what they
called an hour
facades in the in in the Middle East
region to veil colonial control behind
constitutional fictions like buffer
state and Protectorate and so on those
would be Arab facades the idea and
that's the system that still exists
until today
the idea is to you've got to ensure that
the wealth of the region goes to the
west
now that means the United States and
Britain primarily not to the local
people it's not it's not them belong to
them and the way you do that is by
constructing an Arab facade a family
dictatorship which is basically the
local managers for the Western
corporations and countries and they can
enrich themselves the third-world elites
are allowed to enrich themselves if they
do their job properly but you got to
make sure that the massive the
population doesn't get in on this act
that doesn't belong to them and that's
the history of Kuwait in Iraq I mean the
boundaries were set up in such a way
that quate in particular I don't want an
effect of Saudi Arabia the u.s. did the
same in Saudi Arabia and all the ego
principalities they are supposed to be
Arab facades
run by family dictatorships so weak that
they do what you tell them and and if
they get into trouble they have regional
enforcers like Israel and Turkey and
Iran under the Shah and they come in and
smash people up and if things really get
out of hand you call in the guys with
the muscle Britain in the United States
who really did the job properly for you
that's the structure of the system and
it remains that way Quade was carved out
as part of that system in if you want to
really find out B what went on this is a
kind of amazing that during the Iraq war
people didn't look at this more
carefully but actually I know only one
researcher woman in Britain Kristen
Kersten kale
in living Marxism on this who actually
looked at the proper documents amazing
than anybody else look these are
documents from late 50s right after the
Iraqi Revolution which scared the
daylights out of everybody because it
was a nationalist revolution in which
they thought at the time was an asteroid
that was taking over one of the
oil-producing regions turned out it was
no big problem but look at painters at
the time at that point the British
Foreign Secretary saw when boy flew
immediately to Washington they were very
upset the u.s. invaded Lebanon right
afterwards and threaten to use nuclear
weapons in fact if things got out of
hand
solenoid flew to Washington they had
discussions with Dulles and so on it's
all available in the British and
American records parallel they say the
same things the decision was made to
grant Kuwait nominal independence so
that the infection wouldn't spread any
further the nationalist infection
however as Lloyd put it internally and
Britain reserves the right ruthlessly to
intervene in case anything goes wrong
and quite no matter what the source in
other words any thing goes wrong with
this arrangement we ruthlessly intervene
the United States which is the big boy
takes the same right with regard to the
big prize namely Saudi Arabia Britain
gets the little one quake the United
States gets the big one Saudi Arabia and
they explained the reasoning quaity oil
and the profits from it particularly not
just the oil but the profits from it
we're very seriously needed to prop up
the sterling area to maintain Britain's
already sagging economy and it's
necessary to ensure that the Arab facade
there keeps it flowing there if they
don't we ruthlessly intervened by the
early 1970s that was already beginning
to become a problem for the United
States as well and in fact both Britain
and the United States gained when the
price rise when the price of oil
it was mixed but they basically caned
when the price of oil went up in the
early 70s for one thing because they're
both high cost oil producers but for
another thing because the oil companies
are basically Anglo American and their
prices went up even faster than the oil
price so the profits came back here here
in the United States primarily so that
that's that's where Quaid comes from I
mean you can say yes it's illegitimate
but of course you know named the state
that isn't I think we'd like to thank
you all for coming
maybe we could take one more more
question what would you like to
the manger he gave the impression of
coming in with
politically reformist stops he was
talking about nice things I'm a mister
of international weapons well you know
this is a move in the right direction
this is a good thing I think that in the
United Nations Churchill we we now know
what the true in the United States I
have sympathy about here is someone
with somewhat GA physically perform this
time
well actually George right after the
Iraq war of so-called war that was
should not really refer to it as a war
after the Iraq slaughter or war or
something where two sides shoot at each
other and after that event whatever you
call it was over Bush had a triumphal
speech in Congress where he talked about
the great tragedy of the world in
particular the Middle East namely
proliferation of weapons and now that we
have this wonderful New World Order
we're gonna have to cut back on weapons
sales and we have to control all this
and so on and everybody applauded and
editorials and so on couple days earlier
the administration had presented to the
Senate its plans for increased arms
sales all over the world particularly to
the Middle East then they went up beyond
by now the United States is so far in
the lead in arms sales that you can't
even count and they're peddling arms all
over the place the successes in
destroying a defenseless country and
Iraq were where you were guaranteed that
they wouldn't shoot back so that's the
way you become a hero and that those
were used as a sales device half there's
a big air show in Paris every year and
the next Paris Air Show all the
companies went and they showed off these
wonderful things that you could use to
bomb the niggers and when they can't
shoot back and so on and you try to sell
them the other killers so they'll use
them too and of course arm sales my way
up in fact that's one of the ways in
which the United States has compensated
for the fact that there's been an attack
on the Pentagon budget Pentagon budget
is somewhat not much but somewhat
declined because of the loss of the
traditional pretext defense against the
Russians and one of the ways they've
kept things going is by expanding arms
sales and I presume what happened and
here is the same though I don't know now
as far as Clinton is concerned Clinton
is just another conservative Republican
you know I mean I'm amazed at what I've
been reading in the British press
the election it certainly doesn't
describe the country I see I read in The
Guardian the other day about how Clinton
is a kind of beacon of hope for the
international left after this inspiring
victory and so on that really galvanized
Americans it's kind of a caricature but
something like this you know Clinton was
extremely unpopular he's a conservative
business candidate he's the governor of
a so-called right-to-work state right to
work as a euphemism which means illegal
to organize the state and Democrats this
and this convention didn't even feel the
need to make the usual gestures towards
their traditional popular constituency
they didn't pretend to be anything other
than a business party in fact if you
look at the international financial
markets which tell you how the business
community responds the things they were
either stable or actually improved after
the election because the international
investors think has probably a good
thing for the investment climate
I left the United States last night so I
last papers I read were the Sunday
papers where they interviewed Robert
Reich who's the he's the kind of lefty
extremist and the administration he's
one of the people who was with Clinton
at Oxford I don't know if you followed
the role that Oxford play is an American
mythology but Oxford is the place where
Clinton got these ideas about social
engineering which have destroyed in
Europe you know that's why the US
economy is booming while Germany
collapses and so on but and he and
Clinton and right we're here together
and he's sort of the you know the
Keynesian lefty and they'd never view
with the Boston Globe's our bird
professor and he said well maybe we
won't have to carry out these Public
Works programs and investment programs
and so on that we were talking about
maybe the economy will recover on its
own although we should carry out an
investment tax credit in other words
regressive fiscal measures to benefit
investors and you know how anybody can
be surprised at this I don't know I mean
if you look at the institutional
structure of American politics it's
perfectly obvious
in fact of world politics decision you
know the power is in the hands of those
who own the place and they set the
parameters within which decisions are
made now you don't make it into the
political system until you accept those
rules if anybody got into tried to break
them they'd be cut off very quickly if
you don't can't figure out for yourself
you can read the Wall Street Journal
which will explain exactly what would
happen if some American president were
crazy enough to try to carry out social
welfare programs what would happen is
the International bond market which is
huge I mean I forget the numbers but
huge amounts of American government
bonds are traded every day I mean
astronomical numbers the owners of the
bonds would not like it and when they
don't like it they pull out their money
which means that the interest rate goes
up which means that the economy
collapses and that's the end okay so if
anybody we're going to try to carry out
these policies they would be very
quickly disciplined by what is called
the market that means the device by
which the rich men who are already
satisfied
rule the worlde okay and Clinton isn't
about to make any mistake like that I
mean the chances that a the Clinton
program will reflect a slightly
different understanding of how to
improve the profitability of American
enterprise
maybe incidentally some other people
will benefit from it maybe not but
that's an incident and as far as arms
sales are concerned the United States
does face a structural problem though
it's a serious one the United States
there is no capitalist country in the
world
I mean third world countries are
supposed to be capitalist but that's so
that we can destroy them any country
that has ever successfully developed has
done it by violating those principles
that's true of England that's true the
United States is true all over the South
Korea if you take a look at the modern
American economy the parts of it that
function are the parts that get enormous
amounts of government protection and
subsidy that's a pretty good article is
a letter this morning in the Financial
Times on a back page but some
parliamentarian isn't even in recognize
who give some of the facts about this
which are accurate the United States a
very heavily protectionist the parts of
the economy that function like say
electronics and pharmaceuticals and
biotechnology are basically state
subsidized there's no other way Frank
that to work the industrial program the
the Industrial Development Program in
the United States has been based in the
Pentagon system if you look at things
like SDI Star Wars the expenditures for
Star Wars are approximately are
distributed about the same way as the
expenditures by meeting the Japanese you
know Ministry of industrial trading
industry because they target the same
technologies you know they expect they
make roughly the same judgments but with
the emerging technologies do in the
United States the way you do it is
feedom faded through star wars but
that's the function of the program and
that's the way it was sold
well that's gone you know it's getting
harder and harder this means taxpayer
subsidy the taxpayers have to agree to
pay off advanced industry by paying the
costs of research and development and
providing a state guarantee to publicly
guaranteed market for waste production
in the hope that something will be
profitable at which point you turn it
over to private enterprise that's what's
called free enterprise or private
enterprise public pays the costs and if
anything comes out of it you give it to
rich guys to make the profit and it's
hard to sell that to people no so in the
United States the way it's been sold the
people as the Russians are coming well
the Russians aren't coming you know that
so that makes it harder and now there's
a search for alternative techniques to
develop the same programs and that's why
the people around the Clinton are
talking about civilian state state
involvement in research on civilian
production to replace Pentagon
production of course if you look closely
it's always pre commercial okay like the
National Academy of Sciences just
proposed the big government corporate
Enterprise which in which the taxpayer
will pay the costs of development for
pre commercial research and development
crucially because
it gets to be commercial that means you
can make some money out of it and it
goes back to the private system that's
the way state capitalism works and
there's not these are only matters of
the you know technical adjustment within
institutional frameworks that are very
resistant to change and they will only
change when the institutions change I
mean short of that you just have you
know you move up and back in a very
narrow space then we're gonna bring the
session to a close now and I'm sure
you'd like to join me in thanking
professor Chomsky very much indeed for a
tour de force and enormous ly unique
occasion which this is I'd also like to
encourage you to actually look at the
exhibition on East Timor which is
downstairs in the restaurant which will
be open till 10:00 tonight and will go
on until the 13th of December I think
it's a very moving and a very special
exhibition because of the way which the
photographs particularly ones relating
to 1991 were taken and it's an
opportunity not to be missed
thank you
[Applause]
yes
Chris Juana who actually took the
footage the video footage in the
cemetery itself and many others who
supported that work that the world knew
about what had been going on something
of what had been going on in his team or
it was certainly not the first massacre
Aria Branca like Ludacris there been
many massacres which had punctuated the
bloody rule and occupation of the
Indonesian since 1975 but this was the
first time that it was actually shown
across the world
Australian customs officials and
authorities tried to in fact confiscate
the tape so sensitive was Australia to
the ramifications of showing that film
and it's to their credit and to their
enormous courage that's we know today
what we do know about his Timor in a
room like this can be filled almost a
capacity in order to hear a talk on East
Timor no doubts the character of the
main speaker tonight professor Chomsky
has been a major draw we've hijacked him
from the philosophers for one night and
we're very pleased to be able to do so
but it's also I think very much due to
the publicity and to the awareness the
growing awareness which has enabled such
a gathering to come into being we'd like
to send a message tonight to the people
of East Timor that they have not been
forgotten that they have a hope for a
better world and that oxfords which has
a link now with the presidency in the
United States can have an influence on
events perhaps larger than one might
think there will be a student club and
student society association which will
be founded called the Friends of East
Timor should be founded some hands and
the founders are here tonight and if
you'd like to to know more about it you
can get in touch with me or for others
who are involved with work on East Timor
so without further I do
turn to drown gordita who is a graduate
students at Campion Hall working on a
thesis to do with nationalism and
religion in his Timor and most of all he
has been a personal witness to the
events which we will be talking of
tonight thank you
[Music]
I hope you can hear me and that the mic
is is functioning properly well ladies
and gentlemen and Friends it's a great
pleasure to welcome you tonight to the
Museum of Modern Art's and to this
lecture by Professor Chomsky which is
being held in conjunction with a major
exhibition on East Timor which is can be
seen in the downstairs in the restaurant
and I hope that you will be able to see
it after this this meeting it will be
open for half an hour afterwards the
format of tonight will be that I will
make a very short opening address I will
then turn to Jean Boveda who is a nice T
Maurice who's now studying at Campion
hall to give something of an impression
of what it has been like to actually
live through the years of the Indonesian
military occupation and to particularly
dwell on the developments which have
happened within the East Timor E's
church the Catholic Church of East Timor
and the way in which that has focused in
and helped to sustain the growing
nationalist resistance in East Timor
Arnold Cohen will then follow Arnold has
been almost single-handed the architect
of keeping East Timor in front of the
public eye in the United States during
16 years when it was extremely difficult
for MA for much of that time to really
be able to hold it as an issue of major
public concern because of the way in
which the press and those who could
report what had been going on in his
team or were excluded and were banned
from visiting the territory and also
from what Professor Chomsky will be
talking about in the fourth presentation
the International matrix
which is kept East Timor in the position
that has been in during the past sixteen
to seventeen years I'm a specialist on
Indonesian history and to my shame it
took me nearly ten years to actually
realize what was happening in East Timor
I remember the first indication that
something was pretty seriously wrong was
when I was sitting in a restaurant
Leiden but there is certainly an
explosive phenomenon which has taken
place in East Timor over the last 17
years and this phenomenon is the real
religious element which I'm going to
describe it briefly in the following
terms first and foremost since the new
medium version of his team Oh in 1975
the timorous church has adopted an
attitude of mutual accommodation with
timorous people throughout the 17 years
of occupation the Catholic Church in
East Timor has given all sort of
supports and in several ways to the
suffering he marries people in other
words the timorous Catholic Church has
been the only and real haven in East
Timor under those seventeen years and
continues to be
and secondly as a team research begins
or began to look at the Bible from the
underside that is from the perspective
of the suffering numerous people many
similes came in mass in big numbers and
converted to Catholicism from 30% of
Catholics in 1975 when the unisons or
when the body's government left the East
him--oh the number went up 60% and now
the total number of converted of those
converted to Catholicism is something
around 95% if the figure means anything
at all it must mean that this is a
potentially when I first went to
Australia in 1987 I was invited to give
a talk at one of the universities in
Melbourne I was quite nervous at the
time because my English wasn't very good
and before it talked there was a student
who came to me and asked me where I was
the speaker and I said yes she then went
on saying that she knew quite well about
the plight of the timorous people and
she was very upset about her
government's policy on his team on
and then she asked me where exactly is
Timor was and she wonder whether it was
somewhere in the northern suburb of
Victoria and of course I said yes but a
bit further north so we literally went
through all the suburbs around Victoria
and we ended up at the top end of
Australia which is Darwin by then she
realized the mistake she made that she
simply had mistaken East emo with one of
the original tribes in Australia well
what exactly I want to say tonight it's
nothing complex
the simple fact that the timrie struggle
still survives today it is mainly due to
the Catholic Church and its priests in
East Timor and by this I don't mean to
undervalue and to end the value of the
spirit of nationalism of the timorous
people themselves and nor do I overlook
the efforts of individuals and groups
solidarity's around the world and Red's
that's five Western journalists two
Britons Australians and New Zealand had
been shot and killed while covering the
war at Valley bow in October of 75 and I
thought well it's a bit odd for five
journalists and cameramen just to be
wiped off the face of the earth just
like that just fulfilling their duties
and it was not until 1983 when I was
asked to review the book written by
James Dunne an excellent book on East
Timor Court immoral people betrayed that
I realized what had happened to them
that they had been shot in cold blood by
the Indonesian army and that not only
they have died but somewhere around a
hundred thousand team owners out of a
population of 688 thousand had died in
the first three and a half years of the
Indonesian occupation alone per capita
and in terms of the suffering per square
inch in East Timor certainly perhaps
greater than that even of Pol Pot's
Cambodia in the following year after 83
we tried to hold a meeting to coincide
with a visit to Oxford by jose
ramos-horta
who later came as a visiting fellow to
Stan's knees and like Arnold has been
very much instrumental in terms of
holding the the cause of his team or
aloft in the UN and in major
international circles in the circles of
diplomacy in international relations for
very long period of time he has been a
principal
pockets of East Timor's rights of
self-determination and the rights for a
future which the people of East Timor
can decide for themselves and when we
organized a meeting in New College
barely 20 people turned up it was a
beautiful hall as large as this but 20
people were there and I think it's a
measure of the change which has been
wrought during the past year a change
which occurred because of the massacre
the Santa Cruz Massacre and the way in
which that massacre was reported in the
West
two of the journalists and photographers
who were there at the time Steve Cox who
took the photographs some of which you
can see downstairs in the exhibition
Peter Gordon who headed the Yorkshire
television team which made the very
moving documentary on his team Oh which
was shown in January last year both are
here tonight and it's due to the courage
of Peter and Steve
