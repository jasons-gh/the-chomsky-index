take a look at the corporation's let's
say X on every one is something like
Standard Oil of California or New Jersey
or something else and the reason is
because they have state charters but
that's the way a corporation's
established Corporation is an entity
established by state power primarily
federal power but within the
jurisdiction of a state where they're
given a charter and if it would be
history of corporations say through the
19th they go back to say 1900 or
something 1800 a corporation was just a
group of people who got together and say
a municipality that got together and
decided we want to build a bridge over
this river or something and they
incorporated and were given a charter by
the state to build a bridge over the
river and once they built the bridge it
was ended that was what a corporation
was for the 19th century these mostly
the courts it wasn't really legislation
the courts gradually extended the rights
and privileges of corporations finally
by about a century ago they were given
extraordinary privileges mostly by by
lawyers legal authorities and Court
decisions and so on but the still
chartered by States I'm the reason that
there are so many that are incorporated
in New Jersey and Delaware is that ethic
about by the late 19th century the
courts have decided that you
corporations didn't have to have a fixed
purpose and they could buy into other
corporations and they were getting all
sorts of other you know it's the right
gift our sins yeah well kind of elect
him later that was the early 19th
century and they got the rights of
persons that beyond the rights of
persons and so on but as all of this
took place some states like New Jersey
and Delaware in particular realized that
they could make a killing test in
corporate taxes by getting the
corporation's to move their offices
there so a movement in the
work across the river and you get a lot
of extra benefits so you had Central
Jersey kind of corporations and billows
that have a race to the bottom the fact
that there were states competing to get
tax product profits and other now I just
didn't find it and so on
led to a kind of race to the bottom
which is still going on incidental so
takes a Massachusetts one of the big
employers here is fidelity the financial
institution the state gives them all
kind of gifts but the Rhode Island is
now giving them their gifts our move
over the border to Rhode Island which
means losing ten stubs of jobs here
other corporations or forget the name of
it that one green technology corporation
was just given a very substantial tax
payer gifts and Massachusetts that they
decided to pack up and go to China now
it's cheaper and workers we've gotten
evergreen so what was it a bird resort
yeah evergreen right so that's it
because now it's international it used
to be in States but they still have
state charters which means that in
principle this isn't the state to take
away charter but they're they're even
less radical modes you can be made which
are could be significant you can take a
look at standard economics textbooks the
kind that you read in graduate courses
and economics on corporations which
point out that it's just as it's just a
Court decision which isn't written in
stone
that corporation corporation management
has to be answerable to stockholders on
a part of anglo-american and corporate
law just a savage by the courts no
legislation is that the managers of
corporation must dedicate themselves to
shareholder profit that's a useful
that's the kind of principle that's
going to destroy the environment when
valves four or five reasons as a really
lethal principle but it's just a court
decision can be returned and as the
textbooks point out you know you could
change corporate law so that
corporations are responsible to what are
called stakeholders stakeholders names
the workforce and community but that
their legal responsibility is for the
benefit of the work of the workforce in
the community
it's nothing an economic principle with
cozia you can't do that it's just a
court decision that you can't do it well
you know that's pretty straightforward
move and you have probably had an
enormous popular support and it's in
short signal a leave charter and that
which is another step so this this kind
of anti corporate that moves that could
be made and they're kind of like right
on the surface like most things about
you know if there's it's just it's a
matter of getting over this kind of
barrier of not seeing what's around us
like that Galilean revolution you got to
see what's around you before you when
you do you find lots of steps can be
taken there are there are small efforts
to do this on a national scale there's
one organization called the committed
stance or poke light pocl ad anyone
remember now you can find it the
interview CLA
yeah it's a couple it's not a lot of
people with small number pets hit it
that's organized by the aggregate
Grossman if I remember which is in which
is you know it has a lot of publications
which are pretty sensible ones on the
questions of this kind does some
organizing of their active parts of the
country like this some area Newell
Pennsylvania I think which is just
rejected little corporations as you
can't go in
