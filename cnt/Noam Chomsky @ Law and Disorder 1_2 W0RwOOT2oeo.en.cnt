here in law and disorder we've
chronicled the events of Israeli forces
in Gaza today we're delighted to have
with us Noam Chomsky one of the world's
foremost social critics institute
professor emeritus in the MIT Department
of linguistics and philosophy and the
author of many books today we talked to
him about his latest Gaza in crisis
reflections on Israel's war against the
Palestinians Noam Chomsky wrote Gaza in
crisis with Ilan Pappe one of the
exceptional young Israeli historians now
teaching history at the University of
Exeter in the UK Noam Chomsky welcome to
law and disorder or beauty let's get
right in and tell us why you wrote this
book by you particularly you wrote two
of the major essays in the book
particularly the one that I've focused
on was exterminate all the Brutes about
the war on and Gaza and give us some
perspectives that you give people in the
book around the war on gaza actually
just to be kindly let's start with
WikiLeaks for perfect if icky which
doesn't sound is not very much of
interest in it frankly but one of the
interesting cables is I think the only
one from leading elevated embassy it's
the Clinton and it discusses this leah
was giving your sort of talking points
discusses the attack on Gaza that's
what's about and it tells her that
Israel had to attack in december two
thousand eight in self-defense because
Hamas had violated the truce now there's
nine two possibilities either the US
Embassy in Israel is so clueless with
nobody even reads the press or else
they're just lying flat out because the
facts are clear and uncontroversial in
december two thousand eight hamas was
calling for a renewal of the truce that
Israel had broken and the Israeli
cabinet considered it rejected it
because they want the bomb and i should
add that's us israel because these are
joint activities and in fact that's what
happened
and there was a truce established in
june two thousand eight Israel never
lived up to it they insisted on
maintaining the siege in violation of
the first agreement but nevertheless
Hamas lived up to it scrupulously Israel
officially recognizes officially that
there was not a single Hamas rocket
until November forth on November 4th
Israeli troops invaded Gaza that killed
at the peasant Hamas militants there was
rocket firing in response and huge
Israeli rocket and start firing when I'm
for couple days and as usual with
casualties were all Palestinian then the
truce did run out in December and then
what happened is we destroyed unless
called repeatedly to even instantly more
rigorous truce agreements and Israel
rejected and then the US visual attack
now the fact that you know this can pass
without comment cause it color on it in
fact i could go on to save 15 in the
whole wikileaks episode my opinion the
most remarkable fact is the absolute
contempt for democracy that's revealed
by the embassies by the State Department
and by the commentators if take a look
at the leaks of the nothing really
dramatic week was repeated all over the
place headlines articles etcetera is
that the way it's put is the Arabs world
wants us to bomb the random for you
notice afraid of the rent well there's a
minor point in a major one the minor
point is there of course just citing the
Arab dictators and we don't know what
they think we don't know how much how
the emissive officials selected or maybe
invented what we wanted to hear which is
quite normal but let's say it's all true
they are citing the Arab dictators
quite brutal what about the Arab
population now again either they are
clueless or don't know a thing about the
Middle East or us their line and we have
good studies of Arab public opinion from
mainstream very respectable sources the
brookings institute released its last
extensive pull a couple of months ago
and it has a lot about this it says that
the Arabs do perceive a threat he eight
percent of them see the threatening
threat is Israel seventy-seven percent
see the main threat as the United States
I you're here n is mentioned way down at
the bottom ten percent see a threat from
Iran in fact they're so opposed the US
policy that a majority 57% i think that
the region would be better off as iran
had nuclear weapons for an hour
intellectual culture what the population
thinks is irrelevant what we care about
is what the dictators think or what we
say they think this is pretty striking
i'm seeing a word about this new going
to gaza for another second because you
written your chapter i believe before
the Goldstone report came out this is
the chapter in gaza in crisis
exterminate all the Brutes and i'm
interested in both your reaction to the
Goldstone report and of course the
state's reaction the u.s. particularly
what I'm trying to run Vivint about it
they did a very good job of thinking as
well as you can do when you're
investigating a past world you don't
have access has been blocked Israel just
11 and the access and so on so it did a
pretty good job but it's in here and
pretty difficult to to really
demonstrate that full crimes took place
in battle you know that you can always
say well you know how do you know some
Hamas gunmen wasn't hiding the under
doors the most critical issue is one
just discussed it Israel have any right
to use for
in the first place any great scottsville
most universally is wilshire in the
right of self-defense that's not the
issue of course everyone has a right of
self-defense the question is you have a
right of self-defense by force and the
law and common sense are quite clear
about that you don't have that right if
you haven't exhausted peaceful means and
in this case is refusing even to try
these four means and the reason is they
knew they'd succeed they'd have gone
back to a person which there were no
rockets well that being the case all
discussions are relevant and now maybe
they committed war crimes in the course
of media the attack on track i'm sure
they did volcom gives good evidence I
mean they basically granted them a gift
if Ezra ones are irrational what they
would have done is welcome the Goldstone
report thank you for agreeing with us
that we were right and justified in the
packing gasm implicitly and then they
would have published a couple of
thousand pages which nobody would looked
at going through each detail I think
that's really important i mean the
Goldstone report does not address at all
it just passes over israel and you know
why interminably ghost himself a long
interview with Bill Moyers which Moyers
asked him what about with a justified
consistory they were justified attacking
they just still it's disproportionate
and that's the way most everything was
reported and even the human rights
groups they just granted them the right
to look back and said well it was
disproportionate it's a little bit like
saying that the Russian invasion of
Afghanistan is disproportionate that's
not the way we do we're speaking with
noam chomsky who's just published to
haymarket books came out with Gaza in
crisis Noam Chomsky and Ilan Pappe it's
a very very fine book no you were
somebody concerned with Israel and its
fate from the very beginning when you
were a young man just like Michael and I
were visited there in the 50s and it's
been something that's been part of our
lives as we've grown up and old and it
gets increasingly dismayed what do you
tell people when they ask you
what sort of solutions to relook for a
one-state Tuesday bi-national state
where we at and what can we do Oh in
fact that even do on analytic solution I
agree any reason to honor would compare
your boundaries excellent woman with and
I were mr. Dillon the early fifties and
we were hitchhiking of the menorah thing
we happened across the Lebanese border
and some kinda cheap came by and started
screaming at us until is the bank but
why have a border cutting the Galilean
half so I'm supporting all these
proposals makes perfect sense as long as
we recognize that you have to have a way
to get there I know of only one way to
proceed if anyone has a different
suggestion we have you hear it anyway I
know is for the United States to join
the rest of the world and stop its
rejectionist opposition to being huge
overwhelming international consensus
agree to a two-state settlement in this
case Israel it has to go along and then
you know there are details to be worked
out with the basic form of itals very
well understood and accepted
overwhelmingly by every relevant actor
except the united states in this room
after that Marlin is that it would be we
come to be recognized everyone in the
former Palestine mandatory Palestine
Jordan to see the drawing a line through
that territory makes absolutely no sense
commercial relations would pick up
social relations cultural relations and
go across the border to the Western
whatever it may be and I think the
borders would erode naturally in natural
ways actually the way that's beginning
to happen in Europe and okay then you
could move towards a bi-national on
Federation of some sort of what people
grow one state and after that you could
overcome the Imperial borders why not
have integration with lemon well now why
is it that the United States defies
international opinion and doesn't go
along some people argue that it's the
Israeli Lobby here others say no it's in
the interests of the ruling elites the
United States to keep Israel as their
cat's paw I mean what's your view of why
they don't go along it's very lobbies
their strong Lobby no doubt and i really
wish those claims were true as those
claims were true would save me a huge
amount of time and effort haha literally
I could stop spending a huge amount of
time giving talks and traveling and
getting involved in organizing efforts
and the writing and so on I could just
put on coat and tie jacket and tie I
thought I'm somewhere go to the
corporate offices of the Intel mortgage
change or whatever you know Lockheed
Martin and explain the Chamber of
Commerce you know and explain to them
politely that their interests are being
harmed by this little lobby that they
can put out of business in five seconds
ok then it would be over that's the
tactical conclusion from the beliefs
that's a lot now the fact of the matter
is quite different I'm the strongest
support for Israeli crimes is coming
from the business world I mean the most
rabid supporter of Israel in the media
is the wall street journal now part of a
pack that's the journal of the business
world Republicans are far more extreme
than the back rats even though Jewish
votes Jewish money both malamig we go to
the Democrats there the more extreme
food business oriented parties and so it
goes across the board an Intel for
example is building its biggest plant
world for new generation chips in Israel
military industry which has a huge lobby
of course the Y to do this room so for
example when we knew it when Obama
offers another three billion dollars
worth of jets which will end up being
twice that throw bleep in this room does
Lockheed Martin
and in fact they love it ee because then
Saudi Arabia comes along and says we
want something so Obama offers and sixty
billion dollars worth of military
equipment that they can't use in the
biggest sale ever after then it's just
delightful and in fact the US military
intelligence a tightly integrated of
Israel so that goes back to nineteen
forty eight I think there's archival
materials and finally beginning working
on which is that in 1948 the Joint
Chiefs the US military were very
impressed by Israel's military
efficiency I thought this could be a
good base for us power it goes on after
67 it just took off I furthermore after
1967 the intellectual community I just
had a love affair with this room they
love this demonstration of his really
power and you have to remember that was
right at the he could the Vietnam War
when despite what claim now liberal
opinion was very upset about the fact
the u.s. wasn't winning the war and here
came Israel along and sure how to deal
with fair world upstarts in addition to
that Israel major effect on the ribs
service to the United States there had
been there had been an ongoing conflict
between radical Islamic fundamentalism
which the US for supporting the US and
Britain and secular nationalism
