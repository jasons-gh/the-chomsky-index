figure with some toppings of your
political position if you want I I can
do this system and the first question is
here and which is your energy for follow
which is a conception of FF netting is
in that these editors of young also the
connection of this with the rationalism
well I don't see innate isn't an issue I
mean everybody except some form of
innate ism I mean everyone agrees that
humans aren't Birds let's say when
they're not rocks and as soon as you
agree with that then you've accepted in
80s and the Western you know you believe
in angels or something we have some
special innate structure that makes us
humans that's not even a doubt there is
you could conceivably argue that we
don't have any Nate structure from
language but that's almost unimaginable
I mean it's impossible to with the most
extensive effort to teach even the
tiniest rudiments of language to even
higher Apes our closest relatives and
humans learn it without any evidence at
all virtually just minimal stimulation
so it must follow that they have
extremely rich structure for language
again somebody might believe and it's
been argued that it's just our general
intelligence applied to this material
but in order to make that a serious
proposal you'd have to say okay what are
the mechanisms of general intelligence
and how are they different from those
who say apes and nobody can even begin
to answer that question so the question
that we have a specific capacity for
language which in fact is highly
restricted to question to that that is
just mysticism at this point now people
want to question it okay it's like
saying I don't believe that the law of
gravity works or if somebody said that I
don't believe that in aid structure
makes make some cells become the
chickens another
from humans again are you with them
exactly it's just these are things that
are obvious the only interesting
question is what's the innate structure
well there you know there are
substantive issues lots of work and so
on my own feeling is it so restricted
that virtually or all of languages in
eight and about the only differences
between languages are in parts of the
lexicon no choice of words some
grammatical developments and so on very
peripheral things that can't really
established yet but i think there's
reasonable evidence for it as to the
connection with rationalism there
there's a serious question of
interpretation i mean there is a
tradition learning from Plato into say
Cartesian rationalism and there are
continuities but they're all so
different one of the continuities has to
do with an eight ism plato was concerned
with very much the same problem how how
can it be that we know so much when we
have so little evidence and for example
in the me know the Socratic dialogue is
essentially a way of teasing out from
the slave boy his innate knowledge of
geometry that's kind of like a thought
experiment trying to demonstrate that
the slave employee who had never heard
of geometry actually knew it all and you
know the experiment is more less
accurate I mean that's what would happen
under those conditions Plato then want
an answer and his answer was that it's
in our souls and we remember it from an
earlier existence okay that's that's not
entirely false it's in our genes
actually and it comes from previous
existence in a sense that answer and
this problem then goes right into the
17th century and for example Leibniz
argues that Plato's Furies much must be
correct there's no other way to account
for knowledge but as he put it his
theory has to be purged of the error of
reminiscence
so somehow that was wrong but he didn't
have anything else to make right in
Cartesian rationalism is pretty much the
same I mean it's basically in a you know
the Cartesian rationalists tried to for
example ones who worked on language stay
the people in the universal grammar
tradition that didn't quite grew out of
this tried their concept of universal
grammar is basically that witches in our
souls that which is there doesn't change
and so on and they develop by our
standards but by the standards of the
time fairly rich theories of universal
grammar well this tradition then
continues through German Romanticism
them through the Enlightenment it takes
various forms and then it sort of dies
out in the middle of the 19th century
and he really wasn't picked up again
until we would load 20th century with
some scattered exceptions well that's
rash it wasn't what about in under that
interpretation of rationalism this is a
renewal of rationalism however there are
other interpretations of rationalism and
you can you know you can decide what you
want to look for in this tradition and
had a lot of things one of the things
that was in it was an attempt to deduce
all the facts of the world from first
principles I mean Cartesian rationalism
as well you know you start with the
cogito and then you keep going and end
up with all the facts about the world
obviously this isn't rationalism in that
sense so it's a question which out of
this rich complex tradition which
strands do you pick out some strands
that you can pick out carry from Plato
right through classical rationalism into
the Enlightenment and onto the modern
period other ones have been abandoned
which were quite central to them if you
look in contrast at the alternative
major true to say the empiricist
tradition at least the classical
imperial of empiricist tradition say
hume also was an ADA student question
that there was an awful lot of innate
structure just they thought it was a
different inning stretch
so human actually specified what he
thought it was it was principals
Association and similarity and an innate
concept of induction I remember after
all Hume is everybody knows you know
he's remembered for the phase paradoxes
of induction but of course he also gave
an answer his answer was that it's just
animal instinct which is what we would
call in eight so in human psychology
which comes modern psychology in many
ways the principles of Association by
similarity and contiguity and so on and
the principle of simple induction are
the innate structure well that's just
hopelessly inadequate in fact if you
look at the contrast between Descartes
and Hume who were maybe the two leading
figures in these two terminals century
part but to meeting figures in this
tradition actually looked at some of the
same examples and drew opposite
conclusions and crucial examples so for
example Descartes asks the question
rather like play-doh he says suppose you
presented a forget the figure trying
some geometrical figures a triangle to a
giant child in infancy before the
infinite had any experience he says the
child would perceive it as it as a
triangle which of course it isn't
physically it's always going to have
occurred over the line and all be some
distortion of a triangle but the child
will perceive it as a distorted dry
ankle not as a an exact image of what it
is I mean it's some strange and
describable figure if I draw something
in the blackboard it'll never be a
triangle but he says the the child will
perceive it as a tribe not which which
it isn't it's just resembles one and he
will not perceive it as what it is
because that's too complex human looked
at the same example and concluded that
he mentioned it for him it was a
straight line but it's the same question
and he simply concluded reasonably from
his point of view that people have no
concept of a straight line and the
reason is because you can't tell the
difference between a line with a slight
curve in a straight line so there
for by his principles it follows that
you can't have a concept of a straight
line there's a direct difference in
predictions for Descartes you have you
have a concept of geometrical figures
because that's the way our brain is your
mind for him just design therefore a
person will see things in the world as
modifications of geometrical figures
Hume on the other hand given his
principles of innate structure has to
conclude and is honest enough to
conclude that you just don't have a
concept of a straight line well we know
who was right about that in fact even
without the experiments was obvious at
the time that human psychology was
refuted by this fact whereas Cartesian
psychology was if not proven at least
vindicated by it unfortunately history
took the OP the other turn it was
assumed that Hume was right and the car
was wrong it's obviously the opposite
and it really wasn't until the modern
period that this that it's become
obvious to any perceptual psychologist
at least repped of course the guard is
right I mean not that anybody thinks
about they card anymore but if you the
conclusion that is standard today is
that yes obviously the brain of mine the
brain these design so as to identify
certain kinds of figures and not others
and in fact they're simple ones like
lines and angles and so on and that's
how we construct their picture of the
world but basically the Cartesian its
conception with without Cartesian
physiology and metaphysics and nobody
would take seriously humans proposal but
we don't have a concept of the straight
line of course we have a concept of the
straight line everybody does well in
this through this strain of the history
the modern work is rationalist but as I
say there are other ways of looking at
the history you can think other things
in it are important you can think the
proof of the existence of God is
important in that case this obviously is
rational
let's see the resort the question is
very well positive this definition will
be between the inlet eastman the
conception of production yeah also in
the sense of the rationale is looking in
the Cartesian ascending there is another
assume from the from the beginning that
the common sense erection is in general
equality with equal industry modula well
that is a point of view certainly in
this domain is true and you have to go
to really exotic levels of pathology
before you find deficiencies in the
language faculty I for example if you
take something as some soup as severe as
the that that down syndrome mongoloid
better yeah okay which is a pretty
severe disability genetic disability and
the act the achievements of the Chicago
child would give their right but they're
not very great but the language ability
apparently develops normally except some
more slowly it's going to slow down so
they never kept it as any part and in
fact there are cases of children people
with fed actually they're not
intelligent so low that it's
unmeasurable I can't do anything but we
have perfect language capacity so that
doesn't seem to be a significant I mean
there are certainly differences in
people's ability to learn a second
language isn't that sort of thing but
these are minor phenomena for initial
language learning the thing that
everybody does naturally the differences
are you know more significant than the
difference isn't how fast you grew up I
mean children before tuvalu me whether
growth spurts are but they basically
grow the same way and that's true here
and that's essentially what they card
saying of course he's saying it much
more broadly he's saying it for thinking
generally and that seems to be pretty
plausible but when you move away from
areas that are well understood you can
speculate like it's not true that
everybody's you know equally confident
to become a quantum physicist but that's
at the outer fringes of human
intelligence I mean most of the problems
to which human intelligence is it that
that don't as far as I those don't
differ the capacities not differ in any
significant way across a very important
Specter so that picture seems reasonable
at least as a pretty good first
approximation in fact they card himself
pointed out that it's only a first
approximation he says you can find
people who are incapable of doing things
the second question is the relation
making your work on value to a lot of
them computational system and there with
the
negation are also on the conception of
the man as an odometer begin offering
the son of the temple yeah that's its
lead debate in the 17th century has been
started up again in the 20th century
without any free you know any memory of
it the 17th century was in fact from in
part for the same reasons I mean in the
17th century the automata you know like
complicated clocks and things we're
getting to such a degree of complexity
that they people began to wonder are
humans more complex automata and then in
parc des cartes thinking was motivated
by that kind of question and he wanted
to argue for both problem may be partly
for religious reasons but certainly
partly on scientific grounds that it
wasn't true and his if you look at the
carts actual philosophy not what studied
these two what study today is usually
some peripheral part of his philosophy
but for him what was important was the
physics and the physiology and you know
the theory of vision and all this sort
of thing and the other stuff that we
study is kind of around the periphery
where you argue with other philosophers
about it but he argued that in fact most
of the world was a dominant as the
notion was understood and went on all
the way through the animal world or
automata Amanda provisions assume that
the fact i think that the animal is all
about today that's not a question I mean
it became a scandal at the court because
the you know the Cartesian would go
around taking some court ladies favorite
the dog and you know stepping on it
because he can't hurt it I mean they got
proof it just in a comment and that was
one of the court scandals in the period
so yeah this was they thought this was
demonstrated animals were automata and
then there comes a big debate for
hundreds of years about whether animals
are
but they cart argued that moat almost
everything about humans is automata as
well although after sensation I mean
through certainly human physiology but
up to the point where you get to
sensation in fact it wasn't it to it you
get to higher mental processes like
language that he thought he could prove
that it wasn't automata and what it all
tomorrow stations of freedom of will
which he said are inconsistent with the
notion of one-to-one automata it's kind
of fun cause behavior but not random
hayford language was his major example
and the descriptive comments are correct
it's as far as we know so he then
invokes mine second substance race
kobe's nuts to account for this all of
this is no sort of normal science of
sketchy science you really feel anything
in but it's an outline of scientific
reasoning large parts of which remain
quite viable effect so then the
conclusion is well it demands not
automata because of these probably these
phenomena such as ability to choose what
you do and quoting girona some of these
famous statements of the minor cartesian
who developed all of this i mean their
position was that machines are compelled
to act in a certain way but humans are
only incited or inclined to act a
certain way and they may act contrary to
their inclination maybe choose to do so
like you can choose to put your hand in
the fire i would say that you're not
going to do it whereas a note on that it
can't if it's designed in a certain way
it has to do what it's structured to do
well then you know comes Newton who
showed that the world is not an
automaton which not really shocked
people including Hughton and after that
you get a big debate I mean the sort of
reasonable response to that is the idea
that mental phenomena including language
capacity are just some properties of
complex organized matter just as
attraction and repulsion are none of it
fits into Cartesian automatism I mean
Newton's major discovery in many ways
one that disturbed him Rose was the
proof that Cartesian physics won't work
for terrestrial or planetary motion that
the world and the planets and so on are
not on automata as the as the notion was
understood then or for that matter now
it's a it required mystical properties
occult properties as he called them such
as universal gravitation I mean Newton
you know his letters he writes that
anybody has any understanding and
philosophical matters realizes that I
can't you can't influence something
without contacting like I can't raise my
hand and you make that coffee move I
have to contact is that's obvious any
person was with a brain understands that
it just happens before a proof that was
false and he was very disturbed by it
naturally well at this point the men you
know the automaton the mind machine
problem disappears the world isn't a
machine so obviously the mind isn't the
machine because even the rest of the
world and since you have properties like
action to distant and as you go on
through the sciences you just have more
and more exotic properties running
magnetic fields and quantum effects and
curved space-time and so on and so forth
that was a big crisis of fury how are
you going to react to Newton's
demonstration that what was called the
mechanical philosophy you know the
common sense understanding
things work in mechanical ways was just
not true and in fact physicist didn't
really give it up until into this
century there were always attempts to
find some mechanical explanation of
gravity and ether or something rather as
to the the mind this this conception
that was enunciated but by people like
lemon tea for example that the mind is
just the structure of organized matter
it's the right idea but it also lasts I
mean it sort of disappeared until was
picked up again in the 20th century well
in the mid 20th century people were
again excited by automata now it's
computers and the same debate started
over again in different terms of course
but in fact the Cartesian conclusions
are not unreasonable i mean if even if
you take contemporary auto-off computers
instead of complex clocks and so it
seems to me the argument still hold this
there's no way in which complex
computers can manifest properties such
as the ability to choose what's a
ability the distinction beat I'm een
computers are just as much compelled as
old-fashioned clocks were and humans
aren't apparently they're only inside of
your client so that gap remains I'm
promoting wants to look at it but the
gap remains I think please I don't think
that computer the ad the coming of
computers hasn't really changed the
terms of this problem very much in fact
the kinds of things that people try to
get computers to do I the mechanical
aspects of human behavior you know like
to compute them save your play chess
looks like like playing chess can be
reduced to a mechanism and when a
computer plays chess it doesn't do it
the way human does it doesn't work out
strategies and make choices and so on it
simply runs through a mechanical
procedure of trying out tentative moves
it uses its vast
Maury and speed to explore in depth what
would happen if you made this move that
move in the other move and then it
evaluates the outcome by some measure
that the programmer through in and then
it automatically selects a move that's
nothing like what a human does even in a
what is intellectually speaking you know
Trivial Pursuit like chess trivial not i
mean do it easily but it's a very
trivial game you can describe it in ten
sentences you so the problem remains
where it was that's I think too much
bigger problem with others think it is
and i think that the cartesian all over
basis for the cartesian argument
collapsed because the mechanical
philosophy collapsed the conclude the
essential logic still applies and modern
computer don't change the image the
debate that has now come along as
usually pursued in quite different terms
so the debate is over things like
whether a computer could really would
really be understanding language if it
duplicated human performance in response
to language well you know that that's it
I don't even think that's an interesting
question because of course the computer
wouldn't understand language any more
than an airplane can fly like an eagle
understanding language and the rest of
the intentional discourse about thinking
feeling and so on these terms applied to
humans nothing else can do human brain
can't understand language that makes
sense to say the brain understands
language anymore than it makes sense to
say the wings of an eagle fly flying
something the animal does because of the
word meat but on the other hand at the
topic that's debated today but you know
Cyril and the rest of them is actually
has to do with what could turn out to me
mechanical procedure it would be quite
consistent with Cartesian belief if
there was an algorithm that went from
hearing a sentence to giving an
appropriate response because that may
not involve free choice so that asked so
they're really studying what could turn
out to be an automatism without even
touching cartesian argument
those nobody talks about the problem of
the speaker who produces new utterances
fitting to the occasion nobody tries to
duplicate that because we'll be totally
hopeless not even a conceivable task
what they study is the problem of giving
an appropriate response to a certain
input that's an input-output problem
which in theory could make it could be
automatic whereas the problem of action
which has no room for it you don't even
have a formula that was exactly the
carts point so in many ways I don't even
think the discussion about machines and
automata is even reaching to the levels
of sophistication of the 17th century
debate hey just make a confirmation yeah
were working okay ya can't tell you how
many interviews I've had we're after
three hours the interviewer just forgot
realize you hadn't push the button and
have to be worth of the BBC I think this
question is connected we and a concept
that you use in a sense very different
of the common sense that in the nation I
remember our discussion with football
between openly with 100 of our classes
the use of the mode
well got anything I think you use
creativity in a sense very different
from there are formal well I but I made
that very clear I mean there's no
relation I what I said is the these
aspects of choice of appropriate action
I said is creativity in a certain sense
of course it's not creativity with the
aesthetic value that's a different sense
of creativity so these are just
dermatological point actually put the
foot Leah first were discussed this in
any depth as far as i know was a spanish
philosopher in the 16th century pre pre
cartesian one who are they what i said
yeah i don't know how much people
studying but he had very interesting
things to say about said the levels of
intelligent action they had three levels
and the second level of his is what I'm
talking about then he said it's the
third level which is true creativity in
platonic tradition he said that's when
you have a an element of madness that's
the artist but there's also in the
partying system there's a level of
creative action which is just normal
human behavior and that's beyond animals
and this is the what the Cartesian
you're talking about not aesthetic
creativity actually this all of these
ideas enter into aesthetic theory I mean
if you look into the aesthetic theory of
the Romantic period with a very much
influenced by Cartesian philosophy if
you'd like Schlegel coral ridge and
someone the similar ideas are quite you
know consciously they know the source
are consciously developed into an
adapted to poetic creation or musical
creation story how successfully one
could argue but anyway there's an
attempt to develop and the general
concepts on the wall
isn't that the world is one and four to
approach them is also won the sciences
but it all right that's not clear what
it means I mean that in the Natural
Sciences one sort of works by a kind of
a hope that things will become unified
but they never have been I mean up to
the present day there are aspects even
physical theory that are not unified I
mean take gravity no still not unified
with weak force people hope that there
will be a unified theory of nature but
of course when they talk about nature
they're talking about a very special
part of it there's no there's no
rational reason to believe that things
like human thought and action belong to
the kind of nature that physicists are
talking about that's the Cartesian
problem again so sure everyone you know
kind of hopes somehow that there'll be a
more unified way of explaining things
the reason for that hope is just that
your hope for deeper understanding and
if the word the universe turns out to be
divided the separate realms you won't
have understanding of why those realms
different what their relation is so
naturally when hopes that there are no
limits to understanding you know
actually some people might hope there
are limits understanding and I can see
reasons for that too but within science
you kind of act on the working
hypothesis that you can always
understand more and to say that you can
always understand more as to say that
you expect a kind of unity of nature but
every time you link things up like you
link biology and chemistry you
understand little more you understand
things about teeth and biology you can
understand before but whether there are
limits to this process whether the world
is in fact designed so that this there
is a unified account of everything it's
an open question and the fact the idea
that humans might be capable of finding
it even if it's
yes not all of this he says then which
are there any connection between you and
political beliefs and a new concession
of mine well you know their various
kinds of possible connection as the
logical connection of course not I mean
one could have any political beliefs you
need to be beliefs about language it
would be perfectly consistent as for a
sort of accidental historical connection
like my own personal case there's no
connection my political attitudes and
beliefs were for him long before I ever
heard linguistics when I was a young
teenager in fact you know changed since
but growth greatly as for conceptual
connection it could be I mean there
might in fact if you go back to say the
Enlightenment Rickon yeah if you go back
to the Enlightenment period there was
there were attempts to drug the
connections between these fuse so in the
case of the one from humboldt who was
both both a leading linguist and
philosopher and a founder of the modern
classical liberal tradition libertarian
thinker he did try to find connections
he argued that at the heart of his
political conceptions as the desire to
the need and the the human need to
inquire and create free of external
authority that leads to libertarian
thought and he at the heart of his
linguistic conceptions was basically the
Cartesian idea that there's something
about humans that makes them
part of their nature is to be creative
in this second level since that is new
things for him even higher sense of
ascetic creativity so his argument was
well they come from the same source
whatever it is that makes us that makes
us capable of indeterminent human action
appropriate indeterminate human action
also gives us the moral right to be free
of any external Authority that's the
connection and it's not an unreasonable
connection I don't think that people
have tried to Russo has the same picture
at about the same time similar picture
and after I haven't been able to find
there's something like that in can't you
know of course not wasn't interested in
language so it couldn't show up there
but and after that I can't find any
further trations of it but it seems to
me a witch may just be my black of melon
to part of the traditional probably is
but I in that doesn't come back again to
over modern fury and then and I think
you can raise the same speculations it's
not a proof of anything but it's a it's
a conceptual similarity which may imply
an actual link for being on your
conception of the role of the residence
the envelope or the mist hanging off a
boat
you need an access to consciousness
tomorrow consciousness which is the
normal access to because I think there
is a connection between the media's of
information to normal man is a remedy
provided by the right by the location so
what's the connection between your moral
consciousness and your obedience to the
law how is the way how do we get more
appearances tomorrow consciousness don't
nobody have any idea I mean somehow we
get it through a combination of
experience and intuition and you know
thinking about the problems of others
and so on in fact there's a is a
definite broadening of moral
consciousness over the ages the things
that were considered entirely legitimate
you know 200 years ago are considered
Nazi like today for example if some
third-world country today were to
produce something like the US
Constitution which was a revolutionary
document at the time highly libertarian
if say you know some third-world country
today were to produce it we call it a
reversion or not Susan learn after where
you take a look at the US Constitution
and there's a category of people who
were described as three-fifths human
it's like if you're a slave owner you
get an extra three-fifths of a vote for
every slave yeah well that's beyond
discussion today but it was quite at
keeping with the the attitudes at the
time in fact not like slavery but
genocide was considered perfectly
legitimate where I live and the
Massachusetts was you know no Indians
around because the Puritans just carried
on genocide and they considered that not
only moral but they thought it was there
following the Word of God and basically
they were bite I mean they fuel to the
Old Testament which is probably the most
genocide or book in the whole literary
canon and said look we're doing what the
Hebrews did I'm like when we wipe out
the
Pequod's down to the last child you know
disperse them to make sure that they
don't reproduce and so often so that
that was considered highly moral now
genocide was considered highly moral not
just tolerable and it's really you have
to go pretty far to the limits to find
somebody saying that today well go maybe
look all that for but pretty far the and
then the same comes right up to the
present I mean questions about women's
rights for example for not taking any
one year seriously 30 years ago as they
are today that's an expansion world
consciousness questions about animal
rights were unimaginable 20 years ago
but they're taken fairly seriously today
so for example there are now even laws
for treatment of laboratory animals
which were unheard of 20 years ago and
there are many people who think that you
shouldn't even allow that I mean
vegetarianism as an expansion of the
moral consciousness you know what are
the right expansions went to debate but
that the model sphere has been expanded
is burned out undoubtable and that's
doable or that means that we met the
only reasonable interpretation of that
is that over time fixedness is over
historical period so it's not our
personal experience but over historical
experience and accumulated historical
experience and you know lots of struggle
and conflict the month the era we get
kind of access to our moral
consciousness that one didn't have in an
earlier period and there's no reason to
think that that process it is a say it's
not a process of linear marching forward
by any means so if you go back a hundred
years ago somebody like say Andrew
Carnegie the founder of the world's
first billion-dollar corporation
released publicly stated that he
believed that things like wage labor
room in human
he said regarded socialism as the such
an obviously true ideal that if we ever
reach it will have achieved for
millennia well you know his counterpart
wouldn't say that today the idea that
wage slavery is and it was were quite
common on working people that many
people who fought in the Civil War know
sort of ordinary working people but the
thought that they were fighting to
eliminate slavery then became industrial
workers in the growing industrial system
of the post-civil war period it's quite
common at that time to say look we fluff
eliminate slavery we're just being made
slaves again by becoming tools of
production in the new industrial system
in which we have to follow the orders of
the Masters that's what we fought
against in the Civil War well that's I
think I'm here you know made difference
interpretation but mumble in my opinion
that was a level of insight into our
moral nature that's been largely lost
the idea that renting yourself to others
in order to survive as an infringement
on your nature is something that was a
commonly understood a century ago and is
barely in the sphere of culture
awareness today he's we getting your
process on your four different
dimensions I have the impatient that
were absolutely optimist about the
future and the sciences and you are very
pessimistic about evolution of the
social life ah well you know whether
people feel optimistic or not as a
matter of their personality it's for me
much you do the same things when you're
optimistic or pessimistic whether you
think things are going to work it I've
always regarded to this kind of a
Pascal's wager if you don't try to
change things you can be sure they're
going to get worse if you do try to
change things maybe there's some chance
they'll be better maybe a small chance
so given those alternatives there's no
question what you do and how optimistic
or pessimistic yards or something you
see I've been very often I think there
I happen to be rather pessimistic and
often I've been wrong so for example
let's say in the Indochina Vietnam War
when I got started really seriously
active in trying to do something I was
absolutely certain that there could
never be in any war movement I mean it
this was in the early of 1963 1964
they're all you know the US had already
been bombing South Vietnam for a year or
two there were American troops there by
then they're probably about 150,000
people been slaughtered in Vietnam
nobody cared nobody cared that the
American Air Force was going out on
bombing missions every day just blasting
villages and people wouldn't talk about
it you know you couldn't get them
interested couldn't get anybody a sign a
petition I mean it's a it was on a few
people didn't get started trying to do
something was with a sense of total
hopelessness and in fact it was quite a
few years before a substantial adding
were movement developed and in places
like Boston for example which is you
know one of the more maybe the most
liberal city in the United States
certainly one of them we couldn't even
have public demonstrations against the
war until well into 1966 because they
typically mean broken up by violence
with the support of a press radio and
snoring and it certainly didn't seem at
that time it was ever going to be in any
war movement foot in fact I was totally
wrong they're not only was in any war
movement but I you know kind of Cultural
Revolution which has lasting impact or
take it contemporary caltech don't we
mentioned a case that just happened I've
been working I guess around 15 years or
so now I'm the issue of the Indonesian
invasion of East Timor which is you know
the worst act of genocide since the
Holocaust and very significant for us
because the United States gave the
primary diplomatic and about ninety
percent of the military support for it
right through the Carter theory while
Carter was spouting off about human
rights he was increasing the flow of
arms to Indonesia while they were
slaughtering he worries and you
the only reason Europe through more of
it is because they couldn't break the US
monopoly I mean as soon as they were
able to nature every every country in
Europe that I know I was selling arms to
Indonesia and contributing to the
slaughter of routine Maurice because
they can make money on it well you know
you can't imagine less popular topic
than this nobody even heard of it press
refused to report it refuse to report
not didn't but refused in fact it's not
because they know about it they knew but
they didn't want it to be known and so
trying to get people interested in this
topic you know 10,000 miles away I mean
no American troops was did really seemed
hopeless and there were actually only
about half a dozen people working fewer
than full-time there's several with one
person in particular who just dropped
out of graduate school in the Southeast
Asian specialist and has spent his
entire life since the mid seventies
working on this topic working with
churches and people in Congress loss
offending you know and so on others like
me have been writing and speaking well
you know it finally got to the point
that to my I mean I never imagined
there'd be any hope for this but to my
amazement just a couple of months ago
there was the US Congress cancelled a to
Indonesia on these groups nor 38 well
it's a symbolic act because you know
Britain the Holland everybody else Oh be
happy to rush in and provide the
military aid but it's an important
symbolic act for the Indonesian zits a
warning you know they may not get away
with this forever and if something
similar could happen and say France or
hollander you know any other big
military suppliers it would make a big
difference right you know here's a case
where maybe half a dozen people at worst
ultimately succeeded in doing something
which you know could save could save
hundreds of thousands of lives not to
speak of allowing people freedom from
them so you never know do what you can
I was questioned the things that he's a
personal question what would you study
language not history oh I didn't spell
actually I didn't as any of the
linguists around here I'll tell ya I
have no professional qualifications in
the field first why don't know any
languages I mean I have the least
linguistic capacity of any human being I
ever saw which is why I could kill speak
a word of spanish also i never really
split him in Westing's I mean the reason
there's a reason I'm teaching at MIT
which is a science and engineering
university when I got my PhD I didn't
have any qualifications in linguistic
not known university with a you know
decent self respect for the fire demon
twisted and in fact I hadn't I didn't
really have any intention of staying in
the academic world I landed at MIT
because the scientific university
they're willing to play around with
strange ideas he headed the head of
electronics lab happened to be intrigued
so I went to an electronics lab where I
still am actually I mean I don't know
what tape recorder from a telephone you
know but I've been an electronics lab
for almost 40 years ago because and in
fact linguistics developed out of that
but my own background was extremely
exotic it was a little bit of this a
little bit of that mostly self-taught
him so it's not a model for anything I
me up to today you know my students like
he was a student even 10 times as much
about linguistics as I did and my
students always do something of
literature I never heard of all sorts of
please
thank you for your muscles oh I was very
glad you could kill her right there
thank you
don't pin Scotty amino acids enter this
is possible droid that the nickel just
not a little photos progress only oh yes
yes oh my god of you notice us I want
them to know me what you think is really
sure where I'm us really trivial one
yeah sure
okay yeah okay let me hold it so it
doesn't rank you be the first question
it would be what led you to devote your
life or parts of your life to
linguistics mostly accident like most
things that happen in life actually I
had more or less dropped out of college
by the time I was about 17 it was
terribly boring didn't want to go on I
was interested mostly in politics and I
happened through political connections
to meet someone who was a acting rather
important sort of left the Victorian
thinker and and he happened to be the
professor of linguistics University of
Pennsylvania where I was nominally a
student like sort of i got friend like
him and go through one thing led to
another I started taking courses I just
sort of got interested but you know like
accident basically Haven is it
increasingly what are the distinctive
features of the Chum skin way of doing
mystics or what would you like non
linguistic mystics as you understand
well you know you study what you can
hope to understand there are things you
might like to understand that you can't
really study so one of the most obvious
fact about language the fact it's
immediately obvious to us if we look at
it is that and as people have noticed
through the ages is that somehow people
can continually say new things but they
never heard before maybe it have never
been said before they do it effortless
effortlessly they do it in ways that are
appropriate in the situations where they
are other people here them understand
them immediately and human interaction
continues that way so there are a lot of
questions that can be asked about that i
wouldnt question you can ask about it is
what are the mechanisms that make it
possible and a further question you can
ask is how do we achieve this how do we
gain those mechanisms how do they
develop in
and with regard to the mechanisms
there's two choices one is sort of the
technical mechanisms what are today
called the computational mechanism and
the other is the question of how we use
these computational mechanisms to speak
appropriately and in novel ways and so
on and so forth only some of those
questions have been subject to serious
inquiry the question of what the
computational mechanisms is a lot
understood about that and it's a given a
tremendous amount of insight into some
of the aspect it's one of the few areas
of higher human mental function where
there's some real understanding of how
the thing works as to the second
question how do these mechanisms develop
which is much more interesting word
still there there are also with pretty
good answers by now and they seem to be
demonstrating more and more that it
isn't learned it's just there as part of
human nature as to the third question of
how we put these mechanisms to use in
human interchange how we do what you are
doing though let's say there's I'm
essentially nothing and we don't even
how to study so the roughly roughly
speaking I think this the letter
delimits the there are other questions
that one could ask for example how are
these mechanisms realized and brain
that's a problem that could maybe we'll
come to be understood someday right now
it's not there are questions about how
this these capacities developing species
nothing is known about that and maybe
nothing ever will it's not even clear
how to study sure
okay now you willfully compare and
you're working with sticks to physics or
the chemistry I would ask you how is
linguistics related to science well this
is these aspects of linguistics are just
part of science and by comparing the
chemistry and physics I don't mean to
suggest that they either that they've
achieved that level of sophistication or
that there are direct connections just
that it's a methodological point we
should study these questions the way we
study the rest of the natural world and
physics chemistry and biology show how
you should study the natural world and
in my opinion when should study these
questions the same way whether all of
the study if there are many parts of the
study in language don't fall under the
sciences in any sense at all I mean a
part of cultural anthropology or some
other field as to these questions that
are always lurking on the horizon and
that we can't seem to approach like the
questions of language use it's not clear
whether they can be studied by the
methods of science which is after all
human science special human capacity
maybe some other intelligence organized
in a different way from errors could
study these problems I had another
question related to this
as you do relate linguistics to science
retrying to make it well the relation is
really just inclusion part of sentence
okay why don't scientific journals
include articles on linguistics well
depends what do you mean by scientific
journals I mean yeah yeah if if you
means a nature the reason is that the
kind of there's also you know there are
lots and lots of kinds of work that are
never included in those journals they
they usually run short articles
reporting experimental results and so on
and so forth that's not the nature of
this field there are many scientific
fields that don't publish in those
journals because it's not the nature of
the field also there are other reasons I
mean it's more or less you know the the
chances that the contemporary results in
physics or biology will impinge on the
work of linguists is very small and
conversely i mean if some new discovery
linguistics there's nothing much the
chemists can do with it so it doesn't
make much sense to use the same organs
publication nowhere in the night
question is non generative linguists and
non linguists very often criticized
generative and transformational grammar
because it changes so rapidly now could
you explain the reasons for these
changes and do you think non journalists
are aware of the reasons and the changes
well this is an indication of the sharp
break between the sciences and the
humanities all the science has changed
rapidly and every time you read a new
issue of Physical Review physical you
read the letters column it has you know
indications of changes that are
happening any field that's alive is
changing this field is a young field so
it's barely beginning to find its way
around I should stop changing they would
I would advise everybody to drop out of
the field any field that stops changing
it probably wasn't we're studying in the
first place now in the humanities this
is not understood they it's regarded as
important to keep saying the same thing
on your life that you said when you were
in graduate school but in the science
that such a joke I'm if you're teaching
the same thing you thought when you were
in graduate school you wasting your time
you're in the wrong field so and the
reason why things changes you learn more
yeah you learn new things I mean the
phenomena come along that were noticed
before people have new ideas as to how
to improve the theory they they think of
reasons why the theories that had been
proposed in works modify them that's
scientific inquiry the changes take
place well I mean the early work in
generative grammar I mean they tried it
had two different goals which were in
conflict one goal was to try to describe
the facts of each language accurately
and in order to do that it apparently
had the right extremely complex systems
of rules because the phenomena of
language seemed very intricate and
varied and you know every language looks
different from every other one and every
part of each language looks different
from other parts and so on this wasn't
really understood in traditional grammar
but that's because it never got to the
stage of writing
they didn't not not enough sent in the
sense in which that's now understood
they only gave hints that could be used
by a person already new language to make
its own moves but when you tried to
spell out what it is that people
actually know it turned into
extraordinarily intricate rule systems
well the second question that the
question trying to explain how people
get this into their how they acquire
this knowledge that that the answer to
that question must be that most of it is
already there because it's impossible to
have enough experience to even pick up a
tiny fraction of these rules so it can't
be that the languages are as complex and
different different as they appear to be
and the effort to answer the question of
acquisition of language of the growth of
language in the mind had to lead you to
the belief that there's basically
there's very few options available there
are very few possibilities for language
and the child must settle on those
choices with very little evidence
because we know that that's all that
happened there is that's leading in
another direction try to claim that
things are very simple now that
resolving that tension over the years
has led to lots and lots of changes to
the point where today we're beginning to
understand how fixed principles that
don't change at all can yield a wide
variety of the phenomena of language
just by interacting slightly different
ways so it's as if you have a very
complex system and you change little
pieces of it here and there you may get
and it may do something quite different
you change the way the wires are hooked
up in a few places the system they
behave quite differently radically
different and the task is to try to find
that initial wiring that and the points
at which the changes can be made and
then to demonstrate that the apparent
complexity and variety of language is
just an illusion due to our the
in a militarily previous failure to
understand the simplicity of the
underlying structure and the ways in
which the few changes can be made and
there's been a lot of progress i'm at
every single one of those practices is
changing steps as a change in theory
sometimes a radical feet another
question is that people usually it is a
popular belief that the existence of
languages essentially for communication
I would see if you agree with that hard
to endure I don't agree or disagree I
don't know what it means biological
systems aren't for anything they're just
there I mean if a child grows an image
at the embryo before birth child grows
arms and legs it's not doing it because
it wants to walk in fact even if we look
at the evolutionary process it's
extremely hard to say what functions
things were for so the the wing of an
insect let's say developed as a device
for distributing heat from the insect's
body turned out you could distribute
heat better if you had a little thing
sticking out it turned into a wing a
human certainly use language is language
to communicate they use it for a million
other purposes they use it to tell jokes
they use it to establish friendly
relations with people when they don't
care about communication they they use
it just to express their thoughts you
know there are all kinds of reasons for
using language and who knows what what
doesn't make any sense to ask what the
purpose is biological systems don't come
along with a purpose or they just grow
develop for some reason now you just
think if the aim of your theory is to
study knowledge
you know I would like to be able to stay
use it just doesn't seem to be within
the realm of study well if it nobody
nobody knows how I mean a lot of
interesting things you say about
language juice but that you know a lot
of interesting things you can say about
history or you know social structure or
something lots of interesting things but
nothing in the level there's no
theoretical understanding in fact in
general most of the questions of real
human significance are out of the range
of scientific understand at least for
now maybe forever well I just mean well
you know I'm when doesn't have to use it
if they want it doesn't matter but the
point is we have acquired a certain
cognitive capacity certain mental
capacity that's what people call moment
we know I think a good deal of what is
called knowledge is just the change of
parts of the brain to particular states
in which information is stored so you
know knowledge of how to get from here
to girona is probably stored somewhere
in your brain knowledge of what
sentences mean is stored somewhere in
your brain everyone agrees that you know
children or adults know that set and
so-and-so means such and such and I want
to know how that knowledge is stored we
all seems to be stored in a generative
grammar and then you want to find out
what that is so to emphasize knowledge
of language is sound interested with
topic I even if one is not interested in
why this sentence means such and such
the next word means so-and-so study
something else
does James of grandmas and have anything
to do with applied linguistics yeah well
that's for people who you'd make the
applications to decide I mean it's you
know forth and throughout most of modern
history the sciences haven't been useful
for anything it wasn't really until the
19th century that it became important
for an engineer to know something about
physics because physics just didn't tell
them very much they knew the craftsmen
crafts- more about how to do things than
the Sun indistinct and its really only
better you know last 150 years maybe
that you could find ways of using even
the advanced sciences for applications
it feels like that and there's no you
know the theoreticians have nothing to
say about this topic you know if if
people who are applied who are studying
say real-world topics like problems of
national language let's say or a second
language teaching and so on if such
people find these ideas a value and use
the news them actually they often they
usually do but that's a matter of trial
and error there's nothing that's nothing
principled about it I mean the problems
have applied anything are usually so
complex and involve so many factors that
you don't know how much theoretical
understanding would contribute even had
it since
context the calculus will be what hunt
does the notion of dialect into your
theory is it relevant to distinguish
between managers it's not it doesn't
have anything to do with this theory I
made the decision about dialects and
languages is it a decision it's like a
dissident group of people in a room and
you tried to decide which worms look
alike you could do that a lot of
different from anything that you know
there there might be you might agree
that they in lining them up so that this
one looks much like this one and that
one looks mostly like this one and you
get to the end and someone at least look
at least like that one but if you
started to try to draw a boundary among
the look-alikes you could do it a lot of
different ways dialects or languages
that look more or less alike languages
or groupings of individual language that
look less alike than dialects but more
alike for what we call different
languages I me to take the whole romance
area say you know spanish catalan
portuguese on and in a sense they're all
the same language with just the
differences in fact what's called
Chinese is a bunch of languages which
aren't even mutually comprehensible it's
Stefan structural properties in common
these are very meaningful questions
actually I'm they're very meaningful for
human life budget they're not
scientifically meaningful like who looks
a like might be important for human life
to it's just there's never going to be a
science about it's mostly a matter of
decision
question can the knowledge of two
languages as in bilingual children which
is something that we have we're very
open here required two languages in
parallel entirely that we explained with
a model of knowledge of language well if
it can first of all I mean again that's
a work whether a person is viola is
multilingual or not as more a matter of
decision than of fact in fact every
child who grows up has many different
languages stored in their head I'm
because you hear people speak
differently in the your parents speak
differently from your teacher would
speak differently from children the
streets you go to the other side of town
and they speak still differently there
those differences are usually so small
that we don't call from differences but
they're there and if you look closely
you find that if you travel one or two
blocks away find people talk differently
from you do I mean my brother and I for
example don't talk the same way because
we had slightly different influences in
our life and but I have no problem with
understanding him which means I must
have at least those two systems in the
head and in fact dozens or thousands who
knows how many we call it
multilingualism when the systems that
you have in your head are far enough
apart so that we're struck by the
differences we have to make some effort
to move up and back between them if
there's in many you know at least
certainly in pre-modern societies it was
absolutely standard for people to know
many such languages say go to West
Africa today and a child may grow up
knowing half a dozen different languages
which are really mutually unintelligible
because that's the way the society
sausage is very mixed and so children
pick up a whole bunch of different
languages in most modern societies
differences among people have been
leveled either by force and conquest or
by you know expansion of a national
culture and by these days even by state
television you know so that you get an
illusion of homogeneity of language
which wasn't true at an earlier period
I'm need in Europe you don't have to go
back
farby when you go back to the beginning
of the century let's say and people
couldn't understand someone from the
next village because they were talking
some it's probably still true in places
like Italy your place I don't know if it
isn't Spain but you get that kind of
realistic the person you get that kind
of realistic diversity in Spain that you
hadn't say in Italy of real mutual
unintelligibly have none yes but in lard
but in face of France let's say you
would at the beginning of this century
you could find people in nearby villages
who are speaking with referral practical
purposes different languages now all of
that stuff has been leveled largely
level deafness or feel at least in this
generation that's mostly leveled in
Europe although still you know a person
from the North Germany and from South
Germany made a very hard time
understanding each other if there's ever
going to be any understand any
comprehension of how multum you know the
assimilation of many languages develops
in the brain it will doubtless be
through some further application of the
understanding of how a single language
might what we'll need to know is in
addition to the question how single
language develops we'll have to know how
interactions are constructed between
these single languages and developed so
that's just a further complication of
the problem of acquisition of a single
language with other factors through
teaching in elementary high school so
that if their obvious things to go over
ready to language like blood arrived and
weight and maybe fine language that one
of six pack at the same way that
interesting that people know things
about the world of physics biology that
very things upon language should also be
talking that yeah yeah yeah I mean you
know after all language is a very
important fact about our lives what
about our nature and if it's important
to understand something about how birds
behave or how rocks behave or how
planets behave it ought to be important
to understand how humans behave and this
is one of the few areas where we have at
least some insight into what are
distinctively human capacity or in any
such cases so for that that's men are
studying about what's understood about
language different from them studying
language itself definition that I would
ask you to make things clear for some
people the definition grammar doesn't
meet you I mean prescriptive grammar is
just a formal Authority it's like
etiquette you know you tell people that
they should put their fork on the left
they should wear a tie when they give a
talk or something like that I mean it's
basically nothing it's a matter of how
to know theoretical interest again it
may have human interest like maybe you
want to try it maybe you should even
teach it I mean maybe it's worth
teaching children some kind of usually
artificial literary standard for
whatever reasons I'm practical reason
but there's nothing of any theoretical
interest to say about it any more than
there is about styles of dress time you
probably want to teach children styles
of dress too
belief is that when someone knows a
language they know the norms of the
language well that's what people tend to
think yeah because people well I mean
but they should understand they should
understand that every person has a
perfect knowledge of their own language
by definition now whether you decide to
follow norms that someone in authority
tells you to follow our up to you to
decide but this there's no abstract
right or wrong about it's a matter of
whether you want to choose to defer to
authority sometimes it's worth deferring
to authority like it makes more sense to
drive on the right and on the left
because you'll survive that's deferring
to authority and sometimes it may be
useful to follow some rule that some
somebody made up for some arbitrary
reason that's followed in the formal and
then the you know literary canon okay
maybe it is maybe it isn't but it's
basically a quest it's the same kind of
question it's a question of whether to
accept usually artificial norms that
have been designed for whatever purpose
they have no status other than the
status that people agree to give to them
there's nothing right or wrong about
driving on the right okay just you know
there's a law that says drive on the
right and life is better in that case of
everybody follows the law so you follow
in other cases like norms of grammar
it's almost totally arbitrary it's like
what you should wear a tie yeah you can
decide to do it because it's easier to
get by in the world or whatever but
there's nothing of any significance of
added
