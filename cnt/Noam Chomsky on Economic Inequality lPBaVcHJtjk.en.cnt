as far as inequality is concerned it's
been growing quite rapidly worldwide
every year Oxfam leading development
agency publishes a detailed extensive
report of the state of poverty and
inequality in the world in the year 2014
they found that about 90 individuals
that literally had half of total world
wealth which is an extraordinary degree
of inequality in the year 2015 their
latest publication which just appeared
it's the number has been reduced from 90
to 60 to 62 individuals hold half the
world's wealth and there are many very
ugly consequences to this to take one
example from the Oxfam report they point
out that 5 million children are dying of
starvation every year that means about
500 or so while we're meeting 500
children starving while we're talking
and they could very easily be saved the
resources are certainly there to save
them what policy is designed so that it
goes to enriching the super rich and the
powerful not to saving millions of
children from starvation the there is an
organization of the rich developed
countries the OECD the 31 countries
among the OECD countries the US is at
the extreme in both inequality and
poverty just quote from the latest OED
report on this it says the share of top
incomes in the past year increased
especially in english-speaking countries
in the United States far more than
others and by top incomes they mean the
top one percent
a fraction of 1% that's where there's
been an explosion of inequality huge
explosion primarily in the United States
also to some extent in other
english-speaking countries and poverty
remains at extraordinary levels but with
regard to poverty and inequality by most
measures in the OECD studies the United
States ranks with the poorest of the 31
countries it ranks alongside of Mexico
and Turkey poverty rates and inequality
in the United States are much greater
than poor or quite poor European
countries like Portugal and this has
been consistent over 50 years the same
is true of measures of social social
justice that's measures that include
things like infant mortality hunger and
so on of the 31 OSE D countries the
United States ranks 27th right down to
the bottom right along with Greece only
slightly above Mexico Chile and Turkey
that there is an Associated and quite
striking fact which you perhaps have
read about in the newspapers it's
recently been discovered that among the
sector of the American population less
educated whites mainly white males that
means with on a high school education
among this large sector of the American
population a life expectancy is actually
declining that's something that is
unheard of in rich societies life
expectancy continually Rises the United
States is not particularly high in life
expectancy as that's for the that life
expectancy should reduce among a major
sector of the population less educated
white males that's unheard of these are
surely consequence all of this is surely
a consequence
of the neoliberal policies of the past
generation deregulation marketization
decline of public institutions and so on
it has led to general in the United
States and similar things or even worse
elsewhere it's led to a stack pretty
much stagnation for much in fact the
majority of the population awesome ones
decline real wages actual wages
evaluated relative to inflation real
wages for male workers are now at the
level of about the late 1960s there's
been considerable growth but it's gone
into very few pockets the last couple of
years almost all the growths has gone
into tiny percentage of the wealth
wealthy population the said that there
is in fact now this radical
concentration of wealth and not in parts
of the population that are really
productive much of it is in financial
institutions which have a dubious and
maybe a harmful effect on the economy
and this is understood by the major
powerful institution so for example a
couple of years ago
Citigroup why the major financial
institutions published a report for its
and for the for the investors the
investors and the Citigroup deals with
and it urged them to direct their
investments to what they call the
plutonomy index bhutanam e means the
sector of the population the wealthier
sector of the population they said that
worldwide incidentally so the plutonomy
is a worldwide class system of very
wealthy people the and it says the
mostly in the united states but also
some elsewhere some China some in Saudi
Arabia and so on primarily in the United
States that that's where the real good
investment opportunities are you can
kind of disregard the rest there is not
important and infected so the common too
just to divide the world's population
into a putana me which is the upper
sector of wealth and power and the what
something is called the precariat the
people who live precarious lives without
security without benefits in many
countries of including rich countries in
Europe there's the unemployment among
youth is extraordinarily high that
people are living at home into the 40's
again
stark family is getting a job and so
that's the precariat part on jobs no no
just same in the United States at take
colleges and universities which
increasingly are hiring temporary
workers adjuncts graduate students
people of no protection can be dismissed
easily a paid very little that's the
precariat so the world is kind of
dividing into a plutonomy and a
precariat done as many have pointed out
by now the super-rich really inhabit a a
different world a world that barely has
contact with the general population
except to extract resources from them
well there's much debate about the
causes for all of this turns out to be
many complexities but there's ample
evidence that it doesn't have to do with
any economic laws but to largely with
the policy decisions but not economic
necessity and if you look at the policy
decisions keeping to the United States
now we should recognize that the United
States is different from other societies
in many ways one way is that it's by far
the richest Society in the world with
incomparable advantages that's been true
since its founding in fact throughout
its history of the United States
Disney has been the richest or close to
the richest country in the world
by the late 19th century of the US
economy was greater than that of the
other advanced societies come
twentieth century just accelerated this
I'll come back to it suppose but though
the United that's one respect in which
the and of course the United States has
enormous advantages huge territory
relatively unpopulated once the
indigenous population was eliminated or
destroyed enormous internal resources
extraordinary security and so on but
also to an unusual extent the United
States is a business run society that's
partly the result of the fact that it
didn't grow out of existing feudal
institutions it became to a high extent
run by the business world and that's
revealed in many ways so takes a voting
much on everybody's mind right now
oh the United States has a pretty high
abstention level people who don't vote
and that's been investigated with
interesting results well one of the
leading scholars who studies
contemporary electoral politics Walter
Dean Burnham for distinguished scholar
about some years ago did a study careful
study of the socio economics profile of
non voters in the United States and what
he discovered is that their
socio-economic profile matches those in
Europe similar societies those in Europe
who vote for a labor based or social
democratic parties the sector of the
population in the United States just
doesn't vote because nothing represents
them there are no such parties just
recently Dean Burnham's in scholar and
Thomas Harrisonville
were prominent political scientists did
a careful very careful study of voting
in the most recent election 2014 did a
careful county-by-county study of just
what floating was like and they came out
with a pretty spectacular conclusion it
turned out that voting in that election
was approximately the same as
in the 1820s when the vote was
restricted to property Dwight Mills 2014
about the same level of voting which
tells you quite a lot about
participation in what's called a
democratic society and these results are
amplified when we look at how people are
represented by their own representatives
there's a way of studying that it's
major topic and academic political
science you study the policies that the
representatives vote for that's public
and you study the attitudes of the
people who they represent their
preferences we know a great deal about
that from extensive and quite reliable
and consistent polls and it turns out
that for about 70% of the populations
the lower 70% on the income wealth scale
they're basically disenfranchised their
own representatives vote in ways
dissociated unrelated to their
preferences as you move up the income
wealth scale you get a little more
influence on representatives and at the
very top which means really a fraction
of 1% policies are essentially made
that's very good work on that by Mark
Collins Larry Bartel other mainstream
political scientists there's a recent
study by gillum's and Benjamin page
well-known political scientist published
Princeton University in which they
investigated a couple hundred major
decisions that were made and they
compete by the political system and they
compared the decisions with popular
attitudes here's their conclusion quoted
economic elites in tiny fraction of
economic power economic elites and
organized groups representing business
interests have substantial independent
impacts on US government policy while
average citizens and mess based entry
groups have little or no independent
influence the results provide
substantial support for theories of
economic elite domination and for
theories of biased pluralism but not for
theories of majoritarian electoral
democracy or majoritarian pluralism to
decode to the political science rhetoric
what it means as in simple words the
United States is a to Tok recei with
some formal Democratic elements that are
increasingly at the margins and the
public is aware of that they may not
read people don't have to read the
political science journals to see it in
their lives we see it in much of what's
happening now there have been posed
about taxes for decades regular polls
basically two questions people are asked
or your taxes too high and people say
yeah I'd like to pay less taxes our
taxes on the rich too low sure the rich
oughta pay much higher taxes that's
consistent and it's very interesting in
a few studies which showed that when
these polls are reported it's typically
the first question that's reported taxes
are to buy not the second question which
says taxes are too low on the wealthy
when you go back to the 1950s the
Eisenhower period Texas and the wealthy
were far higher the top rate was 90% in
fact it's being cut back regularly over
the years in direct opposition to the
popular will oh so by now in fact the
poor probably pay a larger percentage of
their income than the rich in taxes when
you consider the whole array of largely
regressive taxes state local sub
security and so on that's these are all
the effects of policy decisions in
recent years which have led to the
extreme inequality and the maintenance
of
high levels of poverty ever since the
end of the Second World War
picking up in the 1970s with the
neoliberal programs the net effect of it
is what we see today policies of
deregulation which have led to regular
crises concentration of wealth and
financial institutions Bill Clinton's
program of destroying the welfare system
ending welfare as we know it at a roof
seriously harmful effect on the people
who need welfare especially women with
dependent children right now there are 3
million children in the United States
who are living on less than $2 a day
lots of unskilled labor which helps
because there's a work requirement which
drives down wages as much else is a kind
of a vicious cycle of the increase the
concentration of wealth leads to
concentration of political power leads
to policy choices that increase the
concentration of wealth and maintain
poverty
