you to war geopolitics history conflict
in the Middle East a public talk with
Robert Fisk introduced by Noam Chomsky
this is the third leg of a conference
organized by the armenian revolutionary
federation which actually began in new
york city at new york society for
ethical culture and later on a CUNY
Graduate Center this conference is meant
to generate a new critical discussion
from a leftist perspective which ties
traditional issues for Armenians like
recognition of the Armenian Genocide to
a broader context that includes
imperialism u.s. militarism women's
rights and many other critical topics to
our predicament and to see how they
actually influence the Armenian
predicament I'm now gonna introduce

professor Chomsky
a couple of weeks ago I had one of many
interviews and this one happened to be
on New Zealand radio and it was about
the hottest topic of the day namely the
Middle East and the interviewer
mentioned that he'd just run a marvelous
highly informative interview with Robert
Fisk and he asked where Fisk's regular
columns of reports were published in the
United States and I had to say
regretfully that I didn't know of single
one within the mainstream and quite
properly he didn't believe me and so I
suggested that he do it enters an
internet search and you might try it
that will be highly instructive he was
right to be amazed for two basic reasons
the first one is that for the past about
30 years Fisk has been the most
respected journalist reporting from the
Middle East with incomparable depth and
understanding and also extraordinary
courage that's one reason the second
reason is that the Middle East is indeed
the hottest topic in the world it's the
primary area of concern for the American
public and journalism over a long period
but particularly yeah quite recent again
now so the Gallup poll just released its
review for 2006 the Middle East is the
prime concern for the public are the
most important problem when they ask
what's the most important problem facing
the United States by far the first
January to March is the war in Iraq more
than twice as high as the next topic
that concerns the public which is the
economy and the most serious threat
perceived is Iran
that doesn't really mean that the public
is concerned about it ran it means that
the media and journals and so on tell
them that the greatest threat is Iran
there's a strong correlation between
most unpopular country and whose
receives most defamation and the
doctrinal system the the most foreign
coverage over the years by a long shot
is Israel and matters related to Israel
and might add that the region also
provides the topic of least concern to
Americans that is among topics that are
covered at all at least a judge by the
printed word and that is the fate of the
Palestinians plenty of coverage but just
contempt and disdain for their rights
dramatically so right now well
conclusion from these observations is
that the that Americans are protected
carefully protected from the most
respected and valuable voices on the
topics of their primary concerns which
is something that might merit some
concern on airport it's there aren't the
only comparable example that I can think
of is the complete exclusion from the
media and journals of Dennis Halliday
and hunts von sponeck
and you can try an internet search now
these are the two distinguished UN
diplomats who ran the was called the
oil-for-food program they had hundreds
of staff reporting from all over Iraq
regularly they surely knew in more in
close detail about Iraq than the CIA or
the Pentagon which admittedly isn't
saying very much
but perhaps more than almost any
Westerner Halliday resigned in 1998
charging the policies and the called UN
policies they're actually US UK policies
he criticized them as genocidal and
didn't want to take part in them anymore
he's replaced by von sponeck who
resigned two years later with very
similar charges von sponeck also added
that the United States even blocked his
reports to the Security Council but
we're lucky the information system in
the United States protected the US
population from understanding the
reality of Iraq and their own massive
crimes from the best public sources they
could obtain counterpart to protecting
them from the most important journalism
well you'll soon be able to learn about
funds fonox about his detailed
revelations very detailed in a book that
is finally supposed to come out in
English it's been out in several other
languages and right now you can discover
what you've missed in Robert Fisk's
reporting over the years and his
monumental book great war for
civilization which just appears it
records his remarkable career and also
goes back into plenty of historical
background historical roots including
world war ii and particularly the
Armenian Genocide and the ways in which
it's been barred from history actually
it's not really a book for reading it's
too rich and dense for that and much of
it is too painful and horrifying be able
to tolerate for a long stretch it's
really a book to immerse yourself in
repeatedly letting it's awful lessons
sink in now I don't want to take away
from the opportunity to hear
Fiske II as he's called by colleagues so
I learned from the book so that so let
me just mention three of the rich store
of searing episodes that Eva vyd Li
portrays in the book the merest sample
and very relevant to this moment though
they're from the past the first incident
that I want to mention is the case of
the USS stark and it's a US missile
frigate it was part of the u.s. fleet
which was providing a vital support it
turned out to be decisive support for
Saddam's murderous aggression against
Iran which killed nobody knows how many
hundreds of thousands of people or more
in May 1987 the stark patrolling and the
Gulf on behalf of the Iraq was hit by
two Exocet missiles that killed 37
crewmen it was known instantly that the
attackers were the Iraqi Air Force and
Iraqi jet but and President Reagan in
fact did make an impassioned statement
about it namely that Iran is the villain
of the piece well that ended that story
Saddam Hussein was absolved with apology
for regrettable incident and the example
is which is discussed in detail in the
book is a quite revealing the only other
country that's permitted to get away
with something like that is Israel in
1967 the attack on the US Liberty
actually under more ambiguous
circumstances than the attack on the
stark and it was also the subject of
many bitter denunciations from the
highest quarters of the government and
the military and of course the Liberty
crew who are still publishing a journal
about it all to scandalously little
effect however in the case of the USS
start and not even that
place just go on it's full of the grant
that whole episode does reveal something
important it reveals the unusual and
fact quite extraordinary love for Saddam
Hussein on the part of the president
administration and its immediate mentors
these are facts that are highly relevant
today and they would be on front pages
regularly in anything that pretended to
be a free press along with a great deal
more like them well second incident I'd
like to mention also of current
relevance is a year later the shooting
down of Iran air 655 by the u.s. super
high-tech worship Vincennes in the Gulf
actually in Iranian waters killing 290
people commercial airliner the the
captain of the nearby US naval vessel
David Carlson was so horrified by this
he observed at all that he denounced it
in the official Navy department journal
the Institute of Institute of naval
Affairs or whatever it's called the main
II instead the Naval Institute Journal
he denounced that he wrote there that in
his words he wondered aloud in disbelief
as he observed the downing of what was
obviously a civilian air liner taking
off from an Iranian base in a commercial
corridor perhaps he thinks out of a need
to prove the viability of Aegis it's
high-tech missile system this fence end
was called Robo Cruiser by the other
naval vessels because of its extreme
aggressiveness and violence the same
journal Naval Institute have published
an acid review of the neighbored Navy
Department cover-up of this the review
was by a write retired Marine Corps
colonel and military historian David
Evans in it he quotes a high military
officer who was attending the official
hearings the whitewash and he concluded
that our navy is today
to deploy well that was taken care of by
President Bush number one who said I
will never apologize for the United
States of America I don't care what the
facts are here that one turned out he
was not the only one who didn't care
what the facts are I learned from the
book that Fisk's very dramatic report
from the scene was too much for his
newspaper to handle the London Times for
the first time he reports they Eve
iterated his account they cut out the
details that incriminated Washington and
they even sank the level of adding a
ridiculous Thatcher Bush propaganda
charge about how the plane might have
been on a suicide mission fists reacted
by resigning after many years with the
times and since then it's his reports
from the London independent from which
Americans have to be protected and have
been effectively well both of these
events are highly relevant to what's
going on right now the crisis over Iran
for those who hold the club's typically
history is bunk it's old-fashioned
boring antiquated put it aside as we
move on to a glorious future the victims
don't have that luxury so Iranians
remember that the US has been torturing
them without a stop for over half a
century without a break the support
