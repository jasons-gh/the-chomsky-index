I started by saying that one of the
relations between capitalism democracy
is contradiction you can't have
capitalist democracy and the people who
really sort of believe in markets or at
least pretend to understand that so if
you read Milton Friedman the other
apostles of so-called libertarianism
they don't go for democracy they call
for what they call freedom was a very
very restrictive concept of freedom it's
not the freedom of a working person to
control their work with their lives and
so on it's their freedom to submit
themselves to control by a higher
authority
that's called freedom but not democracy
they don't like democracy and they're
right capitalism and democracy really
are inconsistent actually what's called
libertarianism in the United States is
about as extremely extreme an example of
anti libertarianism that you can imagine
they're in favor of private tyranny the
worst kind of tyranny tyranny by
unaccountable private concentrations of
wealth when they say well we don't want
government interference in the market
they mean that they mean maybe they
don't understand that but if you think
it through it's pretty obvious the kind
of interference in the market they want
to block it's the kind that would permit
unconstrained tyranny on the part of
totally unaccountable private tyrannies
which is what corporations are it's
worth bearing in mind how radically
opposed this is to classical liberalism
they like to invoke say Adam Smith but
if you read Adam Smith
said the opposite he's famous for not
you know the claim is that he was
opposed to regulation government
regulation interference of markets not
true he was in favor of regulation as he
put it when it benefits the working man
he was against interference when it
benefited the masters that's traditional
classical liberalism this what's called
libertarian in the United States which
likes to invoke the the history that
they've concocted is radically opposed
to basic class of libertarian principles
and it's kind of astonishing to me that
a lot of young people say college
students are attracted by this kind of
thing I mean you can after all read the
classical texts this would take say Adam
Smith Adam Smith at the time he's the
icon you know Liberty he's he was
considered to be a dangerous radical at
the time because he was pretty any
capitalist it's pre sort of
pre-capitalist era but he was opposed to
it he condemned what he called the vile
Maxim of the masters of mankind
all for ourselves and nothing for anyone
else it's an abomination but take the
phrase invisible hand everybody's
learned that in high school at college
Adam Smith actually did use the term
rarely but take a look at how he used it
in Wealth of Nations his major work it's
used once if you look at the context
it's an argument again against what is
now called neoliberal globalization and
what he argued is this he was concerned
with England of course he said suppose
in England that the merchants and
manufacturers invested abroad and
imported from abroad he said well that
would be profitable for them about what
he harmful to the people of England
however they will have enough of a
commitment to the wrong country to
England which is called a home bias in
the literature that have enough of a
home bias so that as if by an invisible
hand
they'll keep to the less profitable
actions and England will be saved from
the ravages of what we call neoliberal
globalization that's the one use of the
term in Wealth of Nations in his other
major work Moral Sentiments terms also
used once and the context is this it's a
member England's basically an
agricultural country and he says suppose
some landlord that accumulates an
enormous amount of land and everybody
else has to work for him he says well
that won't turn out too badly and the
reason is that the landlord will be
motivated by his natural sympathy for
other people so he will make sure that
the necessities of life and the goods
available will be distributed equitably
to the to his the people on his lands
and it'll end up with an equal of
relatively equal and just the
distribution of wealth as if by an
invisible hand that's his other use of
the term just compare that with what
you're taught in school or what you're
reading the newspapers and it goes
across the board like everybody probably
has read the first paragraphs of wealth
of Nations which talks about how
wonderful that is that the butcher
pursues his interests and the baker
verses in his interests were all happy
so we should be in favor of a division
of labor everybody's read that how many
people have read a couple of hundred
pages into Wealth of Nations where he
has a bitter attack on division of labor
for interesting reasons and reasons that
were standard in the
enlighten an environment in which he
lived very different from ours he says
if you pursuit division of labour people
will be directed to actions in which
they'll just repeat the same mechanical
operations over and over
they'll be d skilled ok that's the goal
of Management for a hundred years
d skilled the workforce it says that's
what will happen if you pursue division
of labour it goes on to say this will
turn people into creatures as stupid and
ignorant as a human being can possibly
be and therefore in any civilized
society the government will have to
intervene to prevent any development
like this
that's Adam Smith's view of division of
labour the next step of here's a
research project take the standard
edition scholarly edition of Wealth of
Nations produced by the University of
Chicago Press naturally on the
Bicentennial with a scholarly apparatus
you know footnotes everything else and
take a look at the index is a scholarly
index look up division of labor this
part of the book is not referenced you
can't find it unless you decide to read
700 page then you can find it but that's
its concept the division of labor and it
continues like this I'm not stalling a
lot of things there you can harshly
criticize like as advice to the colonies
but nevertheless it's a very different
picture from what's called
libertarianism work
today capitalist democracy would
self-destruct capitalism would
self-destruct and that's why it hasn't
been instituted the Masters understand
that they cannot survive a capitalist
economy plus a fair economy you take a
look at the history it's pretty
interesting so the United States when it
was was independent so it could reject
the rules of sound economics and it
developed there were other countries
that were poised for Industrial
Revolution and were given the same
advice like Egypt and India in fact
India already was the commercial
industrial center of the world the more
southern England
Egypt was poised for Industrial
Revolution and it's not impossible that
it might have developed was a rich
agrarian society it had cotton produced
cotton as I say that's the main product
like oil today and it didn't need slaves
hasn't it had a developmental government
aimed at industrial development that
could have taken off just as India could
have taken off but they were not free to
reject sound economics because they were
ruled by British force so they were
forced to accept sound economics and
Egypt became Egypt the United States
became the United States India went
through a century of D development until
it finally got independent that's what
happens when you apply less a fair
principles in fact that's essentially
the third world and the first world
divided you take a look at the countries
that developed there are the countries
who violated the principles that England
the United States Germany France the
local Netherlands
one country of the South one country
developed Japan the one country that
wasn't colonized and was able to pursue
the same course that the rich countries
developed I mentioned that in mid 19th
century 1846 Britain was so far ahead of
the rest of the world in industrial
development that they did I decide that
Lizzie fair would be possible so they
moved to what's called a free trade era
and didn't first of all they imposed
sharp constraints on it they cut off the
end
India India was not allowed that others
could not invest in India their main in
possession and India was not allowed to
develop there were other restrictions
and pretty soon
British capitalists called the game off
because they couldn't compete by the
1920s they couldn't compete with
Japanese production so they literally
closed off the empire to Japanese
exports as part of the background for
the Pacific War at nineteen in the 1940s
the United States did the same with its
smaller Empire
Philippines the Dutch did the same with
Indonesia and all the Imperial systems
decided no more free trade we can't
compete so they closed off the Empire
being in Japan had no markets no
resources and they went to work that's a
large part of the background the United
States in 1945 did move towards was a
fair fact there was an important
conference the United States was
basically running the world at that
point obvious reasons
there was a hemispheric conference
called by Washington February 1945 and
thanks
we're the Western Hemisphere was
compelled to adopt an economic charter
for the Americas which which bend any
interference with market principles the
goal was read the State Department
reports to oppose the new nationalism in
Latin America which is based on the idea
that the resource that the people of a
country should benefit from the
country's resources that's evil can't
allow that it's Western and us investors
who have to benefit from their resources
so that was the economic Charter the
Americas imposed on the countries that
hemisphere with one exception here the
United States did not follow those
policies quite the contrary
as I mentioned there was a massive
development of a state ecoute based
economy with an industrial policy the
kind that created the modern high-tech
economy you can see it right across the
river take a look take a look at MIT
right one of the main centers of these
if you looked at MIT in the 1950s I got
there it was surrounded by electronics
based high-tech firms like Raytheon and
itech you know huge IT firms you take a
look at MIT today take a look the
buildings its Novartis Pfizer and so on
the reason is completely obvious during
the 50s and the 60s the cutting edge of
the economy was electronics based so the
way to get the public to pay for it was
to scream Russians and to get them to
pay higher taxes for the Pentagon and
then the Pentagon would fund
the research and development like my own
salary for example I shouldn't complain
too much and the and of course a private
is so-called private industry was around
they're like vultures to pick up the the
products and the research and disembark
it
well since the seventies the cutting
edge of the economy has been moving
towards being biology based so funding
government funding has shifted Pentagon
funding is declining funding from the
NIH and other for both health related
government institutions is increasing
the private corporations understand that
so now the Novartis you know Jen genetic
engineering firms and so on are hanging
around trying to pick up the research
that you're paying for so that they can
market it and make profits it's just
transparent it's in front of our eyes
and it takes a very effective
educational system to prevent people
from seeing it it's virtually
transparent that's the way really
existing capitalist democracy works a
final word about democracy and then we
have to leave there's a major attack on
democracy all the way through that by
now it's reached the point
just pretty remarkable well you take a
look at me one of the main topics in
mainstream political science you know
not talking about radicals mainstream
political science is comparing public
attitudes with public policy it's a
fairly straightforward it's hard work
but straightforward effort we have the
public policy so you can see it there's
extensive polling quite reliable
generally consistent its results that
gives you a good sense of what public
attitudes are and the results of this
are published in the major books and
articles give you references if you like
the results are very straightforward
about 70% of the population the lowest
70% on the income scale are literally
disenfranchised their opinions have no
effect on policy their elected
representatives don't pay any attention
to them
that's one of the reasons why many of
them don't bother but they're not gonna
pay attention to them anyway may not
read the technical literature but you
understand it in other ways as you move
up the income scale you begin they'll
get a little more a little more
influence on policy when you get to the
top and the contrary to the Occupy
movement it's not 1% it's more like 1/10
of 1% when you get to the top where the
massive concentration of wealth is they
basically set policy that's it's not
democracy that's plutocracy and that's
what we have accepted the good thing
about it is it's changeable it's not
controlled by force that we are very
free at night respect thanks to the
victories over the century it's not
possible now for a corporation to do
what Andrew Carnegie the great
pacifist did in 1890 that gives a lot of
options and you have to make use of
freighter gotta leave
