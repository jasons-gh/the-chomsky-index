and for the same reason similar reasons
Israel has consistently preferred
expansion to security particularly
that's been particularly evident since
1971 when Israel made a really fateful
decision I think backed by Henry
Kissinger namely the decision to reject
the offer of a full peace treaty by
President Sadat of Egypt which
incidentally offered nothing to the
Palestinians it's an agreement that
Israel and the United States were
compelled to accept at Camp David eight
years later it's after a major war which
was a near disaster for Israel and
immense suffering that goes down in
history as a wonderful achievement of
u.s. involvement in the bringing peace
in fact it was a diplomatic tast raphy
for the reasons I mentioned but that's
you know beyond the capacity of educated
people to discuss or think about again I
urge you to look at the facts if you're
interested now a priest peace treaty
with Egypt in 1971 which the US and
Israel rejected that would have ended
any significant security threat it was
none from the Palestinians and Egypt is
the major our military force by four but
there was an unacceptable quid pro quo
so that insisted that Israel abandon its
extensive settlement programs in Egypt
mainly in the northeastern Sinai and as
usual security was a lower priority than
expansion as it still is today Israel
could have security normalization of
relations integration into the region
but it very clearly prefers illegal
expansion conflict a repeated exercise
of violence to teach lessons to the two
legged beasts actions that are severely
eroding its security even if it gains
term military victory one of the wisest
voices in Israel unfortunately a tiny
minority weary of nari I recently wrote
that after an Israeli military victory
in Gaza what will be seared into the
consciousness of the world will be the
image of Israel as a blood-stained
monster ready at any moment to commit
war crimes and not prepared to abide by
any moral restraints this will have
severe consequences for our long-term
future our standing in the world are a
chance of achieving peace and quiet in
the end this war is a crime against
ourselves to a crime against the state
of israel it's good reason to believe
that he's right if I can quote myself
again several decades ago three years
ago I wrote that those who call
themselves supporters of Israel are in
reality supporters of its moral
degeneration and it's probable ultimate
destruction and regrettably that
judgment looks more and more plausible
meanwhile we're observing a very rare
moment in history it's what the late
Israeli sociologist bar timberlane
called politicized politicize that's the
murder of a nation at our hands thanks
