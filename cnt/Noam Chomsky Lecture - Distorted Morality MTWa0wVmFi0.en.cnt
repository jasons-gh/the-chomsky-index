the idea is the reason why the world is
so disorderly is because you've got all
you now with a cold war gone you've got
all these ethnic groups killing each
other and so on well as usual it's
always a good idea to start by asking
about the facts whenever you hear
anything said very confidently the first
thing that should come to mind is wait a
minute is that true my city is still
breathing
it's true through buildings got missing
white teeth sidewalks are watching me
think about you
sparkles with broken glass
I'm back with scars to show back with
the streets unknown will never take me
anywhere but here

Thanks
I just got back from Brazil where they
don't have any fire codes and if you
think this is uncomfortable you should
see a meeting there people packed so
tight that the was a good question
whether they'd the oxygen level would
suffice fortunately there wasn't a fire
that would have been a huge catastrophe
uh well the title you noticed had a
question mark after it and the reason
for the question mark is that whatever
has been happening for the past several
months and is going on now and however
you evaluate it like it hate it whatever
it's pretty clear that it cannot be a
war on terror and that's fact that's
close to a logical necessity at least if
we accept certain pretty elementary
assumptions in principles so let me try
to make those clear at the outset the
first principle guideline if you like is
that we ought to I will try and I think
we should bend over backwards to give
the benefit of the doubt to the United
States government on every whenever it's
possible so there's any dispute about
how to interpret something we'll assume
they're right the second guideline is
that we should take rather seriously the
very seriously the pronouncements of
leadership especially when they're made
with great sincerity and emotion so for
example when George Bush tells us that
he's the most devout Christian since the
Apostles we should believe him take him
at his word and we should therefore
conclude that he certainly has memorized
over and over again in his Bible reading
classes and in church
the famous definition of hypocrite
that's given in the Gospels
namely the hypocrite is the person who
applies to others the standards that he
refuses to apply to himself so if you're
not a hypocrite you assume there's
something is right for us it's right for
them and if it's wrong when they do it
it's wrong when we do it that's really
Elementary right I assume the president
would agree and all of his admirers as
well so those are the principles I'd
like to start with well just beside
comment I mean unless we can rise to
that minimal level of moral integrity we
should at least stop talking about
things like human rights and you know
right and wrong and good and evil and
all such highfalutin things because all
our talk should be dismissed
in fact dismissed with complete
repugnance unless we can at least rise
to that minimal level I think that's
obvious and I'd hope there'd be
agreement on that too well with that
much in place just that much for
background let me formulate a thesis the
thesis is that we are all total
hypocrites on any issue relating to
terrorism now let me clarify the notion
we I mean to by we I mean it like us
people who are have enough a degree high
degree of privilege of training
resources access to information for whom
it's pretty easy to find out the truth
about things if we want to if we decide
that that's our location and in the case
in question you really don't have to dig
very deep it's all right on the surface
so I mean when I say we I mean that
category and I definitely mean to
include myself and we because I have
never proposed that
to our leaders be subjected to the kinds
of punishment that has recommended for
enemies so that's hypocrisy in fact
there are if there are people who will
escape it I really don't know them and
come across them it's a very powerful
culture it's hard to escape its grasp
so that's thesis number one we're all
total hypocrites on the matter of in the
sense of the Gospels on the matter of
terrorism the second thesis is stronger
namely that the first thesis is so
obvious that it takes real effort to
miss it and in fact they should go home
right now because it is nevertheless let
me continue and say why I think both
theses are correct well to begin with
what is terrorism got to say something
about that that's supposed to be a
really tough question you know academic
seminars and graduate philosophy
programs and so on very vexing and
complex question however in accordance
with the guidelines that I mentioned I
think there's a simple answer
they movie just take the official us
definition of terrorism since we're
accepting the pronouncements of our
leaders literally so let's take their
definition in fact that's what I've
always done when I've been writing about
terrorism for the last 20 years or so
just accept the official definition so
for example a simple simple and
important cases in the US Army manual in
1984 which defines terrorism as the
calculated use of violence or the threat
of violence to attain goals that are
political religious or ideological in
nature unless iam
simple yeah appropriate a particularly
good choice because the timing 1984 1984
you'll recall was the time when the
Reagan administration was waging a war
against terrorism particularly what they
called state-supported
international terrorism
a plague spread by depraved opponents of
civilization itself in a return to
barbarism and the modern age I'm to be
quoting George Shultz who was the
administration moderate another
guideline is we'll keep to the moderates
not the extremists
so that's 1984 Reagan had come into
office couple years earlier his
administration had immediately declared
that the war against terrorism would be
the focus of u.s. foreign policy and
they identify two regions as the source
of this plagued by depraved opponents of
civilization itself Central America and
the Middle East and there was quite wide
agreement on that so in 1985 for example
the every year Associated Press has a
poll of editors on the most important
story of the year and in 1985 the winner
was Middle East terrorism so they agreed
right towards the end of that year 1985
Shimon Paris Israeli prime minister came
to Washington and Reagan and Paris
denounced the evil scourge of terrorism
referring to the Middle East scholarship
and experts also agreed is a huge
literature for the last 20 years on
terrorism particularly state supportive
international terrorism the time review
it but a good illustration which I'll
keep do is the December issue December
2001 issue of current history journal
current history good serious journal
it's called America at war includes
leading historians specialists and
experts on terrorism and they identified
the 1980s as the era of state supported
state-sponsored terror agreeing with the
Reagan administration and I agree with
that too I think it was a hero of
state-sponsored
terrorism one leading author Martha
Crenshaw says that in that year of the
United States adopted a proactive stance
to deter the plague mostly it's about
middle the middle east but Central
America is occasionally mentioned for
example us support one two author's
co-authors from the Brookings
Institution described the US war against
the US Contra war against Nicaragua as a
model for how to fight a war against
terrorism
they say that that was a model for us
support for the Northern Alliance and
the current phase of the war against
terrorism the seeds of contemporary
terrorism however are much deeper the
major historian and the group points out
David rapport of leading academic
specialists on terrorism midotaur the
Journal of terrorism and so on he points
out that it goes back to the the origins
of modern terrorism like Osama bin Laden
go back to the early 1960s when I'm
quoting him now
when Vietcong terror against the
American Goliath kindled the hopes that
the Western heartland was vulnerable I
won't comment on that but I'd like you
to just as an exercise you might try to
find a historical analog to that
statement somewhere I'll just leave it
at that the the world also and it's easy
without commenting if you check through
the scholarly literature you'll find
same story all the time virtually
exceptionalism
the world agreed with the Reaganites to
in 1985 right after Reagan and Paris had
denounced the evil scourge of terrorism
the General Assembly passed a resolution
condemning terrorism and in 1987 it
passed a much stronger resolution and a
much more explicit one denouncing
terrorism in all its forms and calling
on all states to do everything
they can to fight against the plague and
everything you like it's true that that
wasn't unanimous
there was one abstention namely Honduras
and two votes against the usual two they
gave their reasons for voting against
the major UN resolution on international
terrorism namely both States the United
States and Israel pointed to the same
paragraph as the reason for their
negative votes it was a paragraph that
said that nothing in the present
resolution could in any way prejudice
the right to self-determination freedom
and independence as derived from the
United Nations Charter of people
forcibly deprived of that right
particularly people's under colonial and
racist regimes and foreign occupation or
could deprive them of the right to
obtain support for others in these ends
and accord with the charter of the
United Nations that was the offending
paragraph and it's easy to understand
why it raised a serious problem for the
United States in Israel the African
National Congress was identified
officially as a terrorist organization
in the United States and South Africa
was officially an ally but the phrase
struggle against colonial and racist
regimes plainly referred to the struggle
of the ANC against the apartheid regime
so that's unacceptable
the phrase foreign occupation everyone
understood referred to the Israeli
occupation of West Bank and Gaza than in
its 20th year extremely harsh and brutal
from the beginning
continuing only because of decisive u.s.
military economic and diplomatic support
runs up to the present so obviously that
was unacceptable
so therefore the vote was 153 to two
with one abstention
so what
totally unanimous it wasn't reported and
it's disappeared from history you can
check to find out instantly that's
standard practice when the master says
something is wrong it's down the memory
hole you know doesn't get recorded and
it's forgotten but it's there you know
if you want to look you can discover it
sources if you like well remember Reagan
at that time was recalled he was he in
Paris we're talking about the evil
scourge of terrorism in the Middle East
George Shultz didn't entirely agree and
he thought that what he called the most
alarming manifestation of
state-sponsored terrorism was
frightening Lee close to home namely it
was a cancer in our landmass a cancer
right nearby that was threatening to
conquer the hemisphere with a revolution
without borders rather interesting
propaganda fabrication revealed to be a
fraud instantly but always used
repeatedly afterwards even by the same
journals who explained why was total
fabrication
it was just too useful to abandon and
there's also an interesting if you think
about it the fabrication had a certain
element of truth in it an important
element of truth could come back to that
if you like anyhow this cancer in our
land mass was threatening to conquer
everything following openly following
Hitler's Mein Kampf and we plan ahead
and do something about that the it was a
serious there's a day in the United
States called law day elsewhere in the
world it's called May Day May first day
for the support of the struggles of the
American workers for an eight-hour day
but in the United States that jingoist
holiday called made a law day and on law
day 1985 the President Reagan declared a
national emergency because the
government of Nicaragua constitutes an
unusual and extraordinary threat to the
National Security and foreign power
of the united states that was renewed
annually George Shultz informed Congress
that we must cut the Nicaraguan cancer
out and not by gentle means things are
too serious for that so to quote Shultz
recall the administration moderate you
know the good job quote Shultz he said
negotiations are a euphemism for
capitulation if the shadow of power is
not cast across the bargaining table
he condemned those who advocate utopian
legalistic means like outside mediation
the United Nations the World Court while
ignoring the power element of the
equation I'll avoid quoting the
hardliners the at that time the United
States was exercising the power element
of the equation with mercenary forces
based in Honduras attacking Nicaragua
they were under the supervision of John
Negroponte II who was just appointed to
run the diplomatic side of the
diplomatic component of the current war
on terror as a UN Ambassador the
military component of the current war on
terror is Donald Rumsfeld who at that
time was Ronald Reagan's special envoy
to the Middle East the other place where
the plague was raging through 1985 in
fact the United States at that time was
also blocking utopian legalistic means
that were being pursued by the world
court the Latin American countries and
others and it continued to block those
means right to the end until the final
victory of its terrorist wars throughout
Central America well how was the war
against state-sponsored terrorism waged
in those two regions by the people who
in fact there's leading the new phase so
it's very close historical continuity
not just those two of course well that's
just to illustrate pick the peak year
the worst year
you know 1985 in the Middle East top
story of the year so what were the who
wins the prize for the worst acts of
terrorism and the Middle East in 1985
well I know of three candidates maybe
you can suggest a different one one
candidate is a car bombing in Beirut in
1985 the car the car bombing was it was
a cart he was placed outside a mosque
the bomb was timed to go off when people
were leaving to make sure he killed the
maximum number of people it according to
the Washington Post killed 80 people
wounded over 250 mostly women and girls
leaving the mosque there was a huge
explosion so it blew up the whole street
killed babies and beds and so on and so
forth
the bomb was aimed at a Muslim Shah who
escaped it was set off by the CIA in
collaboration with British intelligence
and Saudi intelligence and specifically
authorized by William Casey according to
Bob Woodward's history of Casey and the
CIA so that's a clear Cait cut example
of international terrorism very
unambiguous and I think it's one of the
candidates for the prize for the peak
year of 1985 another candidate surely
would be the so-called Iron Fist
operations that Shimon Paris's
government was carrying out and occupied
southern Lebanon in March of 1985 the
operations this is southern Lebanon
which was under military occupation in
violation of a Security Council order to
leave but with us Oscars what US
authorizations irrelevant
the of the bombing the Iron Fist
operations were targeting what the high
command called terrorists villagers in
southern Lebanon included many massacres
lots of atrocities kidnapping of people
for interrogation than taking them
Israel and so on
it reached new depths of calculated
brutality and arbitrary murder according
to a Western diplomat familiar with the
region who was observing there was no
pretense of self-defense rather it was
openly undertaken for political ends it
was conceded it wasn't even argued so
that's a clear case of international
terrorism although here we might claim
that it's a that it's aggression
I'll call it just international
terrorism in line with the principle
that we bend over backwards to give the
United States the benefit of the doubt
of course this is a u.s. operation you
know Israel does it because they're
given arms and aid and diplomatic
support by the United States so we'll
call this we'll decide to call this just
international terrorism not the much
more serious war crime of aggression the
same incidentally was true of the much
worse operations of 1982 when Israel
invaded Lebanon killed maybe 20,000 or
so people again crucial US military in
economic and diplomatic sport us had the
veto a couple of Security Council
resolutions to keep the slaughter going
provided the arms for it and so on so
it's a u.s. Israeli invasion if we're
honest the goal of the invasion I'll
just quote the New York Times on that
the goal was to install a friendly
regime in Lebanon announced the PLO
which would help persuade Palestinians
to accept Israeli rule in the West Bank
in Gaza
that's actually accurate and I have to
compliment the New York tons and saying
that that was this January 24th as far
as I know that's the first time in
mainstream US literature that anyone has
dared to say what was absolutely common
knowledge in Israel and in the dissident
literature 20 years ago when I was
writing this in 1983 just using his
railey sources but it couldn't penetrate
us commentary you might check and see as
far as I know this is the first
breakthrough
sure the reporter understood what he was
saying but anyway he did say it James
Bennett January 24th well you know prize
for James Bennett for telling the truth
after 20 years and it's true and of
course it's a textbook illustration
virtually textbook illustration of
international terrorism this time we
have to bend over backwards pretty far
to call it international terrorism
because it's hard to say why this isn't
overt aggression the kind of action for
which US and Israeli leaders should be
subjected to Nuremberg trials real
serious war crime but again let's keep
to the guidelines and say it's only
international terrorism well that's the
second example this 85 them deep to the
iron fist operations third the only
other example for 1985 that I know of
took place a few days before Shimon
Paris arrived in Washington to join
Reagan and denouncing the evil scourge
of terrorism shortly before that Paris
and the Israeli Air Force to bomb Tunis
killing 75 people civilians with torn to
shreds with smart bombs was all rather
accurately and graphically depicted by a
highly respected Israeli reporter Amnon
kappa leokk and the hebrew press in
israel and corroborated by other sources
so the united states cooperated with
that by withdrawing the sixth fleet so
they didn't have to inform their ally
Tunisia that the Bombers were on their
way presumably getting refueled on the
way so that's a third candidate I don't
know of any other candidates were that
even come close to being candidates were
instantly George Shultz the moderate
immediately after the bombing he
telephoned the Israeli Foreign Minister
to say that the United States had
considerable sympathy for this operation
but he backed away from open support for
massive
of international terrorism or maybe
aggression when the Security Council
unanimously condemned the attack as an
act of armed aggression a United States
abstaining against that so those are the
three cases of top three cases that win
the prize for 1985 to my knowledge and
again I'll assume that these are just
international terrorism so we're not
calling for Nuremberg trials adjust more
international terrorism by depraved
opponents of civilization itself and
examples which are pretty hard to miss
remember because this was the peak story
of the year international terrorism in
the Middle East here's three perfect
examples in fact the only three major
examples that I know of however they
aren't candidates in fact they're not
even in the running they're not
competitors the examples that are in the
running are for example cited in the
current history issue to which I
referred which does discuss 1985 and
gives two examples of the evil scourge
of terrorism a namely the hijacking of
TWA 897 killing an American one American
Navy diver and the hijacking of the
Achille Lauro boat killing which led to
the killing of Leon Klinghoffer a
crippled American both surely terrorist
atrocities those are the two examples
that are in the running for that are
memorable you know that count for
international terrorism
well the hijackers of the TWA plane
claimed correctly in fact that Israel
was regularly hijacking ships in
international waters in transit between
Lebanon and Cyprus killing people
kidnapping others taking them to Israel
either for interrogation or simply as
hostages keeping them in jail for years
some people are still in jail without
charges many
but that's all correct their charges are
correct but that doesn't justify the
hijacking on the assumption which I
accept at least that violence is not
legitimate in retaliation against even
worse atrocities or as preemption
against future atrocities violence is
not legitimate in such cases so we can
dismiss those claims though they're in
fact correct and incidentally the
us-israeli hijackings and remember if
Israel does it we're doing it
those hijackings are also out of the
historical record I mean occasionally
you'll find a reference to them in a you
know the bottom column on something or
other but they're not part of the
history of terrorism the hijackers of
the Achille Lauro claimed that this was
retaliation for the bombing of Tunis
couple days earlier well we dismiss that
with contempt on the same principle
namely violence is not justified in
retaliation or a preemption and assuming
that we can rise to the level of the
minimal moral level that I mentioned
earlier if we're not confirmed
hypocrites in other words then some
consequences follow about other acts of
retaliation and preemption but that's
too obvious to talk about so I'll just
leave it you to think about
well that's 1985 the peak year of
international terrorism and the Middle
East it's as a research project you
might see if I left out anything that is
a competitor for the prize and not aware
of it
none are mentioned in the literature on
terrorism well and notice that as I said
at the beginning you don't really have
to work very hard to see these things
you have to work very hard not to see
them takes a really good education to
miss this
it's think about it and see 1985 was of
course not the first or the last act of
international terrorism in the Middle
East
there are many others I'm quite
important for example in 1975 Israel
meaning Israeli pilots with US planes
and US Court in December 1975 the bomb
the village in Lebanon killing over 50
people no pretext was offered but
everybody knew what the reason was at
that time the UN Security Council was
meeting to consider a resolution which
was supported by the entire world with
marginal exceptions only one crucial
exception the United States which meet
the resolution calling for a diplomatic
settlement of the israel-palestine
conflict incorporating UN 242 and all of
its wording the main resolution security
and you know territorial integrity all
those nice things on the internationally
recognized border the offending part of
this one was that it also referred to
Palestinian national rights and that's
not acceptable to the United States it
rejected them then it rejects them now
contrary to a lot of nonsense that you
read the u.s. vetoed the resolution that
terminated didn't terminus continue
another still going on in fact a year
after year of efforts at diplomatic
settlement which the US has unilaterally
blocked Israel doesn't have a veto at
the Security Council so they reacted to
the debate by bombing Lebanon and
killing 50 people without a pretext
that's not in the annals of
international terrorism either there are
more read many more recent cases
including the two invasions of Yitzhak
Rabin and Shimon Paris in 1993 and 1996
u.s. supported in Lebanon the u.s.
supported both of them lots of deaths
hundreds of thousands of people driven
out and so on Clinton had to back off
his support for the 1996 invasion after
the khana Massacre over a hundred people
in a UN refugee camp that point he said
can't handle this anymore II better
leave there was no pretext of
self-defense in this case this is just
outright international terrorism or
maybe aggression and it continues so
let's go up to the current Intifada
which broke out on September 30th of
year 2000 in the first couple of days
there was no fire from Palestinians with
snow throwing but Israel was in fact
using Israeli u.s. attack helicopters to
attack civilian complexes apartment
complexes and so on killing and wounding
dozens of people in the first few days
the Clinton administration responded to
this by well our president's phrase by
enhancing terror Marie Cawley Bush
condemned the Palestinians for enhancing
terror last month I saw I'll use his
phrase in line with the guidelines the
Clinton administration committed itself
to enhancing terror by making on October
3rd by making the ideal for the biggest
shipment in a decade of attack of
military helicopters to Israel and along
with spare parts for the Apache attack
helicopters that have been sent a couple
of weeks earlier that's enhancing terror
and the days right after these
helicopters were being used to murder
and wound civilians attacking apartment
complexes and so on the press cooperated
by refusing to report this note not
failing to report it refusing to report
it it was specifically brought to the
attention of editors and they simply
made it clear that I'm going to report
it there's no question about the facts
and so no one but to this day it hasn't
been reported except in the margins that
policy continues to skip to December
2001 last month two months ago uh George
Bush was condemning the Palestinians for
enhancing terror and he contributed in
the conventional way to enhancing terror
in crucial ways in fact
on December 15th the UN Security Council
debated a European initiated resolution
calling on both sides to reduce violence
and calling for the introduction of
international monitors to assist in
monitoring a reduction of violence
that's a very important step that was
vetoed by the United States went to the
who want to enhance violence evidently
it's hard to think of any other
interpretation for this the press didn't
have to bother giving an interpretation
because was barely reported it then went
to the General Assembly where as far as
I'm aware it wasn't reported at all and
there was an overwhelming vote
supporting the same resolution this time
the United States and Israel were not
entirely isolated in opposition as
several Pacific Islands joined in now
one or two others so therefore you know
not the usual splendid isolation I don't
think I recall that that was reported a
couple of about a week before ten days
before that there was another major
contribution to enhancing terror the
fourth Geneva Conventions according to
the entire world literally outside of
Israel applied to the occupied
territories the United States refuses it
doesn't vote against this when it comes
up in the United Nations its names I
presume the reason is the United States
does not want to take such an open
blatant stand and violation of
fundamental principles of international
law particularly because of the
circumstances under which they were
enacted recall that the Geneva
Conventions were established in order to
write after the Second World War in
order to criminalize the acts of the
Nazis so saying they don't apply is
pretty strong statement however outside
of the United States in Israel the whole
world agrees the International Red Cross
which is the agency responsible for
applying and interpreting them agrees in
fact there's no as far as I'm aware no
further question about this Switzerland
which is the responsible state called a
meeting of the hike and
acting parties for the Geneva
Conventions that is those like the
United States that are legally obligated
by treaty to enforce them it's a high
song commitment called a meeting on
December 5th and in Geneva and the
meeting the place passed a strong
resolution saying the determining that
the Geneva Conventions do apply to the
occupied territories which makes illegal
just about everything that the United
States and Israel do there they went
through the list settlements
displacement everything that goes on the
United States boycotted the session they
got another country to boycott them
Australia according to the Australian
press under heavy US pressure Australia
joined in boycotting them if the US
boycotts it's like a negative vote at
the Security Council or the General
Assembly then get reported and it's out
of history okay but that's another
important step to enhance antara all of
this took place incidentally in the
midst of a 21-day truce one sided truth
of Palestinians weren't carrying out any
acts but a couple of dozen Palestinians
were killed including a dozen children
and that was right it was right in the
middle of this that these efforts to
enhance terror took place maybe that's
an unfair interpretation and there's
some other motive that I'm not thinking
of but that's what they look like to me
you can think about that in any event
international terrorism in the Middle
East certainly continues as long history
and if you look over the record of
course it's mixed and complicated but I
think you'll find that the balance is
pretty much along the lines that I
described in fact the balance reflects
the means of violence available as it
usually does if you look around but
terror in fact that's why in the whole
range of terror a state terror is far
worse than individual terror
for the obvious reason that states have
means of violence that individuals don't
have or groups and that's what you find
if you look I think overwhelmingly it's
commonly said that terrorism is a weapon
of the weak that's completely false at
least if you accept the official us
definition of terror if you do that then
terror is overwhelmingly the weapon of
the strong like most other weapons well
that's history but all of this stuff is
out of history its history is what is
created by well-educated intellectuals
and it doesn't have to have any
resemblance to that thing called history
by naive people and I think if you check
this you'll find that that's true well
that's the Middle East let's turn to
Central America the other main focus of
the plagued by depraved opponents of
civilization itself here I can be I'll
be brief because what at least the core
parts are just uncontroversial in at
least uncontroversial among people who
have minimal regard for international
law and international institutions and
so on actually the size of that category
is very easily estimated namely ask
yourself how often where I'm now going
to say has appeared in the discussions
about the evil plague of terrorism in
the past five months huge flood how much
has been devoted to some on
controversial cases again on
controversial if you think the World
Court in the Security Council and
international law have some significant
well in 1986 the International Court of
Justice condemned the United States for
international terrorism unlawful use of
force and its war against Nicaragua
again I'm gonna keep to the guidelines
bend over backwards allow this to be
interpreted just as international
terrorism not the work right of
aggression so we'll call it
international terrorism the court
ordered the United States to terminate
the crimes and to pay substantial
reparations
billions of dollars Congress reacted by
instantly escalating the war by new
funding to escalate the war the
Nicaragua took the matter to the
Security Council which debated a
resolution calling on all states to
observe international law mentioning no
one but everyone knew who was meant the
u.s. vetoed it
Nicaragua then went to the General
Assembly which passed similar
resolutions and successive years United
States and Israel opposed in one year
they got el salvador all of this is out
of history it has to be just
inconsistent with our preferred image of
what history is supposed to be and as I
say you you can check how much this has
been these are uncontroversial cases you
can check to see how much it's been
referred to recently and remember who
were the individuals responsible people
like Negroponte e proconsul of Honduras
Rumsfeld special on wood in the Middle
East and so on and others plenty of
continuity well the the the u.s. reacted
as I said by escalating war and also for
the first time giving official orders to
its mercenary forces to attack what are
called soft targets that's what the
southern South Southern Command called
them soft targets meaning undefended
civilian targets agricultural
cooperatives and so on that was known it
was discussed in the United States that
was considered legitimate by the left so
Michael Kinsley who represents the left
and mainstream debate the an interesting
article he was known as rather than a
republic in which he said that we
shouldn't be too quick to condemn State
Department authorization for attacks on
undefended civilian targets because we
have to apply pragmatic criteria we have
to carry out cost-benefit analysis and
see whether as he put it the amount of
blood poured in is compensated by a goo
namely democracy what we will determine
to be democracy and what that means you
could see by looking at the states next
door like El Salvador in Guatemala which
we're okay democracies and if it passes
our testament it's okay so in other
words international terrorism is fine
assuming it meets pragmatic criteria and
now across the spectrum you know left to
right
among we that is educated privileged
intellectual not the population of
course all right the in Nicaragua the
the population had an army to defend it
it was bad enough I mean tens of
thousands of people killed the country
correctly devastated may never recover
but it had an army to defend it and I'll
Salvador in Guatemala that wasn't true
the army was the state terrorists this
u.s. supported state terrors they were
the army there was nobody defend the
population and in fact the atrocities
were far worse also they are not a state
so they couldn't go to the World Court
on the Security Council to follow legal
means of course without any effect
because we people like us have
determined that the world is going to be
ruled by force
not by law and since we have the power
as long as we determine that state that
tries to follow the legitimate means of
responding to international terrorism
that never do but that's our choice
you know nobody else's choice can't
blame anyone else on that for that the
you know in order to carry out that
there was however enough popular
resistance not elite resistance but
popular resistance to the atrocities
there that the US had to resort to a
klenda to an international terrorist
network an extraordinary international
terrorist network remember the u.s. is a
powerful state it's not like Libya Libya
wants to carry out terrorist acts they
hire you know Carlos the Jackal or
something the United States hires
terrorist States
we're big guys so the terrorist network
consisted of
taijuan Britain Israel Argentina at
least as long as it was under the rule
of the neo-nazi generals when they were
unfortunately removed they fell out of
the system Saudi Arabian funding quite a
substantial international terrorist
network never been anything like it in
contemporary terms we might call it an
axis of evil I suppose the outcome again
keeping to the guidelines we believe
their leaders the result was hundreds of
thousands of people slaughtered millions
of orphans and refugees every
conceivable atrocity the region
devastated the single uncontroversial
case Nicaragua which was the least of
them that alone far surpasses the crimes
of September 11th and the others
suffered far worse this is again we're
bending over backwards and giving the us
the benefit of the doubt so we're only
calling it international terrorism
organized by depraved opponents of
civilization itself well that's the
second major area Central America all of
this however is off the record - in the
current history journal and it's typical
in this respect none of nothing was I
just I've referred to its mentioned nor
is it in the whole scholarly literature
in fact except the way at the margins
you can check and see it just doesn't
count the 80s are described that's the
era of state-sponsored international
terrorism but they're not referring any
of these things the US was trying to
prevent state-sponsored international
terrorism by taking proactive means like
the most massive international terrorist
network that's ever been known that's
very typical of the scholarly literature
journalism and again you can do a check
there's barely than a word about any of
this as the second phase of the war on
terror has been reading declared once
again with pretty much the same people
and
every reason to expect similar outcomes
well let's continue from all of this an
obvious conclusion follows there is an
operational definition of terrorism the
one that's actually used it means terror
that they carry out against us that's
terrorism nothing else passes through
the filter furthermore that's as far as
I know that's a historical Universal I
can't find an exception to that you
might try so for example the Japanese in
China and Korea were defending the
population against Chinese terrorists
and going to create an earthly paradise
for them if they could control the
terrorists the Nazis in occupied Europe
were defending the legitimate
governments like machine and the
population from the terrorists partisans
who were supported from abroad as indeed
they were they were run from London and
London France and so on the facts I say
I can't find an exception you might try
also as far as I'm aware this is
virtually universal among intellectuals
educated folks like us apart from
statistical error this is the line but
they take now it doesn't look that way
in history but you have to remember who
writes history that'll leave you with a
little bit of skepticism if you look at
actual history not the one that's
written I think you'll find that this is
the case and I could even maybe
suggested as a research topic to some
enterprising graduate student who
aspires to a career as a taxi driver
the well just to continue to the present
let's just take the last couple of
months September 11th was a perfectly
clear example of international terrorism
no controversy about that so we don't
waste time on it what about the reaction
well it turns out the reaction is also
an uncontroversial case of international
terrorism again let's keep to the
guidelines we'll just listen to what our
leaders say so on October 11th President
Bush announced that the Afghan that
through the Afghan people that we will
keep bombing you until you hand over
people who we suspect of terrorist acts
although we refuse to provide any
evidence and we refuse to enter into
negotiations for a extradition and
transfer clear case of international
terrorism all right on October 28th had
admirably his British counterpart
Admiral Sir Michael boys who's the chief
of the British defence staff took it a
step for further three weeks after
remembered speak getting rid of the
Taliban regime was not a warning that
was an afterthought and three weeks
after the bombing began that was added
presumably so that intellectuals would
have something to feel good about or
something I don't know anyway three
weeks after the bombing that was added
as a new worrying and Admiral voice
announced to the Afghan people
accordingly I think this is the first
mention of this worrying that we will
continue bombing you until you change
your leadership okay first that was all
very prominent like page one of the New
York Times in both cases to both cases
our textbook illustrations of
international terrorism if not
aggression but we're still bending over
and it's all off the record by usual
convention we're doing it so it doesn't
you know it's only when they carry out
what we officially define as terrorism
that it counts well it's easy to go on
but let me just return to the week
thesis there can't be a war against
terrorism at least against as terrorism
is defined in official US documents it's
a logical impossibility these this is a
small sample of illustrations you can go
on easily but it's enough to show that
that can't be true that's the weak
thesis what about the strong thesis that
it's all so entirely obvious that it
won't even be embarrassing to talk about
it because it's all right on the surface
nothing hidden about any of this
everything I mentioned is perfectly well
known you know you'd have to penetrate
anything to discover no obscure sources
nothing just the obvious evidence and
it's very easily you can easily add to
it this ton of literature about it for
the last 20 years but that's all that
literature also can't be discussed
because it comes out with the wrong
conclusion
so it's treated the same way
terrorism is in our intellectual culture
again the choice not a necessity so we
end up with a kind of a dilemma if we're
on if we're not honest to forget it if
we are honest there's a dilemma one
possibility is just to acknowledge that
we are total hypocrites that we and then
to at least have the decency to stop
talking about things like human rights
and right and wrong and good and evil
and so on and just say yeah we're
hypocrites we want to we have force and
we're going to rule the world by force
period let's forget about everything
else the other option is harder to
pursue but it's imperative unless we
would like to contribute to still worse
disasters that are likely lie ahead
