oster the local governor to discuss
these events were joined by Marwan
Bishara senior political analyst at Al
Jazeera and host and editor of the TV
show Empire an MIT professor Noam
Chomsky author of well more than a
hundred books including most recently
Gaza in crisis reflections on Israel's
war against the Palestinians also hopes
and prospects both published by
Haymarket books welcome you both to
Democracy Now wonderful to have you both
in our studio this week on this 15th
anniversary week of democracy now just a
correction it was an ABC News reporter
Miguel Marquez not NBC was among those
you know you know me go he was in manama
in Bahrain part of this rolling
rebellion in the Middle East no talk
about the significance i feel like we
talked a revolution ago we were speaking
just as the rebellion was unfolding in
Egypt but and that was just what 18 days
ago David yeah well it's a it's a
startling event I mean the I don't think
one can predict where it's going but
it's obviously creating at least the
basis for major changes in the region
and for the moment the regimes are more
or less holding so in Tunisia and Egypt
it's essentially the same regime the
changes but the public protests are so
vibrant and energetic that it's hard to
believe they're going to be able to hold
Bahrain which just talked about is a
particularly sensitive place as you
mentioned it hosts the u.s. fleet the
major fleet in the region but also it's
a charity Shiite country with a Sunni
leadership and right across the on the
mainland the population in Saudi Arabia
is also mainly Shiite and Saudi Arabia
has been concerned about the four years
it's a repressed population they're
concerned about possible influences from
the Shiite regions near by Iran southern
Iraq and also that happens to be where
most of the Saudi Arabian oil is so it's
a very sensitive area you've been
studying the Middle East also traveling
there for decades Marwan Bishara you
live there I think you don't live in any
one place but for Al Jazeera you travel
the world talk about the significance of
this well I think we are living I'm not
sure if it's our 1989 moment or
something else but certainly the Arab
world has been quite delayed from those
transformation that took place in the in
Eastern Europe or for that matter in
Latin America and I think perhaps the
Arab moment has come it's clear that the
genies out of the bottle now some people
some cynics would like to see it as a
temporary uprising and everything will
go back as it were I don't think so I
think change is coming to the middle to
the Middle East to the Arab world in
general and in a sense we know that the
way back is not the way forward but what
is the way forward exactly as Professor
strong said we're not exactly sure but
certainly it's a work in progress and
I'm not as skeptical as many that that
although benally has gone in Tunisia and
although Mubarak has gone in Egypt that
the Mubarak regime and the moba and
they've been either team is going to
stay I think it's a work in progress and
I think sooner rather than later we will
see also the regime's being swept away
after their symbols their faces have
already been have already left the
scenes well I like josh is particularly
about Saudi Arabia the bastion of
conservatism and authoritarianism in the
region now Saudi Arabia is faced with
Bahrain explosion Bahrain to its east
Yemen to its south Egypt to its West and
basically all the
trees around Saudi Arabia now are on
fire and the the impact on the monarchy
and of course on US interest in the area
what do you think would be the impact
within Saudi Arabia so I think the
impact is going to differ from one
country to another but there's certain
commonality to all of it see there is
this thing that's been absent in the
mind of many not only in Washington but
also in the US media there is something
called an Arab there is an Arab nation
you can fly if they can take a seven
hour flight from Morocco to Iraq passing
through an Arab region that speaks the
same languages has the same heritage but
it has been invisible to American media
into American decision-makers we've seen
the Arab world we've seen Saudi Arabia
we've seen by hurrying through the
lenses of military strategy oil prisms
of Israel and certainly terrorism and
jihad but what we've seen over the last
six weeks has been completely absence
and hence it caught everyone by surprise
everyone was caught in the headlights
what is going on who are these people
don't not realizing that in places like
Bahrain places like Yemen certainly
Egypt Tunisia and so on so forth a
pent-up tension has been building up for
years this this is not a new thing
that's going on facebook so in Saudi
Arabia like in the rest of the Arab
world we're going to see what has been
building up for years in Mahara used to
call it for the last 30 years attempt to
topple the government's attempt to
topple the regime in fact there were
community organizers well they're not
exactly like Chicago the risks are far
higher and the Arab all but these are
committee organizers in Egypt in Tunisia
Yemen Bahrain and other places trying to
live or trying to root for 444 decent
living but always being called
terrorists or always been been oppressed
under the pretext of terrorism Marwan
Bishara you just came back from
Washington DC where you were meeting
with think tanks what is your sense of
the Washington Consensus understanding
versus what you are experiencing in the
Middle East you know sometimes I forget
exactly what are the concepts that are
you are allowed on television or not but
let me just put it this way they were
caught
with their pants down completely I mean
people in Washington until today have
not realized exactly what is going on
they're still trying to play catch up
with what's going on in the arable so I
for example I was in one of those and
one of those brainstorming sessions that
we try to talk about what's next for
Palestine and Israel and watch what
amazes me is that if everything that
they speak about has an Israel reference
to it because that's where the
correspondence for their main networks
are that's where the people are and
that's how they've seen the region Egypt
Palestine and so on from Israel's prisms
so every points of reference is what did
not Anna Jose what does Israel think
what would a la because that would now
for example President Obama do this and
that and we'll the Israeli it all be
allowing what does that mean for our
strategic interests me is not
understanding that there is a complete
sweep that that requires not only
exchange of mindset and if you allow me
here a change of decision-makers perhaps
or does it you know a change of aids in
Washington there's a complete class of
bureaucrats in Washington that are not
only not in touch with what's going on
in America they certainly not in touch
with what's going on in the Arab world
well no chumps we all had to follow up
on that at the time that an interesting
article today apparently an Obama
administration leaked that the
administration had from the president
for more than a year had had requested
this study that predicted the possible
outbreak of popular movements throughout
throughout the region Samantha power was
involved in preparing this report as if
to say well we were on top of the
situation even though we weren't we knew
that this was coming and your sense of
to what degree Washington is is able to
respond or even is really aware of
what's going on in the region it's hard
to believe that they're not aware of it
I mean you can read it in the newspapers
there have been there have been
demonstrations and protests going on for
years a big protest in 2005 and they
keep being repressed and they're more
in fact the you know the current wave of
protests actually began last November in
western sahara Morocco which is under
Moroccan rule after a brutal invasion
and occupation the Moroccan forces came
in carried out destroyed the tent cities
a lot of killed wounded and so on and
then it spread that you have to be
pretty was as far as hardly known about
their authority under the occupation
come it's a major atrocity it's kind of
like a steam work affected pretty much
the same even the same time the but it's
blowing up and also they must read the
studies of Arab public opinion I mean
you can't imagine an intelligence
service that doesn't read the regular
studies by Western polling agencies of
error public opinion if you look at them
you can see why democracy is so such a
such a frightening concept the latest
major study last August released by the
Brookings Institute of not very obscure
showed that almost nobody in the Arab
world regards Iran as a threat ten
percent what they regard as a threat is
the United States and Israel like you
know eighty ninety percent in fact
majority even a favor Iran having
nuclear weapons to balance us-israeli
power which is the real threat in the
Arab world you take a look at when they
list people who are respected the air
tag on Turkey is way up on top Obama
isn't even listed you know you get down
to Osama bin Laden Saddam Hussein know
Obama you know now these are the
opinions of people in the Arab world
what you said about the bureaucrats and
the age is absolutely correct I'm
livens 60 years in which explicit policy
you know in writing has been internal
records has been to disregard the Arab
population as long as they can be kept
under control so is perhaps the the
reticence of the administration in case
of Egypt let's say we are right now in
Bahrain more geared to the fact that
they know that public opinion and they
understand that the real democracy in
the region would mean another Latin
America another region totally out of us
ability to dominate I don't talk to
anybody in Washington so I can only
guess but if it is simply inconceivable
that at least the intelligence services
don't go as far as reading polls that I
can read um
