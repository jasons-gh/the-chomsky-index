you mentioned that before there is
legitimate scientific project to
investigate go where the limits of human
understanding lies so whether question
is beyond our ability to answer I just
wonder what what kind of evidence or
inquiry Dufresne would be relevant to
that so such as an example in philosophy
call him again host the wheel that the
nature of consciousness or the
expenditure cap that's something that
you know human beings are just never
going to be able to answer and I guess
there's some some affinity between his
position and what you say but then an
objection to him that I'm sympathetic to
you said well how do you know we cannot
know how do you know that if you give
human beings dude
ten thousand years their support we are
suppose that we haven't gone extinct by
that how do you know that you give ten
thousand years people aren't going to
come up with new concepts that they
don't now have so how do you know that
they are not going to be able to solve
it so so I just wonder you you think you
think there's a scientific evidence for
this question what comp evidence would
that be well first of all we're talking
about empirical questions and in the
case of empirical questions you never
know with certainty that's what makes
some empirical questions otherwise
they'd be questions of logic or maybe
arithmetic and even there you can ask
questions but if it's empirical we're
never going to know with certainty
that's for sure let's prove by
definition so the question really is
what evidence do we have and how good is
the evidence well in some cases the
evidence is pretty good like take the
classical case what Newton regarded as
an absurdity and again I think you've
taken people like Newton seriously you
know and human organs and the rest of
them what they regarded as an absurdity
is that there could be influence without
contact and I well we don't know with
certainty that that's the limits of
human intelligence there's pretty good
evidence
if you study first of all we we just
have it from our own intuitions and from
you know the history of centuries of
efforts by the leading scientists to try
to do some to overcome it finally ending
in failure and abandoning the quest and
we also know it are beginning to
understand it from just the experimental
study of infants children the things of
the kind that I mentioned they
reflexively seek some kind of contact in
order to account for correlations then
make sense otherwise all physicists have
finally given that up they say look
we're never going to find it it doesn't
exist but is how strong is that evidence
well you decide how strong it is looks
pretty compelling to me and if it is
really the limits of ever understanding
then nothing's going to change in 10,000
years that just as it didn't change in
the last 50,000 what about things beyond
that well you know it's not an easy
question to ask even about other
creatures like rats but you can
investigate it are you ever gonna get
certainty no you'll never have certainty
because it's an empirical investigation
so that you no bother looking for as far
as consciousness is concerned I was very
hot topic these days in fact in
philosophy it's called
the hard problem everything else is an
easy problem something but this is the
hard problem you go back to the 17th and
18th century they also had something
called the heart problem namely how is
motion possible that was the hard
problem I mentioned you know Newton
wrestled with it finally said it's
impossible you know just have to accept
it even though we can't find difficult a
physical cause that was called the hard
rock in philosophy Voltaire you know
dedicated Newtonian I said that the fact
that humans can cause motion by thought
like I can think
I want my hand to go over here and
something will move he said that's so
inexplicable that it's got to be divine
intervention he was of course a pretty
dedicated atheist by the standards at
the time but it looks as if we're stuck
within and there seem to be if we look
further there are many others many other
things I mean takes a language which is
easier studying there are impossible
languages you can construct things you
know things that look simple sequences
which are given interpretations and so
on but which have a structure that
humans cannot learn I mean they may deal
with it as a puzzle of some kind but
they can't deal with it as a linguistic
task
there's by now pretty good experimental
data on that well that's the kind of
thing you expect to find when you look
at any organism including our cognate
other cognitive capacities as far as
consciousness is concerned you know I'm
not so convinced that it's the hard
problem first of all you have to
formulate it coherently what's the
problem I mean I quoted Francis Crick I
didn't mention him as saying that he has
an astonishing hypothesis that
consciousness comes from activity of the
brain that's locked
you know Hume yes they took that for
granted so that's the astonishing
hypothesis and then you can go to
proceed as he and others have done to
ask what's going on in the brain when
people are conscious okay that's serious
work does it answer them suppose you
could get all those questions answered
does it tell you what consciousness is
no leaves open the questions of
consciousness and in fact you know we
might ultimately be reduced to something
like what Bertrand Russell thought it
read his analysis of matter for example
which unfortunately isn't read much but
it's important I think I think it's 1928
or so he says he says look the only
thing we have any confidence in is our
immediate consciousness and we may be
wrong about it but at Lee
we have some degree of constant
confidence in it everything else is a
metal isn't the intellectual
construction including our conception of
objects or theory the world and so on so
that's if you want the hard rock not too
hard because it could be wrong but
that's what we have to start with and
the best you can do is human
