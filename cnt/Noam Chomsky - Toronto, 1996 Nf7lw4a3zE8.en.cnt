no I'm Tom ski has said that the news
media are profoundly reactionary known
what do you mean by that what that what
I mean by that is that they
overwhelmingly tend to be subordinated
to centers of power and I should say
that I don't really mean to distinguish
the news media from the intellectual
culture in general and furthermore I
think that this is close to tautological
in any society that is those sectors
that are not subordinated to power are
going to be marginalized and
externalized and so on you can trace
this right back to the earliest recorded
history you could go back to say the
Bible and ask yourself who were the
people who were respected during the
period covered by the Old Testament well
the answer is it was the people we call
the false prophets the people we call
the prophets were canonized hundreds of
years later they were people who were
imprisoned and beaten and driven into
the desert and reviled and so on the
people who were respected were those who
catered to the powerful later centuries
later called the false prophets and any
society with a an unequal concentration
of power which means any society the
kind that exists he's going to have that
property there will be what are
sometimes called the bought priesthood
or the Commissar or whatever name you
want to use for them who will serve the
interests of the powerful and naturally
they will be rewarded for that service
and there will be tend to be in
positions of influence prominence
Authority and so on and those who whose
point of view and
the material they produce and attitudes
are considered subversive to power
undermining and will naturally tend to
be marginalized societies differ in the
way this happens like first omits death
squads for others it's a gulag for
others it's not getting a job I mean you
know big differences then those are very
important differences there's big
difference between being say in Central
America where you're likely to get to
cut the shreds and left by you know on a
roadside ditch and being like us where
maybe you know somebody doesn't like you
or get that call the bad names or
something or lose a job if you're young
that kind of thing but so there are
differences but the the mechanisms will
of course vary from society to society
but the outcome is not so different in
fact I've done a lot of detailed
analytic work on the most interesting
case the immediate and free societies
where there is very little in the way of
state coercion comparatively and it's
striking how similar the media output is
to what you find in totalitarian states
actually that's a point that was made by
or will so in a very interesting way
Orwell Orwell's Animal Farm everyone
knows about you know carrots a satire on
the enemy not a totalitarian enemy
however Orwell wrote an introduction to
animal form called on literary
censorship in England and that wasn't
published it wasn't published for about
30 years somebody finally dug it up and
published it in the seventies about 30
years after the book appeared and in it
he pointed out that England is obviously
very different from Russia you know but
he said the literary censorship is not
all that different and he even gave the
reasons he said the reason is that first
of all he said the press is owned by
wealthy men who have every interest and
not having certain ideas expressed and
then he said there's just a period of
there's a system of indoctrination in
which you simply learn the values of the
society and you just learn you know
through Oxford and so on and then you
have just internalized the values and
you know there are certain things you
just don't say and he said the
combination of these two factors the
socialization which we call education
which is basically indoctrination and
then just the the whip you know other
people the fact that powers come wealth
is concentrated the is are the outcome
of these two effects is that you do have
literary censorship in England the free
society which is not so different from
what you're getting into at a latarian
Society and as if to prove its point it
didn't appear now as to that difference
there because there would be a
difference the media you've written must
maintain the illusion that there is in
fact freedom that there is not de-facto
censorship so how does this happen how
does it come that the journalists as I
believe actually are self deluded into
into believing that they're not into
self-censorship and and how do you see
that mechanism operating well for one
thing it's it's not it's by no means
uniform I mean there is openness in the
media in fact they're a lot more free
and open than they were thirty years ago
just as a result of the popular activism
of the years which is has changed the
culture so it's more open culture and
get more open media and there are plenty
of journalists including some who are
very distinguished and well-known who
wouldn't describe the media in terms any
different from what I did except that
they wouldn't do it publicly because
they would have a job very long but
they'll do it privately there are plenty
of people working in the media who in
fact some of the most prominent
investigative reporters and others who
essentially try to play the system they
see how far they can go they look for
openings and so on and they're just
plenty of people with real professional
integrity you just do very honest and
accurate reporting and sometimes get it
through and sometimes they get stepped
on and so on but for the most part I
think what you say is correct for the
most part itself delusion so say to pick
someone like for example Tom wicker
who's it was the leading liberal
commentator in The New York Times for
many years
he was he was really upset when people
said that he was supporting power he
said look I write anything I like nobody
ever tells me what to write sure and
that's true because if he hadn't
internalized the values of power he
would not be allowed to write but once
he has internalized them and he's shown
that he's going to say the right things
it's absolutely true that no one will
ever tell him what the right you'll
never get out of line it's inside like
we're well said now what about some of
the examples the the more horrendous
shall we say examples of the of the
reactionary role of the media resulting
in vast omissions and censorships I'm
thinking for instance if I'm not
mistaken please correct me of the
Holocaust itself that when when the
media coverage which as it was then
radio and print of the Holocaust is
examined that that it was it was a
non-story and so forth is that true and
what other examples are there Avast true
and that's a horrible example but I
don't think it's a very telling example
mm-hmm for one thing I should say it was
all there there have been reviewed
studies in Hebrew of the Hebrews at that
time and it's not so different in what
is now Israel it was in Palestine it was
kind of downplayed and they it wasn't
you know and put off a long time in fact
when you read the reports from 1942 and
so on and the Hebrew press it's pretty
appalling the and there are many reasons
for at the Holocaust first of all you
know it was a maybe the most horrifying
single event in history but it
nevertheless was covered by the fact
that it was during a war there was a war
going on and everyone was focused on
that now you can say and in fact
correctly that the you know refusal to
pay give this appropriate attention was
grotesque nevertheless it can be I don't
think it's a case of private power let's
say having an influence the fact is also
that the governments didn't pay any
attention I mean for example how many
refugees came to the United States well
you know the US government wouldn't
allow them in they could have gotten
refugees there's a book published in
Canada one is too many about the number
of Jewish refugees allowed into Canada
that period actually more
proportionately Canada Canada in the
United and in fact the most interesting
story about this in my opinion is after
the war
I mean during the war you can make all
kind of reasons and excuses you know
fighting a war but from 1945 no one was
fighting a war Jews were still dying and
deep beacons in fact that not a very
different rate from under the Nazis they
weren't being thrown into gas chambers
but the conditions were such that the
death rate was high the conditions were
awful and so on simply ask yourself how
many of them came to the United States
suppose they'd had a choice where do you
think they would wanted to go on this
shift asked they didn't come to the
United States and they didn't come to
the United States for several reasons
one of them being that the American
Jewish community didn't didn't Lobby to
get them in except with except for one
sector the anti-zionist sector of the
American Jewish community the was in the
Council for Judaism they lobby for
Jewish immigration from Europe to the
United States but the organized part in
particular of the Zionist movement did
not for several reasons one being that
they didn't want them here in the United
States and the second reason is they
wanted them to be essentially compelled
to go to Palestine
you know what was becoming Israel this
is not a pretty story and there we're
not told very much but that's the most
striking story in my opinion during the
war you can make arguments after the war
the ending anyway and was there not a
concomitant story that at that very same
time Nazi war criminals were being
welcomed into the United States to work
on the NASA and so on not just that I
mean you know the SS guards from Latvia
Krupp they're probably more SS troopers
from you know Nazi sympathizers from
Eastern Europe then there were Jews from
DP camps because they were being given
priority they were in what we called
captive nations you know they were taken
over by the Russians and therefore for
just plain Cold War reasons priority was
given to these captive nations people of
whom a substantial number were you know
maybe not concentration camp guards but
men although some were but just you know
pro-nazi elements
that there's some good historical work
on this but some Jewish historian
Leonard dinner Stein is one now this
brings us to perhaps the last example we
could we could deal with in in this
conversation this particular
conversation and that is the Cold War
and there were preparations for the Cold
War the Cold War was carried on or cold
war one and cold war two can you comment
on the media's role in the reflection
and the perpetuation and promotion of
the Cold War
well overwhelmingly the media it's a
little unfair to talk about the media
because it's true of the intellectual
community in general the meteor just
wasn't visible part of it but just
keeping the media the they almost
uncritically accepted the framework of
cold war propaganda which is in my view
very distorted I don't think the Cold
War has been an act I think it'll be a
long time before we come to look at what
the Cold War is what it actually was
fact of the matter is the cold as the
better diplomatic historians have
pointed out the Cold War began in 1917
if you read say George Kennan who aside
from being a major policymakers also a
diplomatic historian history historian
of soviet-american relations his big
study of Soviet American relations says
that the main work that he says that the
breach between the west and he and the
Russians you know the Bolsheviks the
final breach he said occurred in January
1918 when the Bolsheviks offended our
sensibilities by disbanding the
Constituent Assembly that he said caused
the breach with an element of finality
and evers because we couldn't tolerate
that with our love for democracy
incidentally a couple of months later
the Marines in Haiti disbanded the
Parliament by force because they refused
to approve a part of a constitution
written by the u.s. occupiers which gave
American corporations the right to
purchase Haitian lands so therefore the
Marines went in and as Marine General
Smedley Butler put it disbursed them by
genuine Marine Corps methods and then
the Marines ran their own referendum in
which they got something like ninety
nine point ninety eight percent of the
vote with 5% of the population
participating and that didn't offend
anyone's sensibilities but when the
bolsheviks disbanded the Constituent
Assembly cannon rights this was just you
know Wilson and the British and so on
were just horrified and that's when the
Cold War started well apart from the
obvious fraudulent or the reasons as
this single example demonstrates he's
right in the dating it was Eastern
Europe was part of the third world
Russia was a third world country in
effect and it had been for hundreds of
years and no part of the third world is
allowed to strike an independent course
doesn't matter whether it's a you know a
little speck in the Caribbean like
Grenada or a six of the world and that's
when the cold were started and it sort
of went on from there
now this framework is very important to
understand otherwise you can't
understand anything that's happening now
as they're being driven back to
essentially a third-world status but the
media and the intellectual community
have yet to even face these facts here
is where we'll have to conclude this and
and it's it's so telling that that you
referred to Haiti because now we'll turn
if we main on to indeed Haiti
first and and then the Middle East for
about thirteen minutes and I wonder
maybe and we'll have to forget what you
just said because that'll be another
program in another month but I shouldn't
say we forget it I mean we we could
bring back that history because which is
exactly what I was hoping you would do
is look at the history of American
involvement in Haiti and up through the
present day and then that relate that to
the media coverage of Haiti historically
and to the present day would it be good
to lead off with I I think with them
with this clip okay I think well I think
that's how we'll do it
so I'm going to talking to the people
behind the glass now asked if we might
start off with me looking at Julie's
camera again and then do our next
conversation
mm-hmm okay
and we went way over finally didn't I
of course I'm if there if there's
anything goes wrong here I'm responsible
and whatever credit there is goes right
me to you so I just position okay I need
to just think for a moment I just need
to think for a moment
okay
Noam Chomsky has followed the history of
Haiti for a long time back to connecting
it to the origins of the Cold War
believe it or not no um we have a little
audio clip here that I'd like to play
for us and it is from a documentary on
CBC and it and it involves the Haitian
elite if we just listen to this for 30
seconds and I appreciate your comment on
it well what what he says is exactly
correct but I think we speaking as a
Haitian we should speak as Westerners
and look at ourselves the way he looks
at Haiti and it's true that the ruling
class that he's talking about are one of
the most grotesque in the world and they
look at the Haitians as animals but it's
worth remembering that well just to take
the when Woodrow Wilson's Marines
invaded Haiti of the racism of the
American invaders shocked the Asians
that was or that was 1915 when they
stayed there until 1934 and they left
the country a total wreck and under the
rule of the National Guard which is
still running and they and also a
plantation for American corporations but
what one of the biggest impacts of the
American invasion on Haiti was the
extraordinary racism they regarded all
Haitians as animals not just the
ordinary Haitians the and it's it wasn't
just the you know the look the soldiers
who were most
extort entirely races including the
officers but because all the way up to
the top leadership - I mean FDR Franklin
Roosevelt who was an assistant secretary
the Navy was still calling racist jokes
about Haitians in the 30s Woodrow
Wilson's secretaries of state Bryan and
Lansing were vicious racists Lansing
said well you know Haitians are Africans
they just have no capacity for
self-government it's just you know
irredeemable Brian was famous for his
discovery that they spoke French and he
said dear me nigger speaking French
isn't that funny you know and in
particular was the educated Haitians the
ones who had what many of them who were
very educated and cultivated who
inspired the worst racist outbursts on
the part of the American invaders who
were muscling louts you know and and of
the the impact of this on Haiti was
extraordinary I mean it was a racist
society it had been for hundreds of
years they had you know like a hundred
and thirty different gradations of color
and to be in the right place that was
connected with French origins and all
sorts of stuff but all of this was
exaggerated by the extreme racism of the
American invaders and it had a big
impact on what followed quite apart from
that the Americans restorative will this
is Woodrow Wilson the great believer in
self-determination they restored virtual
slavery they carried out a
counterinsurgency war in which they
killed thousands of patients according
to Haitian historians maybe fifteen
thousand people or so died maybe more
the as I mentioned before they destroyed
the parliamentary system because they
refused to ratify a u.s. written
constitution the crucial issue was
alienation of land the Haitian
Constitution didn't permit foreigners to
buy up the lands and this was considered
illiberal by the Americans because it's
liberal for Western corporations to be
able to buy the land so they simply
rammed down their throats
a US written constitution actually
Franklin Roosevelt took credit for
writing it though probably falsely
because he himself wanted to buy
plantations there it ended up with
they'd ended up with the country being
actually a us own plantation exactly the
same thing happened in the Dominican
Republic next door on the same years
also under an invasion American invasion
in both countries when the u.s. left
they left it with new armies for the
first time in Haiti had not been a
pleasant place but now they had an army
specifically created to control the
population that's the National Guard and
those are the killers of the last year's
however US relations with Haiti don't
start in 1915 they start in 1791 when
the this is the first foreign relations
of the United States right after its own
revolution Haiti had a slave revolution
and that terrified the West the United
States had one of the worst reactions to
it in fact when these Haiti was in fact
the first free country in the Western
Hemisphere the US had a revolution but
it was a slave Society and Haiti was a
free society not a pretty one by any
means but it was technically free and
that caused horror in the United States
all of Europe including had a for a
crushed Haiti in order to get rid of
this horror of slaves revolting and
freeing themselves in what was at that
time remember the richest colony in the
world it's not like it is today that was
one of the richest parts of the world
it's the source of much of the wealth of
France in fact and Western Europe all
together but for 60 years the u.s.
refused to recognize it and kept it
under very harsh conditions
afterwards Haiti just became a plaything
for imperial powers finally the u.s.
ended up being dominant by the early
19th 20th century then the u.s. invaded
ran the place for 20 years left at a
pretty total wreck the u.s. supported a
dictatorship during the last ten earth
from about 1970 on US aid was pouring in
there to try to turn Haiti into an
export platform using super cheap labor
highly exploited labor or big surplus
because people are driven off the land
by you
agra agra agra exports and so on and
that's what created the mats the person
that was talking before they came out of
the system the these tiny elite they're
part of the system i mean you know it
has roots and haitians so i'm not
suggesting was all imposed from the
outside as plenty of roots a nation
society but it was exaggerated and made
much worse and much more disgraceful by
the long in fact two centuries impact of
the west this is after hundreds of years
of i'm you really go back when coke
katie is the first place where Columbus
landed and what he found was a society
that place that he regard as a paradise
I had may have been the richest part of
the world and maybe the most populous
part of the world and very peaceful in
fact they were so peaceful he thought
they'll make perfect slaves I'll never
resist this well within a couple of
decades they had wiped out the
population literally wiped it out then
they brought in slaves who were treated
absolutely viciously you look back at
the records of French slavery I mean
it's mind-boggling finally there was a
slave revolt and then came the history I
described so we have five hundred years
of history here and it's not a pretty
one though it's one of the I mean Haiti
itself is almost like a parable of
Western imperialism I mean what would
rather like Bango which the British when
they got there also regarded as a
paradise a Haiti and Bengal are now you
know Bangladesh are the singles of
despair and that's after five hundred
years of European robbery and tutelage I
mean Haiti may disappear in another
couple of decades there this is this
rich super-rich center of the world you
know which was literally one of the
richest places in the 18th century being
robbed blind by the West may turn into a
desert in a few years and that's not
because of Haitians know what you've
just said I imagine would come as a
revelation to a tremendous number of
people because you have drawn the
historical picture would you relate this
to media coverage past present and
future well there actually are studies
of the media in the early part of the
century during the Wilson invasion and
they simply supported it totally I'm in
a liberation of Haiti I mean it was just
grotesque
but let's turn to the current period
the US was turning Haiti into what the
line was they're gonna turn Haiti into
the Taiwan of the Caribbean what they
actually did was turn it into an export
platform where you have women working in
factories for 10 cents an hour making
baseballs digging putting their hands
into toxic substances so that the
American manufacturers can advertise how
well they're bonded and so on if they
die after a couple of years there's
plenty more wages went down about half
during this period in the eighties when
it was being turned into a miracle now
this would not how was this reported if
it was recorded as an economic miracle
yeah
then everything was working fine lots of
profits not only for the mevs family and
a couple of others in Haiti of that
elite but for plenty of Western
manufacturers US aid money is pouring in
there and to create this monstrosity
then you know a lot of things happen but
they finally allowed a free election in
1990 now everyone thought that it was
going to be a walk away for the US
candidate the US had a candidate mark
busines World Bank official and he had
all the resources and all the wealth and
so on they figured of course it'll walk
away so it's safe they have a free
election well nobody was paying
attention to what was going on in Haiti
I mean who looks at the slums you know
who bothers looking at the pet it's a
peasant society who goes up and looks at
the peasant community what was going on
there was a that a very vibrant and
lively civil society had been created
the basis for real democracy had been
created the kind of democracy that
nobody in the United States even
understands and Jefferson would have
understood it but we've forgotten they
had a they had grassroots movements and
activism and populism and nobody paid
any attention press coverage that you
recall of that nobody even who looks you
know does anybody look at the slums
I mean nobody even looked the when the
election took place it was a shock a
populist figure a Liberation Theology
one on the on a wave of a popular
movement and a lively vibrant popular
movement well the u.s. moved at once to
try to undermine I'm the only question
that should have been
anybody's mind is how's the United
States gonna get rid of them because
that kind of figure and that kind of a
movement is not permitted in u.s.
domains if people know that they really
are ignorant of modern history so the
question is how they're gonna get rid of
the US moved at once to try to undermine
it you aid stopped except for the
business community so aid for investment
stopped the only aid that went in was to
support the business community against
our esteem there's an Orwellian
organization called the National
Endowment for democracy and anyone who
reads or will know what it is bipartisan
organization which is an attempt to
create top-down type democracy you know
the kind of democracy which is in the
hands of a Lietz in which people are
kicked around they moved in and they
created counter organizations to to rst
very surprisingly it's exactly those
organizations that survived the coup and
then became the functioning organization
something which no one seems to have
noticed but the idea was to try to
undermine RSD know this he was in for
seven months and that's a period of
history which has now been wiped out of
history the store official story is he
was a you know mad theologian
impractical and so on facts are quite
different
he was extremely successful he cut down
narco-trafficking cut down a bureaucracy
eliminated the deficit he was beginning
create jobs in fact he's so impressed
the international lending community like
the inter-american Development Bank and
the World Bank and so on nothing big
radicals but they were offering in
support in fact leaked State Department
reports described they're surprised at
his success in taking this basket case
and starting to turn it into a working
Society that's all eliminated when you
read the reports today it's well you
know he wasn't a good politics way to
teach him and so on finally he was
overthrown in a coup whether the US was
involved or not nobody knows there's
been anyway they certainly supported it
there was theoretically an embargo but
surely theoretically the u.s. leads the
way other countries don't do anything if
the US doesn't lead the way and the u.s.
made it very clear that they didn't want
to take that embargo seriously in fact
within a few weeks
George Bush had announced what he called
an exception namely US manufacturing
firms were allowed to violate the
embargo well if you take a look at US
trade figures with Haiti during the
following year they're not that far
below the normal it would take about
three minutes for any journal to
discover that the same way I did namely
called the Commerce Department I has
never been published under the FERC
Clinton's first year the trade went off
by 50% including a huge increase in food
exports from the starving Island so
Fritz Malthus tells you how sad is about
the starving people yeah they were
exporting food to the United States
under Clinton the federal government
u.s. federal government was purchasing
stuff that Baseball's and things that
were produced in these Haitian factories
under the embargo now actually I'll just
end with this right the the bigger the
US intervention to the the military
cedrus and Francois and so on they were
in effect told look you got a couple of
years to murder people to kill the
leaders of the popular movements to
destroy them and decimate them and when
you're done with you and there won't be
much of an embargo during this period so
don't worry about it you'll be fine and
when the job is done you'll be sent off
but very happy
you know you'll be wealthy left plenty
of money will take care of you that's
exactly what happened I mean I don't
know if they were told in those words
but it was obvious that that was what
was going on and in fact that's
precisely what's happened that's called
restoring democracy
okay the job is done the popular
movements are decimated the leadership
has killed off people are intimidated or
so it's hoped now the soldiers go in and
what they're restoring our esteem
technically purely technically I should
say that the day of the intervention it
was a Monday if you remember the day
before that Jimmy Carter was in Haiti
having dinner with president with
general Sid dress and telling us oh what
a nice man he was and so on and so forth
the leading killer the biggest story of
the intervention broke that day and it
has as of now yet to be reported in the
mainstream in the United States is a
couple of weeks it was on every AP it
was on the AP wires which means that
every journalist found that out exactly
the way I did
monitoring the AP wires every news desk
knows then on Sunday the day before the
intervention Associated Press ran a
major story on which they then repeated
on a leak from the Justice Department
concerning the way in which oil had been
sent to Haiti the oils the main thing in
the embargo and everybody was watching
he knew that oil was getting in well how
is it working
turns out that it was being done with
the approval of the US government at the
highest level the cabinet level that is
Texaco corporation in particular was
informed was given a cease and desist
order because there was a presidential
directive under Bush so they were told
stop sending oil cease and desist but
they were also informed that there would
be no prosecution and they then proposed
to the Justice Department some cannery
by which they would do it and we're told
well that's illegal but we're not gonna
prosecute it and that went on under
Clinton as well so in fact there was no
embargo that's the the biggest story of
the day should have been there never
were any sanctions and I never heard
that story well okay but it's on the AP
wires it's not a secret was I yeah and I
knew it right away
and I don't have more resources in The
New York Times so globin now you know
the I mean it'll certainly leak out
sooner or later because it's just in
fact in small papers like you know ones
which don't really control the news
properly it came out a couple of days
later but in the mainstream it's been
kept out but that's just a piece of it
all of this means if we put it together
that while our stayed was in power he
was remarkably successful and the u.s.
tried to undermine him after the coup of
the u.s. backed off from sanctions there
were no sanctions effectively no
sanctions except against the poor they
were directed against the poor but the
mill at the narco-trafficking went on
the military enriched themselves the
mevs family fritz mezes family were
constructing a big oil refiner in haiti
under the embargo what for well you know
dentistry discovered
then our state is now put in but under
very strict conditions there's a reason
why Fritz moves is distributing tens of
thousands of pictures of our estate all
around port-au-prince because he
conceives he says considers that our
estate has become more mature
while he's in Washington in other words
he's learned that his job is to sort of
shine Whitey's shoes you know at least
so he hopes so he's now more mature he's
become what the press calls pragmatic
mm-hmm any follow orders the orders are
in a world and a program an economic
program that was forced upon the Haitian
government the our state government the
way it's described as he presented the
program to the Paris donors Club yeah he
presented so it's a World Bank program
in effect and it's the standard
structural adjustment package anyone
knows about these things and those what
that means if you read it it has some
nice rhetoric but the crucial line is
goes toward like this it says the
renovated government of Haiti
will focus on civil society particularly
the private sector domestic and foreign
so that means foreign investors are the
central part of Haitian civil society
and that's where the resources will go
now this economic plan is yet to be
reported it's reported by a very good
reporter Allan Nairn who's a freelance
reporter and multinational monitor which
is a marginal journal this was in August
has yet to hit the press unfortunately
unfortunately we'll have to conclude
here there's more than more than a
Horror Story they're known that that's
that's but we will have to turn to two
other if not equally important equally
serious questions and and we will now
we'll turn the Middle East next and
because we elected to to really turn
over all of this this Monday's program
to Haiti then we'll I'll ask for
countdown into let's say four minutes on
we'll try to go through what seven
subjects each or something like that you
just warned me I'm talking too long cuz
I mean I tend to go on too well look III
don't I didn't I I mean I could just
listen and listen
well the stuff starts coming out but I
will indeed and I would have to be
talking to people behind the glass if
with each of these briefer conversations
if I should start off as it were looking
into Julie's camera that's what they
want
sure okay so I know the Middle East is
the first one so it'll be the Middle
East and then they owe the 500 channel
universe in four minutes that'll be a
trick so I guess that actually we're
we're ready Noam Chomsky has followed
among many other areas of the world the
Middle East with great care and now I'm
going to start again
Noam Chomsky yeah
we're gonna give you ten minutes for
movies oh oh okay
ten mil exert and and when will we get a
three two and one ten minutes on the
Middle East three two and one right then
we'll really speed through the others
Noam Chomsky is recognized as one of the
foremost experts on the Middle East and
media coverage of the Middle East norm
it's been my observation that for a long
time there were nonviolent peace efforts
in the Middle East which I think we're
very much marginalized by the media
using that as a starting point
how would you characterize media
coverage of the Middle East I suspect
I'm now talking about the United States
primarily because it's somewhat
different than other countries in the
United States the media coverage in the
Middle East is the absolutely the pits
it's the worst of any story I've ever
looked at and the reason is because
although usually the press is
subordinated the one state in this case
I believe ordinated - two states one of
them the United States and the other its
major client since ninety since 1967 it
was different before but since 1967 the
civility and that's the only proper word
to it for it has been both to the United
States and its client state the civility
of the media of the media overwhelmingly
I mean to the extent that most of
history has just been written out of the
record
so take the nonviolent initiatives
actually the most important nonviolent
initiatives are diplomacy and there is a
diplomatic record that you wouldn't know
it from reading the media the diplomatic
record includes crucial events which
have simply been written out of history
well for example in February 1971
President Sadat of Egypt accepted a full
peace agreement with Israel for peace
agreement recognition everything almost
precisely in accord with official US
policy all right that caused little
turmoil in the United States they had to
decide whether to go along with Egypt
and separate from Israel or break with
their own official policy they picked
the latter under Henry Kissinger's
influence the we know all about this
there's no
buuuut about the facts under Kissinger's
influence the u.s. just abandoned its
policy and moved over to Israel's policy
which was no withdrawal Kissinger called
it stalemate
all right so that's initiative is out of
history the standard line even in
scholarship is that until his dramatic
visit to Jerusalem in 1977 no Arab
leader including Sadat was ever willing
to consider peace with Israel just the
total flat lie
I mean journals like say Newsweek will
not even accept letters small three line
letters referring to this fact though
they concede privately that they in fact
even published it when it happened so
that's out of history that's one
diplomatic effort but that's what led to
the 73 war I mean so that made it very
clear that if the US was going to block
all diplomatic initiatives he had no
choice but war Washington was worn by
ambassadors by oil companies and so on
but Kissinger was so dense he couldn't
understand it not the only case and
finally there was a war and it finally
broke through the clouds that you got to
do something
all right now then in let's go on to the
diplomatic record in January 1976 the
Security Council debated a resolution
which was brought by the Arab Conference
citation States by Syria Jordan and
Egypt and backed by the PLO and publicly
backed by the Soviet Union by Europe by
the non-aligned countries in fact by the
whole world just about calling for
essentially a two-state settlement all
right that would have ended it had all
the wording of UN 242 you know
recognizing the territorial integrity
and the existence and so on of all
states in the region all of that was in
there but it called for a Palestinian
state in the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip
well Israel was violently opposed and
the u.s. vetoed it at the Security
Council no this was reported at the time
you go back and you look at the New York
Times at the time you say yeah I was
there but it's out of history the u.s.
veto at another Security Council
resolution in 1980 of the same kind
through the late 70s in the early 80s
there were all kinds of diplomatic
initiative
coming from everywhere including the PLO
like Yasser Arafat was calling for
negotiations with Israel leading the
mutual recognition
the New York Times refused to publish it
they refused to publish letters to the
editor referring to it in fact sometimes
friend of mine is a professor in a
Midwestern university actually got a
letter back once from the foreign editor
the New York Times saying we're not
going to publish your letter on this
because this is not to be said basically
it's out of history all of this time the
media the typical phrase is it not so in
dispatches would be this mysterious
elusiveness of peace in the Middle East
because the United States was blocking
it for 20 years the United States is
leading the rejection front and blocking
every diplomatic initiative and it's not
a secret the Security Council vetoes are
clear our thoughts initiatives are clear
they're explicit the General Assembly of
you know you can't veto anything in the
General Assembly so there was a vote
every year in their winter session and I
would always around like a hundred and
fifty to two or something not sometimes
a you know hundred four fifty one two
three once the United States picked up
Dominica it was the United States Israel
and maybe one or another client State
against the world out of history you
know in fact that continued until
December 1990 and the reason it stopped
at that point is that the world
essentially conceded the region to the
United States said okay you run it this
was after the Gulf War the Gulf War
essentially established that the US was
going to run that region by force the
world backed off the Madrid conference
started under unilateral US control and
that's called the peace process because
the u.s. was running unilaterally and
the world was out of the picture and the
u.s. ran it on its own terms its own
terms are no withdrawal except where
Israel and the United States decide in
opposition to the rest of the world and
nothing for the Palestinians those are
the two u.s. positions they are in the
Madrid conference in 1991 and right up
to the Oslo agreements so that's called
the peace process now it's interesting
that US power is so extraordinary in
today
world that most of the West has now
internalized the u.s. position so for
example I think most of Europe has
probably forgotten what their own
position was three years ago it was very
intriguing that Norway brokered this
agreement the reason for that was in
fact described in the Israeli press the
Clinton administration has broken all
records and service to Israel in fact it
shocks the Israelis there to the right
of the Israeli government to the hawkish
side of the Israeli government and they
probably figured that if they wanted to
preserve any credibility within the Arab
world they better not do it through the
Clinton administration because that's
like doing it through their own extreme
right-wing
so they therefore got Norway to broker
the agreement and it's interesting that
Norway I was willing and without second
thought to broker what in fact was the
u.s. rejectionist position nothing for
the Palestinians and no withdrawal would
would you risk would you venture any
kind of prediction just in the short
term about the the middle this Middle
East situation extrapolate it and and
how the media will probably deal with
that I think it's you know unfortunately
very predictable
the US has gotten its way there is a
settlement in which the Palestinians are
marginalized Israel has all if you look
back to the Israeli positions it's about
1968 it's been pretty uniform across
this political spectrum from right to
left the idea is that Palestinians must
not have any national rights that's
point one so totally rejection is
however Israel and Israel should take
what it wants in the occupied
territories what it wants is the usable
land big area around Jerusalem you know
the resource the resources of both the
Gaza Strip and the West Bank the Jordan
Valley are they want to canonize the
region so you get little Bantu stands
but they don't want to have to
administer the local population they
want them to somebody else to be
responsible for them so Israel doesn't
want to have to run Tablas let's say
they'd like some what somebody else
Jordan
because they don't want the
responsibility so that's been the
proposal it was first called the alone
plan the Sharon plan is not very
different the the current plan is
exactly that and that's going to be
implemented the exactly as the Israeli
press says an Israeli commentators say
they will move from in their words
colonialism to neo colonialism that's
the phrase and it's accurate these
regions will be under Israeli
subordination much the way Haiti is
under us subordination and the press
will describe that as peace in fact they
win the Nobel they just are winning the
Nobel Prize for it now where would you
suggest that our viewers could turn to
gain the kind of facts and the kind of
interpretation that inform your
understanding of the middle of the best
place to turn is the Hebrew press in
Israel mm-hmm
so for example of actually close friend
of mine who's a professor at the Hebrew
University at the Tel Aviv University
Tonia Reinhardt I wrote to just to pick
one of a thousand examples an article
recently in which he pointed out quite
accurately that the current peace
settlement shouldn't has a it hasn't an
analogy to South Africa but not the
usual one it's not like the end of
apartheid it's like the beginning of
apartheid she pointed out that the
current peace agreement is very similar
to what the ultra-right nationalist
government in South Africa instituted in
the 1950s namely the apartheid system
including Baptist and a little Bantu
stands which were recognized as states
by South African racists and some of
their friends abroad but not by anyone
else and she said that we are now in the
stage where we're instituting South
African apartheid in the style of the
1950s this is incidentally in the major
Israeli journal arts you know it's not
like the New York Times and in fact like
I write articles there you know there's
these journals are open and they're the
discussion is quite open and
incidentally a lot of this materials
available in English there's Israel
Shaka who's a professor former professor
deeper university and indeed a Holocaust
survivor is translates and circulates
material translations from the Hebrew
which are very illuminating you want to
know what's going on that set of
translations is a thousand tons better
than anything you read in the West well
regrettably then as we close this it
appears that there is not the basis for
lasting just peace in the Middle East
not so easy not just and so we'd better
inform ourselves better than ever thank
you
III I was thinking that some sort of a
more or less formalized conclusion was
in order was I right yeah okay so now
the and and by the way I guess III
clearly see your three on your two and
your one Julie thanks and then you do
this that yeah but then I'm actually not
clear would you then give a faster rap
and and maybe just some sort of a signal
that might our time has in fact run out
especially since now we're going to try
to do the rest in three minutes each
yeah or two because because we and also
someone should call a cab and make sure
the cab is absolutely cut you off yeah
they're two to two we're going after
actually two minutes each okay
to Noam Chomsky I believe invented the
phrase intellectual self defense no what
do you mean by that I mean but the
standard attitude that anyone in the
sciences takes towards their work namely
you look at everything skeptically
somebody comes along with the result
that looks interesting you ask yourself
well is it really true and if you look
at it the right way can I could there be
some other evidence that he overlooked
I'll do it a different way and so on
that's if you don't understand that you
can't work in the sciences I'm gonna
happen to teach in a scientific
university this is just second nature
you know well that's the attitude that
people should take towards things that
really matter in life you read something
in the newspapers there's a peace
process in the Middle East that we're
restoring democracy in Haiti first
question any sensible person should ask
is well I mean is there a power interest
that would want things to be looked at
that way answer well obviously yes does
that infect the coverage will all
investigate and of course you find out
very quickly yes and then you say well
what am I not what are they not telling
what wouldn't they want me to know what
wouldn't they want me to think okay I'll
look for that I mean you know these are
this ought to be second nature to
everyone and then in some small areas
like say the science is it is second
nature in fact there wouldn't be any
sciences otherwise in areas that matter
to human life there has been a huge
effort to drive that out of people's
heads and it's taken centuries literally
you've read the working-class press in
the 19th century which was very lively
and independent than done by
working-class women and men a lot of
women incidentally who were editing
newspapers and so on it raised all these
questions all the time I mean it it's
taken a century of indoctrination to
drive out of people's heads the idea
that you should think now someone is
added to your phrase and said we also
need in light of the entertainment media
emotional self-defense
how would you respond to that well very
much so because actually my own work is
kind of misleading in this respect I
focus mostly on that sector of the
intellectual culture and the media
that's directed to the educated sector
the population but probably 90% of the
propaganda is something else
it's just intended and divert people to
get them away from things to turn their
brains into mush you know they could
just keep them away from the public
arena so we can run it in peace that's
what almost all the media are and I
don't personally write about that partly
because I don't know much about it but
yeah that's so you need the kind of self
defense which says look they want you to
focus on the EO Jay Simpson car chase
why because there's other things going
on they're important that you might do
something about you better not think
about them you better look at the
cartridge supreme distraction yeah
that's very interesting
yeah or are you giving him science too i
yeah that was good noticed I didn't see
her in my peripheral vision but yeah no
that was good I think we should do that
yeah okay then we're ready for the next
one
disinformation is a phrase for outright
lies complete fabrications in the media
Noam Chomsky can you give us one example
of disinformation today well everything
we've been talking about is
disinformation if the the Nobel Prize is
coming for three people who brought
peace that's disinformation what they
brought is traditional u.s. rejection
ISM after 20 years of blocking peace the
u.s. supposed to be restoring democracy
in Haiti
that's disinformation what the US is
doing is undermining the possibilities
of popular democracy in Haiti and we can
go down the list and incidentally this
disinformation is with the collusion of
the media if you actually pay attention
you can see it happening though let me
just give you one personal incident I
happen to be in Laos I had at a time
when virtually the whole Western press
court was there because Richard Nixon
had just made a speech saying there was
a North Vietnamese invasion sort of I
flew in and are very excited every
journal the journalist allows a very
easy place to follow the news because
all the journalists are in the same
hotel there's actually two hotels in
this cow
town and the richer one is where most of
the journalists were especially the
fancy ones so they're all sitting around
the bar laughing about Nixon's speech
because they all know it's a total lie
in fact they had just had a briefing
from the US military attache who hadn't
heard the speech yet and he told them
didn't say anything about it so they all
know it's a total lie they're telling
jokes about it and drinking and so on
you take a look at the next day's paper
they all reported the North Vietnamese
invasion of Laos well you can say
disinformation if you like but it's a
funny use of the word and this happens
all the time and any working journalist
can tell you then how about how about
such as the reports that we're reading
now that secret KGB files are being
unearthed in the Soviet Union and they
say all sorts of strange things actually
the most interesting I mean there are a
lot of people here working like hawks on
those files trying to find some support
for US Western propaganda over the years
and what's been dramatic is how little
they've been able to find almost nothing
has come out so take all the big stories
you know like the Russians are trying to
assassinate the Pope or you know that
kind of stuff well it's interesting that
nothing is coming along and it's not
that people aren't looking I mean they
they're dedicating enormous efforts to
try to find any scrap of information
that can buttress traditional cold war
propaganda and to this strikingly very
virtually nothing has come out but who's
not doing do not CIA operatives actually
create fictional documents there were
those famous yeah there's a lot of
fakery but you know and it does exist I
mean actual intelligence fakery does
exist but in my opinion its own sort of
a marginal phenomenon first of all it's
easily penetrated alright and secondly
the worst part is the kind of thing I've
just described
it's the willing collusion with power or
even worse than that the internalization
of values that doesn't make that it that
prevents you from seeing that you're
colluding with power
in other words self-censorship thank you
on that
if
anytime no I'm Tom ski the world's
leading media critic refers a lot to
print know'm I was at a talk recently
and one of Canada's leading media
critics of man named Jeff Bevere told
the audience he said I understand Noam
Chomsky does not watch television and
then he went on to say I also understand
he only watches one movie a year and
then he said I'd love to know what that
movie is and everybody laughed is it
true you don't watch television
is it true you just see one movie a year
and if that's true what is it well
probably not literally true but it's
sort of more or less in the ballpark I
watch I do watch television news you
know occasionally we'll watch a
television program you know such as
mm-hm
something diverting you know northern
exposure or you know I don't know
something or other
but you know tired at night but not very
often I was for movies you know like to
be able to this is not time no so what's
the last movie you saw and why did you
go to it you answer gotta answer my son
was visiting us and overcome all about
six months ago and he told us we should
go to a movie and we said well what's
the only movie playing at the local you
know collection of movies and it turned
out to be Forrest Gump
oh yeah so we went in so far as gum
before that I actually enjoyed it was a
movie called sale which I like to sail
and it had marvelous sailing scenes it
was I think about the America's Cup
unfortunately they interspersed they
figured they had to have a story so they
had a story line which was so idiotic it
was embarrassing but if you kind of
turned off during the storyline and just
watched the sailing scenes it was really
terrific so that one I like that's
typical Dom photography you want
concentrated sailing never mind the
story line thanks very much thanks very
much
thank you it's called wind I think oh oh
that's too that's too late now we have
to fly like the wind ourselves
