Noam Chomsky has made two international
reputations in unrelated or apparently
unrelated fields the widest is as one of
the national leaders of American
resistance to the Vietnam War the
deepest is as a professor of linguistics
who before he was 40 years old had
transformed the nature of his subject
he's something of a joker in the pack as
far as philosophy is concerned many
professional philosophers would insist
quite sincerely that he isn't a
philosopher at all that linguistics is
simply a different discipline albeit
neighboring one well I'm not going to
argue about that it's little more than a
question of definition anyway the fact
is he was trained as a philosopher his
work has enormous implications for
philosophy and in the writings of
philosophers today i should say his name
probably occurs as often as that of any
living person the central point really
is this if one problem more than another
has dominated much of 20th century
philosophy it's that of the relationship
between language and the world
liechtenstein to give no more than a
single instance was in thrall to this
problem throughout his life well now
along comes the linguist Chomsky and
argues that the way we actually acquire
the use of language and therefore its
relationship to experience and therefore
its relationship to the world are
radically different from what the
anglo-saxon tradition in philosophy has
always maintained he passed he first put
his ideas forward in the late 1950s as
part of the critique of behavioral
psychology it's not too unfair to say
that the behavioral psychologists
attended to talk as if the human
individual came into the world as an
undifferentiated lump of malleable stuff
which was then molded and shaped by its
environment through processes of
stimulus and response they said penalty
and reward the reinforcement of
rewarding responses and the association
of ideas the individual developed to
learn including the learning
now Chomsky argued that this could not
possibly explain how virtually all human
beings regardless of their intelligence
do something as fantastically difficult
as master the use of a language even
when they're not deliberately taught it
as most people probably aren't and they
do this at such an extraordinary young
age and in such an extraordinary short
space of time he argued that for this to
happen at all we must be genetically
pre-programmed to do it and therefore
that all human languages must have in
common a basic structure that
corresponds to this pre-programming now
this also has some very important
negative implications the chief of these
is that anything that can't be
accommodated to this structure anything
so to speak that can't be caught in the
mesh of this particular network is
linguistically inexpressible and
unintelligible to us so the general
principles common to all languages set
vital limits to our capacity to
understand the world and communicate
with each other put like that it sounds
like a translation into linguistic terms
of some of the basic ideas of Immanuel
Kant and I must say that's always how it
looked to me but even if so it's Chomsky
was carried it out and no one else and
it's proved an enormously stimulating
and fruitful thing to do a professor
Chomsky one of the difficulties about
discussing your ideas is that in an
obvious sense they are hybrid in part
they're linguistics in part their
philosophy and in part their biology and
in fact you yourself first put them
forward in what was really a dispute
with biologists with with behavioral
psychologists how did you come to start
at that starting point well the reason
was the this picture of the nature of
language and the way in which language
is acquired was of such enormous
prevalence over quite a wide spectrum of
thought including not simply psychology
but but philosophy and the linguistics
as well the view that was dominant say
at the time when I was
2530 years ago the dominant picture of
language was that it is essentially a
system of habits are skills or
dispositions to act and that it is
acquired through extensive training over
training through repetition perhaps
through procedures of induction or
generalization or Association and that
one's knowledge one's system of the
system of habits that one developed
simply grows through accretion
incrementally as experience is subjected
to these processes of generalization and
analogy and in fact this this picture
which plainly is a factual assumption
was presented as if it were virtually an
a priori truth which it certainly is not
I mean it's obviously not necessary that
language is a system of that sort or
that it's acquired in anything like that
way one thing that you pointed out which
is in fact very obvious once it's
pointed out is that most people probably
aren't actually taught language at all
that is to say that most parents don't
give any systematic instruction of any
kind to their children yet the children
nevertheless learn well I would want to
even go beyond that I think it's
certainly the case that languages the
only the most marginal senses taught and
the teaching is in no sense of central
to the acquisition of language but in
another in a certain sense I think we
might even go on to say that language
isn't even learned at least if by
learning we mean any process that has
those characteristics that are generally
associated with learning for example the
press of the league the characteristics
that i mentioned it seems to me if we
want a reasonable metaphor we should
talk about growth language seems to me
to grow in the mind rather in the way
that familiar physical systems of the
body grow we begin our interchange with
the world with our mind in a certain
genetically determined state and through
an interaction with experience with an
environment this state changes until it
reaches a mature state which we call a
state of knowledge of language this
sequence of changes for
the genetically determined initial state
to the final state in which we really
have a quite complex system of mental
computations this series of changes
seems to me very much analogous to
growth of organs and in fact I think
it's not inappropriate to regard the
mind as a system of mental organs the
language faculty being one each of the
structure determined by para biological
endowment with interactions also
generally determined by the nature of
our biological endowment growing through
the triggering effect of experience
which shapes and articulates the organs
as they develop in the individual
through the relevant period of his life
so as I said it seems to me that not
only is it wrong to think of languages
being taught but it's at least very
misleading to think of it as being
learned if we carry with the notion
learning the associations that generally
go along with it in other words we are
pre-programmed to learn a language in
the same way as we are pre-programmed to
grow arms and legs and reach puberty in
our early teens and all sorts of other
sometimes delayed processes of growth
yes and reaching puberty is a good
example since that's a case of
biological development of auto genetic
development that's plainly
pre-programmed in essence but takes
place after birth and in fact we might
say that something that even death for
that matter is genetically determined
that is it's we are biologically
constructed so that at a certain time
our life processes stock but and in fact
the fact that some development takes
place after the organism has begun an
independent existence in the world has
nothing to say it tells us nothing about
whether it's a genetically determined
development or not now one thing that
follows from your view is that if if we
set out as you have done in the course
of your professional life to investigate
the language Faculty of human beings
then what you are investigating is as
much a biophysical system I mean
something that actually exists in matter
and stuff in human
as would be the case if you were
investigating human vision or human
digestion or the circulation of the
blood well I think that that's certainly
true in least we believe it to be true
in principle we are not at a stage now
where in the study of the neural basis
for higher cognitive processes where
it's possible to identify the physical
structures that are involved in these
operations correspondingly the actual
study of this organ remains of an
abstract level that is we can try to
investigate the principles by which it
functions but there's very little to say
right now about the ways in which these
principles are physically realized
instruct quite correspondingly one might
study the visual system let's say as was
done for a very long period knowing say
nothing about how it's physically how
the principles that we are led to
attribute to this system the let's say
analyzing mechanisms that we are led to
a tribute to the system knowing nothing
about how these may be physically
realized in our neural structures and I
think it's quite appropriate to think of
the contemporary study of language is
being analogous to a study of a vision
at a period when it's remained
impossible technically or through the
limitations of understanding technique
and so on it was impossible to determine
the actual physical elements that
entered into these systems which could
be studied only in an abstract fashion
there seems to be a special difficulty I
mean we accept the fact that I can't buy
introspection however hard I try say
observe the workings of my own liver I
can't observe it in the act of secreting
dial or whatever it does and similarly
presumably I can't observe these these
language formation faculties of mine at
work but nevertheless there is an
important difference because if we want
to if we want to investigate the
workings of the liver we couldn't
observe other people's I mean you can
bits of life peoples or the whole
peoples or animals livers you can
experiment with different inputs and see
what difference they make to the output
and so on and so forth but we can't do
that with animals as far as their
language using faculty is concerned
because they haven't got language using
faculties now doesn't that shut off from
us what is in fact the chief mode of
Investigation with all the other
biological faculties that we have it
does very definitely set out to stop a
very natural mode of Investigation that
is we are not for ethical reasons we do
not conduct intrusive experiments with
human beings so for example there are
very natural modes of Investigation that
suggest themselves at once suppose for
example I propose that language has some
general property and that every human
language must have this property as a
matter of biological necessity if we
were dealing with a defenseless organism
that we were allowed to study say the
way we study monkeys or cats what we
would do is employ the method of
concomitant variation that is that we
would design an artificial environment
let's say in which this principle was
violated and asked whether the system
develops in a normal way under those
conditions first to take one kids well
that we can't do in the case of humans
we can't design artificial contrived
environments and see what happens to an
infant in them just as we don't conduct
ablation experiments with humans and
this it's important to recognize that
this limitation imposes no raises no
philosophical issue it what it means is
that we have to be clever in the kind of
work we do because a number of modes of
inquiry are simply excluded they're
being as far as we know nothing
analogous to the language faculty in the
case of other organisms but that doesn't
mean that we can't study the problem we
have to study it more indirectly we
often can't directly move through the
experiments that would give us clear and
precise answers the questions that we
raised but if you think about the model
that I put forth that is that the model
of a of an organ beginning in a
genetically determined initial state and
growing
too immature state of knowledge then
it's obvious that that mature state of
knowledge will be determined by really
by two factors one the initial genetic
endowment and secondly the the impinging
experience so when and as far as the
final state of knowledge is concerned
what's called the grammar of the
language the system of rules and
principles that determines what is a
sentence and what it means and how it
sounds and so on that's as far as that
system is concerned we really can get
tremendous amounts of evidence in fact
every utterance that's produced is an
experiment if you like every reaction of
a person to an utterance is an
experiment so there's no shortage of
information concerning the mature state
of knowledge achieved if we can wait if
we can then discern in the mature state
of knowledge principles and properties
which are in no way presented in the
experience that is present that is
available it's very plausible to propose
those as properties attributable to the
initial state the main thing I want to
do in this discussion professor Chomsky
is go into the implications of your work
for philosophy I don't ago pursue you
into the nature of the work itself
because that's highly technical
obviously and it's not really feasible
to discuss it in a in a television
program of this kind let us now as it
were assume the truth of your theories
and start looking at the wider
implications of them because this I'm
sure is what will interest are our
audience most one consequence of your
theories is that we are as human beings
very very rigidly pre-programmed there
are certain things we can understand
certain things we can communicate and
anything that falls outside that we
simply can't is that so that's certainly
correct so I mean in a way this is a
rather alarming doctrine I mean it it
certainly contravenes the way we want to
feel about ourselves well I that may be
an immediate reaction but i think it's
it's not the correct reaction in fact
well it's true that our genetic program
rigidly constrains us I think the more
important point is that the existence of
that rich
of that rigid constraint is what
provides the basis for our freedom and
creativity and the reason she means any
because we have pre-programmed but we
can do all things are and exactly the
point is that if we really were plastic
organisms without an extensive
pre-programming then the state that our
mind achieves would in fact be a
reflection of the environment which
means it would be extraordinarily
impoverished fortunately for us we are
rigidly pre-programmed with extremely
rich systems that are part of our
biological endowment correspondingly a
small amount of relative degenerate
experience allows a kind of a great leap
into a rich cognitive system essentially
uniform in a community and in fact
roughly uniform ilysm which would have
developed over the compass evolutionary
ages through all the basic assembly
prevents the basic system itself
developed over long periods of
evolutionary development we don't know
how really but for the individual its
present as a result the individual is
capable of with a very small amount of
evidence of constructing an extremely
rich system which allows him to act in
the free and creative fashion which in
fact is normal for humans we can say
anything that we want over an infinite
range other people will understand us
though they've heard nothing like that
before we're able to do that precisely
because of that rigid programming but
short of that we would not be able to at
all what account are you able to give of
creativity if we are pre-programmed in
the way you say then how is creativity
impossibility for us well here I think
one has to be fairly careful I think we
can say a good deal about about the
nature of the system that is acquired
the state of knowledge that is attained
we can say a fair amount about the
biological that the basis leave the
bases in the initial state of the mind
for the acquisition of the system but
when we turn to a third question namely
how is the system used how are we able
to act creatively how can how do we
decide to how can we decide to say
things that are
new but not random that are appropriate
to occasions but not under the control
of stimuli when we ask these questions
we really enter into a realm of mystery
where human science least so far and
maybe in principle does not reach we can
say a fair amount about the principles
that make it possible for us to behave
in our normal creative fashion but as
soon as questions of will or decision or
reason or a choice of action when those
questions arise human science is it a
loss it has nothing to say about them as
far as I can see these questions remain
in the obscurity that in which they were
in classical antiquity would you also
accept this or not but that having
arrived at our present situation across
millions of years of evolution we must
have been going through us a continual
process of innovation and new adaption
and development of new abilities
dispositions organs etc might we not
still be as it were plastic at the edges
might not still be developing and
evolving genuinely evolving if only on
the margin well I think one has to be
again very crushers here because well
it's true at a very independent to say
it's correct to say that the systems
that we now have have developed through
evolution through natural selection it's
important to recognize how little we are
saying when we say that for example it
it's certainly not necessarily the case
that every particular trait that we have
is the result of specific selection that
is that we were selected for having that
in fact there are striking examples for
the contrary at least apparent examples
to the contrary say take for example our
capacity to deal with abstract
properties of the number system and
that's a distinctive human capacity as
distinctive as the capacity for language
any normal human effect of found of
pathological levels can comprehend the
properties of a number system and can
move very far and understanding their
deep properties but it's extremely
difficult to believe that this capacity
was the result of specifics
election that is it's hard to believe
that people who are a little better at
proving theorems of number theory had
more children would say that didn't
happen in fact through most of human
evolution in fact essentially all of
human evolution this capacity wasn't it
would have been impossible to know that
this capacity even existed the
contingencies that allowed it to the
exercise never arose nevertheless the
trait is there the capacity is there the
mental organ if you like has developed
presumably it has developed as a
concomitant of some other properties of
the brain which may have been selected
for example we can speculate say that
bring you know that increase in brain
size was a factor in differential
reproduction it's an evolution and it
may be that for physical law because
physical laws that we presently don't
know that an increase in brain size
under the specific conditions of human
evolution simply leads necessarily
through a system which has the capacity
to deal with graphics the number system
well then that's a matter of physics
ultimately and then the mind that
evolves the brain that evolves will have
this capacity but not because it was
achieved through selection now I think
it's at least likely that something this
or is true of human language I mean
surely if it were dysfunctional it
wouldn't have been maintained its
obviously functional but it's a long
leap to claim that that the specific
structures of language are themselves
the result of specific selection and
it's wholly that I don't think is
particularly plausible what you save
them about the limitations that this
imposes on this prompts in me the
following thought we are all very used I
think to the idea that in social life
each one of us as individuals tends to
construct a picture of the world around
his own experience and indeed we it's
difficult to see how we could do
anything else we're bound to do that
we've got no alternative but it does
mean that each one of us forms a
systematically distorted view of the
world because it's in because it's all
built up on what accidentally happens to
be the particular and really
the narrow experience of the individual
who does it now do you think that
something of that kind applies to man as
a whole because of the reasons implicit
in your theory that is to say that the
whole picture that mankind has formed of
the cosmos of the universe of the world
must be systematically distorted and
what's more drastically limited by the
nature of the particular apparatus for
understanding that he happens to have
well i think that is undoubtedly the
case but again i would question the use
of the word limited which carries
unfortunate suggestions that is i assume
that one of our faculties one of their
mental organs if you like is let's call
it a science forming capacity a capacity
to create intelligible explanatory
theories in some domain and if we look
at the history of science we discover
that time after time when particular
questions were posed at a particular
level of understanding it was possible
to make very innovative leaks of the
imagination to rich explanatory theories
that presented an intelligible picture
of that sub domain of the universe often
long theories as we later discovered but
there's a course that's followed and
this gives this could have been the case
only because we do have and we in fact
share across the species a some kind of
a science farming capacity that is that
limits us as you say but at the same in
the same web same token provides the
possibility of creating explanatory
theories that extend so vastly far
beyond any evidence that's available i
mean it's impt it's very important to
realize that should be some obvious say
but if worth saying that when when it's
when a new theory is created and a don't
necessarily mean newton and even a small
theory what the scientist is typically
doing first of all he has very limited
evidence the theory goes far far beyond
the evidence secondly much of the
evidence that's available is typically
disregarded that is its put to the side
in
hope that somebody else will take care
of it someday and we can forget about so
at every stage in history of science
there's even the normal science not you
know Cooney revolutions there's a high
degree of idealization that Joe's on so
the selection of evidence distortion of
evidence creation of new theory a
confirmation or refutation or
modification of that theory further
idealization these are all very curious
debt now we're capable nevertheless we
can often make them and make them in a
way which is intelligible to others
doesn't look like some random act of the
imagination and where that's possible we
can we can develop intelligible theories
we can gain some comprehension of the
nature of this aspect of the world now
this is possible only because we are
rigidly pre-programmed again because we
have somehow developed through evolution
or however the specific Faculty of
forming very particular theories of
course it follows at once sir please
follow it's reasonable to assume that
this very faculty which enables us to
construct extremely rich and successful
theories in some domain may lead us very
far astray and some other domain for
example there may be some you know again
a Martian scientists looking at us and
observing our successes and errors from
a higher intelligence let's say might be
being used to discover that whereas in
some domains we seem to be able to make
scientific progress in other domains we
always seem to be running up against a
blank wall because our minds are so
constructed that we just can't make the
intellectual leap that's required we
can't formulate the concept we don't
have the categories that are required to
gain insight into that domain do you
think that if our study of our language
forming capacity and hints our cognitive
capacities as you call them our
abilities to know and understand and
learn
if these studies the job pioneering
results in an enormously amount of
increased knowledge of all these human
faculties do you think it's at all
likely that that increased knowledge
will enable us to change and indeed
expand the faculties that I think is
extremely unlikely because i think the
faculties are a biological given we may
study the structure of the heart but we
don't do so because we think it's
possible to replace the heart by another
kind of pump today which might be more
efficient similarly here I think if if
we ever did gain a real comprehension of
the mental organs we would not we might
that might help us in case of pathology
marginal cases in other words but I
wouldn't see how that could be of any
way at least with our present science /
plausible science of modifying these
capacities what we might do however is
games I mean at least it's in theory
imaginable that we might discover
something about the limits of our
science forming abilities we might
discover for example that some kinds of
questions simply fall beyond the area
where we are capable of constructing
explanatory theories and I think we even
maybe now have some glimmerings of
insight into where this delineation
might be between intelligible theories
that fall within our comprehension and
areas where no such theory is possible
well the case that we discussed before
maybe one take take the question of if
you go back to the you know take the
back to the early histories of science
history of science early origins of
science speculation and people were
raising questions about say the heavenly
bodies and about the sources of human
action well we're asking exactly the
same questions now about the source of
human action there's been no progress we
have no idea how to approach this
question within the framework of science
we can write novels about it but we
can't construct even fourth scientific
theories about it we still have nothing
to say when we asked look for the
question how does a person make a
decision in a certain manner and not
some other manner when it's a free
decision we just have no way of dealing
with that issue
the other hand of history physics let's
say has had substantial advances and
very it's very likely I think that that
should secretly the massive difference
in progress in one domain and an Affleck
blank wall and another reflects the
specific properties of our science
warming capacities we might even be able
to show that someday in fact there so
far we've been rather talking in this
discussion as if all organized thinking
is done in language but of course that
in fact isn't service and I mean one can
take all kinds of examples in music is
one that appeals to me very much if you
get a composer like Stravinsky composing
a fantastically complicated and original
and you need revolutionary score like
that of the Rite of Spring for an
enormous Orchestra then he's celebrating
at an original and complicated and very
sophisticated level and he's probably
celebrating in his elaborate away as
anybody else's who's doing anything and
what's more he's creating a structure
which is publicly articulated and so on
and yet words don't come into this
process at any point as far as one can
gather does that fact of other facts
like you pose any threat to your
theories well not really I mean I in
fact quite contrary my assumption is
that the mind is not a uniform system
but it's a highly differentiated system
in fact like the body it's essentially a
system of faculties or organs and
language is simply one of them I don't
it we don't have to go to the level of
Stravinsky to find examples of thinking
without language I'm sure that everyone
who introspect who thinks about what he
himself is doing will know at once that
much of his thinking doesn't involve
language or say well for thinking of a
cat let's say plainly doesn't involve
language there are other modes of
thought there are other faculties and I
think that the musical faculty is 11
which is particularly interesting I
think because it's extremely likely in
fact here's an area in a sense like
physics that is where very rapid and
rich development took place in a way
which was over a long period of say
Western history in a way which was very
intelligible to others
I mean not immediately that after a
short period and strikingly well there
is a striking feature of the 20th
century in this respect that is that the
the musical creation of the 20th century
i think is qualitatively different from
that if they the 18th century in that it
lacks that and that immediate access or
short-term access that was true of the
past I one would have to do an
experiment to prove it but I have no
doubt that if we took a child of the day
two children of today let's hear two
groups and taught one of them say Mozart
Haydn and Beethoven and put the other
one Schoenberg and poster on bergen
music that it would be very substantial
difference in their capacity to
comprehend it and deal with it and that
may reflect in fact if that's correct it
would reflect something about air air
innate musical capacities points of this
nature have been discussed for some time
I remember Paul Hindemith there about 25
years ago I think and lectures argued
that to violate the tonal principle and
music would be something like an effort
to violate the principle of gravitation
I take it he meant by that that it was
an innate problem well we might say in
his prep I don't pursue the musical
analogy too far because I was using that
really only as an illustration what it
illustrates is the fact that you think
we are pre-programmed in fact a lot of
things don't you I mean no doubt to use
gesture or recognize faces or another at
a common-sense view of the world and so
on well every area of human existence
that even worth studying is worth
studying because rich and complex
structures are developed in a uniform
way otherwise it's not worth studying
and those are precisely the case is
where we expect to have with the to
discover pre-programming that makes
possible these great achievements so in
other words you think that everything
that we do makes manifesto
pre-programming games institutions the
way we dress the way we eat everything
well here again I think some caution is
necessary for exempt that games I'm
speculating obviously but it seems to me
reasonable to suppose that games are
designed so as to be
in a sense at the outer limits of our
cognitive capacities we don't make up
games that are in which we are as
skilled as we are in using words let's
say that wouldn't be an interesting game
everybody can do too much what we do it
we make up games like say chess which is
an extraordinarily simple game that is
its rural Assistance utterly trivial but
nevertheless which is not we're not very
good at it as in the case of using
language we're all extraordinarily good
and were essentially undifferentiated
orders of our cognitive capacity than
individuals a very similar intellectual
makeup will nevertheless diverge very
significantly in their ability to deal
with these exotic problems that's what
makes it an interesting game and in fact
I think there are also tasks that can be
constructed that are really outside our
cognitive capacities and in fact I think
there's even field that's devoted to
developing such tasks it's called
psychology much of modern psychology has
been concerned to discover tasks which
would yield species uniform laws that is
laws that are essentially hold across
number of species or to construct good
experiments that is experiment that have
slow learning curves with regular
increments and so on and so forth and
there are such tasks a maze running in
which rats are about as good as humans
and both are quite terrible and these I
think are in fact precisely tasks that
do lie outside of our cognitive capacity
so we do proceed by trial and error and
by induction and so on but centrally
your whole approach represents a
rejection of the empirical tradition in
philosophy it doesn't it because I mean
the very fact that you think that the
empiricists are wrong about how we learn
must mean that they're wrong about
knowledge and the nature of knowledge
and the nature of knowledge has been the
central problem in the whole empirical
tradition of philosophy well the
classical empiricist tradition which i
think was the tradition is represented
let's say crafton its highest worn by
hume seems to me to be a up to that
tradition of extreme importance in that
a particular
of the origins of knowledge fact of the
science of human nature in humans phrase
was put forth an empirical theory and I
think Hume for example would regarded as
an empirical theory did regard it so
when we investigated I think we discover
that it's just completely false that is
that the mechanisms that he discussed
are not the mechanisms by which the mind
reaches states of knowledge that the
states of knowledge attained are
radically different than the kinds that
he discussed for example for Hume the
mind was in His image a kind of a
theater in which ideas paraded across
the stage and we it therefore followed
necessarily that we could introspect
completely into the contents of our mind
if an idea is not on the stage it's not
in the mind and the ideas may be
connected and associated in fact he went
on to say there isn't even any theater
there's just the ideas and that respect
the image is misleading well that's a
that's a theory and in fact it's a
theory that has had a an enormous grip
on the imagination throughout most of
his my knowledge most of the history of
Western thought for example that that
same image dominates the rationalist
tradition as well where it was assumed
that one could exhaust the contents of
the mind by careful attention you know
you could really develop those clear and
distinct ideas and their consequences
and so on and in fact even if you move
to someone let's say but Freud with his
a vocation of the unconscious still I
think that a careful reading suggests
that he regarded the unconscious as in
principle act accessible that is we
could really perceive that theatre and
stage and the things on it carefully if
only the barriers of repression and so
on could be overcome well if what I've
been suggesting is correct that's just
that's radically wrong I mean even wrong
as a point of departure there is no
reason at all but I can see for
believing that the the principles of
mental computation that enter so
intimately into ayer action or our
interaction or our speech to believe
that those principles have are at all
accessible introspection any more than
the analyzing mechanisms of our visual
system or for that matter
the nature of our liver is accessible
introspection it seems to me that over
and over again you come back to the same
point that is to say that many of the
particular problems discussed and
theories put forward by philosophers in
the main but also psychologists you've
just mentioned fried and in your
writings you mentioned many others are
in fact theories about physical
processes they are therefore open to
checking by investigation and when you
check my investigation you'll find out
that the theories are wrong and
therefore you are as it were radically
subversive of a lot of very well
established theories in our tradition it
seems to me that what you put forward in
their place over and over again in fact
does parallel the rationalist tradition
I said in my introduction to this
program that what I'm always reminded
off by your work is the theories of
can't you seem to me to be almost
redoing in terms of modern linguistics
what kant was doing do you accept any so
far well right not only accept truth in
it but I've tried to bring it out in a
certain way however I haven't myself
specifically referred to can't but
rather to be primarily to the 17th
century tradition of the continental
Cartesian xand the British neoplatonism
who developed many of the ideas that are
now much more familiar in the writings
of can't for example the idea of
experience conforming to our mode of
cognition or the well particularly in
the British Plata nests cudworth for
example there are I've leave is a rich
mine of insight into the organizing
principles of the mind by which
experience is structured in fact I think
problem that some of the richest
psychological so sorts of psychological
insights that I know I and that's the
one it's this tradition that I think
that can be fleshed out and made more
explicit by the kinds of empirical
inquiry that are now possible of course
I think we also have to diverge from
that tradition and a number of respects
I've mentioned one namely the belief
with the contents of the minder of an
introspection similarly we certainly no
reason to accept the metaphysics of that
tradition to believe that there's a
dualism of mind and body I mean you can
see why the Cartesian were led to that
it was a rational move on their part but
it's not a move that we have to follow
we have other ways of approaching that
question another thing that I say
mentioned in my introduction was the
fact that you've made to international
reputations the other one besides
linguistics being as a political
activist and it does seem to me that
there is a connection between these two
careers of yours and I want to put this
to you really in the form of a question
liberalism grew up in the history of
European thought in very close
relationship to empirical philosophy and
scientific method the battlecry really
in all three was don't accept anything
on the say-so of established Authority
look at the facts and judge for yourself
this was revolutionary in politics
science and philosophy and because of
this liberalism has always been regarded
in the Western tradition as the main
anti-authoritarian political creed but
he just as you've rejected empiricism
you also rejected liberalism and you now
say in your writings that whatever may
have been true in the past liberalism
has now become the ally of authority
would you accept that there is this
underlying connection between your work
in linguistics and well to put it
dramatically your opposition to the
Vietnam War well this raises quite a
welter of questions let me begin by
saying something about liberalism which
is a very complicated concept I think
it's correct surely that liberalism grew
up in the intellectual environment of
the empiricism and the rejection of
authority and trust in the evidence of
the senses and so on however liberalism
has undergone a very complex evolution
has a social philosophy over the years
if we go back to the classics or at
least what I regard as a classic say for
example unbolts limits of state action
which inspired nil and is a true
libertarian liberal classic it would
look the world that humbled was
considering which was partially an
imaginary world but the world for which
he was developing this political
philosophy was a post feudal but
pre-capitalist world that it was a it
was a world in which there is no great
divergence among individuals in the kind
of power that they have in what they
command let's say but there was a
tremendous disparity between individuals
on the one hand and the state on the
other consequently it was the task of a
liberalism that was concerned with human
rights and equality of individuals and
so on it was the task of that liberalism
to dissolve the enormous power of the
state which was such a enfora carrying
threat to individual liberties and from
that you develop a classical liberal
theory and say Humboldt or mill sense
well of course that is pre-capitalist he
couldn't conceive of an era in which a
corporation would be regarded as an
individual it's a or in which such
enormous in which enormous disparities
and control over resources and
production would distinguish between
individuals and massive fashion now in
that kind of a society to take the
Humboldt in view is a very superficial
liberalism because while opposition the
state power in an era of such divergence
conforms the Humboldt's conclusions it
doesn't do so for his reasons that is
his reasons Lee the very different
conclusions in that case namely I think
his reasons lead to the conclusion that
we must dissolve the authoritarian
control over production and resources
which leads to such divergences among
individuals in fact I think one might
draw a direct line between classical
liberalism and the kind of libertarian
socialism which I think can be regarded
as the as a kind of an adapting of the
basic reasoning of classical liberalism
to a very different social hero now if
we come to the modern period here
liberalism has taken on a very strange
sense if you think of its history now
liberalism is essentially the theory of
state capitalism of state intervention
in a capitalist economy well that is
very little relation to classical
liberalism in fact classical liberalism
is what's now called conservatism I
suppose but this new view I think really
is it am I my view at least a highly
authoritarian position that is it's one
which accepts a number of centers of
authority and control the state on the
one hand
agglomeration zuv private power on the
other hand all interacting with
individuals as malleable cogs in this
highly constrained machine which may be
called democratic but given the the the
actual distribution of power is very far
from being meaningfully democratic and
cannot be so so my own feeling has
always been that to achieve the
classical liberal ideals for the reasons
that led to them being put forth in a
society so different we must be led in
very different direction oh it's
superficial and erroneous to accept the
conclusions which were reached for a
different society and not to consider
the reasoning that led to those
conclusions the reasoning i think is
very substantially i'm a classical
liberal in the sense but i think it
leads me to be a banana cos all right an
anarchist socialist and well I'd love to
pursue you down that road to visit
Chomsky but that would be a new
discussion of new program so I think we
must glass in there thank you very much
you
