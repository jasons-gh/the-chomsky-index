it's obvious to begin with that we can
distinguish two systems of power the
political system in the economic system
the former consists in principle of
elected representatives of the people
who set public policy the latter in
principle is a system of private power a
system of private empires that are free
from public control except in a remote
and indirect ways in which even a feudal
nobility or tella terian dictatorship
must be responsive to the public will
there are several immediate consequences
of this organization of society the
first is that in a subtle way an
authoritarian task of mind is induced in
a very large mass of the population
which is subject to arbitrary decree
from above I think this has a great
effect on the general character of a
culture the effect the belief that one
must obey arbitrary dictates and accede
to Authority and I think in fact the
remarkable and exciting fact about the
youth movement in recent years is that
it's challenging and beginning to break
down some of these authoritarian
patterns second fact that is important
is that the range of decisions that are
in principle subject the public
Democratic control is quite narrow for
example it excludes in law and principle
the central institutions in any advanced
industrial society that is the entire
commercial industrial and financial
system and a third fact is that even
within the narrow range of issues that
are submitted in principle to democratic
decision-making the centres of private
power of course exert and inordinately
heavy influence in perfectly obvious
ways through control of the media
through control of political
organizations are impactful 'simple and
direct means of supplying the top
personnel for the parliamentary system
itself as they obviously do dick Barnett
in a recent study of this reports hit
study of the top 400 decision-makers in
the post-war national security system
but most have I quote now come from
executive suites and law offices within
shouting distance of each other in 15
city blocks and five major cities and
every other study shows the same thing
in short the democratic system had best
functions within a very narrow range
capitalist democracy and even within
this narrow range it's functioning is
enormous ly biased by the concentrations
of private power and by the
authoritarian and passive modes of
thinking that are induced by autocratic
institutions such as industries for
example it's a truism but one that must
be constantly stressed that capitalism
and democracy are ultimately quite
incompatible and a careful look at the
matter I think merely strengthens this
conclusion there are perfectly obvious
processes of centralization of control
taking place in both the political and
the industrial system as far as the
political system is concerned in every
parliamentary democracy not only ours
the role of parliament and policy
formation has been declining in the
years since World War two as everyone
knows and political commentators
repeatedly point out the executive in
other words has become increasingly more
powerful as the planning functions of
the state become more significant the
House Armed Services Committee a couple
of years ago described the role of
Congress as that of a sometimes queer
euless but essentially kindly uncle who
complains while furiously puffing on his
pipe but who finally as everyone expects
gives in and hands over the allowance
and careful studies of civil military
decision since World War two show that
this is quite an accurate perception
senator Vandenberg 20 years ago
expressed his fear that the American
chief executive would become the number
one world warlord of the earth his
phrase that has since occurred clearest
decision is the decision to escalate in
Vietnam and February 1965 and cynical
disregard of the expressed will of the
electorate this incident reveals I think
the perfect clarity the role of the
public and decisions about peace and war
the role of the public and decisions
about the main lines of public policy in
general and it also suggests the
relevance of electoral politics to major
decisions of national policy
unfortunately you can't vote the rascals
out because you never voted them in in
the first place the corporate
the corporate executives and the
corporation lawyers and so on who
overwhelmingly staff the executive
assisted increasingly by a
university-based Mandarin class these
people remain in power no matter whom
you elect and furthermore it's
interesting to note that this ruling
elite is pretty clear about its social
role as an example take Robert McNamara
who's a person widely praised in liberal
circles for his humanity is technical
brilliance and has campaigned to control
the military his views of social
organization I think are quite
illuminating he says vital
decision-making in policy matters as
well as business must remain at the top
that is partly they're not completely
what the top is for and he goes on to
suggest that this is apparently a divine
imperative I quote God is clearly
democratic he distributes brain power
universally but he quite justifiably
expects us to do something efficient and
constructive with that priceless gift
that's what management is all about
management management is in the end the
most creative of all the arts for its
medium is human talent itself the real
threat to democracy comes from under
management the under management of
society is not the respect of Liberty it
is simply to let some force other than
reason shape reality if it is not reason
that rules man
then man falls short of his potential
end of quote so reason then is to be
identified as the sexualization of
decision-making at the top and the hands
of management popular involvement in
decision-making is a threat to Liberty a
violation of Reason reason is embodied
in autocratic tightly managed
institutions strengthening these
institutions within which men and
function most efficiently is in his
words the great human adventure of our
time well this has a faintly familiar
ring to it and I think it is the
authentic role of the the authentic
voice of the technical intelligentsia
the liberal intelligentsia the
technocratic corporate elite in a modern
society there is a parallel process of
centralization and economic life
there's a recent FPC report which notes
that the 200 largest manufacturing
corporations now
about two-thirds of all manufacturing
assets at the beginning of World War two
the same amount of power was spread over
a thousand corporations I quote the
report it says a small industrial elite
of huge conglomerate companies is
gobbling up American business and
largely destroying competitive free
enterprise furthermore it says the 200
corporations are partially linked with
each other and with other corporations
in ways that may prevent or discourage
independent behavior and market
decisions
what is novel about such observations is
only their source the FTC
they are familiar to the point of cliche
among left liberal commentators on
American society the centralization of
power also has an international
dimension it's been pointed out that on
the base on quoting from foreign tears
that on the basis of the gross value of
their output US enterprises abroad in
the aggregate comprise the third largest
country in the world with a gross
product greater than that of any country
except the United States and Soviet
Union American firms control over half
the automobile industry in England
almost 40% of petroleum in Germany over
40% the toe of the telegraphic telephone
and electronic and business equipment in
France 75% of the computers within a
decade given present trends more than
half of the British exports will be from
American owned companies and furthermore
these are highly concentrated
investments 40% of direct investment in
Germany France and Britain is by three
firms American firms George ball has
explained that the project of
constructing an integrated world economy
dominated by American capital and Empire
in other words is no idealistic pipe
dream but a hard-headed prediction it's
a role he says into which we are being
pushed by the imperatives of our own
economy the major instrument being the
multinational corporation which George
Ball describes as follows in its modern
form the multinational corporation or
one with worldwide operations and
markets is a distinctly American
development through such corporations it
has become possible for the first time
to use the world's resources with
maximum efficiency but there must be
greater unification of the world economy
to give full play to the benefit
of multinational corporations these
multinational corporations are the
beneficiary of the mobilization of
resources by the federal government and
its worldwide operations and markets are
backed ultimately but American military
force now based in dozens of countries
it's not difficult to guess who will
reap the benefits from the integrated
world economy which is the domain of
operation of these American based
international economic institutions well
at this stage and discussion one has to
mention the specter of communism what is
the threat of communism to this system
for a clear and cogent answer when can
turn to an extensive study of the
Woodrow Wilson foundation the National
Planning Association called the
political economy of American foreign
policy very important book which is
compiled by a representative segment of
the tiny elite that largely sets public
policy whoever is technically in office
in effect it's as close as you can come
to a manifesto of the American ruling
class here they define the primary
threat of communism as a quote the
economic transformation of the Communist
powers in ways which reduce their
willingness or ability to complement the
industrial economies of the West that is
the primary threat of communism
communism in short reduces the
willingness and ability of
underdeveloped countries to function in
the world capitalist economy in the
manner of for example the Philippines
which has developed a colonial economy
of a classic type after 75 years of
American tutelage and domination it's
this doctrine which explains why the
British economists Joan Robinson
describes the American crusade against
communism as a crusade against
development the Cold War ideology and
the International communist conspiracy
function an important way as essentially
a propaganda device to mobilize support
at a particular historical moment for
this longtime imperial enterprise in
fact I believe that this is probably the
main function of the Cold War it serves
as a useful device for the managers of
American society and their counterparts
in Soviet Union to control their own
populations and their own respective
Imperial systems I think that the
persistence of the Cold War can be in
part explained by its utility for the
managers of the two great world systems
well there's one final element that has
to be added to this picture namely the
ongoing militarization of American
society how does this enter in to see I
think want us to look back at World War
two and to recall that prior to World
War two of course we were deep in the
depression World War two taught a an
important economic lesson it taught the
lesson that government induced
production in a carefully controlled
economy centrally controlled could
overcome the effects of a depression I
think this is what Charles II Wilson had
in mind in 1944 when he proposed that we
then that we have a permanent war
economy in the post-war world of course
the trouble is that in a capitalist
economy there only a number of ways in
which government intervention can take
place can't be competitive with the
private empires for example which is to
say it can't be any useful production in
fact it has to be the production of
luxury goods goods not not capital not
useful commodities which would be
competitive and unfortunately there's
only one category of luxury goods that
can be produced endlessly with rapid
obsolescence quickly whistling and no
limit on how many of them you can use we
all know what that is this whole matter
is described pretty well by the business
historian Alfred Chandler he describes
the economic lessons of World War two as
follows the government spent far more
than the most enthusiastic new dealer
had ever proposed most of the output of
the expenditures was destroyed or left
on the battlefields of Europe and Asia
but the resulting increased demand sent
the nation into a period of prosperity
the like of which had never before been
seen moreover the supplying of huge
armies and navies fighting the most
massive war of all time required a
centralized control of the national
economy this effort brought corporate
managers to Washington to carry out one
of the most complex pieces of economic
planning in history that experience
lessened the ideological fears over the
government's role in stabilizing the
economy is the conservative commentator
and point out make data that the ensuing
cold war carried further the D
politicization of Americans
sian created kind of a psychological
environment in which the government is
able to intervene and part through
fiscal policies and part through public
work and public services but very
largely of course through defense
spending in this way to use Alfred
Chandler's words the government acts as
a coordinator of last resort when
managers are unable to maintain a high
level of aggregate demand as another
conservative historian Joseph Monson
writes and lightened corporate managers
far from fearing government intervention
in the economy view the new economics as
a technique for increasing corporate
viability of course the most cynical use
of these ideas is by the managers of the
publicly subsidized war industries there
was a remarkable series in Washington
Post about this last about a year ago by
Bernard noscitur for example he quoted
samuel downer financial vice president
of LTV aerospace one of the big new
conglomerates who explained why the
post-war world must be bolstered by
military orders
he said it's basic it's selling appeal
is defensive a home this is one of the
greatest appeals the politicians have to
adjusting the system if you're the
president and you need a control factor
in the economy and you need to sell this
factor
you can't sell Harlem and Watts but you
can sell self-preservation and new
environment we're going to increase
defense budgets as long as those
bastards in Russia are ahead of us the
American people understand this of
course those bastards aren't exactly
ahead of us in this deadly and cynical
game but that's only a minor
embarrassment to the thesis in times of
need we can always follow the rescue
Burt Humphrey and other luminaries and
appeal to the billion Chinese armed to
the teeth and setting out a world
conquest again I want to emphasize the
role in this system of the Cold War as a
technique of domestic control technique
for developing the psychological climate
of paranoia and psychosis in which the
taxpayer will be willing to provide an
enormous endless subsidy to the
technologically advanced sectors of
American industry and the corporations
that dominate this increasingly
centralized system well of course
perfectly obvious that Russian
imperialism is not an invention of
American ideologists it's real enough to
the Hungarians of the Czechs for example
what is an invention is the uses to
which it's
for example by Dean Acheson or 19 1950
or Walt Rostow a decade later when they
pretend that the Vietnam War is an
example of Russian imperialism or by the
Johnson administration in 1965 when it
justifies the Dominican intervention
with reference to the sino-soviet
military bloc or by the Kennedy
intellectuals who as Townsend Hoopes put
it in a article in The Washington
Monthly last month were diluted by the
tensions of the Cold War years and not
perceived that the triumphs of the
national revolution in Vietnam would not
be a triumph for Moscow and Peking the
most remarkable degree of delusion on
the part of presumably literate men or
for example by Eugene Rostow who in a
recent book that was very widely praised
by liberal senators and academic
intellectuals outlined the series of
challenges to World Order in the modern
era as follows Napoleon Kaiser vilhelm
Hitler and continuing in the post-war
world general strikes in France and
Italy the civil war in Greece and the
attack on South Vietnam where he writes
in 1968 Russia has put up two severe
tests in its efforts to spread communism
by the sword as a very interesting
series of challenges to World Order
Napoleon Kaiser Wilhelm Hitler general
strikes in France and Italy the civil
war in Greece and the Russian attack on
South Vietnam if one thinks it through
he can some pretty interesting
conclusions about modern history well
one can continue with this indefinitely
I mean to suggest that the Cold War is
highly functional both to the American
elite and its Soviet counterpart who in
a perfectly similar way exploit Western
imperialism which they did not invent as
they send their armies into
Czechoslovakia
it's important in both cases in
providing an ideology for empire and for
the government-subsidized system here of
military capitalism it's predictable
then that challenges to this ideology
will be bitterly resisted by force if
necessary
now in many ways American society is
indeed open and liberal values are
preserved however is poor people and
black people and other ethnic minorities
oh very well the liberal veneer is
pretty thin Mark Twain once wrote that
it is by the goodness of God that in our
country we have those three unspeakably
precious things freedom of speech
freedom of conscience and the prudence
never to practice either of them those
who like the prudence may well pay the
cost roughly speaking I think it's
accurate to say that a corporate a
league of managers and owners governs
the economy in the political system as
well the political systems well at least
in very large measure the people
so-called do exercise an occasional
choice among those who Marx once called
the rival factions and adventurers of
the ruling class and those who find this
characterization too harsh may prefer
the formulations modern democratic
theorists like Joseph Schumpeter who
describes modern political democracy
favorably as a system in which the
deciding of issues by the electorate is
secondary to the election of the men who
were to do the deciding a political
party he says accurately is a group
whose members proposed to act in concert
in the competitive struggle for
political power if that were not so it
would be impossible for different
parties who adopt exactly or almost
exactly the same program that's all the
advantages of political democracy as he
sees it this program both parties adopt
more or less exactly and the individuals
who compete for power they express a
narrow conservative ideology basically
the interests of one or other element in
the corporate elite with some
modifications now this is obviously no
conspiracy I think it's simply implicit
in the system of corporate capitalism
these people and the institutions they
represent are in effect in power and
their interests are the national
interest it's this interest that is
served primarily and overwhelmingly by
the overseas Empire and the growing
system of military state capitalism at
home if we were to withdraw the consent
of the governed as I think we should we
are withdrawing our consent to have
these men and the interests they
represent govern advantage American
society and impose their concept of
World Order
their criteria for legitimate political
and economic development in much of the
world although an immense effort of
propaganda and mystification is carried
on to conceal these facts nonetheless
facts they remain we have today the
technical and material resources to meet
man's animal needs we had not developed
the cultural and moral resources or the
democratic forms of social organization
that make possible the humane and
rational use of our material wealth and
power conceivably the classical liberal
ideals as expressed and developed in
their libertarian socialist form are
capable but if so only by a popular
revolutionary movement rooted in watt
strata of the population and committed
to the elimination repressive and
authoritarian institutions state and
private to create such a movement is the
challenge we face and must meet if
there's to be an escape from
contemporary barbarism
