who is a person that's quite an interest
has quite an interesting history that
question so in Western thought legal
doctrine and so on the good bit of it
traces back in the modern you know
relatively modern period eight hundred
years to Magna Carta particularly
article 39 of Magna Carta which
establishes what we call presumption of
innocence a person it cannot be
subjected to any penalty by state
authority with unless shown to be guilty
in a fair trial by peers that's the
essence of the the principle of Liberty
formulated in Magna Carta of course
person had a very narrow range the
person first of all didn't didn't
include women didn't include slaves
didn't include people without property
person and a relative property male of
course white male
that's person you move on say to the
American Constitution next major step it
also if you look at the Bill of Rights
it talks about the rights of persons who
are persons well not Native Americans
obviously they have to be exterminated
than expelled not slaves actually it's
worse than that slave owners were super
persons though because of the famous
three-fifths rule which gave slave
owners extra rights because of the
slaves that they possessed so but
obviously slaves are not person of what
were women the women were property the
u.s. took over British common law and
according to British common law the
women were property a woman was the
property of her
and the property was then handed over to
her husband so if you look at the
debates and the constitutional
convention as to why women shouldn't be
allowed to vote one of the arguments was
it would be unfair to unmarried men
because it would mean that a married man
has two votes his own vote and the vote
of his property and that's plainly
unfair so women can't have the right to
vote and of course among white males
again there were property restrictions
of all kinds poll taxes is that the
other thing so again person meant pretty
much little be extended somewhat beyond
Magna Carta but it still meant property
white male to a substantial extent well
kind of battles and struggles took place
over the years won't run through them
you know them finally by the 1920s women
did get the right to vote and in 1975
which is not that long ago the women
were the Supreme Court which of course
determines what the rules are the
Supreme Court did decide that women can
be peers they can serves on federal
juries they were right to serve on
federal juries which makes them
technically persons if you look at the
14th of the Civil War one of the
outcomes of the Civil War was the 14th
amendment and which was supposed to
guarantee the rights of freed slaves a
crucial notion is who was a person it
does say in the 14th amendment that no
person will have their rights infringed
that's under except under you know legal
conditions and so on
so who's a person well who's a person
depends on what the courts decided not
what's written on parchment you know
what the courts decided is that
corporations are persons virtually every
case brought under the 14th amendment
had to do with the rights of
corporations which over those last years
of the 19th century in the early 20th
century were gradually given more and
more rights ultimately Rights of Persons
that goes right to the present the
famous citizens the United vote 10 years
ago essentially carries the notion of
corporate personhood steps forward
corporations were the persons who had
rights there was almost nothing about
freed slaves in fact what happened after
the Civil War was that the slave
population was forced back into slavery
the way it was done was by granting the
southern states which had most of the
black population granting them the right
to establish their own laws for state in
internal state affairs and one of the
things they did is criminalized black
life literally so if a black man is
standing on a street corner he can be
charged with vagrancy and given a fine
which he can't pay since the prison
stays there for the rest of his life
becomes part of a workforce if a black
man looks at a white woman a way that
somebody doesn't like he can be accused
of attempted rape and he'll be in jail
forever the person most of the black
male population was back in jail that
made them a perfect workforce even
better than slavery a slave owner has
property and has to take care of it
you have to reproduce the property so
it's a costly African food and so on if
the if the slaves are in the state
system the taxpayer provides maintains
the property and you can just use it and
in fact the slate just as the cotton
production was the basis for the modern
economy from which we all benefit
enormous Lee the slave system that was
established after the
Second World War was a large part of the
basis for the Second Industrial
Revolution and we're familiar with chain
gangs you know he's got these pictures
of slaves working in the agricultural
areas but that's because it was visible
the same was true of mining of the steel
industry of a good bit of the late 19th
century early 20th century industrial
development was based on another slave
force this went on up until the Second
World War when there was a need for
what's called free labor to work in the
military plants that's a large part of
the black population was free for a
couple of decades after that they were
restored to some sent back to prison the
method was the drug war if you look at
the incarceration rate in the United
States by about crime in the United
States about the same as other wealthy
countries little on the high side not
much aside from death with guns but that
has to do with a crazy gun culture but
apart from that crime is roughly the
same incarceration was also about the
same up to about nineteen eighty then it
starts rising by now incarceration in
the United States is literally the
highest in the world for any country
that has statistics the made five to ten
times as high as your comparable
European countries most of it is
victimless crimes drug-related crimes
which target specifically blacks
primarily males women too by now and
increasingly Hispanics as well that's a
kind of a restored Jim Crow system both
world wars is that's history up to the
present take a look at the remnants of
the Native American population almost
anywhere miserable conditions worse
conditions in the country in Central
America it's the same story there are
still to this day people fleeing from
the genocidal assaults of the 1980s and
being driven back from the borders in
fact from Mexico and so on well the so
what's another interesting question
about who's a person is what about
aliens what if somebody comes to the
United States and doesn't have documents
well according to Supreme Court ruling
they're not persons they're literate so
person is narrowly defined it's expanded
beyond Magna Carta does include women
doesn't restrict property rights at
least by law and practice it does many
other kinds of discrimination but still
excludes aliens the these are these are
very fundamental questions about person
who
