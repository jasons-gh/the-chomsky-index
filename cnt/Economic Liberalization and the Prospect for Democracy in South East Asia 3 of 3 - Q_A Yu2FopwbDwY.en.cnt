the speakers will now take questions
there are two mics in the two aisles and
please line up and they request that you
keep your comments and questions brief
so that everyone gets a chance to get
this
targeting produce purchasing power
now and then except possibly for the
I think that's a debatable issue in the
days of narrow in the 50s for example
even with a thumping majority which the
Congress party which narrows party had
you had how the parliamentary debates
you had parliamentary committees that
were consulted with and whose
recommendations were frequently taken
seriously in the past three years for
the for the most of the past three years
the Narasimha Rao government did not
really have a majority far from it being
a thumping majority nonetheless narsimha
Rao has had the impunity really to
hardly be present in Parliament or
answer questions the the parliamentary
committees report on the scan the
Harshad Mehta scam has been essentially
some early dismissed a body by the
current government and last of all it
seems to me that the way in which take
for example the national debate over gap
and the then Dunkel proposals concerning
intellectual property rights etc were
proceeding it was simply unprecedented
that that government should move
discussion on these issues in Parliament
at the 11th hour I don't think this ever
happened in in narrows time this is not
to serve the cause and that part of your
point is well-taken that indeed the
organs of decision-making have always
had a high degree of centralization as
Chomsky was quoting Adam Smith as say
but I think there is an important
difference of degree which which we
ought to recognize
well your wife do is look at who's happy
and who said I think tolsey a lot the
happiest person in Haiti apparently is
Fritz MIBs
who's the spokesman for the biggest and
richest family in Haiti and one of the
major coup supporters he's in fact
circulating tens of thousands of posters
all over porta press you know welcoming
our Steve and thanking Clinton for
bringing him back and so on and the
reason is because he's literate you know
and he's he got rich by paying attention
to what happens and he can see exactly
what's happening
Clinton consummated effectively the bush
clinton program they really weren't very
different to try to destroy the our
state government which is exactly what
they've done the first of all it's not
true that he restored our state
he put our state back for a couple of
months not for four and a half years
there is a constant there's although I
was talking about the Constitution says
he has to step down next December it
doesn't say that at all Constitution
says that the elected president has a
five-year term it doesn't say what's
supposed to happen when three years of
that five-year term are spent sitting in
Washington while us training thugs are
massacring the puppy
you know the destroying the popular
organizations that elected him
well Clinton has his view on that and
it's a hundred percent of the American
press agrees with him you have to go to
Canada to find this not very profound
observation made and he'll be back for a
couple of months fritz meds is quite
capable of reading the economic plan
that was rammed down our steeds throat
which says that a lot of nice words but
when you get to the central part World
Bank plan it says
something like this this is almost exact
it says the renovated government will
focus its energies on civil society
primarily the export sector and foreign
investors okay
meaning US investors are part of Haitian
civil society in fact the privileged
sector of Haitian civil society but not
the folks in slums are up in the
mountains they're not a relevant part of
Haitian civil society US aid is now back
with exactly the plans that it had prior
to the election namely cut back wages
drive people off the land so you have
more cheap labor turn Haiti into a
export platform where you get women
working you know for ten cents an hour
eleven hours a day and so on yeah
they're back to that they managed to in
fact what they've essentially done is
restore the it it's amazing that the I
mean you know I have spoken about this
around here some of you heard me talk
about it but immediately before the
right before the US forces landed they
landed on Monday the Sunday before that
the day before that I happen to be
monitoring the AP wires
figuring something's going to happen and
indeed something did happen there was a
huge story the biggest story of the week
which has yet to appear in you know in
Boston or New York or Washington the
story was that there had been a leak
from the Justice Department explaining
half the details of how oil continued to
flow to Haiti during the embargo I mean
everybody knew that oil was flowing in
fact fritzsche meds was building a huge
refinery so obviously oil was flowing
oil is the most important thing in any
sanctions and if the oil was flowing how
well turned out that it was flowing with
the authorization of the justices of the
Treasury Department under the Bush and
Clinton administration's fact apparently
right up till the end now you notice a
print that's the story of the day of the
interview
it what it said is there never any
sanctioned so whatever is going on it
wasn't that there were sanctions and now
you know we're restoring democracies
nothing else was going on well it would
be unfair to say that the story wasn't
published I had a friend in the library
through a nexus search and there was
nothing on Monday but maybe that was too
early but there was something on Tuesday
it was published in Platts oil gram
which is a journal for the oil industry
and on Wednesday it got into some of the
smaller journals around the country like
Dayton Ohio and things where people
don't have enough sense you know keep
out the wrong sort of things but take a
look in the Boston Globe or the New York
Times they did they're smarter so so far
we don't have them but Fritz meb's knows
it you know he knows that the Clinton
administration he also knows as the
press has also succeeded in suppressing
that US trade with Haiti was not all
that far below the norm under Bush and
went up 50% under Clinton that would it
takes a five minute phone call to the
Commerce Department they discovered that
one but no reporter is yet found it out
the if the fact of the matter is pretty
straightforward I think you can see it
now a bush it was the Bush
administration when the coup took when
the election took place they were
shocked you know nobody was paying
attention to what was going on in slums
they didn't know that all these people
were organizing vibrant civil society
and so on and they moved immediately to
undermine it even during our state's
term the US government did everything
they could undermine US government when
the coup took place either with or
without us connivance we don't know yet
the Bush administration moved quickly to
ensure that there would be no effective
sanctions Clinton simply extended that
in effect they told the generals look
you guys have a certain amount of time
to decimate the popular organizations
intimidate them kill off the leadership
and so on and so forth and when it's
done will tell you it's done and you can
go off and live the rest of your lives
and luxury and impunity of course and
that's what happened so that's what we
call restoring democracy now we're back
to where we were before the coup before
the election in fact
happy about it
they sure are yeah I mean suppose for
example that you're being subjected to
electric torture and the torturer
decides kindly to turn down the current
you'd be happy I mean that's
incidentally why I wasn't personally
against the intervention like if the
torturer asked me Shai turned down the
current I probably said yes
I wouldn't feel very proud about being
you know associated with the torturer
okay I'm not touching what you're saying
now these guys should not be called
conservatives I mean whatever it is you
shouldn't tarnish the good name of
conservatism by using the refer to these
statist reactionaries they're all
believers in powerful states not not
thanks to them not thanks to them they
fought against it and besides their look
takes a Massachusetts it losses on the
ballot every time under business
pressure and while there is technically
a progressive income tax which was
finally achieved through a lot of
popular struggle they've been cutting
away at it ever since if you look at
actual tax rates you know you look at
actual the percentage of one's income
that goes to taxes it's pretty flat
across the income distribution
well the best place to look the guy who
did the most detailed work on this is a
very you know a real conservative in the
real sense a joseph peckmon I think he's
dead now but he for years did analyses
of actual tax distribution if you count
in all the taxes including the
regressive ones you know like sales
taxes and stuff it turns out I forget
the exact numbers but it's you know like
I said at the very ends of the
distribution you get a little difference
but across the main distribution is
pretty flat
well like you I don't know what
middle-class means I mean middle-class
is just a term in the United States you
should disguise the fact that most of
the populations poor
you figure if you call people
middle-class they'll somehow feel okay
I'm part of things so everybody's
everybody says they're middle-class you
know even if they're earning $5,000 a
year
I want to thank you for mentioning this
news which I lived up in the Science
Library dr. crowler's nothing
and also to create a salamander
repeating with chop so it's easy to wipe
off my new things you are curious the
highly colorful salamander open
libraries halogen a 24 from
schizophrenic mother having tangential
thoughts and documents from of the
Boston Public Library I started
researching an electoral system of
Washington County New York for my mother
and where I had to take three hours to
apply the food stamp program guaranteed
accented by the ball to the US and I
wanted a pump and one of us was looking
for work certificate in California and I
want to teach in my high school
I got 800 on American history and how I
couldn't get there because I had been
detected might have for three hours to
sign up school I could walk to and I
wanna change the wall a release date
and the holy people
and you probably like that can actually
do something useful to society what I've
done is taken a sentence
yeah I'm glad you mentioned the Commerce
Department before because I believe it I
can prove prove that there's been fraud
committed by the Commerce Department
both in the Reagan administration and
under Ron Brown back
physical record here and anyone who can
watch the pages incredibly complicated
going
excuse me thank you we have to have
other people
[Music]
yeah I think they they get it right
thank you very much thank you thank you
[Music]
[Music]
here
[Music]
yeah if you put them on the table near
the door people can look at them then
[Music]
thank you thank you very much yes please
to whom do you direct the question okay
well I think your question could could
be taken in two senses one is can
third-world countries such as India
practice autonomous policy autonomous
economic policy the other sense in which
your question could be taken is what
sort of autonomous
[Applause]
so the other sense would be what sort of
autonomous economic policy could good
countries like India pursue well I'm
skeptical on the first count but I don't
think it's impossible it it is no longer
a bipolar world I think one of the
peculiarities of the Cold War period was
that it did allow room at least in the
name of non-alignment or what-have-you
for some third world countries to pursue
a course of autonomy within limits
dictated by the world system and I think
it's much less practicable today than it
used to be but for the larger economies
of the world it's not impossible and I
would certainly hold India China Brazil
and Mexico for example to be large
enough economies that they can pursue
autonomous policy now it's a different
matter that
you know some of them are simply not
trying to do so but the other question
is really you know it would take a whole
evening really do to get into what is an
autonomous policy how does in a country
like India engage in such a policy what
what would it mean you know in detail
how do you practice it I'd rather not
take up that question in the interest of
time
about what the inertia in society I
don't see any inertia in society what an
ER I don't know what inertia you're
talking about I mean if there was a
nurse in society would still live under
feudalism slavery
[Music]
final end depends on what people do I
mean there have been you know throughout
all of history there have been popular
movements that struggled against
depression and Authority sometimes they
win sometimes they lose if we want to
learn something about how you do it and
if we in fact if we want to learn
something about democracy we can learn
look at places like Haiti where in fact
well nobody was looking a major and
rather dramatic array of popular
movements developed under you know the
noses of the rich and got strong enough
so that they needed foreign power to
crush it well you know in the United
States there's no foreign power that can
crush it if we knew if we were willing
to commit ourselves to freedom and
democracy as much as impoverished
Haitian peasants I would change
everything
who says there sit no I don't think
they're more than look they have they
have power as long as you let them have
power there is no objective power in the
hands of transnational corporations if
if the population decides to dismantle
them they're finished
not somebody's going to come around it's
going to be changed by a long period of
intense popular struggle which means
education and understanding and
organization and reforms and defeats and
victories until finally you create a
better world that's the way everything's
happened in history that's right that's
always been true and poor people have
always come up that's why there's that's
why there is a welfare state
that's what look in in some ways the
situation in the world now is has a kind
of an eerie resemblance to what was
going on in England around the 1820s
that's the period when classical
economics was developed the stuff they
teach you in school David Ricardo and so
on now then it was England now it's the
world you know but that aside it's very
similar and it's kind of interesting to
see what happened you know like maybe
people were asking you your kind of
question then around 1820 this was the
period in which you know you know it was
the fur it was the period of ascendance
of modern capitalism that meant you had
to destroy people's belief that they had
human feelings and and that they had
what was in fact called a right to live
you had to eliminate the idea that
there's a right to live so when you read
the classical economists like say David
Ricardo they say it's an infringement of
natural Liberty and even science to
mislead people into believing that they
have rights other than their rights on
the labor market they don't have any
human rights and he says that's as
certain as the principles of gravitation
and out of that comes the whole you know
you there's a labor market the way
Malthus put it he's famous for the stuff
on population but he was a major
economist I said that would be if you
don't have inherited wealth and you
don't have you can't survive on the
labor market then go somewhere else
okay and somewhere else meant in those
days go to that colonies where they've
exterminated the population so it's open
well that they finally won like in the
1830s these guys basically won they took
political power they were now in a
position to create a world for it was
just England then
in which you you had no human rights
except the rights you got on the labor
market and your choices were try to
survive on the labor market go to a
workhouse prison or go somewhere else
perfect victory you know great if every
free market victory the only trouble was
that the British Army was at that time
involved mostly in putting down riot and
within a couple of years they had the
Chartist movement and the and the labor
movements began organizing and pretty
soon people got scared because they
realized that we can deny them the right
to live but they can deny ask the right
to rule
well the science fortunately is very
flexible you know it's not like physics
you can adapt it as you choose so the
science changed and by the time you get
to the mid century people like John
Stuart Mill or even you know
conservative economists like NASA a
senior they discovered that there is a
right to live and you start getting the
what becomes the foundations of the
modern welfare state well that's what
happened then now it's being tried on a
world scale you could ask you could ask
the same question in England that 1820s
[Applause]
you don't see the same thing you have
different things no you don't you always
until there is always going to be you
know until we finally get to utopia
there will always be some form of
authority in power but less and more
benign and we and more diffuse democracy
has extended autocracy has declined it's
not a it's not a straight path upwards
like we happen to be in a path downward
now but that's a constant struggle all
through history I don't understand your
point if you're saying are we how can we
get to a perfect world where nobody is
unpleasant to anyone else well I don't
know how to do that how can you make
changes that'll make things better we
all know how to do it
crime and what immigration
[Music]
well actually you know immigration is a
big issue in places like say California
but countrywide it's crying and welfare
that are the two big issues and as far
as immigration goes they should say you
know corporations are very split because
they need the cheap labor on crime
there's good work some of the best work
is by a actually the best work I noticed
by criminologists named William
Chambliss at the George Washington
University is one of the main
criminologists who also incidentally has
been running quite interesting studies
with the in a project with the
Washington police force where law
students and others go around in police
cars and just take transcripts of what's
happening and so on
and the general fact which everybody
knows in fact is that crime statistics
haven't changed a lot in the last 20
years or so the perception of crime has
changed it's I mean there are some
changes here and there but fundamentally
it's about the same in fact violent
crimes have been even declining it's as
he points out in fact it's not true that
the concern over crime compelled the
government to take steps it was quite
the other way around
hysteria over crime was whipped up by
Richard Nixon and you know a lot of
right-wing Democrats and so on and you
can understand why it's functional there
is a growing superfluous population
since the 1960s real wages have either
stagnated or in the Reagan years
actually declined there are more and
more people around who are like those
people who Ricardo was talking about you
know you can't serve and survive in the
labor market go somewhere else well
there's nowhere to go now
so what you do is lock him up and in the
Reagan years the incarceration rate
tripled well that's these are the basic
facts but and it was not because of
crime in fact most of that I don't have
the exact numbers in my head now but an
extraordinarily high
number of the people in jail are there
for non crimes they're there for what
they call victimless crimes like
possession you know you got a joint in
your pocket that's simply a technique
for throwing the black population in
jail
Chambliss points out on concludes on the
basis of his own studies which the most
intensive I know that the police have
simply declared the black males a
criminal population however I don't
think he's exactly right if you look at
his data that's not true because
criminals have constitutional rights and
as he shows they do not regard the black
population is having constitutional
rights so these these are you know the
there are if you call me something I'll
give you references but there are he's
got you know there are very good studies
where they you know people go with the
police and see what they do and they
don't treat anybody any black person was
having constitutional rights you know
break into houses you take people out
you toss them in jail
the we passed South Africa and Russia
back in the mid-80s in per capita
imprisonment actually last year you'll
be happy to know that we went back into
second place under the capitalist
reforms Russia is now a a little bit
ahead of us in locking up its population
they're sort of learning our values as
we're trying to teach them but we've
been you know we passed them in the 80s
and this huge growth of crime has
nothing to do with the increase of crime
and in fact it's not even aimed at
dealing with it so for example if you
look at the people in crime for most of
the people in jail are for drugs but if
you look at who's in jail it's not I
mean you try to find and say bankers or
a chemical company executives you know
anybody who's involved in the drug in
the center of the drug racket they are
like you know most of the big banks are
involved in money laundering the
chemical corporations the CIA pointed
out years ago
that they're sending down to Latin
America you know chemicals way beyond
the level of anything that's needed for
industrial purposes and if you look at
what they're sending it's the other kind
that they use for high-technology drug
you know
but relatively high technology drugs
like cocaine processing do you see those
guys in jail no what you see in jail is
black kids who they can't figure
anything else to do with if it was
Brazil you would send out the death
squads they come from the FBI yeah they
come for the FBI you know the FBI
publishes record regular records and
that's you know it varies a little bit
but it's pretty flat you know not no
major changes I mean there were big
changes around 1970 or so but there
haven't been recently in fact the last
couple of years it's actually Violent
Crimes actually declined that's not to
say that crime isn't a big problem you
know like it's terrifying a lot of
people and making their lives impossible
but the crime were isn't intended to
deal with it it's just bypassing it
completely and of course I think you
mentioned white-collar crime before
that's not even considered a crime in
fact the drug lord laws are very
carefully crafted for class interests so
takes a cocaine there's totally
different laws for crack and powder a
crack cocaine is very severe crime
that's the drug of choice in the ghetto
powdered cocaine is the drug of choice
out in the white suburbs virtually no
penalties you know it's all crafted on
very sharp glass lines
[Music]
[Music]
hey-ya
well you know it's we all know how to do
it I don't understand the question if
you I mean if you there are people on
the Boston Globe for example who would
be happy to publish the truth they don't
they're not gonna be able to do it
unless they have public support public
support means pressure you know it means
people going to day tutorial office
every day and saying how come you're
publishing these lies might just publish
this let's say and at for example the
Boston Media Group which unfortunately
isn't working anymore but when it was
working just a tiny group you know it's
just it's a media monitoring was already
scaring the local papers into you know
changing what they were doing doesn't
take much I mean you know the most
dramatic case is one that's in the front
pages right now East Timor East Timor is
now on the front pages just yesterday
although I know if they recorded two
days ago two American reporters who a
lot of you know Alan Aaron and Amy
Goodman were arrested and Indonesia
because they're trying to get to East
Timor again they tried to have a press
conference in Jakarta and the security
forces dragged him away right in front
of the cameras and so on but East Timor
is on the front pages like the globe has
had an OP it had not been the other day
from one of the main activists they'd go
to Victoria I mean that happened because
about ten people were working on it in
the country it doesn't exist did that
East Timor exist I mean you can't
imagine anything more marginal than East
Timor that's because people don't that's
because that's because people like us
don't do what people did about East
Timor that's the only reason it's not I
mean look it's not gonna happen there
they have no interest in pointing out
that the worst human rights violator in
the hemisphere is Columbia and it gets
more than half of our military aid going
up and Clinton what interest do they
have been publicizing that fact anymore
than they had an interest in publicizing
the fact that the US was the main
supplier of Indonesia for its genocide
and your genocide in East Timor have no
interest in that but in fact with
popular effort you you know these facts
get out they don't get out if you sit if
you sit in your room somewhere and it's
not that there's any secret everyone
knows exactly how to do it
[Music]
what about what
look there are there are a lot of
popular organizations there's a 50 years
is enough campaign going on now which
has all kinds of local groups operating
on it which is concerned with the World
Bank it's educating people about its
publishing things it's I mean it ranges
from calling for an end of the world
bank to radical modification of it
that's the way you educate people about
these things what other way could there
be I mean how did the Solidarity
movement with further Central America
developed which included hundreds of
thousands of people millions of people
and had a big effect you know it did not
happen by people sitting in the room and
asking how do I do something about we
know how to do it
[Music]
usual for example people are going to be
buying toys for Christmas for their
children and their children's friends
and they're not going to be paying a lot
of attention to the fact that I forget
the number but I think it's maybe 80% or
so of some high number percentage of
those toys are being made in East Asians
crematoria you know literally where
women are locked into factories and
burned to death if there's a if there's
a electrical switch breaks like in
Guangdong Province and in Thailand and
so on no they're not gonna be paying
attention to that when they buy the toys
I mean maybe they'll look and see if the
Bloods washed off or something but well
I know it was a rhetorical question
you're not really asking me for the
answer
and yeah the these are things that
people should know as to was the first
question out of our population well
actually there was a very good study of
that and what I'd recommend since there
isn't much time I think was very good by
a March SN you know him he's an
economist over at Harvard it was in the
New York Review a couple of months ago
he's an extremely good economist has
done very good work on this topic and he
pointed it he just went through in
detail what everybody knows who's looked
at it over PUC I mean you know if to the
extent if women have opportunities and
education and so on then fertility drops
so in India there's one state that one
of the poor I guess doesn't it Carol
must be one of the poorest state which
has I think that one of the highest
literacy rates and you know especially
for women and so on and fertility is way
down it's very cool and and you don't
have to kill people you know you don't
do anything like that you just have to
create opportunities in much of Europe
population growth is actually negative
at this point the genes didn't change
it's just that people have opportunities
and choices and you know they decide not
to have sex
if you're a poor person makes a lot of
sense to have a lot of children who's
gonna take care of you when you get old
you know maybe some of them will survive
like my mother's family no how do they
all talk about the blacks and so on I'm
an Ashkenazi Jew you know we're supposed
to be the highest IQ this that and the
other nonsense my mother's family had 11
as well that I know of 11 kids I'm not
sure how many because nobody counted the
ones who died you know well because they
were in East European family and you
just had a lot of kids that's the way
you survive you know some a lot of them
died some survived maybe some of them
take care of in your older you know yeah
you want to get rid of the problems of
too much population create create decent
circumstances for people to live in
incidentally the problems of the world
are not due to overpopulation so the
problem of overuse of resources for
example which is real has nothing to do
with population I mean it's rich people
like us who are using the overwhelming
mass of the resources you know and if
you want to cut down the problem of
overuse of resources cutting down the
birth rate in India has almost nothing
to do with
[Music]
we're one of Africa
we really
but is it really
here really I mean are you willing to
violate we all give
who says first of all who says there
would be any sense in doing
or you can if you want but that's almost
useless you know a idea is because the
effect if you were to give away let's
say you earned $60,000 a year and you
decided to give $55,000 of it away the
effect of that on changing the world if
you did that would be virtually
undetectable on the other hand if you
and I and other people work to change
social conditions the effect can be very
great and there's no particular reason
why incomes should go down
sure yeah in fact you're probably worse
off if you're in big salaries but that's
it these are individual choices which
are almost irrelevant to what happens to
people in the world I can say it because
it's true for example if you decide if
you decide that you're going to live as
a hermit on a desert island the
contribution that you will be making to
people starving in the streets of Brazil
is zero I can say it because it's true
and you know it's true okay let's if you
don't understand that it's true let you
tell me how you would help children
starving and a father in the father loss
of Rio if you decided to live on a
desert island how would you help them
would they would they note would they be
any better off they would be better off
if you stopped using resources well you
know perfectly you know perfectly you
know perfectly well that that's totally
irrelevant I mean the problem for them
is not that they would have no more
access to resources if you decided not
to have a television set than if you do
decide to have a television set oh if
you shared your resource not one person
yeah but then it's not a matter of an
individual because individuals can do
almost nothing what you can do is as a
group change social policy for example
if you want to affect the people in
Brazil change the policies of our
government which we're responsible for
which are driving them to that state
that will have an effect
you're
it ends it if you think that it begins
that yeah if you want it to begin an
individual level that's also where it
ends if I were you know running the
world
I would love people to have the proposal
that you're making because if
individuals decide to do something alone
to help people you can be sure that
that's not even going to be a P on a
mountain the way changes take place is
when people work together to to bring
about significant changes in social
policy well then how are we disagree
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I don't think that evil has a lot to do
with it I mean let's suppose I mean I'm
not sure I understand your what you're
saying let's take say let's take some
institution that has power like say
General Motors ok totalitarian
institution which has a lot of power in
the world well it has a board of
directors now does it matter whether the
people there are nice guys or bad guys I
mean they have a certain institutional
role if they stop playing that
institutional role they'll be kicked out
and somebody else will be put in if you
could have a golf date with one of the
directors of General Motors and you
convinced them look what you ought to be
doing is using your resources to improve
the working conditions of the workers
and making better cars cheaper and so on
suppose you convinced him fine then they
throw them out and somebody else comes
in I mean because it's an institutional
fact that the guys who are running that
thing are going to be increasing market
share and well yeah
[Music]
[Music]
Sam in the defense look I have friends
who I know people who were so working in
the millet friends actually who were
working in the military system and you
know just actually some of them right
around here like Henry Kendall his Nobel
Prize winning physicist here was inside
the military planning system and decided
at one point he just didn't want to be
part of that okay and there are plenty
of other people like that
so okay they drop out but the system
doesn't change no oh that's easy
yeah try reading Hitler's diary someday
go to the out to the it's useful you go
to the lower depths of the human species
and look at what Himmler was writing
about he was describing how courageous
he is and how honorable and how he's
defending human values and Clinton you
know protecting the fundamental you know
principles of the highest civilization
in the world from this that and the
other thing he even had distinguished
philosophers putting it in ten syllable
words for him like Heidegger who was
explaining at the peak of the Nazi
period how the peak of the Nazi period
how Germany represents the civilization
of the Greeks and as the inheritor the
civilization of the Greeks the only
authentic civilization and has to defend
it against the barbarians of east and
west and so on and so forth I mean you
know there's nothing you can't justify
option you probably believed it what
what does that have to do with anything
has nothing to do with it look every one
of us knows for Marren experiences that
people can internalize beliefs that are
useful to them okay and it's you know
one of the things you naturally want to
do is find those beliefs in yourself and
help other people find them and
dismantle them and try to see the world
as it is but it doesn't have a lot you
know there are evil evil people but the
problems we're talking about don't have
to do with that they have to do with
institutional structures like when Adam
Smith was talking about the merchants
and manufacturers who are designing
state policy and they are interest in
harming the people of England he wasn't
saying look they're immoral people
they're not they're just working within
an immoral system and anyone who works
in it is going to do harm so I changed
the system you convinced one of those
people somebody else comes in takes
their place because these are
institutional some facts
[Music]

the water of the US economy
[Music]
now that's a big subject III think it's
it's obvious that that the trends are
all downward it's it's it's also been
clear for the past 20 years that real
wages haven't gone anywhere that the
position of significant parts of the
population has actually deteriorated and
meanwhile you can you can see also in
the sabre-rattling of our economic
policy makers and leaders in this
country visa vie their competitors
abroad in fact Clinton claims that his
main mission in Southeast Asia is to
make Southeast Asia's safe for US
exports that's an example of what I mean
by sabre-rattling and imposing voluntary
policies their favorable to the US one
other countries these are all signs I
think of of declining competitiveness
and so on there's nothing inevitable
about this I don't believe that this is
all fated and so on
so by the same token I don't think
there's anything
inevitable about a collapse and the date
of the collapse it seems to me that you
know much like any any third-world
country whether the US can do something
about these problems will very much
depend on how their political systems
operate and whether the people will
become more proactive and and exercise
their their rights and powers and
and make the right policies happen but
to just give you one example the
graduated tax and Massachusetts which
was shot down under a barrage of
ideological claims that this would
destroy or marginally destroy the
Massachusetts economy even though you
know that the only basis that exists
suggests in fact the opposite conclusion
it was well financed the campaign won
out and the people of Massachusetts have
lost out here's an example where if if
people you know will wake up and do
something about it and not buy for
example the the contract on America on
America then I think something can be
done so none of this again is inevitable
I don't know if that answers your
question
I think even if and when
if and when an ethical economy comes
into place that would be a revolution
well for sure now well what what sort of
revolution must precede that revolution
I think you know is something that we
can think about talk about and do about
and again nothing is foreclosed it it
isn't clear to me that that everybody
should do just one sort of thing in
order to create the revolution I think
creating the revolution takes all kinds
of talents all kinds of people all kinds
of you know actions and activities and
so you know I again I it's not it's not
obvious to me that there is one
blueprint kind of solution for getting
from here there it's going to be
difficult I mean that much is clear but
I don't think there's a single path
converging onto the the what you call
ethical economy
[Applause]
on behalf of the Alliance and everyone
here I would really like to thank two
speakers thank you very much
[Applause]
turned out that it was flowing with the
authorization of the justices of the
Treasury Department under the Bush and
Clinton administration's fact apparently
right up till the end now you note
that's the story of the day of the
intervention it what it said is there
never any sanctions so whatever's going
on it wasn't that there were sanctions
and now you know we're restoring
democracies nothing else was going on
well it would be unfair to say that the
story wasn't published I had a friend in
the library through a nexus search and
there was nothing on Monday but maybe
that was too early but there was
something on Tuesday it was published in
Platts oil grant which is a journal for
the oil industry and on Wednesday it got
into some of the smaller journals around
the country like Dayton Ohio and things
where people don't have enough sense you
know to keep out the wrong sort of
things but to take a look at the Boston
Globe or the New York Times they did
they're smarter so so far we don't have
them but Fritz meb's knows it you know
he knows that the Clinton administration
he also knows as the press has also
succeeded in suppressing the US trade
with Haiti was not all that far below
the norm under Bush and went up 50%
under Clinton that it takes a
five-minute phone call to the Commerce
Department to discover that one but no
reporter has yet found it out the if the
fact of the matter is pretty
straightforward I think you can see it
now Bush it was the Bush administration
when the coup took when the election
took place they were shocked you know
nobody was paying attention what was
going on in the slums they didn't know
that all these people were organizing
vibrant civil society and so on and they
moved immediately to undermine it even
during our state's term the US
government did everything they could to
undermine his government when the coup
took place and it says something like
this this is almost exact it says the
renovated government will focus its
energies on civil society primarily the
export sector and foreign investors okay
meaning US investors are part of Haitian
civil society and in fact the privilege
Durov Haitian civil society but not the
folks in slums or up in the mountains
they're not a relevant part of Haitian
civil society u.s. aid is now back with
exactly the plans that it had prior to
the election namely cutback wages
drive people off the land so you have
more cheap labor turn Haiti into a
export platform where you get women
working you know for ten cents an hour
eleven hours a day and so on yeah
they're back to that they managed to in
fact what they've essentially done is
restore the it's amazing that the I mean
you know I have spoken about this around
here some of you heard me talk about it
but immediately before the right before
the US forces landed they landed on on
Monday the Sunday before that the day
before that I happen to be monitoring
the AP wires
figuring something's going to happen and
indeed something did happen there was a
huge story the biggest story of the week
which has yet to appear in you know in
Boston or New York or Washington the
story was that there had been a leak
from the Justice Department explaining
half the details of how oil continued to
flow to Haiti during the embargo I mean
everyone knew that oil was flowing in
fact Fritz meb's was building a huge
refinery so obviously oil was flowing
oil is the most important thing in any
sanctions and if the oil was flowing how
will for the for the most of the past
three years the Narasimha Rao government
did not really have a majority far from
it being a thumping majority nonetheless
narsimha Rao has had the impunity really
to hardly be present in Parliament to
answer questions the the parliamentary
committees report on the scan the
Harshad Mehta scam has been essentially
some early dismissed body by the current
government and last of all it seems to
me that
the way in which take for example the
national debate over gap and the then
Dunkel proposals concerning intellectual
property rights etc were proceeding it
was simply unprecedented that that
government should move discussion on
these issues in Parliament at the
eleventh hour I don't think this ever
happened in in narrows time this is not
to say of course and that part of your
point is well-taken that indeed the
organs of decision-making have always
had a high degree of centralization as
Chomsky was quoting Adam Smith as say
but I think there is an important
difference of degree which which we
ought to recognize
the speakers will now take questions
there are two mics in the two aisles and
please line up and they request that you
keep your comments and questions brief
so that everyone gets a chance to get
this in
reproduction higher chances for the
greater accessibility produce purchasing
power
today
I think that's a debatable issue in the
days of narrow in the 50s for example
even with a thumping majority which the
Congress party which narrows party had
you had how the parliamentary debates
you had parliamentary committees that
were consulted with and whose
recommendations were frequently taken
seriously in the past three years well
you have to do is look at who's happy
and who's said I think tells you a lot
the happiest person in Haiti apparently
is Fritz mins
who's the spokesman for the biggest and
richest family in Haiti and one of the
major coup supporters he's in fact
circulating tens of thousands of posters
all over poor depressed you know
welcoming our Steve and thanking Clinton
for bringing him back and so on and the
reason is because he's literate you know
and he's he got rich by paying attention
to what happens and he can see exactly
what's happening Clinton consummated
effectively the bush clinton program
they really weren't very different to
try to destroy the rst government which
is exactly what they've done the first
of all it's not true that he restored
our state he put our state back for a
couple of months not for four and a half
years there is a constant a there's all
there was talking about the Constitution
says he has to step down next December
it doesn't say that at all Constitution
says that the elected president has a
five-year term it doesn't say what's
supposed to happen when three years of
that five-year term are spent sitting in
Washington while us-trained thugs are
massacring the puppy you know the
destroying the popular organizations
that elected him
well Clinton
his view on that and it's a hundred
percent of the American press agrees
with him you have to go to Canada to
find this not very profound observation
made and he'll be back for a couple of
months fritz moves is quite capable of
reading the economic plan that was
rammed down our steeds throat which says
that a lot of nice words but when you
get to the central part World Bank plan
