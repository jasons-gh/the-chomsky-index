does Donald Trump have a coherent policy
in the Middle East is there a real
scandal with his connection with the
Russians and is the survival of the
human species in jeopardy i sat down
with professor Noam Chomsky for this
wide-ranging conversation but here in
part one we're gonna focus on events in
Syria professor Chomsky thank you for
taking the time to be with us let's
start with Trump strikes on Syria the
most recent ones on the air base
following the chemical attack which was
widely blamed on the Syrian government a
lot of people see the strikes as
political theater for domestic us
consumption where Trump is trying to
distract from hope from his low ratings
from his policies that he could not push
and it was seen as a way to unite both
Republicans and Democrats behind him and
kind of like build this image of a tough
president but others see this as a
signal of a drastic shift in u.s.
foreign policy and really Trump's entire
worldview it seems and I'm just curious
how do you read it well there's no
indication of any policy decision behind
it
it looks like a single act which is
understood on all sides to have been
nothing more than a signal so they hit
an basically empty airbase
day later planes were flying from it it
had no military significance so it's
very plausible to believe that this is
Trump's way of saying look I'm tougher
than Obama that we sort of forget the
fact that Trump strongly supported
Obama's position of not striking back at
the time of the chemical weapons but
that's history no he can say look how
tough I am Obama's responsible
and I presume it's something like that
but you really can't tell the
administration spokespersons are all
over the place
nikki Haley at the UN is very aggressive
Rex Tillerson Secretary of State is
waffling says essentially nothing Trump
himself probably barely knows what's
going on and we have whether there's any
meaningful plan behind this looks pretty
dubious but what would it be plausible
that he actually was moved as he claimed
he was that by seeing the images of
children that this is what actually made
him take action it's possible but then
why one has to ask other questions like
why hasn't he moved by the fact that
Saudi Arabia and our which we strongly
support with with our age is imposing
starvation and massacre on tens of
thousands of people in Yemen why not be
moved by that plenty of things to be
moved by if there's also questions it's
at least that could be asked about just
what happened there are some pretty
credible voices that are skeptical about
the charge that Syria was involved
Lawrence Wilkerson is one people are not
easily dismissed so at the very least
there should have been an inquiry into
what happened zooming out a little bit
and looking at the big picture in Syria
there was a time when this was a popular
uprising six years ago and it was very
easy to just say the correct outcome is
the democratization of Syria but at this
stage six years later it looks like a
proxy war of the worst order very
unsavory characters they're competing
and the forces who are really pushing
for a free democratic Syria don't seem
to have a particularly powerful position
right now in the country given that
we're in the mess we're in today what do
you think is the most realistic desired
outcome at this stage and what should
the u.s. role being I mean if you take a
look at what's happening there's
very little doubt that the substantial
mass of the atrocities are the
responsibility of the Assad regime and
the Russians back them but the main
priority now should be defined ways just
lessen the violence
I mean it's tearing the country to
shreds the country is descending to
suicide so any acts that can be taken to
lessen the level of violence let local
ceasefires moves toward some kind of
potential diplomatic settlement those
are high priorities along with something
much simpler aid to the people who need
it there's this plenty of people who can
be reached who are in need and are not
being helped although there seems to be
some humanitarian fatigue basically this
problem has gone on for so long without
a prospect of a political solution a lot
of people credit that with the fact that
people are getting more numb to the
suffering of Syrians because this has
gone on long thereafter they have always
been numb the funding for humanitarian
aid has been very low notice that we're
supposed to believe that Trump was
horrified by the sight of a couple of
dozen babies apparently killed by a
chemical warfare this is the same person
who's blocking any entry of any Syrians
to the United States so just by accident
at the same time that the chemical
warfare the chemical alleged chemical
attack took place I happen to get a
email letter from somebody who was
coming here to interview me he's born
will mention his name he's born in
Germany lives in England
he happens to be originally Syrian he's
involved with the anti-assad Syrian
writers Union he couldn't come because
it was blocked by US security officers
at Heathrow Airport that happen T the
same time what about these people who
are fleeing
I mean what's called the refugee crisis
is really a severe moral crisis in the
West the United States particularly but
Europe as well so if you're moved by the
sight of Syrian children being killed
then help them can be done okay that's
quite apart from the effort to try to
move towards some kind of reduction of
violence and opening to a political
settlement which is not going to be
attractive there's no attractive outcome
now you're quite right that at the
beginning it was a popular uprising
which merited strong support but what's
left of it is pretty hard to see in the
current situation I want to move over to
Palestine this dichotomy between one
state and two states that those are not
the options there's another option the
one that is in fact being pursued
