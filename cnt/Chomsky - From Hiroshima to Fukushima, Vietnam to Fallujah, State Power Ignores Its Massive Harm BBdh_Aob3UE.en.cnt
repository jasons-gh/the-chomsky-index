the war and peace report I'm Amy Goodman
we end our Fukushima anniversary special
with the words of the rural world
renowned political dissident linguist
offer MIT professor Noam Chomsky who
also travelled to Tokyo last week Noam
Chomsky is now 85 years old he met with
survivors from Fukushima including
families who evacuated the area their
meeting was filmed by the independent
online media channel our planet TV this
is professor Chomsky speaking in Japan
particularly horrifying that this is
happening in Japan which with its unique
horrendous experiences with the effect
of nuclear explosions we don't have to
discuss and of course it's particularly
horrifying when it's happening to
children who are defenseless innocent
but unfortunately this is what happens
all the time I mean I had two daughters
about they were about the age of your
daughter they would come home from
school telling us how in school they
were taught to hide under desks in case
there was a nuclear war this was right
after the Cuban Missile Crisis when the
world came very close to the clear war
and children were very upset I mean I
knew children who were friends of
families that were sure they were never
going to survive because the world is
going to be destroyed by a nuclear war
but the official line was don't worry
everything's under control the same was
true again my daughters when they were
about her age we stopped feeding the
milk because the scientists who were
concerned recognized that there was a
very high level of strontium 90
the milk that was coming from atomic
explosions the US was carrying out many
open-air explosions and the government
assure everyone that there's no problem
but we just a lot of people like us just
stopped feeding the children gave them
only powdered milk which came from
before the explosions it's it happens
all the time so right now for example in
Iraq there's a city Fallujah which was
attacked by US forces using weapons but
no one understands but they leave a high
level of radiation and there's studies
by Iraqi and American doctors showing a
very high level of cancer among children
far higher than before in the whole
neighborhood of Fallujah but the
government denies it the US government
denies it the Iraqi government is
doesn't function the international
organizations refused to look so it's
all being carried out by independent
organizations and citizens groups and
this is simply everywhere I mean in 1961
the United States began the chemical
warfare in Vietnam South Vietnam
chemical warfare to destroy crops and
livestock that went on for seven years
of the level of poison they used the
most extreme carcinogen known dioxin and
it's been off of years
enormous effects in South Vietnam their
children today being born in Saigon
hospitals that deformed children and
horrible deformations government refuses
to investigate they've investigated
effects on American soldiers but not on
the South Vietnamese there's almost no
study of it except for independent
citizens groups it's can add case after
case but it's a horrifying story and
particularly horrifying for you because
you're suffering from it but that's the
way governments operate they protect
themselves from their own citizens
governments regard their own citizens as
their main enemy and they have to be
protect themselves that's why you have
state secret laws citizens are not
supposed to know what their government
is doing to them just to give one final
example when Edward Snowden's
revelations appeared the head of US
intelligence james clapper testified
before congress that no telephone
communications of americans are being
monitored there's outlandish lie lying
to congress is a felony go to jail for
years not a word governments are
supposed to lie to their citizens author
