hello hi yes all right bud can you hear
us fine I can hear you now yeah that's
fantastic be ready to get started yeah
we are when you are yeah thanks very
much for joining us we really appreciate
it we've got some questions from sort of
a broad range of students there's a
broad spectrum of questions on different
things but we're going to try and ask as
many as possible in the sort of time
frame that we have so we get started
yeah what does the election of Benjamin
Netanyahu mean for the prospect of peace
and a Palestinian state there's a bit of
confusion about that matter actually
Benjamin Netanyahu's administration
first administration in 1996 is the
first one that he was even willing to
pronounce the words Palestinian state
when Shimon Peres considered at of left
office in 1996 his parting words very
outspoken were that there will never be
a Palestinian state when Netanyahu came
in his minister of information was asked
by the press with her they would
continue that policy of total rejection
ISM which had been the us-israeli
position without a break and the
minister said well we're planning to
leave certain fragments of territory to
the Palestinians and if they like they
can call it a state or they can call it
fried chicken that was the first
acknowledgement of a state the Labour
Party basically never acknowledged the
possibility us but the question always
is what do you mean who I say do you
mean fried chicken or do you mean what's
been meant by the very broad
international consensus at the US and
Israel have blocked for over 30 years
that first entered the international
agenda in 1976 when the Arab states
the sport of the PLO brought a
resolution to the Security Council
calling for a settlement on the
international border the Green Line
accord with un 242 main document but
added the 242 that there should be a
Palestinian state and the
israeli-occupied territories well Israel
refused to attend the session of the
United States feet to the resolution I
happened again in 1980 I run through the
history of just take a crucial point in
1988 the Palestinian National Council
the highest body formally accepted the
two-state settlement of the
international consensus and the US and
Israel reacted a few months later the
coalition government of Israel that's
Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Shamir issued a
declaration saying their words there can
be no additional Palestinian state
between Jordan and Israel meaning we
declare Jordan to be a Palestinian state
and there can't be another one and the
u.s. fact that the Baker plan of this
number nineteen eighty-nine said yes we
fully accept the Israeli position and so
it continues up until the present
there's been one exception in the last
35 years that didn't january two
thousand and one at the end of clinton's
term at the end of clinton's term he
issued what he called his parameters for
a settlement kind of vague but more or
less in accord with the international
consensus and then he gave a speech in
which he said both sides have accept the
accepted the parameters both sides have
reservations they met top negotiators of
israel and palestine met in Taba Egypt
in January to iron out the reservations
and they came very close to a settlement
in their last press conference they said
with a few more days we'll be finished
and there's a lot known about it
a lot of material and Hebrew and English
as well so we know the details of it but
it was called off prematurely by Prime
Minister Barack of Israel and there's
been no formal continuation since so
when you talk a bit right now the issues
between Israel in the United States are
two things will Netanyahu pronounce the
word state and what will happen with the
settlements and really doesn't matter
whether Netanyahu or Obama or bush or
anyone else pronounces the word state
they have to say what they mean is it
going to be the international consensus
or is it going to be fried chicken and
on that they're suitably vague in fact
not quite the egg because the US has now
endorsed the major annexation proposals
of the Israel in the West Bank which
everyone agrees across the border
illegal you know can't move violation of
the Geneva Conventions fact Israel was
informed of that by its highest legal
authorities in 1967 and confirmed it's
been confirmed by Security Council the
World Court and so on so but the Bush
administration did authorize Israel to
take over unspecified areas of the West
Bank and an exome that we know what it
means I mean Prime Minister Olmert
described the Congress joint session of
Congress called his convergence plan in
effect it means that Israel takes over
everything within the what ought to be
called the annexation wall it's called a
separation defense actually an
annexation wall takes over everything
there which is critically important that
means not only the nice suburbs of
Jerusalem and Tel Aviv up in the hills
it means greater Jerusalem which is
vastly expanded over Jerusalem and
critically it means taking over the
aquifer the water supplies that Israel
now uses about I think four-fifths of
them according to a recent
World Bank a court report there in the
West Bank but Israel uses them and if
they an ex that in accord with the u.s.
position on they get control of the
water supplies also the Jordan Valley
from which Palestinians are increasingly
excluded which imprisons what's left and
a couple of salience that run through
the whole region basically breaking it
up into Canton's now if that's what you
mean by a state you know what's left
it's fried chicken it's not a state and
Obama has indicated hasn't said but he's
indicated that that's what he means he's
very evasive but the clearest position
that he's expressed was in his actually
his one declaration about Israel
Palestine when he appointed George
Mitchell gave a talk at State Department
and he welcomed the he went out of his
way to welcome the Arab League proposal
2002 Saudi proposal accepted by the Arab
League which was in accord with the
international consensus called for
Tuesday settlement on the international
border maybe with minor and mutual
modifications it's the terminology that
was used back in the late sixties us
terminology the and then he a Saudi plan
added that in the context of that
settlement the Arab states should move
towards normalization of relations with
Israel now if you read Obama statement
carefully what he welcomed the Arab
League plan he said is very constructive
and the Arab states should move forward
right away with normalization of
relations with Israel but he he knows
what he understands he can think things
through and what he omitted is critical
he did not include the core of their
resolution he just said go ahead with
the corollary you know proceed to
normalize but you know it's perfectly
well that was not the proposal and
that's a can only be understood as an
indirect way of saying that the US
continues to reject the
core of the consensus on a two-state
settlement so he's talking about
apparently as fried chicken as made it
explicit with regard to the Senate so
that means if there is a settlement that
you know the political settlement in
these terms it means that Israel
essentially takes over what on earth
described Prime Minister all-american
the couple years ago as the convergence
plan what I just outlined and that
essentially leaves nothing I mean there
will be areas but unviable unviable the
there's a this is an extra part of this
which is even worse there was a proposal
from the extreme right in Israel Avigdor
Lieberman's now foreign minister when I
was proposed it was considered virtually
in neo Nazi
