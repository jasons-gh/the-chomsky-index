time now for part two of my exclusive
interview with Noam Chomsky in which the
professor gives us his take on the
global impact of the u.s. presidential
race and the rise of Islamophobia I
began by asking him if he wants to see
senator Bernie Sanders the self-styled
socialist candidate for the Democratic
nomination in the White House come
November first of all Bernie Sanders may
use the word socialist but he's
basically a new dealer now in the
current American political spectrum is
to be a new dealers to be we way out on
the Left yes
Eisenhower for example who said anyone
who questions the New Deal doesn't
belong in the political system would be
guarded a raving leftist so Bernie
Sanders is a decent honest new dealer I
agree with him in a lot of things not
other things I frankly think that our
system of mainly bought elections he
doesn't have much of a chance but if he
were like I think he would of the
current candidates I think he'd be the
one who would have from my point of view
the best policies and so they don't say
it's a charade there are differences in
the parties I don't think they're great
differences but they're real and small
differences in a system of great power
can have enormous consequence you'll say
actually if it's Hillary Clinton versus
Donald Trump or Ted Cruz vote Hillary
Clinton the lesser of two evils is your
preferred candidate of her versus a
Republicans well it's it's exactly what
I've said in every previous election if
you happen to be saying Massachusetts
where we are now which is a safe state
for the Democrats so you can vote any
way you want or not vote if you happen
to be in a swing state we're it's going
to have an effect on who becomes
president
you should definitely vote I mean if
you're in Ohio this November you vote
Clinton rather than Donald Trump Hotel
absolutely just as I would into that I
didn't like Obama but I said exactly the
same thing there is there's a Hillary
has the although if you were in a sweet
Estelle let's put it that way
my vote would be against the Republican
candidate if you abstain that means
you're giving a vote for the Republic
just out of interest very briefly if you
had to sum up somebody says to you
professor Chomsky I've read your books
I've looked at u.s. foreign policy I've
seen Hillary Clinton I've seen you know
President George Bush they all seem the
same to me why should I vote for Clinton
against the Republicans in a sentence or
two what would you say is a difference
between Hillary Clinton and say Ted Cruz
that makes it worth voting for her
against Cruz are there enormous
difference it's some up for me what you
think it is carpet bombing Syria for
example is a difference Ted Cruz has
easy problem with this carpet bomber
what's the effect of carpet bombing you
okay take say the nuclear deal with Iran
every Republican says they're going to
kill it you know that's I assume if they
do that would isolate the United States
it would presumably continue between
Europe and Iran but that would be a very
big step backwards it takes a the one of
the maybe the biggest problem we face
destruction of the environment every
Republican candidate is either a climate
change denier or a skeptic who says you
can't do it what they're just a minute
what they are saying is let's destroy
the world is that worth voting against
yeah there was a meeting in Paris which
could not come up with a binding treaty
the major reason was it couldn't get
past the Republican Congress same thing
domestically the policies are quite
different which it's interesting you say
that and I agree with you there are
quite different so if I mentioned to you
the neuroscientist and liberal atheist
author Sam Harris who you've had an
online debate with he says he'd rather
Republican candidate ben Carson who said
a Muslim shouldn't be President and has
compared Syrian refugees to dogs
he said that Harris has said he would
rather Carson be present at the United
States than you because Carson
apparently gets the threat from
so-called jihadi terrorists that you
don't what's your response to Sam Harris
who claims to be liberal I don't bother
with Sam Harris
this is he his he specializes in
hysterical slanderous
charges against people he doesn't like
that's of no interest to me
am I not concerned with jihad a
terrorism I'm much more concerned with
it than he is I've been at that's why I
say you don't just scream at it you look
at the roots you try to figure out how
to deal with it you respond to it I
don't take him seriously I don't see any
point talking about it but well some
people say the point about talking about
it was we live in an environment where
Islamophobia is on the rise in the
United States across the West there are
some who say that the New Atheists
people like Sam Harris Richard Dawkins
the late Christopher Hitchens were
Islamophobes are Islamophobes a guilty
of an almost obsessive anti-muslim
bigotry which is worrying in the current
climate do you share that view I don't
talk about them first of all Anthony
truth Dawkins it might have been true of
Hitchens in his later years Harris I
assume denies it but when I read what he
says that's what it looks like however
the problem of Islamophobia is of course
serious just like the problem of
anti-semitism in Syria this is much
worse Islamophobia now for one thing it
is undermining us if Islamophobe it's
apart from what it's doing to decent
honorable people who are subject to
denunciation physical attacks blocking
of the possibilities for decent life
what's happening with Syrian refugees
and so on apart from all that it's
harmful to the West
Islamophobia leads to proposals like
let's carpet bomber that
let's hit them with a sizing that just
take a look at what it's led to in the
last 15 years there's been in what's
called a global war on terror when it
began there's been one device to deal
with it
sledgehammer smash them up don't find
out what's going on smash them up what's
happened 15 years ago it was calm buck
it was confined to a tiny tribal area in
Afghanistan now it's all over the world
every time you hit it with a
sledgehammer you expand it every single
time Afghanistan Iraq Libya everywhere
can you learn something
then shall we say okay let's smash them
up again because they all want to kill
us
yeah that's one reaction another
reaction is the same reaction what you
do hear from people like who know
something about the topic like Scotty
Tron are like William Polk will know a
Middle East expert long experience and
the US government has pretty much the
same proposals you have to deal with
situation rationally if you want to be
first of all humane but even concerned
with your own security you're 87 years
old you've written more than a hundred
books taught for more than half a
century you're known globally you've
made massive contributions in the field
of linguistics in foreign policy
international relations and yet your
ideas your worldview has never really
gone mainstream especially here in the
United States does that depress you that
you're not living in anywhere kind of
like the society you would like to that
the foreign policy isn't the way you'd
want it to be that you haven't had that
impact here I never anticipated living
in Utopia if I was in the mainstream I'd
begin to ask myself what I'm doing wrong
there have been not because of me but
many people there has been notable
progress over the years not uniform
there's regression as well but in many
respects it's a more civilized world
than it was before
when George Bush and Tony Blair decided
to invade Iraq was the first time in the
history of imperialism and that was
imperialism straight out that there was
massive protest even before the war was
officially launched didn't stop the war
but I think it restricted it they could
never use the modes that were used by
Lyndon Johnson for example well that's
progress in other respects there's
progress to take something like women's
rights huge difference in the last 50
years civil rights mixed differences
this is a concern over the environment
that's a matter of life and death of the
species it's quite different from what
it was 20 30 years ago and in many
respects there is slow progress set up
to mist about the future look you have
two choices you can say I'm a pessimist
nothing's going to work I'm giving up
I'll help ensure that the worst will
happen or you can grasp on to the
opportunities that do exist the rays of
hope that exist and say well maybe we
make it a better world how much of a
choice then John see that's the
gentleman up front
