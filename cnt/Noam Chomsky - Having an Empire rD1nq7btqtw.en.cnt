in many of you works illustrate the
economic doctrines that America imposes
on other countries like asymmetric free
trade agreements and overthrowing
leaders outright to just exploit
resources and labor power so what I was
wondering is is it necessary for us to
do this if we want the American economy
to prosper well first of all remember
it's the u.s. is just following on the
path of every other imperial power and
it's not you know new circumstances but
it's doing what Britain did what France
did what other great powers have done in
their day in the Sun and it's easily
understandable the question that you're
raising is quite an interesting one so
what's the impact of this on the
American population does the American
population gain from it well you know
it's pretty hard to measure precisely
but in the case of the British Empire
which has a much longer history there
have been attempts by economic
historians to try to do a cost-benefit
analysis of the British Empire
so like how much did they gain how much
did it cost its imprecise you can't put
much faith in the figures there's too
many variables but the rough conclusion
rather rough conclusion seems to be that
the costs and benefits more or less
balance that there's a lot of benefits
there's a lot of costs and they're kind
of in the same range roughly so why have
an empire well the answer to that comes
out as soon as you ask who paid the
costs who got the gains okay if you look
at that it turns out that the British
Empire is essentially class war internal
to England the people who had the gains
you know are the people who had shares
in East India Company you know the the
banks in the City of London and so on
and so forth enormous gains who paid the
costs well you know the sailors who were
dragoon into the British Navy the
the poor or the poor population and so
on so it's essentially a form of class
war I think if you look at the American
dominated system it's pretty similar so
take say the war in Vietnam which I
discussed for for Saturday the planners
understood what they were doing they
wanted to destroy that virus before it
spread contagion same reasons why they
imposed dictatorships at the same time
in Indonesia you know Thailand
Philippines and so on you know kind of
like South America so from their point
of view it was a success they killed the
virus they prevented contagion the
region didn't move towards independent
development it'll a long way from it and
it remains pretty much under Western
domination not exactly everything they
wanted but pretty much how about the
costs well you know sixty thousand
American soldiers were killed severe
economic problems within the country
let stagflation in fact it laid the
basis for the developments that took
place in the 1970s by severely harming
the economy then comes all the things
that follow and I think if you take a
look case by case it's sort of like that
I'll take the Iraq invasion it's
probably several trillion dollars
thousand soldiers killed pretty big you
know it it sharply increased terrorism I
don't know how you put an measure on
that but as predicted it was predicted
that the Iraq invasion would increase
terrorism the intelligence agencies
predicted that the British and American
of independent experts and it did a
terrorism went up by a factor of seven
that's big the year after the invasion
and it's spread well beyond it led to a
it led it increased the perception in
the Muslim world which is very high that
the u.s. isn't a war
Islam you take a look at polls in the
Arab world Muslim world there's an
overwhelming feeling that the u.s. is at
war with Islam and that you know that
not only provides a basis kind of a
reservoir for terrorism we got to defend
ourselves but also just strong and anti
US feelings would show up in all kinds
of ways how do you measure that you know
you can't put a number on it but it's
certainly harmful to the people of the
country and their future well that's the
downside the upside is you know whatever
you win from it was not most of the
population but others and I think that
if you look I think it's a very
important question and should be looked
at frankly I don't think that it's the
right criterion to determine whether an
invasion is correct or whether terrorism
act like you don't ask suppose Hitler
had actually won the war well would it
have benefited the German population
that's not the right question you know
but nevertheless though it's not the
right question you can ask it and you
can ask it for the British Empire for
French atrocities in Africa which are
horrendous US policy and so on and I
think if you look at it it usually turns
out to be something roughly like this
it's kind of internal class war within
the Imperial Society
