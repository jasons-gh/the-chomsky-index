okay okay everybody okay can you hear us
yes okay good evening my name is Eduardo
Kodava and I'm presently the chair of
the Edward W Saeed class of 57 Memorial
Lecture Committee and on behalf of the
committee the Department of English and
the student-run Princeton Committee on
Palestine I would like to welcome you to
the seventh annual lecture in our series
this year we are honored and pleased
that professor Noam Chomsky has kindly
agreed to be with us tonight before
introducing him I'd like to offer a few
thanks and to say a few words about the
lecture series first of all I'd like to
thank the members of the lecture
committee and especially izia Mian for
the role he played in professor
Chomsky's kind acceptance of our
invitation and the students on the
Princeton Committee on Palestine
especially ul baton the current
president of the PCP and Sara Musa for
everything they've done to make this
event possible thank you
although this is a seventh lecture in
our series this is only the second year
that the lecture has been supported by
endowed funds and so I also wish to
thank some our Eunice Nabil kadu me and
Carl chastening for their very generous
and kind support we're especially
pleased that mr. Shasta is able to be
with here with us tonight and I think
he's right here yes it's open thank you
we owe him and our other donors have
felt depth for facilitating this year's
lecture and for helping secure the
series's future I'd also like to
acknowledge Miriam Syed's presence here
tonight right here and to thank her for
our ongoing support the lecture series
was begun in 2003 by the student run
Princeton Committee in Palestine in
order to honor and give tribute to
Edward Syed's work in life both of which
have been and still are so present for
so many of us as we know memorials are
of any kind or as much about the future
as they are about the past and it is in
this context that the example of Edward
remains still today such a model and
inspiration not only for those of us in
literature and the humanities but also
for those of us who remain committed to
a future that will not simply be the
repetition of the past taking his point
of departure from Adorno Edward once
wrote the big main hope of the
intellectual is not that he will have an
effect on the world but that someday
somewhere someone will recall what he
wrote exactly as he wrote it in an
interview he explains that he borrowed
this idea from Adorno at a time when he
felt that things were going very badly
for the Palestinians and that being left
out of the progress of history was a
fate he didn't wish to settle for what I
felt that I could at least do was to
testify he says to be a witness to a
certain kind of history and to get it
right I think in the end that is
probably the most fundamental challenge
of all to try to get it right
to find words that will fit a situation
and that will not change as the
situation changes but which will at
least register a reaction to a
particular moment that would otherwise
go by and quote the passion that
motivated what Edward wrote about
Palestine and its people emerge from his
sense of the distance between
Palestinian reality and the distortions
of that reality that have been and
continue to be so present in Western
public discourse this is what encouraged
him to try again and again to get it
right this is also I think what often
has motivated the courage determination
and commitment of Noam Chomsky's
long-standing interest in describing the
daily effects of the israeli-palestinian
conflict on the Palestinian people but
also the suffering of the poor and the
vulnerable across the globe those who
have experienced what Walter benjamine
famously called the tradition of the
oppressed the Institute professor and
professor of linguistics emeritus in the
Department of linguistics and philosophy
at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology professor Chomsky has written
books that have range from his
groundbreaking research into the nature
of human language and communication to
his fierce analysis and criticism of
international affairs and American
foreign policy from the Vietnam War to
the present wars in Iraq in Afghanistan
since 1957 when he published syntactic
structures he has written over 90 books
including American power and the new
mandarins the faithful triangle pirates
and emperors manufacturing consent
middle-east allusions failed States and
most recently hopes and prospects there
is no living American intellectual who
has read more widely than him exposing
the violent history of American
imperialism his writings have put before
us the violence the inequality the
economic and colonialist exclusions that
affected and continue to affect so many
human beings in the history of not only
America but of the earth he reminds us
that instead of celebrating the ideals
of liberal democracy and of the
capitalist market in an affirmation of
America's expansionist desires we should
attend to the innumerable instances of
suffering and
that often are attributable to this
market and to these desires what
Professor Chomsky shares with Edward
Sayid beyond the events at which they
both spoke together and a book on which
they collaborated in 1999 acts of
aggression policing rogue states is a
commitment to scrupulous scholarship a
passion for justice and the courage to
say what others often do not dare to say
seeking to delineate the consequences of
America's Imperial tendencies and not
only hers what his writings tell us is
that the earth is not a place where
humanity or rights are shared it is
instead a place of inequality and
injustice a place of loss and death a
place where every day there are more
people who are abandoned and abused or
displaced and dispossessed who are
marginalized and exiled and who live
without the full exercise of political
and civic civic rights it is a place
with a task of defining and realizing
human rights is infinite and therefore
permanently urgent and necessary this is
why if a different world can be ever be
inaugurated if there can never be a
future that will not simply be a
repetition of the past it may well be
enabled by work like that of Noam
Chomsky and it is for this reason among
so many others that we remain indebted
to him and to everything that he is the
title of his lecture this evening is I'm
kinnda reflections on the culture of
imperialism please help me welcome
professor Noam Chomsky to Princeton
I always have to test the mic first can
you hear me yeah okay this is the third
time that I've had the privilege of
giving a lecture in memory of Edward
Sayid he was a old and close and valued
friend one of the most remarkable and
influential intellectuals of the past
half century much of his immense effort
and talent was devoted to overcoming the
insularity prejudiced self-righteousness
apologetics that are among the
pathologies of power and defending the
rights of the victims in these three
talks I've tried to pick up some of
Edwards themes the first of the three
was in Beirut in 2006 that was shortly
before the u.s. Israeli invasion that
once again tore much of the country to
shreds that was the fifth invasion in 30
years the 2006 invasion devastated
places that my wife and I had just
visited that added special pain to the
scenes of destruction where we hid
places where we'd been graciously
welcomed during a rare moment of hope
and peace and of course the deaths of
people we admit well perhaps I should
comment on the phrase u.s. Israeli
invasion which is not the usual one but
it's the accurate one and it generalizes
very broadly to Israeli crime since the
u.s. Israeli alliance was formed in its
present established in its present form
in 1967 Israel can go as far as the
United States permits
and no farther throughout the United
States has been a direct participant
even in crimes that it formally condemns
but with a wink we see that regularly
today so take when OPA when Barack Obama
repeats the standard official phrases
about settlement expansion while
informing the press that his statements
are purely symbolic was the word that
was used and that he will not administer
even the light tap on the wrist that
first the first Bush did when he was
annoyed by Israel's brazen defiance of
the call for termination of these
illegal actions any stress he was which
was annoyed by the manner not the fact
of the defiance and Israel recognized
that they did in a different way for
what it's worth over 40 years ago it was
clearly recognized by Israel's highest
legal authorities and includes
distinguished jurists of international
renown that the settlement programs
violate core principles of international
law it's been it's also recognized
throughout the world outside the United
States and affirmed by the International
Court of Justice but not really relevant
when the world is dominated by a
self-declared rogue state on the 2006
invasion that President Obama's stance
was quite explicit at the time during
his presidential campaign two years
later he highlighted his sponsorship of
a 2006
Senate resolution insisting that the
merciless attack on Lebanon must
continue and that calls for ceasefire
must be rejected until Israel is safe
from the threat of as
missiles now there had been no Hezbollah
missiles none since Israel evacuated
southern Lebanon six years earlier but
they were indeed launched in response to
the invasion and the murders bombing of
Lebanese civilian society Obama accepted
without qualification Israel's
justification for the invasion a namely
that was a justified response to the
capture of Israeli soldiers on the
border
that's a pretext that would be a little
hard to take seriously under any
circumstances but in particular in this
case in the light of Israel's regular
practice for 30 years of kidnapping and
killing civilians in Lebanon and on the
high seas piracy way beyond what anybody
accuses Somalia of often jailing them
for long for decades sometimes holding
up as hostages sometimes in secret
prisons all known but irrelevant like
the legal issues in glaring contrast
Obama did not pronounce one word about
the right to self-defense of Lebanese
Palestinians or other targets of US
Israeli violence understandably one
might say there is no such concept as
justified self-defense against our
aggression subversion or terror and it's
a core principle of the culture of
imperialism and of course it wasn't
invented here after a talk in downtown
Beirut in May 2006 members of the
audience gathered as usual just for
informal discussion and one young woman
came from the group and approached me
and said quietly
I am kinnda
it was a startling shocking moment which
gained further poignancy two months
later as US planes with Israeli pilots
drenched the country once again with
bombs it was a moment that resonates
since it's hard for me to forget
powerfully again
last November 30th for reasons that I'll
explain directly well Kenda knew that I
needed no words beyond I am Kenda as she
had seen a book of mine
