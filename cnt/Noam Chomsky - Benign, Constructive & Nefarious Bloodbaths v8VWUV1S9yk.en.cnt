and in order to put the propaganda model
to a test we didn't call it propaganda
model then it's the same thing in order
to put it to a test we tried to compare
sort of paired historical incidents kind
of like I was doing in connection with
freedom of press issued fine I mean
history doesn't create exact controlled
experiments but there are enough cases
that are similar enough so you can test
how the media are going to deal with
them when we look for such cases we
particular we look for atrocities and we
divided the atrocities we looked at into
three categories what we called
constructive blood baths meaning ones
that are good for us power and the
corporate class or their constructive
benign blood baths one where us power
and privilege doesn't care very much one
or another it's sort of irrelevant and
nefarious blood baths those are the ones
carried out by official enemies so we
had various types of benign constructive
in the various blood baths and we gave
quite a number of examples of these well
our prediction was that the media would
welcome the constructive blood baths
that they would ignore the benign blood
baths and that they would become
outraged over the nefarious blood bath
and in fact in the case of the nefarious
blood bath it would invent all sorts of
fantasies and so on and so forth to make
them look even worse than they were that
was the prediction and we gave a bunch
of cases and we ensured that I think we
tried the show and I think did show that
the predictions were correct now there's
actually another prediction that comes
out of that model which we didn't make
but it's implicit if you think about it
and that has to do with the way that
this exposure will be responded to what
you'd predict if you think it through is
that our discussion of the constructive
blood baths would be ignored because to
reveal the fact that the media welcomed
huge blood baths as they did would not
be very conducive to the interests of
power or to the media
it would also expose the fraud about the
the apparent anger over a nefarious
blood bath so you'd expect the
constructive blood bath to be ignored as
far as the benign blood baths are
concerned you might expect an occasional
statement
it's I'm in fact that the media ignored
the benign blood best doesn't show too
you know such terrible things it doesn't
least they didn't applaud them and as
long as you can exclude the role of the
United States and being involved in them
not terrible maybe a few odd comments
with regard to the nefarious blood baths
what you'd expect is fury and venom over
the fact that the media that the
fabrications over bloodbath of the enemy
were exposed to the fraud and that's
important and that can be used it can be
used in fact to defame the critics see
if you show that people are lying about
the crimes of official enemies that you
can easily distort that into a defense
of those crimes right like okay now what
happened well let me take two cases
which were very close to cases that we
were that we discussed were the
slaughter and Timor from 1975 to 1979
and the slaughter in Cambodia from that
in the same years nineteen seventy five
to seventy nine we compared those two
cases the one in Timor we call the
benign blood that the United States
didn't care much one way or the other so
hundreds of thousands of T memories get
killed
no it's not very interesting the case in
Cambodia was of course in the various
blood death that was the bad guys doing
it and we gave a very detailed account
of what evidence was available about
these two they're in the same area of
the world the same years the same
timeframe the evidence available was
comparable these the slaughters were
apparently comparable in scale the one
in Timor was considerably greater
relative to the population but probably
roughly comparable in scale the
difference was that in Cambodia it was
carried out by the enemy Paul Pott
whereas in Timor it was carried out by a
friend Indonesia and furthermore it was
carried out by Indonesia with American
arms which were provided by the Carter
Administration which were expand these
as the arms flow was expanded by the
Carter Administration as the atrocities
increased well how did the meat you deal
with this first fact number when we went
through this in detail the media dealt
with the team war bloodbath by
suppressing there was Ken
durable coverage of Timor believe it or
not in 1974 and 75 this was all in the
context of the breakup of the Portuguese
Empire in as the as Indonesia attacked
teamwork and the massacre started with
us support coverage began to drop when
the massacre hit its peak in 1978 and it
was really approaching genocide with it
with increasing the u.s. support
coverage dropped to zero literally zero
that's the way they dealt with the team
were massacred what about the Cambodia
massacre well within weeks after the
Khmer Rouge took power they were already
being accused of genocide by the New
York Times about a year later they were
being accused of carrying out Auto
genocide and of having murdered two
million people in fact even if having
boasted of having murdered two million
people that became the conventional line
there then came a huge outcry ranging
from The Reader's Digest and TV Guide
over to the New York Review of Books and
including just about everything in
between
vask outcry of outrage over the
communist monsters who were carrying out
this horrifying bloodbath and so on and
so forth
interestingly in all of the there was a
tremendous amount of fabrication just
plain fabrication of evidence for
example that just give you one example
take this 2 million boast of 2 million
killed you know that that's what
everybody's heard you ask people how
many people had Pol Pot killed by say
1977 they'll say 2 million
here's where it comes from in that there
was a book published by a French priest
bonsoir Pancho is his name who's from
Cambodia he wasn't there then he knew
about Cambodia he published a book in
French the book was of course not
available in English it was in French it
was reviewed by a French journalist
journalist named Jacques Couture was
reviewed in France that review was
immediately picked up and translated in
the United States appear in the New York
Review of Books
that's a fastest translation of a review
of a French book that's ever appeared
but in in the review lecturer said this
he said according to Pancho the Khmer
Rouge boast of having murdered two
million people Auto genocide horrifying
and so on he gave a whole bunch of
quotes from the book
about the horrifying things the
commuters said and so on and so forth
that was immediately picked up by the
rest of the media it was all over the
place you know newspaper articles oh my
god what they're doing and so on and so
forth well I was curious at the time
because that didn't you know I didn't
hadn't seen the evidence about that I
just want to know what was going on so I
the book was unavailable so I wrote to
friends in france and asked them to send
it to me and i got the book and i
probably was the only person in the
united states who would read it all that
was being quoted all over the place on
the base of this review and i quickly
discovered that the whole review was a
total fraud whatever was going on in
cambodia that's not what the book said
the book didn't say anything about a
boast of two million people the quotes
that were given in the review either
didn't appear in the book or they
remember you sort of figure out what
they were from you know there's some
wording a little bit like them but they
were grossly distorted and some of them
didn't even weren't even quotes from the
Khmer Rouge they would quote from Thai
and so on
but and in fact every factual statement
in the in the review was just totally
false here's the way the two million
figure came Paul show in the book says
that about eight hundred thousand people
were killed in the American war seventy
two seventy five meaning primarily by
American bombing and the word that the
United States ran from seventy to
seventy-five that's eight hundred
thousand people he then said that
according to the American Embassy in
Bangkok
1.2 million had died not been killed
since the war was over well luck
occurred during the review just added
those two numbers together call them the
Khmer Rouge killings and then added the
boast for a good effect well that's
that's where that figure comes from
anyhow after I read the book I read let
her till I come to her and I do I know
and I told him look I don't know what
the facts are about Cambodia but the
relation between your review and the
book is zilch and I think you ought to
correct it because your review is being
quoted all over the place well he
actually published corrections in the
New York Review
you know I said yeah it made a couple of
mistakes he said well maybe the number
killed wasn't two million maybe it was
just in the thousands he said there's a
slight difference
you know a factor of a thousand
difference but he said really doesn't
matter you know it's terrible anyway and
with and so on well after his
Corrections appeared they were dismissed
and people kept repeating the two
million figure that he invented almost
half of which was attributed to the
American War notice well that's one
example but it's just typical if you
read our chapter on this you'll see a
level of fabrication which you know is
mind-boggling I mean it's just
mind-boggling now this had nothing to do
with the fact of course there was a
massacre in fact as we pointed out the
massacre was probably comparable to the
massacre in Cambodia which was a huge
din teamwork which is a huge massacre we
also pointed out that of all the
evidence available there was one part
that was being suppressed systematically
by the American press interestingly that
part was the information given by State
Department intelligence now the State
Department Cambodia Watchers you know
State Department intelligence they were
the only people with any evidence about
what was going on in Cambodia and they
apparently had pretty good intelligence
they claimed to be able to even pick up
radio transmissions and all sorts of
stuff and they were giving a totally
different story they said that what was
going on that there was you know big
slaughter but they said it was in the
tens or hundreds of thousands and it was
not mass genocide but it was rather
mostly harsh conditions and you know
brutality and so on
that was the position of the only people
who knew anything and that was
systematically excluded it was just the
wrong picture you know wasn't bloody
enough for the purposes well we went
through all of this stuff the
suppression of the Timor massacre the
vast amount of lying about the Cambodia
massacres and we gave that as at an
example of treatment of paired massacres
where they were both treated now here's
the one place where the book was not
ignored what we said about constructive
bloodbath totally ignored what we said
about Timor almost totally ignore it to
the extent that was mentioned the u.s.
role was excluded what we said about
Cambodia however that elicited a huge
new outrage over the fact that we were
defending Paul Pott well we were
defending Pol Pot by saying that he was
carrying out a slaughter comparable to
the major slaughter that the United
State
was backing in Indonesia and pointing
out that in fact that was the picture
given by American intelligence the only
people knew anything about it and then
talking about the way this was distorted
in the interests of the propaganda
system but that didn't matter
here this said what we were doing was
challenging the right to lie in the
service of the state and that's a very
important right to maintain so therefore
the standard view is and you can read
this all over the place now is that we
are usually it's me for some reason or
they decide it's me but we were
defending Pol Pot and you know sort of
apologists for Pol Pot you take a look
back and you'll see that we started we
described it as a major massacre was it
a lot as uncertain you know and then
just describe the facts as they were and
compared them with the media
fabrications and you not allowed to do
that and not allowed to expose media
fabrications and the reason why that was
discussed the one part of the book that
isn't virtually nothing about teamwork
ever is discussed the reason why that
one part is discussed is because that
can be used by further lies to defame
and undermine critics so therefore
that's done well that's the more subtle
way in which the propaganda system works
I should say incidentally that some of
this stuff is really kind of amusing
those of you who read this stuff will
have seen it William Shawcross wrote a
book a little after that in which he
claimed the quality of Mercy it's called
very favorably reviewed all over the
press everybody fell in love with it in
the book he claims that there was
silence over the Pol Pot atrocities and
then he asked the question how could
this happen
you know it's called Holocaust in the
modern conscience well first of all was
there silence over the Pol Pot atrocity
no there was a vast uproar over the Pol
Pot atrocities that started a couple of
weeks after it at the time when they
were being accused of genocide they had
probably killed a couple of thousand
people at the most within a year as I
said it was being well everywhere from
TV Guide in The Reader's Digest over the
New York Review and then it went on like
that a huge amount of huge chorus of
protest further worth tons of
fabrication but it's it's flattering to
say it's it's useful it's serviceable to
say there was silence why is it
serviceable because if he can claim that
there was silence then you can raise the
profound question
why the West was silent over this
massacre and that means from now on we
must be even more diligent in exposing
the crimes of official enemies to
overcome the fact that we were silent
this time so immediately Shawcross has
quoted all over the place and every
newspaper is saying oh my god you were
silent how could we have been silent and
so on then
Shawcross goes on to explain the silence
you take a look at his book he explains
the silence first this was in The
Washington Post and in his book he says
the reason for the silence is the
primary reason for the silence is this
is the skepticism of the left primarily
me so in other words by my skepticism I
silenced all the us all the Western
media and governments it's a lot of
power furthermore this and remember what
that skepticism was it was a skepticism
about documented lies furthermore he
then he then then he cites an alleged
statement in a footnote doesn't date it
or identify the source there's two good
reasons for that one is that the
citation is fabricated the other is that
the source to the extent that there's a
source it's in a book it's in exactly
this book which appeared which went to
press after the fall of Pol Pot and came
out almost a year after the poll fault
fall off paul potts so what he's
claiming is that in a book that appeared
the winter press after Pol Pot was
overthrown and that appeared almost a
year after in that book we succeeded
retrospective retrospectively in
silencing the entire Western media and
governments for four years well that's
you know not only were we powerful
enough to scare the entire West into
silence but we even could do it by magic
you know now that was quoted that was
quoted all over the place with great awe
the point is there's no absurdity so
extreme that it won't be quoted with
respect if it's useful and here it's
useful for several purposes one to
protect the right to lie in the service
of the state two to undermine and defame
critics who you can't answer and three
the claim that we didn't look hard
enough we were silent over this atrocity
well there wasn't a trust
that the West was silent over it's the
one we documented Timor and they were
silent over it because the West was
doing it and therefore you're silent
over it that's the real a you know
question of Holocaust and the modern
conscience but nobody will discuss that
one well these are all examples of more
subtle ways of controlling thought more
subtle and complex that's the aftermath
I had in mind it's a very interesting
story we review it in the manufacturing
