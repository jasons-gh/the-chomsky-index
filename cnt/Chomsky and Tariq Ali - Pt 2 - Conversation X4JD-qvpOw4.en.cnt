gnome if if we could sort of start by
discussing Iraq as you said in the
concluding parts of your speech the even
the elections which are taking place in
a very limited way might produce a
government which good demand of the
United States leaves Iraq traditionally
the United States unlike the European
empires has preferred to rule indirectly
they don't like being present they send
the Marines in when they have to but
they prefer to rule countries through
local relays who do the dirty work
themselves so I mean Iraq is a very
complex situation but theoretically
there is nothing to stop them from
withdrawing the troops if they are
convinced that the government there is
going to do their bidding well if
they're convinced to then but how can
they be convinced in fact if you well I
have to tell you just let's just imagine
what the policies might be of an
independent Iraq independent sovereign
Iraq let's say more or less democratic
what are the policies likely to be well
there's going to be a Shiite majority so
they'll have some significant influence
over policy they're the first thing
they'll do is reestablish relations with
Iran no they don't think they like Iran
but they don't want to go to war with
them so they'll move towards what was
happening already even understood that
you know restoring some sorts of
friendly relations with Iran well that's
the last thing the United States wants
it's working very hard to try to isolate
Iran the next thing that might happen is
as Shiite controlled the more or less
democratic Iraq might stare
feelings and the Shiite areas of Saudi
Arabia which happen to right nearby and
which happened to be where all the oil
is so you might find the wood in
Washington must be the ultimate
nightmare
she ate region which controls most of
the world's oil and is independent
furthermore an independent Iraq is very
likely I you know more about it than
these interested in hearing what you
think but my guess is that an
independent sovereign Iraq would try to
take its natural place as a leading
state in the Arab world may be the
leading state and you know that's
something goes back to biblical times
what does that mean well it means
rearming first of all they have to
confront the regional enemy the regional
enemy overpowering enemy is Israel
they're gonna have to rearm to confront
Israel which means probably developing
weapons of mass destruction just as a
deterrent so here here's the picture of
what they must be dreaming about in
Washington and probably 10 Downing
Street don't know does the thinking
there that here you might get a region
sovereign independent substantial Shiite
majority including most of the world's
energy rearming developing weapons of
mass destruction to try to get rid of
the US outposts that are there to ensure
that the United States controls the oil
reserves of the world
I mean Washington gonna sit there and
allow that that's I think this is a big
problem massive problem for the United
States that this entire rhetoric about
democracy could implode in their face
because if you haven't which is why
something tells me that these elections
are going to be rigged
I'm referring to the Iraqi elections
that they will the way they are setting
up the voting pattern that lots of Iraqi
exiles in Britain and Europe can vote
some heard of actually the way they are
setting up the elections inside Iraq
itself in some areas is very dubious the
model they have is the elections in
Afghanistan which were a total fraud and
the reason they're doing it is to make
sure some of their hardcore people come
into the new assembly but despite that I
think you're right now that despite all
the chicane reader might still have a
government which a wants them out and I
cannot see even a weak Iraqi government
dependent on occupation troops agreeing
to allow Iraqi oil to be controlled by
non Iraqis so Iraqi control of Iraqi oil
no foreign troops in Iraq could become
the big demand which means that the war
will go on if they agree to that but
they I think but I just read from the
business press in the last couple of
days probably reflects the thinking in
Washington and London well ok we'll let
them have a government but we're not
going to pay any attention to what they
say
in fact the Pentagon announced at the
same time two days ago we're keeping a
120,000 troops there into at least 2007
even if they call for withdrawal
tomorrow and the the propaganda is very
evident right in these articles you can
write the articles now the commentary we
just have to do it because we have to
accomplish our mission of bringing
democracy to Iraq and if they have an
elected government doesn't understand
that
what can we do with this dumb Arab sign
that's it
actually that's a very common that's
very key element now look after all the
US is overthrown democracy after
democracy because the people don't
understand they follow the wrong course
so therefore following the mission of
establishing democracy we've got
overthrow their government the thing is
if they're thinking seriously what they
should be thinking but if they do that
and make the government you know even
elected in these weird circumstances
totally useless the people who've
elected it could begin to move towards
joining the armed resistance groups in
Iran that's a big danger for the United
States but remember these these guys
have a lot of experience the same Thomas
Carruthers who's interesting he's the
smartest there's a lot and there are a
lot of them no he points out he's a
great believer in what he calls
Reaganite programs of enhancing
democracy in fact he participated and he
was in the State Department in the
Reagan years as a in the democracy
promotion projects and he describes he
was written the main scholarly books and
articles on what happened and it's
pretty Frank he didn't see them there
Sam what he's saying just isn't what I
quoted but it's Frank I mean he says the
Reagan programs were of course noble and
inspiration but they were a failure and
a very systematic failure namely he
points out in the southern cone of the
hemisphere where the United States had
very little influence there was real
progress towards democracy which the
Reagan administration tried to stop but
couldn't stop and therefore reluctantly
accepted it in the regions where the US
has the greatest influence nearby there
was the least progress towards democracy
and even that he says was constrained by
the fact that the US would only accept
top-down forms of democracy in which
traditional elites allied to the United
States remain in power but that's a
noble
that's a you know wonderful program
we're bringing democracy and this these
appear at a and he's regarded as a
liberal commentator like he appears in
dissent for example and this it's taken
series articles that I just quoted
didn't laugh you know exactly know how
and there's a long history of it just as
there's a history of projecting the
United States as a model of democracy
when it's almost a prototypical example
of a failed state a state with
democratic forms but no functioning I
mean just carrying on those lines let's
assume that the situation gets worse
large groups and the south begin to join
the resistance that will require more
troops from the United States to try and
control the resistance inside Iraq given
that we have this strange situation in
the United States that the reserves are
drying up that fewer and fewer people
are volunteering to join the army more
are volunteering to join the Navy in the
Air Force because they're safe safer
will this could this push the government
to introducing conscription I suspect my
guess is no I think that's going to be a
last resort and the reason is the
Vietnam experience yeah the Vietnam
experience I think is the first time in
the history of European imperialism that
an imperial power tried to fight a
colonial war with the citizens army yeah
I mean the British didn't do it they
 with the Gurkhas and see boys and
so on the French had the Foreign Legion
colonial wars civilians just they're no
good at I mean they're too brutal and
vicious and murderers you just can't
take kids off the street and have them
fight that kind of a war you need
trained killers like the French Foreign
Legion and in fact you could see it
happening in Vietnam to its credit the
army fell apart after a couple eat for
too long but finally the army
essentially fell apart
the soldiers were on drugs they were
fragging officers not following orders
and so on and the top brass wanted them
out you look back at the military
journals in the late 60s they're writing
about we got to get this army out of
here the Army's want to collapse pretty
much like the head of the reserve said
through three days ago he said this is
becoming a broken force you know people
can't do it well they dropped
conscription at that point and shifted
to what's called a volunteer army which
in effect means a mercenary army of the
disadvantaged so army recruiters don't
go to the high schools and colleges and
the suburbs they go down to the poor
areas and try to offer inducements to
poor disadvantaged people to go into the
services and that way you do get a kind
of a mercenary army but even that is
limited I mean you really need
professional killers and I suspect
that's the reason why they're bringing
in so many of the contractors Troy very
contracted yeah you kind of privatize it
to trained killers you know like South
African mercenaries or the you know X
officers and DynCorp then you get people
who can do that kind of thing actually I
think by now the second largest
contingent in Iraq greater than the
British is the contractors which means
basically trained killers you know but
do they have enough of them I don't
think they have enough of them and there
are not that many countries which would
like to supply them either now and the
British Army is in a mess and a number
of leading British generals have said if
the local population turns against us
one Colonel actually said it on
television he said if there is a large
demonstration of two hundred thousand
shear people outside our barracks I'm
not going to give the orders to open
fire I think that'll be time to come
back home so whether or not Blair wants
it
there could be rebellions inside his
army is it's it's quite incredible I
don't know about you but
been extremely surprised but what's
happened since the invasion my unfilled
my own guests at the time was that the
invasion would take about two days Iraq
was a broken country very scarcely held
together with scotch tape if that had
been true they would never have invaded
they knew it and III thought it would be
the easiest military occupation in
history you know here the country been
practically wiped out by sanctions
killed hundreds of thousands of people
was barely being held together I mean
here you know people talk about how glad
they were to get rid of Saddam Hussein I
presume they were even glad or to get
rid of the sanctions but you can't ask
that question so we don't know the
numbers but here the sanctions are over
they got rid of the tyrant the United
States can come in with enormous
resources I mean just to give one
amazing fact they still have not reached
the level of electricity of the
pre-invasion period I mean my guess is
that you know a couple of students from
MIT could probably put that grid
together by now but they have taken a
situation which should have been a you
know the extremely easy military
occupation and turned it into a total
catastrophe and in fact what's happened
is that the US has backed off step by
step from its initial aims if you read
the press now it sounds as if the u.s.
wanted an election that's just not true
the u.s. was opposed to elections it
tried in all sorts of ways to develop
some kind of system which would prevent
elections a caucus system that they
could control some other trickery and I
had to back off or they had to back off
on the privatization not totally but
Bremer's initial proposals which are
outlandish they had to back off on it
and in fact if you think about it I
think it's a remarkable triumph of
nonviolent resistance and it's not the
guys throwing bombs above them that much
it's the steadfast refusal and
resistance of the large majority of the
population to accept these demands yeah
it's an astonishing achievement how it
will proceed I don't know I
with all the resources that they have
iced assume that they can somehow manage
to impose the plans that they now
describe we will force them to accept
vague promises of eventual withdrawal
and count on Tony Blair and George
Bush's speechwriters to give the right
the formulation of it it's going to be
difficult actually for one simple reason
that I think most Iraqis just don't like
being occupied by a foreign power well
if if you finish really you didn't you
didn't get the chance yet to read
Blair's full interview he said it's not
an occupation not only that he said he's
furious about people who think it's an
occupation which happens we have 99% of
the population of Iraq by his own polls
no if we move to another Tony
question in the Middle East which is
that you don't just have the occupation
of Iraq you have the continuing
occupation of Palestine by the Israelis
and on this question it seems to me that
public opinion in the West has almost
given up because the way it's presented
it's still complicated when suicide
bombers are presented the it's presented
in the United States largely but also in
some parts of Western Europe completely
decontextualized Arafat's death was sort
of more or less celebrated in a vulgar
fashion by large sections of the
American media in a new person Abu Mazen
has been elected and now there are hopes
that he will do what the Israelis want
him to do but he is not capable of doing
that he's not able to do that Eric
Hobsbawm the English historian said
recently that if the Israelis carrying
on behaving in this fashion the the
State of Israel has constituted at
present might not exist by the end of
the
century now who knows but what do you
think is this are the first three four
steps to a solution I think they're
pretty clear and once again actually it
was I actually did an article after the
death of our fun which I went through
the American media to see I was treated
and it was amazing yeah if someone was
quite reviewing though so for example
the New York Times as a intelligent
Middle East correspondent he wrote a
major think piece on the disc death of
Arafat front-page story in The Times it
started by saying that the death of
Arafah
will offer a test for the quintessential
faith of Americans that elections
legitimize even the weakest systems
that's the first paragraph of the
article in the front page if you go on
to the continuation page to the last
paragraph the last paragraph says the
Americans would never accept elections
before because they knew that our foe is
going to win so that's the
quintessential faith you know
quintessential faith is elections are
fine if they're going to come out the
way we say now go to popular attitudes
which are extremely interesting and as
usual suppress these same major public
opinion agencies and they do careful
studies found that oh right now in fact
about the proportion of the percentage
of Americans who think that the u.s.
oughta tilt towards Israel is 17 percent
1/7 seventeen percent of Americans think
we should be more favorable to Israel if
you look at the in-depth studies not
reported what they show is that a large
majority about two-thirds I think that
we should accept what's called here the
Saudi plan which is just not the latest
version of the two-state proposal that
the US have been blocking for 30 years
that's a large majority of the American
population either political party would
even dream
same large majority roughly two-thirds I
think that the United States ought to
cut off aid from either party either
Israel or the Palestinians which who are
not negotiating in good faith on a
two-state settlement
well that means cut off aid from Israel
same majority says if both parties are
negotiating we ought to equalize aid to
them I mean that is so radically
different from anything in the political
arena or any word you can read in the
media that if they don't have to say
about it and what's interesting about
all these numbers including ones I
quoted before is that these are opinions
of people held in isolation I mean
everyone who's answering those questions
must think I'm the only person in the
world that thinks this they've certainly
never seen it anywhere never heard it
anywhere I mean if these if it was
possible to discuss these questions if
there was some functioning form of the
you know political democracy with
organizations and discussions and
debates and so on now that would just
reinforce the opinions would be much
stronger well that's a possible solution
in fact it's on the table in fact it you
know it came very close the Clinton camp
David proposals were totally impossible
but and Clinton basically conceded that
a couple of months after Camp David 2000
he came out a couple of weeks before the
end of his term with what were called
the Clinton parameters which were pretty
vague but much more forthcoming than the
Camp David proposals which were
impossible the and that led to
negotiations Goshen centavo Egypt in
January 2001 Clinton when he couple
weeks after he announced his parameters
this right at the end of the term a
stated that give speech in which he said
that both sides have Palestinians and
Israelis have tentatively accepted his
parameters and both sides have
reservations well that's what was
discussed at Taba and they came the
negotiators came to
conclusion that was not gonna work as it
stood but was very close to it to the
old international consensus the US have
been blocking well Barack called off the
negotiations then we get to a cycle of
violence but they continued and there
are now several versions the best
established one are the Geneva Accords
released in Geneva and 2000 birth mm - I
think 2002 which were supported by just
about the entire world the United States
refused with the only major country that
wouldn't even send a low-level delegate
or make a comment about it so they're
dead well you know they could be a basis
for settlement they're not perfect as
they stand but there's certainly a basis
for settlement and in fact it's a
possibility it's been a possibility
since the mid-70s and it remains a
possibility if the United States will
accept it and the population
overwhelmingly accepts it but neither
political party does the media don't
there's no discussion possible about it
the degree of falsification about this
is just mind-boggling I mean take say
Tony Blair this morning he's supposed to
be the intelligent European he he's the
Prime Minister you're responsible half
maybe a quarter but this morning quite
interesting he says I was confident that
within the next few weeks the United
States will his good friend George Bush
will take the lead and taking the matter
in hand and so on and so forth but
what's the problem that has to be taken
at hand well the problem is security for
Israel period Bush the Palestinians have
to agree to ensure security for Israel
now one word about what the major issue
is what about the occupation what about
the fact that the the so called Gaza
withdrawal proposal is really a West
Bank expansion exactly I mean the day
same day that Sharon announced the Gaza
withdrawal his government also announced
it
millions of dollars of new construction
and the occupied territories just a
couple of days ago they reported that
secretly last summer Israel had passed
what was called in New York Times a
clarification of the absentee ownership
law the clarification allows Israel to
confiscate without compensation lands of
Palestinians living and what they call
the seam appear the area between the
separation wall that they're building
through the occupied through the West
Bank between there and the border of
Israel that means they can just take
over more and more territory I mean
somebody is living in Bethlehem and
who's olive groves or ten yards away on
the other side of the separation wall
has lost ownership of them because he
doesn't occupy that land so therefore it
gets confiscated these programs of
development integration infrastructure
development new settlement and so on
that's what's undermining any political
settlement and the u.s. is supporting
them and Britain is keeping quiet about
I know and they go on all the time and
that's not considered a problem I mean
the notion that Israel which has the
fifth strongest army in the world which
has nuclear weapons which is a stockpile
of chemical weapons could be threatened
by any of the existing Arab states leave
alone the Palestinians is just grotesque
I mean they're trying to project the
situation which did exist in 48 - what
exists now when they themselves between
totally transformed and are the most
threatening that are in that in that
region and it always worries me coming
to the United States that the media here
in particular just is completely blind
to Palestinian suffering
it doesn't that that's been true for a
long time or since the u.s. shifted
policy yeah I mean that's basically 67 I
mean
prior to that the New York Times was not
a pro-israel newspaper in fact if you go
back to the 1950s the American Jewish
Committee
Journal commentary it was a
non-scientist journal in fact the
zionist organization actually set up a
competing journal to express the zionist
point of view changed dramatically in
1967 and it finally changed in 1971
that's the crucial date there which is
effaced from american not only media
that even most scholarship in 1971 said
egypt said that offered israel full
peace treaty right in terms of official
US policy Jordan followed right along
the Israeli government discussed it
debated it recognized that they could
have peace and security and be
integrated into the region and so on but
at the cost of giving up expansion and
expansion at that time meant primarily
into the Sinai where they were is the
labor government they were kicking out
thousands of farmers and planning to
build an all to a jewish city in the
northeastern china that was the choice
is it going to be expansion or peace
well they chose expansion they rejected
the offer crucial question was what's
the united states going to do and there
was an internal debate and it was won by
henry kissinger national security
adviser and his policy as he describes
was still made no negotiations only
forced okay
that led the 1973 war very close call
and finally in Camp David in 1978 the US
and Israel accepted Sadat's 1971 offer
that's called a triumph of American
diplomacy a total disaster you know the
refusal to accept it led to a dangerous
war almost a nuclear confrontation for
Israel is very close call
enormous amount of suffering well you
know by then they finally agreed okay
they'll give back Egyptian territory but
by then they were expanding under the
octave of the West Bank with u.s.
funding and support over the opposition
of the American population and so it
continues but the solution to this
problem is you know there are problems
that are it's hard to think of a
solution
but here it's easy to think it's not a
pretty solution that's a horrible
solution frankly but it's a solution
which would at least cut back the level
of violence would allow relations to
establish which might ultimately lead to
something saying in the region and it's
sitting right there all it requires is
that the opinions of about 2/3 of
Americans be taken into consideration we
are approaching the end of this session
lots of you have sent in questions but
look reading the questions we have
covered many of the things you've asked
there's one question which we haven't
discussed at all in having covered and
that's the one I'm going to oppose to
know who in your this is from a member
of the audience who in your opinion is
the most important anarchist thinker
well any person I would mention is
automatically disqualified because any
honest anarchist thinker would simply
immediately reject the description of
being the most important man urca's
thinker the most probably the most
important anarchists thinkers at least
that I know of or poor or illiterate
peasants in Aragon and Catalonia and the
19:36 who actually constructed a
successful live anarchist society over a
large area industrial and agricultural
most of them were illiterate they left
documents so there there are some
documents left which are extremely
interesting they was and it wasn't it
wasn't spontaneous this had been after
efforts that have been going on for 70
years efforts that were attempts crushed
to try again
you know educational programs all sorts
of things finally in the first year of
the Spanish revolution it broke out and
flourished and it was so terrifying
there
that every single power combined the
crusher fascists Russia liberal
democracies put aside their differences
to ensure that this would be crushed and
after they crushed it they went you know
they fought the war as the war of
succession well you know they were
probably the most important anarchist
thinkers and the same is true everywhere
you take a look at the SE IWW in the
United States I mean those were
important anarchist thinkers who
actually carried out actions which led
finally to the development of the
American labor movement which had been
bitterly suppressed you as a very
violent labor history actually know
about it around here the their
activities and others like them finally
did lead to substantial successes
there's major attacks against them since
but those are successes of people who
are constructing worker managed
community run societies which is kind of
an anarchist ideal and that this is very
deeply rooted in the United States that
people forget what it's like there was a
period in American history of in which
there was a substantial there was
substantial victories for democracy
through the 19th century it was you know
people write about it call it the period
of self-rule it was based on the
assumption which is very widespread in
the United States that wage labor is not
very different from slavery I mean that
was the slogan of northern workers who
fought in the Civil War
in fact was even the slogan of the
Republican Party was slavery of course
unacceptable but so is wage slavery you
have to control your own fate you read
the newspapers written during the period
of the freest press in the United States
late nineteenth century
where working people were running
running their own newspapers communities
others people in the mills and eastern
Massachusetts origins of the American
industrial revolution their press is
what we would call anarchist these are
you know Irish artisans from the slums
of lost and farm girls from what they
called factory girls young women coming
off the farms into the mills they just
took for granted that those who work in
the mills should own and that we should
have we should create our own self
managed society integrating with others
that's a deep part of American history
it takes a lot of effort to crush it on
that utopian note I think we've come to
the end of the evening thank you all
very much and thank you
you
