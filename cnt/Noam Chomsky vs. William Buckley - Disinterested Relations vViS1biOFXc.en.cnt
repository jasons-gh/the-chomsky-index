Oh mr. Chomsky we're talking there about
American terror and I think you make a
very accurate observation that we are
responsible for what we do but hardly
responsible for what other people do
except insofar as we are in the position
to influence them for instance if there
is a mass starvation in a by Afra even
though we did not cause that there is a
sense in which we are responsible if we
don't do something to attend to
alleviate it now by the same token if we
are portrayed to agreeing that it is not
always easy - taxonomy as military
action into that which is terroristic
and that which is purely military
operation are we we are left with with
doubts for instance about the bombing of
Germany in 1942 43 44 you might contend
that this was terroristic and
unnecessary and you might be right
although you're not a military expert
not neither am i but i don't think
there's a point to that oh yeah but I do
judge that even if we all agree that
what we did in resident was inexcusable
as a moral question it's got to be
understood in context of what was it
that brought us to Dresden in the first
instance absolutely and what brought us
to South Vietnam in the first instance
in my judgement was clearly a and
uninterested or I should say
disinterested of concern for the
stability and possibilities of a region
of the world
what what period do you feel that we had
this disinterested relationship no no at
what period did we have it did it begin
let's say 1951 for example when we when
the State Department bulletin points out
that we must help the French reconquer
their former colony and we must
eradicate all Vietnamese resistance down
to its last roots and order personally
or was that the peace my vulnerability I
wish we had helped the French we did we
well but sufficient it was hardly
disinterested when we attempted as you
know with with tremendous support in
fact to reinstate French imperialism in
South Vietnam
it was disinterested in this
and I think there's an important
distinction for you to touch on your
book it's a disinterested act F of my
attempt to help or your attempt to help
a particular nation is in order to spare
you the possibility of a great ordeal in
the future which will harm you your
family or to public and in a sense not
Jeremy was also disinterested in Nazi
Germany was conquering Eastern Europe
only in order to advance the values of
short in spiritual civilization and to
restore their right well that's Holly I
follow you but if you want me to pursue
that digression I will okay but but
that's suspended for a moment I I'm
distinguishing that kind of is
interested in us between the time but
that's not interested in this that you
see that's that's something which
includes as a special case every case of
military aggression and colonialism in
history it's all that's interested in
your sense
well let me simply rest my case by
saying that there is an observable
distinction by intelligent man between a
country that reaches out and interferes
with the affairs of another country
because it has reason to believe that a
failure to do so will result in
universal misery and that country which
reaches out interferes with another
country because it wants to establish
coca-cola plants then chased national
banks and and and whatever and exploit
enough that is observable it's a
conceptual distinguish between a
conceptual connection actual under their
to do that all right it is a conceptual
distinction but in actual fact the
history of colonialism shows that these
two motivations can coincide but it's
practically every time there are
exceptions you know they probably the
Belgians in anaconda or an exception but
by and large the major imperialist
ventures have been in the economic and
the material interest or in the
perceived material mathematics of the
BET minute let me come you have already
conceded that it's not merely conceptual
different there are exceptions there are
a few except we're talking about the
exceptions that well nobody the exams
are at the difference no I mean the
exceptions I mentioned for example the
Belgians in the Congo there they didn't
have they didn't pretend to have a
civilizing mission there was pure
material self-interest that these are
the exceptions there are as far as I
know no exceptions on the
there are there are maybe I've left that
a case of history but as I see the
history of colonialism the great massive
cases are cases where a powerful country
was working in its perceived material
self-interest and was covering what it
was doing to itself into the world with
very pleasant phrases about the
preserving Christian values are helping
the poor benighted natives or one thing
or another
