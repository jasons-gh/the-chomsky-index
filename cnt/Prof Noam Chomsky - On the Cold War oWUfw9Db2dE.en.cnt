well there there is a story that the
Cold War was capitalism versus socialism
and capitalism one as if the Cold War
was coming to an end in the late 80s I
wrote an article in fact called the USSR
versus socialism it was invited I was
invited to write it by a left journal
which refused to publish it and finally
I post it in a small anarchist journal
but it was exactly right
when Lenin took over in 1917 one of his
first acts was to Lenin Trotsky was to
destroy the socialist institutions that
had developed during the Revolutionary
period and he did it for principled
reasons which weren't a secret he
thought Russia was a backward peasant
society had to be driven by force to
industrialization wasn't ready for
socialism well where's the battle
against socialism or take say the West
is it capitalist I mean do you use a
computer in the internet that do you fly
an airplane do you use drugs almost all
of this comes out of the state system
comes out of the state sector I'm gonna
check the building where we're sitting
which happens to be built on the ruins
of a lab with 60 50 60 years ago in
which which was devoted under Pentagon
funding to developing computers of the
internet micro electronics of the IT
revolution and so on totally paid for by
the public under the pretext of Defence
the Russians are coming
IBM for example was in there learning on
government subsidies how to switch from
punch cards to computers and finally in
the 60s
IBM got to the point really good
manufacture their own computer they
couldn't sell it it was too expensive so
the government bought it
procurement is one of the major ways in
which the public subsidized private
industry and finally you know 20 years
later became possible to make money on
PCs and you know and so on that's the
way the so-called capitalist economy
works it's not that there's no
entrepreneurial initiative or consumer
choice you know they're there but
they're not the driving factor they're
more at the marketing end so there is a
sector of the economy that does have
real market characteristics the
financial sector and it's been a big
change in in the last 30 years in the
economy
starting from the 70s particularly since
the Reagan Thatcher years the economies
have been financialized so the financial
industry which used to be very you know
3% of GDP is now in the u.s. probably
pushing third I mean while productive
industry has been hollowed out it still
goes on but it's shipped abroad so for
the managers and the owners it's great
but for the workers it's a disaster well
the financial sector is pretty much run
on market lines and it continually
collapses and the state has to intervene
to rescue it as it's doing now this
happens to be a big bailout that there
have been it's periodic that's what's
going to happen in market systems back
that's why that corporations were
created in the mesentery ago to try to
protect the rich and powerful from
market discipline which is harsh so you
know it's not false that there was
certainly a conflict in the Cold War but
you can't describe it that way in fact
if you look at the events of the Cold
War which after all it'll be relevant
the events of the Cold were
overwhelmingly the u.s. attacks on
movements of Independence in its own
domains on the pretext that the Russians
are coming and Russian
actions against its own satellites on
the pretext that the Americans are
coming there's almost a tacit compact in
which each power the huge superpower in
the minor one they used the pretext to
the other to control their own domains
and it's striking that when the Cold War
ended if you take a look at US policy
it's the first thing you look at if you
try to figure out what the Cold War was
about George Bush that first was
president right after the fall of the
Berlin wall they announced a new
national security strategy defense
budget and so on which were very
revealing and what they said is
everything is going to remain the same
except for pretexts so we still need a
huge military system but not because the
Russians are coming
because they're not because of the
technological sophistication of third
world powers they said that and hoped
people wouldn't laugh at were right they
said we still have to sustain the
defense industrial base that's the
standard euphemism for high-tech
industry so we have to make sure that
the rich can be supported by the nanny
state and we crucially he said we have
to they said we have to maintain
intervention forces directed at the
Middle East and then comes a nice phrase
where the serious threats to our
interests could not be laid at the
Kremlin's door so in other words sorry
folks we've been lying to you for 50
years but now clouds have lifted so we
have to say we have to prevent that
what's called radical nationalism
meaning independence so nothing changed
except pretexts and of course tactics
are modified and if you look closely
that's what you find
