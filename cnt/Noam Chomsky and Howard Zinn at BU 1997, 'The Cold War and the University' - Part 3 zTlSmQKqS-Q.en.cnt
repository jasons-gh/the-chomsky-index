no the capitalist classes are telling us
this is the end of history of capitalism
ocean Rafa's has won the global economy
is upon us and can't be turned back and
you know this have to flip our levitates
to market alarm but I felt really bleep
rat and I know if I don't think you
believe that either I was one day of
fearing the far about how the next
troubles phase of struggles will develop
low there be rebellions and various
countries against the move will better
be facing the resentment here in the
United States because we're asked to
place at the large role in ensuring
capitalist tonics in the New World War
how do you conceive versus instability
well first thing to bear in mind is that
this talk about the end of history and
the victory you know the Utopia of the
Masters and so on we've been hearing
that for 170 years I won't run through
the whole history but periodic periodic
pair it keeps it looks as if there's
been as if I positions been smashed the
labor movements been destroyed people
are back in their holes and so on and so
forth and then a few years later
everything blows up so without going
back to the 1830s when it begins just
takes a the 1920s the night what Howard
was talking about a bit after the Red
Scare the country's leading labor leader
also presidential candidate was in jail
put there by woodrow wilson because he
questioned the nobility of wilson's war
the labor movement was destroyed this
was and by violence this was no joke you
know the United States a very violent
labor history this is the period of the
you know the big mass production of
automobiles and so on labor just had
nothing to do with it they were what
virtually wiped out people were afraid
to have meetings in big Union formerly
Union towns working-class towns was too
frightening there was a lot of worry
about how everything was wonderful you
know end of history terrific and so on a
couple of years later the country in
total turmoil you know workers taking
over plants forcing through legislation
that brought the United States more or
less into the mainstream of industrial
society what we call the New Deal
measures that caused huge hysteria on
the part of the Masters they was very
very worried about a huge campaign
started right in the late 30s try to
beat everybody back into their shells
sort of during the Second World War was
kind of put on hold started off right
away afterwards by the 1950s it was
again a period of celebration of
the in quiescence and the end of
ideology and everything's fine now it's
just little tinkering around the edges a
couple of years later Howard students
are out on the streets everybody else is
out on the streets whole country is
blowing up and we have a crisis of
democracy I well since then since the
early 70s there's been another major
effort to try to restore apathy and
obedience and so on and what will happen
next if anybody nobody's ever succeeded
in predicting in the past I you take a
look at the record and you can't predict
tomorrow's weather you know to try to
predict what will happen in human
affairs is completely out of the
question I mean these aren't things that
you sit around making predictions about
the things you try to do something about
and there's plenty of opportunity I mean
you know it's striking I traveled like
our does not only here but also around
the world and it's very different it's
interesting here where you hear
questions about what we should do mostly
in privileged sectors so for example I
just including in the United States you
would I just came back from a couple of
weeks ago from Brazil you know Brazil's
it it's a ranked next to albania in the
UN Development Report it should be an
extremely rich countries had the benefit
of our tutelage for 50 years certainly
should have helped it the Brazil has the
biggest radical Democratic Party in the
world you know labour based party run by
a steel worker from peasant from the
Northeast that easily win any election
if you could possibly have a fair
election I mean they get smashed by the
hundred percent of the media at the last
minute but otherwise they have won the
last two presidential elections it's a
kind of an umbrella group which includes
all sorts of social movements
independent I happen to spent some time
meeting with them including Lula
leadership independently of that there's
150 thousand or so families in a
landless workers movement completely
separate just taking over land now a lot
of struggle like a lot of them get
killed
and it's going on right now all the time
independently of all that there's a big
network of rural trade unions for rural
proletariat a lot of the land is unused
people want to they want to organize for
it there's indigenous movements there's
big media popular media projects I mean
here everybody complains about how we
can't get onto the media there I spent
an evening at a popular media project
out in the you know Brazil's like Europe
the opposite of the United States and
the way cities are organized the
downtown is the rich place and the
suburbs or the poor police by and large
so out in the suburbs placed with a
couple of million people living in
something ranging from suffering the
misery there are public television in
the in the squares you know with the
helped a little by an NGO couple
professionals from the town but all they
do is provide the equipment they come
out with a truck and a big screen and
set it up in a public square and a
couple hundred people gather and they
see things that are done by the people
in the community you know they see it's
acted written by them directed by them
acted by them the actors when I was
there the main actress was a kid looked
about 17 was walking around in the crowd
interviewing people about what they were
what people who were said he's sitting
at a bar you know standing and talking
with her kids or something about the
programs that they were seeing their
comments were broadcast on the screen
you know people were talking about that
big project on and on these are people
with no resources yeah I'm very very
poor people and projects coming all over
the place I mean you know for us to talk
about the inability to deal with things
is sort of something really wrong about
it I mean we should not ask that kind of
question you know there are so many
opportunities with the resources we have
and when you see people with no
resources it's pretty striking and
that's same is true in the United States
and I think we should take a lesson from
that as far as the globalization and the
triumph of the free market is concerned
in what business I mean I won't repeat
but it's as far as a free market is
concerned there that probably the last
time there was anything remotely like a
free market was the asian trading area
before the merchant adventurers broke
into it about 500 years ago it was
vaguely like a free market ever since
then there's been kind of a double-edged
free market free markets are great for
you but I need the protection of a
powerful state and that's exactly the
way it is now what I said about
telecommunications is absolutely
standard it's true every part of the
economy i mean the leading welfare freak
in the country happens to be newt
gingrich who brings more sub public
subsidies to his district than any
comparable district in the country the
leading the most protectionists
government post-war history was the
reagan administration finally double
protectionism saved the + pouring tons
of money into industry that's what saved
you know the steel industry the
automotive industry the semiconductor
industry and so on just a couple of
weeks ago japan announced that they were
going to set up a big program to rebuild
the semiconductor industry in japan to
try to compensate for the advantages
that the US industry had gotten through
Reaganite protectionism and public
funding same day this is all on the
business pages you know it's not the
front page same day the business pages
reported that the United States the
Clinton administration had decided that
the next you know whatever hundreds of
billions of dollars worth of jet planes
would not go to McDonnell Douglas which
builds jet planes but the Boeing which
produces commercial aircraft because
they need the shot in the arm from the
public publicly produced technology
which then they can convert to
commercial uses that's what's called
capitalism if you look at the there is a
technical good technical study of the
top hundred transnational corporations
just came out about a year ago in
England on the fortune list they found
that all hundred of them had benefited
from the industrial policies of their
homes countries and twenty were saved
from total destruction either but by
public take over
ll when they got into trouble that's
free market capitalism right across the
board it's fine for 7 year old kids but
not for rich people they need protection
and they get plenty of in all these ways
that's part of what the university is
about as far as globalization is
concerned it's real you know and you can
argue about whether it's good or bad but
it's not you know the scale is nothing
particularly novel in fact this number
of people pointed out by the PI R up by
gross measures like trade and investment
flows and that sort of thing it's about
back to what it was around 1913 I mean
there are some differences you know
striking mostly in financial capital the
speed with which speculative capital
moves around which incidentally is a
reflection of state policy you know in
many ways including the
telecommunications it makes it possible
so that's an outgrowth of the state
sector of the economy but it was nothing
for an effect of the interchanges
globally about three-quarters of them
are within Europe Japan in the United
States that is three regions where there
are at least formally Democratic
policies in place that is but you can
make policy without fear of military kuz
at least which is not a small thing
meaning the public has formal mechanisms
to determine how this works if the
mechanisms aren't used well okay that
something you try to do something about
but the idea that it's either free
market capitalism or out of control you
know or something totally new or the end
of history I mean this is not a word of
this I don't think can be sustained as
far as predictions it seems to me to
point was to worry about nobody's ever
been predicting correctly in the past we
won't predict properly now the thing is
to do something about it
an organization called the smartest
revolutionary socialist organization
might ask Rick safe to say that people
believe in society this way that all
society the imperialist war increase
attack and personalizes the past blacks
immigrants the tax delayed and so forth
is fat all the rotten saying thank you
to the capitalist system if you would
thank the system where production is for
private property goes to social social
tickets and but I am with the
organization representing so it has to
happen in order to be able to provide
for example posts of holes or like that
basic taxi fortune arts all these
questions or plus the poor is basically
the same thing we think that the working
class which multiracial integrated
working classes of people who have a
hands-on the direct means
factories the railroads so forth that
they have to basically lead a revolution
in this country and across the world
that matter that is going to take a
power out of the hands of the capitalist
class and that's going to introduce a
social system image on production you
know ease so that you will have
knowledge about report contradictions of
note that the discussed many thousands
of dollars exactly mrs. women
Harvard Swensons people for example what
we think that's really necessary for the
fortune of a revolution is going to be a
multiracial are based on cooperation
party that acts as Lenin says attribute
of all the oppressed that is focuses
fight against black impressions women's
oppression depression sexuals is so
forth into one unifying party that we
fight as always these are problems for
example our organization over the past
summer let it demonstration insulin Klux
Klan Chicago if you are successful
inventing these races terrorists from
movie is not a question a lot many
waiting here come on yeah let me just
say for you so much we do have limited
time hoping on this so good I can take a
look but yeah yeah question just stay
over they have a question
you will be given us a good analysis and
thanks
yeah it's like you encourage people to
check out a newspaper to represent this
is so much happy democracy of the
universe is a little bit here so much
about that's a junkie no question once
mentioned earlier your public spending
you broke it down into two categories at
being social spending military spending
would be democratic the other being that
I was just wondering to collaborate a
bit on the logic behind that also kind
of doing it be worth it for the line
drawn between military and obviously
your school bus and Boeing 727 but just
know explain what well I don't really
think that that's the right break down
what I tried to say is that in the late
40s that was the choice the choice was
when the business community was talking
about how to ensure that public funds
went to advance sectors of Industry
there were sort of two obvious channels
one is various means of social spending
of social would stimulate the economy
they understood that and the other was
military spending and they hit upon note
they almost unanimously hit upon
military spending on the other hand its
military spending is mostly it's just
it's not really for them for military
purposes like takes a Boeing which you
mentioned boeing is the leading exporter
and the civilian exporter in the united
states called the leading civilian
export aircraft is the leading civilian
export a big trade surplus from aircraft
furthermore the one of the biggest the
biggest service industry is tourism
which is of course aircraft base which
brings big surpluses back to the United
States well what is all is based on well
it's based on military production that's
where the you know the electronics is
developed and the avionics and the you
know the metals all the fancy stuff
comes from military aircraft military
transports or you know bombers or
fighters and then it's transferred over
to commercial
industry this dual use technology it is
does give a step up to almost all
production and as I mentioned the say
the telecommunications industry well
that was developed as military
production but of course that means the
internet and you know fiber-optic the
transmission and so on and so forth so
you can't really break down military and
not and civilian spending they are
integrated and the military system is
cut has been used as a cover for
ensuring that the public funding goes to
advance sectors of industry that's been
the way the US economy has been working
for a long time I mean the maybe there's
nothing more dramatic than computers
which kind of core of a modern economy
takes a in the 1950s computers were not
commercially marketable so they were
being developed at places like Lincoln
labs that in MIT lab out in Lincoln
under the within the framework guys I
think but that's a value judgment but at
least within the framework of an air
defense system I don't think anybody
seriously thought it was going to defend
anybody from Russian airplanes but it
did develop the basic architecture and
structure and software and so on for
what became commercial computers and one
of the people high up in that project
then went off and set up Dell and then
IBM got into the act and so on and so
forth and that's about the way it goes
so it's not a military spending serves a
very definite function I think
essentially the function that Symington
describe it this guy's is subsidy is by
security but I think that ought to be
completely broken down and people out of
these ought to be issues in the public
arena which people ought to make
decisions about what the decisions ought
to be I don't think are so obvious like
how should the technology the future be
developed and who should pay for it
which would it be and so on those are
not so simple questions but at least we
ought to be able to agree on one thing
there are questions that ought to be
made in the public by the public through
direct participation not in secret by
the guys who are going to get the
to him it's going to be given under the
guise of security
personal the left i wrote the doing work
i think that for me personally and
enlightening experience my question is
worse
we've been talking a lot about social
and there seems to be in this period of
time another issue has come up and could
change design and hospitals don't change
and that is the environmental in the
lala who fielded price is really lost a
lot of last night's i wish one very
concerned about these issues pacific
capital behind changing the system as it
is because it would be things have to
change moment for our students see two
minutes
my question is a lot of the vision of
how people change reverse the movie
dinner tonight cool and that is that the
way the years attack papers they eat
recruited and trained and funded a book
of Representatives change the nation
conversant the way us can there are
number people who are that is the way
they should have done and figure commit
my last name impossible if you say
election see that you can tip the scales
enough cement like push a pretty for you
see alternative vision so far you've
studied instead of some change
give some
nervous great
Lebanon spoke about powers behind the
scenes yeah that we take our orders from
people back here who tell me you think
they should be the last questions that
are you saying I have good news five
more questions yeah just say something
quickly I guess you're asking about the
you know the pouring of money into
electoral campaigns or other options
well it better be other options yeah
that because I mean if there's anything
we've learned over from social movements
over a period of time you know is that a
social change does not come about
through the electoral process you know
it doesn't it doesn't it's sure it's
sure it's helpful it's not not a bad
idea to get you know a in over B I mean
most of the time we have it's a or a
prime but we have a over B yeah it's
better but but we're fundamental and
justices have existed in the society and
then and the history of the labor
movement shows this history the woman's
move with the anti-war movement gay
movement disabled people's movement you
know the initiatives have not come from
Congress the president the Supreme Court
the initials have come from citizens
movement people's movements and then
whether you have a Republican or
Democrat up there where they have a or b
up there if you have a movement powerful
enough they will have to respond to that
so that's my quick judgment on on that
I'm afraid we really do at the end then
let me just add last footnote if if
we're thinking about buying elections if
that's the arena in which conflict is
going to take place we can make a pretty
safe guess as to who's going to buy them
I created arrest we openly baby we're
obviously the booze yeah that's right I
don't think things either can be or
ought to be done in secret we try to do
it there are much more powerful forces
that can do things in secret we have to
do things in public what our strength is
people nothing else
hi this is Raja lyster for Radio Free
Maine and you've been watching Noam
