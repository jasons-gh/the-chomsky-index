good morning good morning love good
morning love their milk count three two
one take two good morning welcome dear
Mills town center the home of the
world's largest permanent
point-of-purchase video wall
installation my name is Kelvin look and
I'm your video host all day here a TM TV
I want to take this opportunity to
extend a very special and warm welcome
to the film crew from necessary
illusions we've got an excellent lineup
of television programming for you today
so let's get on with it
so how long have they been working on
this documentary I see them work every
country I show up they're always there
now they were in England Japan over the
place okay they must have 500 hours
where the tape by me but they put
together a real doozy when they're done
huh no why I hear somebody talk for an
hour I guess they know what to do noam
chomsky's anybody know who Noam Chomsky
is
good afternoon and welcome to Wyoming
talks my guest today is well-known
intellectual Norm Chow em skate thank
you for being on our program today drink
glad to be here well I know probably the
main purpose for your trip to Wyoming is
to discuss thought control in a
Democratic Society now I'd say I'm just
uh Jane USA and I say well gee this is a
Democratic Society and what do you mean
thought control I make up my own mind I
create my own destiny what would you say
to her well I would suggest that Jane
take a close look at the way the media
operate the way the public relations
industry operates the extensive thinking
that's been going on for
a long long period about the necessity
for finding ways to marginalize and
control the public in democratic society
but particularly to look at the evidence
that's been accumulated about the way
the major media the sort of
agenda-setting media in the national
press the televisions on the way that
they shape and control the kinds of
opinions that here the kinds of
information that comes through the
sources to which they go and so on and I
think that Jane will find some very
surprising things about the democratic
system like to welcome all of you to
this lecture today several years ago
fresa Chomsky was described in the New
York Times Book Review as follows judges
in terms of the power range novelty and
influence of his thought Noam Chomsky is
arguably most important intellectual
alive professor Noam Chomsky
gather there are some people out behind
that blackness there but if I don't look
you in the eye it's because I don't see
you all I see is the blackness uh
perhaps I ought to begin by reporting
something that's never read the line
about the arguably the most important
intellectual in the world and so on
comes from publishers blur but you also
always got to watch those things because
if you go back to the original you'll
find that that sentence is actually
there this is in the new york times but
the next sentence is since that's the
case how can you write such terrible
things about American foreign policy and
they never quote that put but in fact if
it wasn't for that second sentence I
would begin to think that I'm doing
something wrong and I'm not joking about
that it's true that the Emperor doesn't
have any clothes but the Emperor doesn't
like to be told it and the Emperor's
lapdogs like the New York Times are not
going to enjoy the experience if you do
good evening I'm Bill Moyers what's more
dangerous the big stick are the big lie
governments have used both against their
own people tonight i'll be talking with
a man who has been thinking about how we
can see the developing live he says that
propaganda is to democracy what violence
is to a dictatorship but he hasn't lost
faith in the power of common people to
speak up for the truth you have said
that we live in tangled in webs of
illness deceit that we live in a highly
indoctrinated society where elementary
truths are easily buried elementary
truths such as such as the fact that we
invaded South Vietnam or the fact that
we're standing in the way of significant
and have four years of significant moves
towards arms negotiation or the fact
that the military system is to an
obsessive stantial extent not totally
but to a substantial extent a mechanism
by which the general population is
compelled to provide a subsidy to high
technology industry since they're not
going to do it if you ask them to you
have to deceive them into doing it I
think there are many truths like that
and we don't face them do you believe in
common sense i mean uracil you do
believe in
cartesian common sense i think people
have the capacities to see through the
deceit in which there and sneered but
they got to make the effort seems a
little in congress to hear a man from
the ivory tower of massachusetts
institute of technology a scholar a
distinguished linguistics scholar talk
about common people with such
appreciation i think that scholarship at
least the field that i work in has the
opposite consequences by my own studies
in language and human cognition
demonstrate to me at least what
remarkable creativity ordinary people
have the very fact that people talk to
one another is a reflection just in the
normal way i don't mean anything
particularly fancy reflects deep-seated
features of human creativity which in
fact separate human beings from any
other biological system we know tonight
scientists talk to the animals but are
they talking back
the journal with Babur from at Mary Lou
Finley communicating with animals is a
serious scientific pursuit this is NIMH
Jim ski NIMH jokingly named after the
great linguist Noam Chomsky was the
great hope of animal communication in
the 1970s for four years putito and
others coached him in sign language but
in the end they decided it was a lost
cause NIMH could ask for things but not
much more I would have loved to have a
conversation with him and understand how
he looked at the universe it failed to
communicate that information to mean a
week and we gave him every opportunity
no I'm Chomsky theorist of language and
political activist has had an
extraordinary career I can think of none
like in recent American history and few
anywhere at any time he has literally
transformed the subject of linguistics
at the same time he's become one of the
most consistent critics of power
politics in all its protein guises
scholar and propagandist his two careers
apparently reinforce each other in 1957
he published his sink tactic structures
which began what has frequently been
called the Chomsky and revolution in
linguistics like a latter-day Copernicus
Chomsky proposed a radically new way of
looking at cleary of grammar Chomsky
worked out the formal rules of a
universal grammar which generated the
specific rules of actual or natural
languages
the general approach on taking seems to
me rather simple minded and
unsophisticated but nevertheless correct
later he came to argue that such systems
are innate features of human beings they
belong to the characteristics of the
species and have been in effect
programmed into the genetic equipment of
the mind like the machine language in a
computer one needn't be interested in
this question of course i am interested
in it and the interesting question from
this point of view would be what is the
nature of the initial state that is what
is human nature in this respect that
astonishing Bacary that next to facility
seletti that in turn explains the
astonishing facility the children have
been learning the rules of natural
language no matter how complicated
incredibly quickly from what are
imperfect and often degenerate samples
complicated so concentrated near jenin
complicated which means it's complicated
if in fact our minds were a blank slate
and experience wrote on them we would be
very impoverished creatures indeed so
the obvious hypothesis is that our
language is the result of the unfolding
of a genetically determined program well
plainly there are different languages in
fact the apparent variation of languages
is quite superficial it's certain as if
that's at certain veining ill is that
humans are not genetically programmed to
learn one or another language so you
bring up a japanese baby in Boston that
will speak Boston English if you bring
up my child in Japan it'll speak
Japanese and that means that the base
that from that it fought from from that
it simply follows by logic that the
basic structure of the languages must be
essentially the same our task as
scientists is to try to determine
exactly what those fundamental
principles are that cause the knowledge
of language to unfold in the manner in
which it does under particular
circumstances and incidentally I think
there is no doubt the same must be true
other aspects of human intelligence and
systems of understanding and
interpretation and the moral and
aesthetic judgment and so on the
implications of these views have washed
over the fields of psychology education
sociology philosophy literary criticism
and logic
in the fifties and sixties the bridge
between your theoretical work and your
political work seems to have been the
attack on behavior isn't but now
behaviorism is no longer an issue or so
it seems so how does this leave the link
between your linguistics and your
politics well I've always regarded the
link I've never really perceived much of
a link to tell you the truth again I
would be very pleased to be able to
discover intellectually convincing
connections between my own anarchist
convictions on the one hand and what I
think I can demonstrate or at least
begin to see about the nature of human
intelligence on the other but I simply
can't find intellectually satisfying
connections between those two domains I
can discover some tenuous points of
contact yeah Luke Leia DDT or CV de

lietuva are you other mental experiment
no default social don't the hopper the
projects you don't need the class it sit
down if it is correct as I believe it is
that a fundamental element of human
nature is the need for a creative work
for a creative inquiry for for free
creation without the arbitrary limiting
effects of course of institutions then
of course it will follow that a decent
society should maximize the
possibilities for this fundamental human
characteristic to be realized now a
federated
decentralized system of free
associations incorporating economic as
well as social institutions would be
what I refer to as anarcho-syndicalism
and it seems to me that it is the
appropriate form of social organization
for an advanced technological society in
which human beings do not have to be
forced into position of tools of cogs in
the machine since the 1960s Noam Chomsky
has been the voice of a very
characteristic brand of rationalist
libertarian socialism he's attacked the
abuses of power wherever he saw them
he's made himself deeply unpopular by
his criticism of American policy the
subservience of the Intelligencia the
degradation of Zionism the distortions
of media and self-delusions of
prevailing ideologies
under the liberal administration's of
the 1960s the cloth of academic
intellectuals designed and implemented
the Vietnam War and the other similar
though smaller actions this particular
community is a very relevant one to
consider it a place like MIT because of
course you're all free to enter enter
this community in fact you're invited
and encouraged the community of
technical intelligentsia and weapons
designers and counterinsurgency of
experts and magmatic planners of
american empire is one that you have a
great deal of inducement become
associated with the inducements and
facts are very real the rewards
Jamie this came with the meal we with
you in a second
okay they still get their cameras okay
look I will start in your essay language
and freedom you write social action must
be animated by a vision of a future
society I was wondering what vision of a
future society and animates you oh well
I have my own ideas as to what a future
society should look like I've written
about them I mean I think that we should
the most general level we should be
seeking out forms of authority and
domination and challenging their
legitimacy sometimes they are legitimate
that is let's say they needed for
survival so for example I wouldn't
suggest that during the Second World War
the forms of authority we had a
totalitarian society basically and I
thought there was some justification for
that under wartime conditions and their
other forms of social relations between
parents and children for example
involved forms of coercion which are
sometimes justifiable but any such any
any form of coercion and the control
requires justification and most of them
are completely unjustifiable now at
various stages of human civilization
it's been possible the challenge some of
them but not others others are too deep
seeded or you don't see them or whatever
and so at any particular point you try
to detect those forms of authority and
domination which which are subject to
change and which do not have any
legitimacy in fact which often strike at
fundamental human rights and your
understanding of fundamental human
nature and right well what are the major
things say today there are some that are
being addressed in a way
the feminist movement is addressing some
the civil rights movement is dressing
others the one major one that's not
being seriously addressed is the one
that's really the core of the system of
domination and that's private control
over over resources and that means an
attack on the fundamental structure of
state capitalism I think that's in order
that's not something far off in the
future you're lying word
the alphabet has only 26 letters with
these 26 magic symbols however millions
of words are written every day nowhere
else are people so addicted to
information and entertainment via the
printed word every day the world comes
thumping on the American doorstep and
nothing that happens anywhere remains
long a secret from the American
newspaper reach it comes to us pretty
casually the daily paper but behind its
arrival on your doorstep is one of
journalism's major stories how it got
there there is a standard view about
democratic societies and the role of the
media within them it's expressed for
example by Supreme Court justice Powell
when he spoke of the crucial role of the
media in effecting the societal purpose
of the First Amendment namely enabling
the public to assert meaningful control
over the political process that kind of
formulation expresses the understanding
that democracy requires free access to
information and ideas an opinion and the
same conceptions hold not only with
regard to the media but with regard to
educational institutions publishing the
intellectual community generally it is
basic to the help of a democracy that no
phase of government activity escape the
scrutiny of the press ear reporters are
assigned to stories faithful not only to
our nation but to all nations Congress
says the First Amendment shall pass no
law abridging the freedom of the press
and the chief executive himself throws
open the doors of the White House to
journalists representing papers of all
shades of political opinion
but it is worth bearing in mind that
there is a contrary view and in fact the
contrary view is very widely held and
deeply rooted in our own civilization it
goes back to the origins of modern
democracy to the 17th century English
revolution which was a complicated
affair like most popular revolutions
there was a struggle between parliament
representing largely elements of the
gentry and the merchants and the
Royalists representing other elite
groups and they floated out but like
many popular revolutions there was also
a lot of popular ferment going that was
opposed to all of them there were
popular movements that were questioning
everything the relation between master
and servant the right of authority all
together all kinds of things were being
questioned there was a lot of radical
publishing the printing presses had just
come into existence and this disturbed
all the elites on both sides of the
Civil War so as one historian pointed
out at the time in 1660 he criticized
the radical Democrats the ones we're
calling for what we would call democracy
because they are making the people so
curious and so arrogant that they will
never find humility enough to submit to
a civil rule now underlying these
doctrines which were very widely held is
a certain conception of democracy it's a
game for elites it's not for the
ignorant masses who have to be
marginalized diverted and controlled of
course for their own good the same
principles were upheld in the American
colonies the dictum of the founding
fathers of American democracy that on
quoting the people who owned the country
ought to govern it
John J
now in modern times their elite this
contrary view about the intellectual
life and the media and so on this
country review in fact is the standard
one I think apart from rhetorical
flourishes
from Washington DC he's intellectual
author and linguist professor Noam
Chomsky manufacturing consent what does
that title meant to describe well the
title is actually borrowed from a book
by walter Lippmann written back around
nineteen twenty one in which he
described what he called the manufacture
of consent
