classical liberalism was saying Jonathan
Humboldt Park or so second discourse
other Enlightenment conceptions I should
go back to the cart it was committed to
a conception of human nature's being
based on unconstrained creative activity
so for example say for Humboldt is
basically one of the founders of
classical liberalism also the modern
education system that also linguistics
in fact his picture of his basic picture
was summarized in a phrase in which he
said that if a craftsman produces a
beautiful work on command we may admire
what he does but will despise what he is
a tool in the hands of others if the
craftsman creates out of his own
interest initiative commitment search
and we admire what he is and the same
with a child if a child is treated like
in cm schools like a vessel into which
you pour water maybe the water will come
out again right form with not education
what the teacher ought to be doing is
both phrase laying out a thread along
which the student progresses and her own
way from inner impulses and that relates
immediately to social organization
follows right away that any acceptable
decent the form of social organization
ought to be based on what a nurture and
encourage free creative activity and
that includes
self-determination control of all the
decisions in matter
in the institution so it's a kind of
like a seamless web and out of that
comes classical liberalism and as Rudolf
rocker and if you think you've pointed
out I think pretty accurately a
classical liberalism foundered on the
shoals of capitalism when this is pre
capitalist and when capitalist
structures developed classical
liberalism was destroyed
it couldn't its own conceptions of
freedom independence and creativity were
stunted or destroyed by the hierarchical
Nigeria structure that was a core of
capitalist capitalist institutions and
anarchism then would be the from this
point of view would be the development
of the remnants of classical liberalism
and conversion of women to ways of
thinking and acting in a capitalist or
post-capitalist society
anarcho-syndicalism specifically was
directed towards organization of the
industrial societies but so I think
there's a continuity
