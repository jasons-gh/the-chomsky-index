thanks very much for agreeing to be
interviewed by the world Network for
saving children from radiation I wanted
to start off by asking you about Ann Ann
Grover who's the UN's Special Rapporteur
and and Grover on the right of everyone
to the enjoyment of the highest
attainable standard of physical and
mental health just released a report on
Fukushima from his extensive visit in
November 2012 and it has over two pages
of recommendations it's quite damning
report I mean some of the main points
have been reported elsewhere but they
include the Japanese government's lack
of real safety measures the response
system that was uncoordinated and
inadequate or underutilized the
radiological emergency plans were
piecemeal and inadequate and then the
ties between the Japanese government's
nuclear regulatory body and the Japanese
nuclear industry particularly TEPCO the
company that owns the Fukushima Daiichi
nuclear complex were not transparent and
far too close to allow for independent
regulation based on the best science
available and as a result safety was
compromised since the accident the
Japanese government refuses to take
responsibility for resetting people
particularly children from areas where
the long-term radiation dose exceeds
internationally accepted levels
furthermore the Japanese government has
indemnify TEPCO against further losses
by underwriting the cleanup effort and
other financial liabilities this is let
the Japanese people responsible for
paying TEPCO's debt in the section on
radiation safety in school textbooks the
reported safe dose according to the text
textbooks that are now given to Japanese
children is up to 100 millisieverts and
as the report notes that the UN report
notes this is not consistent with law
and Japan international standards or
epidemiological research and then there
are a host of other problems identified
in the report that affect the musical
physical and mental health of the
communities in around Fukushima as well
as the nuclear workers in the plant in
charge of decontamination
so first of all what is your response to
the findings from the UN Special
Rapporteur and your knowledge of how the
Japanese government has gone about
dealing with this horrendous catastrophe
that happened in March 2011 well from
the very beginning the government has
held back information has tried to back
off from taking action in many ways has
made the catastrophe considerably worse
naturally one can only be critical of
that and I hope that international and
domestic pressures will lead the
government to proceed in a more
constructive fashion we should recognize
that they're not alone so for example it
hasn't been investigated closely because
there's a principle which says we never
investigate our own crimes only crimes
of someone else
it's an overriding principle but there's
pretty substantial evidence accumulating
from the Iraqi and international
scientists that the levels of radiation
did in parts of Iraq which have been the
targets of a primary a u.s. British
attack are extremely align some reports
from Fallujah indicate that the
radiation levels are
proximately hiroshima by level well we
don't know in detail because it doesn't
yet investigate it but those are
questions we should be asking ourselves
too and we condemn rightly condemned the
Japanese government for not taking
measures that it should the as many
consideration things to think about
including ourselves and of course the
u.s. world and radiation and Japan and
not be discussed we should we should
know about it and think about it and
want to do something about it on the
specific issue every measure of course
should be taken to ensure the safety of
the children to take positive steps
towards either eliminating nuclear power
efforts entirely or else at least
ensuring that the highest standards are
maintained but pursuing yes it's
interesting you mentioned Hiroshima
because according to the UN's report the
the amount of radioactive cesium
released by the Fukushima Daiichi
meltdowns was a hundred and sixty eight
times that released in Hiroshima bombing
and yeah there are 300,000 children
living in the radioactive areas in
Fukushima Prefecture the mandatory
evacuation standard in Japan is set
lower than that of the general disaster
and it seems that the Japanese
government as you mentioned is not
currently taking its responsibilities
seriously with regard to helping people
relocate making sure that they can we
economically speaking and so on
particularly the question of children
which is related to the legal case that
is being pressed against the Japanese
government by the world Network for
saving children from radiation well I
think obviously think the Japanese
government should do more but I think we
should as well it's a the use of nuclear
power is an international responsibility
nuclear power is being used because of
the extraordinary damage it caused by
fossil fuels and the lack of Japan's
particular case the lack of direct
access to fossil fuels that imposes a
severe responsibility on the wealthy
countries to vastly expand their
research and development and efforts of
his regard the sustainable development
which will reduce the threat of
disasters like this and of the threat to
the children of course that should be a
primary concern right now so it's a
broad responsibility it's fine for say
me to criticize the Japanese government
for its failures which are substantial
but this more urgent tasks for you and
for me
right yeah in fact the International
Atomic Energy Agency is in Corporation
now and part of the cleanup of the
health issues in Japan and yet they have
to set this agencies at the same time
responsible for promoting nuclear power
well that's a tricky issue in fact as
some of the most prominent
if climate scientists like James Hansen
for example nectar in favor of pursuing
nuclear power arguing that with all of
its dangers its which are not slight by
any means the alternatives could be a
lot worse fossil fuels are a devastating
impact of like the real alternative
would be developing sustainable options
over energy maybe some others and that
requires substantial efforts which are
much too limited so and in the history
of the world Japan is the only country
to have suffered a nuclear attack and it
was under occupation from the US until
1954 and yet it's also a country that is
at the same time as developing nuclear
power it's 54 nuclear power stations
it is highly geologically active and so
much of the nuclear technology in Japan
was a product of us technology
Westinghouse and General Electric what
to what extent do you believe the
original decision to develop nuclear
power in Japan was a Japanese decision
versus a question of what the u.s.
thought was best for the development of
the country
well Japan was very much under view at
us influences course under direct
occupation and remains under US
influence so for example when just a
couple of years ago when Japanese Prime
Minister dared to raise the question of
removing US bases from low key
the population has been struggling
against him for years he was pretty
quickly ousted under US pressure
so yes the US role was significant
however we have to ask what the options
were right after the Second World War
the u.s. made great efforts to shift
both Europe and Japan to use of fossil
fuels of oil particularly that was a
century of us monopoly but pretty close
to it
the sinking was explicit George Kennan
one of the leading planners pointed out
what was then secret not declassified
documents that the if the United States
can maintain control over the major
energy resources of the world from early
Middle East it will have what he called
veto power over Japan they Kosovo have a
kind of a stranglehold they'll require
our oil well there were other
alternatives known as there are now they
should have much more obvious now than
they were then but the choice of nuclear
power was in part a reaction to this
that it's one of the ways of escaping a
fight of course has to immediate fossil
that does not have rich fossil fuel
resources some cold not much and
therefore santaworld who was in the
Pacific was one major factor of it was
Japan's effort to gain
to the fossil fuels of Southeast Asia or
of Southeast Asia after the ABCD
countries of America Britain China Dutch
had closed it closed off the empires in
the early 1930s the Imperial systems
were closed because in an effort to
protect the West from rising Japanese
competition and the Japan reacted very
brutally by trying to conquer those
resources that led to the Second World
War
after the war the u.s. plan was to
restore Japan's Empire to provide Japan
with what Canon called an empire toward
the south it's essentially restored
Japan's an award of but under US control
and that meant the US would maintain
what can I call veto power over and
within that context it was a turn to
nuclear fuel so there's many factors
that should be considered when we think
about this the real option on I think
most knowledgeable scientists others
would agree with this is to find
alternatives to destructive energy
resources and that includes fossil fuels
and nuclear energy
maybe Sauber and which brings us forward
to today because Japan has a sizable
stock part of plutonium as a result of
its civilian nuclear power operations
and there were some elements within
Japanese political society you want to
overcome overturn the ban on nuclear
weapons develop nuclear weapons the
United States is saying you're safe
under our nuclear umbrella which has
been that policy since the Second World
War and yet there are increasing
tensions in the region visibly a more
assertive China I wonder how that or in
your view plays out in terms of what is
going on now when the US says you're
safe under a nuclear umbrella that begs
a lot of questions actually the nuclear
umbrella is extremely hazardous
it's practically led to destruction of
the United States that's worth
remembering that states do not it
contrary to what you read in
international relations theory states do
not take the security as our our you can
easily show that so just take us history
u.s. is in the lead on this most
important country and it's also an
unusually open society so we have a lot
of evidence they just take a brief look
at the record which includes Japan in
the early 1950s the United States had
extraordinary security enormous power
has the world's wealth just incompetence
purity that was one potential threat
ICBMs with hydrogen bomb words they
didn't exist but there were potential
threat well the Russians knew that they
were far behind
lesson technology and technology of war
making so they actually offered it to a
treaty to the United States to ban these
destructive weapons how did the u.s.
react well we know there's a highly
authoritative history of nuclear weapons
written about the q1 Daisy
National Security Adviser from Kennedy
and Johnson via access to rich array of
internal documents he writes more or
less in passing that he could not find a
single document paper that even
considered the possibility so the idea
of even considering the possibility of
saving yourself from total destruction
didn't arise because other factors were
issues were more important why go 10
years beyond that 1962 John F Kennedy
was willing to face a subjective
probabilities on judgment of a third to
a half of nuclear war which would have
been massively destructed in order to
establish a principle the principle was
that the United States has the right to
have offensive nuclear weapons
everywhere and no one else has that
right that was the principle if you look
closely and in order to establish that
it's willing to face nuclear war that
involved Japan right before the Cuban
Missile Crisis six months before Kennedy
had sent that mr. long long brave ICBM
long-range missiles to Okinawa with
nuclear warheads that was threatening
China at a period of great tension and
it was a major constantly develop to be
in China but that would have brought
destruction to Japan that was 1962 they
want to ten years later in 1973 Henry
Kissinger called a nuclear alert what
was the reason the reason was that there
was a war in the Middle East Israel Arab
War Russia and the United States had
made an agreement to impose a ceasefire
but Kissinger secretly advised Israel
that they didn't have to observe the
ceasefire they could continue and the
nuclear alert was intended to warrant
Russia to stay away the nuclear allure
of course everyone knows
so that's 1973 another 10 years Ronald
Reagan's and office and his
administration decided to test Russian
defenses by simulating nuclear attack on
Russia we said you know advanced bombers
and so on the Russians didn't entirely
understand what's going on they didn't
know whether it was real or simulated so
they call the major ruler we came pretty
close to war we can go on right till
today right just in fact just a couple
of weeks ago months ago if act if you
listen to the President Obama's last
speech with a big speech on 15 new clue
the pivot to Asia yeah well more than
that the new military policy that he
announced a couple of weeks ago there
was an interesting sentence he said that
our assasinated meeting called that but
the assassination of Osama bin Laden he
said carried dangers and threatened our
relations with Pakistan willing to take
a look beyond that it's much more than
that the Navy SEALs were sent in to
assassinate bin Laden were under orders
to fight their way out if they had to if
they had had to the whole weight of US
military force which was entered
Pakistan as a professional army
dedicated to defense of the sovereignty
of the country they have nuclear weapons
probably laced with jihadi elements the
chief of staff of Pakistan was informed
about the intrusion and mobilized forces
he thought it was from India General
Petraeus and Kabul mobilized US forces
scrambled u.s. plans in pretty close to
a war which got has grown into a nuclear
war this was in order to carry out an
assassination someone else's territory
and what this tells us that is easy to
go on is that being under a nuclear
umbrella is a threat it's not security
it's a major threat though these are the
weapons that can instantly destroy
everything they're under the control of
leadership elements that do not regard
security as a high priority in
and are willing to take serious risks so
the very existence of these weapons is a
major threat to survive and in fact
there is a legal obligation if anyone
cares but determined by the Worldport
that the nuclear powers have a legal
responsibility to live up to their
conditions under the non-proliferation
treaty to make good-faith efforts to
eliminate these destructive weapons so
talk about a security blanket I think is
extremely misleading how do you compare
the reporting on the Fukushima disaster
thinking back to the reporting around
Chernobyl in the nineteen room
Jenova in the 1980s do you see
significant differences Vogel is
regarded correctly as a major crime of
the Soviet Union or a reason to condemn
the evil empire for its crimes about
whether it's operable but it's certainly
pretty awful and the reason is so now by
exacta client we should be much more
honest about that and as I said we
should always look in the mirror nice
well whatever responsibility is and what
we can do about it
we can do a lot how do you think we
could best place pressure on the
Japanese government because similarly in
Japan it's not being reported there are
lots of problems already starting to see
health effects of children in the region
women who are pregnant at the time of
the nuclear disaster they didn't have a
proper evacuation plan so some people
stayed in highly irregular irradiated
areas as the plume came across beyond
the 20 kilometers exclusion zone that
people were regulated from but they were
not evacuated in the direction that the
plume was traveling so they were
irradiated for over a month and they
stayed there not being told to be
evacuated and very little of this has
been reported in the mainstream Japanese
media in a similar way that it's not
really reported here about crimes of the
US government and I wonder what we could
do to help force the issue into the open
with regard to what's going on in Japan
because when I was over there
many people were extremely concerned
with they were not getting the correct
information from the Japanese government
their health concerns were not being
taken seriously
they were very the UN report talked
about not just the physical welfare and
health of the people but also their
mental health
some people were moved multiple times
some people up with 10 times 2 different
emergency centers very dislocating older
people were moved all over the country
on 110,000 people are still in
evacuation centers around I have not
been able to move back and yet Kuriyama
City which is the second biggest city in
Fukushima is there's just over 300,000
children still in the area of Fukushima
who are in areas that are above 1
millisievert the Japanese government is
saying we don't need to do anything
about that and the Japanese media is
following that live what would you
advise over injured
that they could do and also here with
respect to government there's the media
kind of blackout at the store like many
other media blackouts can try to put
pressure on the media to report it can
support the domestic groups in Japan
that are protesting it and trying to
gain some make some progress in dealing
with the issues that we can pressure our
own governments to provide aid and
assistance to carry out the very
substantial task of proper relocation
resettlement and beyond that we can
pressure our own governments which you
should be doing independently of
Fukushima to that take the very
seriously far more servers than they're
doing now the task of developing
alternative sustainable energy systems
which will cut back the use of
destructive technologies which won't
leave us with the awful choice between
nuclear energy and fossil fuels and just
to kind of finish on that question
because as you mentioned earlier James
Hansen who has really brought to life
from the late 1980s the question of
climate changing global warming that
we're currently worsening as co2 levels
continuing to increase the use of fossil
fuels continues to increase and more
extreme forms of energy are being
utilized so that the US has gone from
being worried about running out of
natural gas to having a glut of natural
gas on its hand and oil and is predicted
to rival Saudi Arabia by 2020 or so in
terms of its ability to get more oil out
of the ground what are some real
alternative because James Hansen is very
much in favor of nuclear power which is
surprising when you see not only the
effects of Fukushima
are going to go on for decades that
could happen at any time at any of the
other 400 odd plants around the world
the nuclear industry is very much in
favor of expansion of course and there
are any number of arguments not just not
safety but also on economics that
there's no way that nuclear power could
be an answer to
trista generation and of course once you
build a nuclear power plant they're so
huge that they practically have to be
run all the time
they require you to justify them by
ramping up energy use so there's an out
of the window there's any concept of
energy conservation and that was quite
noticeable in Japan when they closed all
54 reactors 30% of the electricity
supply there were no blackouts and Japan
continued in other words they didn't
need the nuclear power reactors in what
sense
the question is what they used to be
close right so they practiced a lot of
conservation but moving forward how
could Japan
realistically move away from fossil
fuels to move away from nuclear power
because the Japanese government now is
investing heavily in the extraction of
methane clathrates
frozen methane deposits which is
supposed to rival fossil fuels by two to
one incredibly dangerous so they seem to
be going in exactly the opposite
direction what do you think is the
answer though well I don't know mr.
Hansen personally but I suspect you'd
agree with everything you said
I understood his statements to be saying
look we have an immediate choice between
two awful alternatives and we have to
evaluate and see which is worse
and he thinks he's right that fossil
fuels are worse but that doesn't mean
were restricted to the two alternatives
there are many other things could be
done in fact what's imma take say the
United States richest country the world
enormous advantages Canada pretty much
the same they are in the lead
internationally in trying to destroy the
environment they're in the lead no do
they have to be no I'm and then the
United States and Canada for example
there's lots of things that can be done
very simply in fact like weatherization
of homes which would first of all be a
big shot in the arm for the economy with
a lot of people to work and with very
sharply restrict the use of energy would
improve living conditions with save
wasted resources all sorts of advantages
it's already been done in many places
like in England binocular or simply we
do not have to leave it to China to be
in the lead in developing advanced
technologically advanced solar panels
and that's kind of our test and aren't
they the best approach well maybe so
maybe not technically competent to judge
but I know there are proposals right
here at this institution in fact from
engineers and somebody else would have
to evaluate them to use solar energy
with
collectors outside the Earth's
atmosphere that would use microwave
transmission to bring power to earth is
it feasible well I'm not the one to
judge but these are the kinds of options
that should be pursued seriously and the
resources are available and in fact
they're being cut back like right at
this moment research in the United
States is being reduced it's being
reduced because of pressures and
Congress to cut back scientific
investigation and that's happening
across the board the a couple of weeks
ago there was an issue of science
magazine main science journal which had
three interesting news items in it the
one was that measured new measures of
the ocean temperatures showed that they
were higher than ever been a second was
a technical study on the new discoveries
about the extreme dangers and kind of
reaching a tipping point with the use of
fossil fuels the third news item was
from Congress the House of
Representatives has three committees
concerned with energy and they had
picked the new chairs of the three
committees all climate change deniers
the two of them was long-standing ties
to the fossil fuel industry now that's
the richest and most powerful country in
the world I mean if we're going to if
we're not going to take the lead and
worse if we're going to
like way behind then the chances of
avoiding the horrible choice between
fossil fuels and nuclear energy are very
slight so there are things we can do
right this minute there are major
efforts in the United States to turn
this into what's sometimes called the
stupid nation but is insisting on moving
as rapidly as possible towards the
proverbial lemmings do let's race toward
the cliff and that's what we're doing I
mean actually of roughly a hundred
relevant countries the United States is
the only one that it does not even have
a national policy on energy conservation
and or or of the use of sustainable
energy as random policies scattered
around with no national policy every
other country does and we should be in
the lead not lacking in behind and I
think those are the it we should
certainly be doing making every effort
to support the popular groups of Japan
that are concerned with their immediate
and overwhelming problem of saving
hundreds of thousands of children them
overcoming this disaster but at the same
time we should be looking inwards and
asking why we are making where are we in
the lead in making the problem worse
much worse and leaving people like James
Hansen with this terrible choice it
seems to ask one find a question about
that broadening out further the various
countries around the world despite the
ongoing horrendous catastrophe in
Fukushima those not being dealt with
appropriately by the Japanese government
according to the UN
many others and the clear links between
nuclear power and nuclear weapons and
then the question of how we move forward
in terms of reducing co2 levels back
down to what they've been now that they
exceed their highest level in three
million years what is it I mean
everybody lives on the same planet and
yet the people who are making the
decision as the politicians that that at
the top and obviously the corporations
that they seem to answer to more than
there are people who are like that
what is it systematically that seems to
drive them towards solutions that are
false and continue down this path that
the best science tells us is essentially
suicidal in terms of civilization
biodiversity and so on do you think it's
possible within the confines of
capitalism to move to a completely
different energy paradigm capitalism is
a dissonant and you can you can almost
prove a theorem about it I mean we don't
actually have capitalist systems we have
kind of make systems various sorts but
to the extent that capitalist market
principles prevail and there's
substantial the extent they are a death
sentence for well-known reasons I mean
the if you're the CEO of a corporation
you have a legal institutional
requirement to maximize profit and
market share in fact that's a legal
responsibility there are what are called
externalities and the economics
literature they get a footnote here in
there the externalities are that in a
market transactions they use only a car
we don't take account of the effect on
on her we take account of our own
welfare well you know sometimes the
externalities the externalities are
always significant but sometimes they're
horrendous so take the current financial
crisis that's substantially reducible to
a market of a well known market fit and
in Europe market failure in Europe
namely when financial institutions make
risky transactions they do not take into
account what's called systemic risk the
risk of the whole system will collapse
that's an externality so you disregard
it but it's a much worse one the fate of
the species that's not taken into
account in principle didn't market
transactions so to the extent that these
institutions continue to function it's a
death sentence though they're driven to
try to destroy the species so you know
it's kind of hard to blame the CEO of
ExxonMobil for trying to destroy the
planet which is legal responsibility
under the existing institutional
structures don't think that makes him a
nice guy but we might as well realize
with the fall of laws and that has to do
with you mentioned before the relation
between decision-making and popular
opinion the relation is a very slight
there is also really existing democracy
which there have been debates over the
years about whether democracy and
capitalism are compatible abstract
debate a very concrete question is
really existing capitalism compatible
with
see the answers right in front of us
certainly not that we live in a
plutocracy not a democracy and the
evidence for this is overwhelming the
large majority of the population
literally has no influence on policy
doesn't matter what they think if you
look at public studies of public opinion
which are very expensive in the United
States and well done that you find that
the most what I think you would I would
agree are the most destructive policies
both economically ecologically and so on
are much more strongly supported as you
move up the wealth an income level for
good reasons a piece of people will gain
from in the short term the children made
by the dog and the sugar cane and that's
true pretty much across the board and
they're the ones that make the decisions
in photography not the population and
furthermore there are major efforts made
by the powerful institutions to try to
create a stupid tension so just to give
you one example Lee there is an
organization American Legislative
Exchange Council corporate funded
organization which develops legislation
for state legislatures and they had a
lot of money behind observed a lot of
clout Muslim go through you can imagine
what they are one new one that they're
starting is for schools k12 the program
is to try to introduce what they call a
critical thinking at the schools sounds
nice what's critical thinking means
balanced education so if in sixth grade
you teach what stated ninety-nine
percent of scientists believe you also
have to teach the balanced at what
Senator Jim Inhofe believed
yeah that's balanced education well the
idea is to try to create a very stupid
nation which will continue to sit which
will support the drive to destruction
which is institutionally required by the
way our institutions are constructed so
it's a big there's a lot to dismantle
here it's not just let's put money into
developing solar energy but let's ask
what structures we live in that are
driving us to destruction right I was
very hard on that positive note very hot
by the growing movement in Japan of
ordinary people to challenge their
government on mass with huge
demonstrations tens of thousands and not
just in Tokyo but all around the country
demanding the end of nuclear power and
in view not just a new way of generating
energy but a much more transparent
government more answerable to the people
because the connections between the
corporations and the government
particularly the nuclear corporations
the so-called nuclear village was so
intense something that we saw recently
in with the BP 2010 since I'd like I
always think we should look to ourselves
there's a reason for that - after the
Second World War the United States of
course occupy Japan and controlled it
the first couple of years after the war
the proconsul basically ran it was
General MacArthur MacArthur probably
believed what he was taught in 8th grade
civics so he allowed Japan to move on of
course
of democratization and it was pretty
significant there were quite important
developments and in reaction to Japanese
fashion of happening all over Japan when
the Liberals in Washington discovered
that Japan was being democratized they
were appalled and they instituted what
was called the reverse quirk to impose
upon Japan essentially corporate rule
much like here and it was done they had
the power to do it so this connection
that you're mentioning maybe would have
developed anyway but it developed with
direct US initiative under u.s.
controlled something similar happened in
Europe of course it happens here so our
hand is everywhere for good reasons it's
a rich powerful country most powerful in
history and has enormous impact and what
happens so it makes sense to take a look
at all of these issues and ask what have
we done about it what can we do there
are always good answers to that well
thank you very much thank you
