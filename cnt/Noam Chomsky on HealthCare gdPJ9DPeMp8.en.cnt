let's take the main domestic concern of
Americans for decades the major domestic
concern of Americans or either top or
very close to the top has been the
health system okay that's obviously why
it's a total catastrophe
it has about twice the per capita costs
of other industrial countries has about
the worst outcomes that's and you know
like 50 million people either don't have
insurance or many more have much too
limited insurance now those are things
that really hurt people you know they're
not abstract drug prices are like 2 or 3
times as high as in comparable countries
so that hurts people then they care
about and furthermore people have
consistent ideas consistent beliefs over
a long period and on this issue they
have a very consistent believes for
decades a large part of the population
has been in favor of some kind of
national health care system it's called
to your single-payer it's called
Canadian style the reason it's called
Canadian style is because people know
that Canada exists it's not you know
Australian style which is a better
system because what they have in
Australia but it's been overwhelming
support for it and it would almost
certainly be much cheaper than the
system we have now in fact if you take
the socialized part of the system
Medicare it's administrative costs or
with a fraction of the privatized system
I'm this constant talk about you know
the problems that Medicare is facing
down the road we've got to do something
about stop it yeah that's true but the
problems are because it has to work
through the privatized system which
makes it highly inefficient costly
bureaucratized a lot of intervention
you know and so on well the public has
wanted something that makes sense but
it's not on the political agenda okay
that's very few people know that that's
what everybody wants and know the
reasons for it this is not disguised
okay that's a pretty impressive
achievement to have suppressed for
decades it's not that it's like
everything I said you couldn't find the
data in the papers which you got to
research but here's a situation where
there's a major domestic concern
population has a lot of public support
if it was even discussed publicly they
support would grow much higher you know
when things are not discussed and
debated that people may have an opinion
but their feeling is well I must be
crazy nobody else believes this if it
was part of an ongoing lively debate and
discussion as would happen in a
functioning democratic society then
people would say the reasons for it may
be reinforced and you'd have public
pressure now up until 2004 these ideas
were never on the political agenda so
you go back to the 2004 election Kerry
Bush election take a look at the debates
and the coverage the last debate right
before the election it was on domestic
issues you go back and take a look at
the New York Times of the Washington
Post the next day they point out
correctly the Terry never suggested any
government involvement in the health
care system because it is politically
impossible and lacks political support
okay the only supported head was the
large majority of the population but it
lacked political support that was
politically impossible which means the
insurance companies didn't like it
Nashville institutions didn't like that
pharmaceutical corporations didn't like
it and so on in fact shortly after that
Congress passed legislation which made
it illegal for the government to use its
purchasing power to negotiate drug
prices I think the United States must be
the only country in the industrial world
where anything like that is true
so like the Pentagon can negotiate
prices you know to get paper clips let's
say but the Medicare can't negotiate to
get lower drug prices well now in and in
a short the Medicare program was created
which is a gift to the insurance
companies only the Democrats about its
work all right this year in 2008 as
something changed for the first time the
Democrats began putting forward programs
which are towards what the population
has wanted for decades don't really get
there but at least they're in that
direction first Edwards then Obama and
Clinton or what happened between 2004
and 2008 public opinion didn't change
it's been pretty much the same for
decades what changed is that
manufacturing industry started coming
out in favor of a national health care
system because they're being smashed by
the costs of the privatized system in
the United States like General Motors is
it costs them over a thousand dollars
more to produce a car in Detroit than
across the Canadian border because they
have a rational healthcare system more
rational not perfect but better well you
know when a sector of concentrated
American capital becomes interested in
something it starts to become
politically possible and have political
support these are things that people
ought to be discussing and think about
what does that tell you about air about
functioning democracy that something can
become sort of politically possible even
if not what the public wants
only if a major sector of concentrated
capital is in favor of it now these are
to be topics that are you know the main
top main issues for people who want to
create a functioning democratic society
and that's the major domestic concern
now if you take a look at Obama's
program today it's being criticized
because it's going to be expensive and
we can't afford it he's planning it it's
going to be expensive because it's
maintaining the privatized system and in
fact right the privatized health care
system is complaining bitterly right now
because if there's an option of a public
system as is written into the program
they won't be able to compete on a level
playing field that's a way of saying
we're so inefficient and costly that we
can't compete with a national health
care system so it's unfair and Obama's
proposals such as they are are now being
tinkered with to help the costly
inefficient privatized system compete on
a level playing field why should the
population allow any of this to happen
ok there's a topic a very different one
on which popular organizing can take
place and should have been for decades
and in fact would have been if democracy
was functioning
