come what's happened over the past
roughly 40 years is that both parties
have shifted to the right the Democrats
are essentially what used to be called
moderate Republicans the Republicans are
just off the spectrum they're not a
parliamentary party anymore and that's
actually recognized by leading
conservative analysts the most most
respected of them Norman Ornstein
American Enterprise Institute describes
the Republican Party today as a radical
insurgency that has abandoned
parliamentary politics that you can see
it in the last ever since the Obama
election and Mitch McConnell and others
made it very explicit right off that
they have any one policy ruin the
country as much as possible hope that
people will blame it on the Democrats
and then maybe we can get power back
again and we can follow our program of
dedicating ourselves with utter
servility to the needs of the very rich
in the corporate sector well now of
course in order to gain votes they can't
say that so what they've done is
mobilized sectors of the population that
have always been there but had never
really been politically mobilized like
evangelical Christians nativists who are
afraid that they are taking our country
away from us white racists gun people
who are so terrified that they have to
carry their guns into church because
maybe somebody will come after them you
know these sectors the population are
there and that's now the base of the
Republican Party it was very striking to
watch the primaries the electoral
primaries one after another person came
out from the base each one crazier than
the last you know Backman came in on
santorum raving lunatics the Republican
establishment was frightened and they
poured money into try to destroy them
and they managed to knock him down and
get one of their own men in from the
kind of establishment Republican but
only by undermining the base and they're
facing it again right now the base that
they've organized that had to organize
was there their commitments are so far
to the right as is no if they can't
they're having a hard time keeping it
under control I mean I don't want to
draw analogies too closely but it has
some similarity to what happened in
Germany in the 1930s not I'm not the
only one to point this out into deadly
its leading German historians have
committed out and it's frightening
