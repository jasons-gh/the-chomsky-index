we've got the supreme court case coming
up in London what I found curious well
first of all we were all surprised that
actually got accepted but what I was
really surprised about was that there
were seven Supreme Court judges coming
out at their full power the Supreme
Court it's 12 judges but already if just
one comes out it's a matter of public
importance they announced that it was a
matter of great public importance what
do you think will happen will we see a
precedent will we see something change
in relation to extradition I'd be
surprised mainly for reasons of power
Britain tends to adapt itself to us
demands that's been going on since the
Second World War and the United States
effectively replaced Britain as the
dominant world power and the British
Foreign Office reluctantly conceded that
as they put it from now on we're going
to be junior partners in the United
States I will follow along and do what
they want and that's pretty much what's
been happening whether the judges can
break out of that I don't know that I'd
be skeptical it could be a lot of
pressure on them yeah I think it's
pretty much the same with Australia
Australia it's long been the same
Austria has rightly or wrongly
considered itself to be protected by
being part of the Sun let's call the
Anglosphere the English British now us
dominated world system and Australia's
provided troops it's preferable
services it has military bases the US
military bases all over the place right
now it's just accepting new military
contingent and presumably ultimately
based in Northwest Australia or in
towards China part of the encirclement
of China that's going on for a long time
Australia was considered itself an
outpost of civilization threatened by
the Agincourt so no Asians lab in and so
on that's a changing now that trade
patterns are changing investment
patterns are changing Australia has a
much more as a foot in each world known
has to make some choices and decisions
that didn't know that well we really
like to a prime minister who could speak
fluent Chinese and he was added at never
replaced by Julia Gillard and then she
has now drawn some of those people who
helped put him out Bill Shorten mark
abebe who was we found that he had very
strong relations with the US for a few
years and was talking her up saying she
was pragmatic so we're a little bit
worried about the way things are going
at the top but underneath that's just
what the public should know about then
where they find out better they can
choose themselves yes absolutely it's a
very dangerous business though I think
that possibly we're looking at people
like Bradley Manning Julian Assange
being made an example of Bradley Manning
is a particularly ugly case is he's been
detained without charges for I think
about nine months he was basically being
tortured that's what it means
the in solitary confinement with the
ugly treatment that's the kind of thing
we complain about bitterly when it
happens in Iran or China and so on
tapping right here no charger he isn't
being brought to a civilian court yet
may never be he's being severely
punished in fact torture for claims that
even if they were established wouldn't
would should be a reason for respect not
to criminal charges but they haven't
even been but he doesn't even have
charges so that's really a very ugly
case yeah we seem to have this divider
it's almost like worlds that don't
collide but they're sitting side by side
and the military point of view is just
completely different there's a doctor
but unfortunately it's the civilian 22
yeah i mean the treatment of Bradley
Manning traces right back to the
civilian Authority and sadly this is not
the worst case some of the cases that
are that have come up and I mean the
informations the air but almost nobody
knows about them some of them a really
great test take the first case that came
to a so-called trial namely military
tribunal not a serious trial the first
one under the Obama administration this
case ought to be all over the front
pages every day this is our hotter it's
a 15 year old child the charges against
him are that he tried to defend his
village when it was attacked by American
soldiers in Afghanistan so he's there
for a terrorist he spent eight years
first in Bagram than in
donna mo after eight years he was
brought to the so-called trial he was
given two options the one was to plead
innocent and spend the rest of his life
in prison the other was to plead guilty
in which case he would get only eight
more years in prison he his lawyers
advised him to plead guilty he did I
he's not back in prison again Guantanamo
as a Canadian citizen that Canada could
easily have him sent to Canada and
releasing but they too just don't like
to step on the shoes of Uncle Sam so
they're leaving him for another eight
years that will be 16 years in prison
and wanton ova was not exactly a nice
place for the charge of trying to defend
this village when he was a
fifteen-year-old kid this is I know what
words you can use for this we were just
talking last night about Julian Assange
the high-tech terrorist and the occupy
london people as the low-level terrorist
and we were wondering if there was a
happy medium terrorists as well how can
more and justice be based on such a
vague term as terrorists what does it
mean professor Chomsky it means somebody
who does things that we don't like and
you can see it very clearly for example
take the terrorist list if a person is
placed on the US terrorist list he can
be murdered they can even if American
citizen neurologists made that clear
what's the terrorist list it's
completely arbitrary set of decisions
made by the US government without
supervision without redress and if you
take a look at its history is
mind-boggling so for example one person
who just got off the
terrorist this two years ago is Nelson
Mandela that he's now permitted to
travel to the United States without
special dispensation why was he on the
terrorist list because the African
National Congress was struggling against
apartheid and the US was strongly
supporting the apartheid regime and to
the very end in 1988 the Reagan
administration declared that Mandela's
ansi was one of the more notorious
terrorist groups in the world so
therefore the US had to support South
African apartheid in the war against
terror or take another case take Saddam
Hussein Iraq was on the US terrorist
list but the Reagan administration
decided that they wanted to support
Saddam in the war against Iran so in
1982 they removed Iraq from the
terrorist list then came down
Brownsville going to Baghdad famous
handshake support for Saddam
breakthroughs worst atrocities
longfellow campaign against occurs the
chemical weapons that not anything he
was supporting they the government tried
to deny that he was doing wouldn't allow
Congress to issue strong protests and so
on this win rate all the way through the
80s 1982 there was a gap on the
terrorist list because Iraq was removed
they had to put somebody on they put
Cuba which was in honor of Cuba's being
the leading target of terrorism target
in fact in the years just before that
there'd been a rash of terrorist attacks
against you but including the
downing of a civilian aircraft with 75
people are so killed bombings and
embassies and so on so case 0 cube will
go on the terrorist list rather
dramatically when the press until he
knows all these facts but try to find
them well they're not it wouldn't be
objective to talk about this because
it's not being discussed by Republicans
and Democrats so therefore if you talk
about this you're by a sentimental maybe
anti-american maybe a terrorist who no
terrorist sympathizer it goes on when
Saddam was tried and hanged it was for
crimes committed in 1982 not the same
year in which he was removed from the
terrorist list so the US could aid him
in his crimes an effect I assumed that
the legal staff that was planning this
had in mind to keep the charges to 1982
you take a look at the charges yeah they
were bad but kind of like a toothpick on
a mountain on compared with this crimes
was they had gone on to include the real
crimes they would have had to open up
the fact that the u.s. was for him and
so he was tried for kind of like tax
evasion but all of this is public record
during WikiLeaks work which it is honest
commentary yeah I sometimes think that
the social media is like the biggest
closet in the world we're all aware of
these things but as people would we feel
that we can't really do anything do you
think that people can do anything to
help Bradley to help Julian if he goes
the same way what kind of it don't
little depend very heavily on the public
pressure which makes a substantial
difference mm-hmm
plenty of evidence for that I so for
example to take a a case that came out
from another leak which is public but I
don't think he's ever made the media
it's now 40 years so maybe someday we'll
the Pentagon Papers the very interesting
part of the Pentagon Papers is the very
last part depending on papers record
ends in mid nineteen sixty eight the
cards are the last few months is very
revealing about exactly the question
that you're raising the Tet Offensive
took place in January 68 it convinced
the American military the support of
wise men the advisors that the war
wasn't worth fighting anymore
nevertheless the president and the
military didn't want to send another
couple hundred thousand troops there the
Joint Chiefs of Staff objected they said
that if we send more troops there who
have a shortage of forces in the United
States where we'll need them for civic
disorder control because there's going
to be an uprising among people who are
infuriated about the war young people
women
an art is this huge opposition to the
war so I'll need the troops here to keep
order so therefore we can't send them
that's a pretty graphic illustration of
what a completely nonviolent public
protest can affect it's a dramatic case
but for one thing because of the
situation for another because it's been
kept quiet now that's the kind of thing
that people should know and it again it
came from a leak at Dan Ellsberg
Congress Oh speak of the Pentagon Papers
but it hasn't made it to the public and
that's not because of censorship it's
because of unwillingness to let people
know what they want to know if they
wanted to come back criminal behavior by
state authorities yeah I'm hoping to
talk to Daniel when I go back to the ice
coast again it's being sams i'll
probably get the continuation of that
story i'll try and link that on cuz no
one to worry nice sure there's plenty of
stuff in the pentagon papers that never
really made it to the public
