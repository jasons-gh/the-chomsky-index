some people are describing the kinds of
energies that are going into the Sanders
campaign as part of a global phenomenon
right so that we have Jeremy Corbyn and
the UK another self-described socialist
was now the head of the Labour Party in
Britain and in Greece which has been
burdened so dramatically by austerity
policy we have Alexis tsipras of the
left-wing syriza party who's been
elected prime minister and I was curious
as to what you thought was the you know
if something is shared behind these
these candidacies if something more
Universal is driving the kind of
enthusiasm for the left in this moment
about just this moment you know there's
something very common
it's called neoliberalism this is a
general assault on the world's
population that takes different forms in
different places but is based on the
same kinds of conceptions and it's
people have suffered everywhere every
place that the neoliberal principles
have been applied it's been harmful to
the general populations in the United
States which is not harmed as much as
others you know rich powerful Society
there's been basically stagnation or
decline for about 30 years for majority
of the population and people are now
arguing about the minimum wage but if
you take a look at the minimum wage I
presume you know this through the huge
growth period 50s and 60s it tracked
productivity that started to break the
late 70s when the neoliberal assault
began if the minimum wage had continued
to do so it would now probably be about
$20 an hour so when people are talking
about $15 an hour they're saying let's
keep it low and that holds for
everything real male wages are now
roughly what they were in the late 60s
the figures just came out a couple days
ago about median household incomes
they're now lower than they were seven
or eight years ago and it's been pretty
flat us ever since you know the Reagan
factor the Oh liberal assault and the
say mr. Pitts taking a different form in
Europe a worse form in many ways Greece
Spain England have been targeted by very
reactionary economic policies even worse
than a year these the idea of austerity
during recession even the IMF thinks
it's ridiculous and from an economic
point of view yes you're it's an
absurdity but that doesn't mean it's
it's foolish it's a very good instrument
of class war it's undermining social
what it's undermining the major
achievements of Europe since the Second
World War both political and social and
economic what we call your welfare state
programs are being significantly
undermined England as well and from the
point of view of the people designing
the policy sure they never like these
things let's get rid of them and the
same is happening almost every word I
mean in England it's it's almost
startling to see for example England the
National Health Service has its flaws
like everything it's probably one of the
best health systems in the world they
are now trying to make it like the
American system which may be the worst
system in the world literally had about
twice the per capita costs of other
countries and some of the worst outcomes
extensive bureaucracy and efficiency
enormous costs poor outcomes so let's
become like them and destroy a
successful system the same is happening
in Canada these are
just different manifestations of the
neoliberal programs and the resistance
is not just starting now
the major resistance started in Latin
America about 10 or 15 years ago Latin
America was a very loyal student of the
neoliberal doctrines and for suffered
significantly but about 10 or 15 years
ago they started to pull out of it both
economically and politically in fact one
of Obama's supposed foreign policy
achievements is the beginning of
normalization of relations with Cuba the
way it's described here Obama made this
forthcoming noble gesture to bring Cuba
out of its isolation exactly the
opposite the United States was utterly
isolated in the hemisphere the last
major hemispheric conference happened to
be in Colombia last US ally of the US is
practically thrown out of the hemisphere
on this issue and on the drug war two
major issues they couldn't reach a
consensus because the US and Canada
wouldn't agree the next hemispheric
conference was going to be in Panama
this year and if the United States had
not made some move on Cuba it probably
would have been thrown out of the
atmosphere for anyone who knows the
history of the United States and the
Western Hemisphere that's utterly
shocking
this was the backyard when didn't worry
about it they do what you tell them they
don't you overthrow the government you
know it's totally reversed and this is a
this began as a reaction to the
neoliberal policies which they have
slowly begun to pull themselves out of
it's now spread to so than Europe or
other
other manifestations here so you're
right there's something global takes
different forms in different places but
it's as commonalities as well
