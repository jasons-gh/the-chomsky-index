Chomsky at MIT and Noam Chomsky a
leading principle of international
relations theory is that the highest
priority of states is to ensure security
so a standard formulation by George
Kennan one of the planners of the
post-war world as he put it his
government is created to assure order
and justice internally and provide for
the common defense what's called
national security and the proposition
seems plausible almost self-evident
until you begin to look more closely and
ask the question security for whom for
the general population for state power
itself for dominant domestic
constituencies depending on what we mean
the credibility of the proposition
ranges from very high to negligible so
security for state power for example is
ranked very high now that's illustrated
by the great efforts that statement
states exert to protect themselves from
their own populations even from the
scrutiny of their populations Edward
Snowden explained his actions by saying
but he said the public had a right to
know about these programs the public had
a right to know that which the
government is doing in its name and that
which the government is doing against
the public and the same could be justly
said by Dan Ellsberg Chelsea Manning and
other courageous figures who've acted on
the same democratic principle the
government of stance of course is quite
different it's that the public does not
have a right to know because security is
undermined severely undermined so it's
asserted there are several good reasons
to be skeptical about a response like
that the first is that it's almost
completely predictable that's what a
government says whenever a government
act is exposed it's reflexive and being
predictable that carries little or no
information a second reason for
skepticism is the nature of the evidence
presented was actually reviewed by
well-known international relations
scholar John Mearsheimer and he writes
that the Obama administration not
surprisingly initially claimed that the
NSA spying played a key role in
thwarting 54 terrorist plots against the
United States implying that it violated
the Fourth Amendment for a good reason
this was a lie however the general Keith
Alexander the NSA director eventually
admitted to Congress that he could claim
only one success that involved catching
a Somali immigrant and living in San
Diego who had sent $8,500 to a terrorist
group in Somalia that's what this huge
operation has succeeded in achieving so
far well there is a sense in which
security is threatened by public
awareness a namely security of state
power for
exposure and that's important the basic
insight was expressed very well by
distinguished political scientists who
held the chair of science of Government
at Harvard University Samuel Huntington
he pointed out that the architects of
power in the United States must create a
force that can be felt but not seen
power remains strong when it remains in
the dark exposed to the sunlight that
begins to evaporate that incidentally is
in favor of secrecy if you go on with
the rest of the discussion in the u.s.
is elsewhere the architects of power
understand this all too well of course
people who have worked through the huge
mass of documents Declassified by the
government can hardly fail to notice how
frequently it is security of state power
from the domestic public that's a prime
concern and not national security in any
meaningful sense often security is
motivated by the need to guarantee the
security of powerful domestic sectors in
the United States that means the
corporate sector one persistent example
of this is the mislabeled free trade
agreements they're mislabeled they're
not free trade agreements they radically
violate free trade principles they're
substantially not about trade at all but
rather about investor rights and they're
certainly not agreements at least if
people are part of their country's
people when they know about them are
usually opposed these instruments are
regularly negotiated in secret elect the
current transatlantic trans-pacific
partnership huge treaties being
negotiated not entirely in secret of
course they're not secret from the
hundreds of court
lobbyists and lawyers who are running
right writing the details of the
agreements with an impact that's not too
hard to guess and in fact is revealed by
the few parts that have been exposed
through WikiLeaks Joseph Stiglitz Nobel
laureate in economics reasonably
concludes that as he puts it with the US
Trade Representative's office
representing corporate interests not
those of the public the likelihood that
what emerges from the coming talks will
serve ordinary Americans interest is low
the outlook for ordinary citizens and
other countries is even bleaker and the
record will supports that including
NAFTA now social security of the secrecy
makes sense they're just as in the case
of the NSA secrecy there is real it real
interests that are being secured but
against the population not of the
population and security of the domestic
constituencies means the corporate
sector that's a regular concern of
government policy and that's hardly
surprising given their a role in
formulating the policy in the first
place
examples are too numerous to mention so
I'll skip them now let's turn to the and
to the third interpretation of security
security for domestic population in
sharp contrast there's substantial
evidence that that kind of security
what's called national security it's
just not a high priority for state
policy now there are plenty of
illustrations the one current one is the
global terror campaign that Obama is
carrying out completely unprecedented
campaign of global terror carrying out
with great enthusiasm and in fact the
war on terror terror generally a since
it was declared by Ronald Reagan in 1981
reading
by Bush 20 years later and more
strikingly it's also true of strategic
planning nuclear policy in particular to
an extent that's not properly recognized
so let's have a look at a few cases
start with the case of so-called war on
terror so take for example the
assassination of Osama bin Laden
President Obama as I'm sure you recall I
brought it up with pride and an
important speech on national security
last May very widely covered but there
was one crucial paragraph that was
ignored Obama hailed the operation took
credit for it but he said it cannot be
the norm and the reason he said is that
the risks were immense the Navy SEALs
I'm quoting might have been embroiled in
an extended firefight but by luck he
said that didn't happen nevertheless the
cost to our relationship with Pakistan
and the backlash among the Pakistani
public over encroachment on their
territory in aggression and others do it
it was severe well let's add a few
details that he didn't mention though
the seals were under orders to fight
their way out if they were apprehended
they would not have been left to their
fate if they had been as Obama put it
embroiled in an extended firefight the
full force of the US military would have
been used to extricate them Pakistan has
a powerful military well-trained highly
protective of state sovereignty and of
course it has nuclear weapons and
Pakistani specialists are quite
concerned about penetration of the
security system by jihadi elements their
presence is itself a consequence of the
massive terror campaign
it's also no secret that the population
of Pakistan has been embittered and
radicalized by the drone terror campaign
and other US policies including
pressuring the Pakistani military to
attack tribal regions that had been left
to their own by the British imperialists
and their Pakistani successors well
while the seals were still in the bin
Laden compound the Pakistani chief of
staff kyani it was informed of the
invasion and he ordered his staff his
words to confront any unidentified
aircraft and he assumed they were
probably from India amid well and
cobbled right down the road the General
Petraeus ordered u.s. warplanes to
respond if Pakistani scrambled their
fighter jets well as Obama said the
worst didn't happen by luck and it could
have been quite ugly could have been
nuclear war but the risks were faced
without noticeable concern or subsequent
comment which is also interesting well
there's a lot more to say about that
operation and it's actually quite
immense cost to Pakistan but instead
let's look more closely at the concern
for security more generally the
beginning with security from terror and
then turning to the much more important
question of security from incident
destruction by nuclear weapons so
Obama's global assassination campaign as
I said by far the world's worst
terrorist campaign never been anything
like it it's also a terror generating
campaign and that's well understood at
the highest levels so for example
general McChrystal former former head of
the US forces in Afghanistan after erect
he pointed out that for every innocent
person you kill you create 10 new
enemies actually the concept of innocent
person which is now standard in u.s.
discourse that tells you how far we've
progressed in the past eight hundred
years next year is the 800th anniversary
of the Magna Carta which established the
principle of presumption of innocence
persons innocent until proven guilty in
a proper trial with a jury of peers now
that was the foundation of
anglo-american law but that's ancient
history by now the word guilty has a
different meaning it means targeted for
assassination by President Obama and the
word innocent means not yet accorded
that status though he he might be a next
Tuesday in the president's assassination
meetings a couple of days after the
Boston Marathon bombing Obama ordered an
assassination in a remote Yemeni village
actually we rarely learn about such
crimes but it happened that there was a
young man from the village in the United
States and he testified about the
operation before a Senate committee he
reported that for years jihadis had been
trying to turn the villagers against the
United States but they had failed the
villagers knew nothing about the United
States except what he was writing about
it and he liked the United States now
but he said one drone murder in the
village actually a murder of a person
who could easily have been apprehended
the one drone murder vindicated jihadi
propaganda turned the whole village in
two people who hate America and want to
retaliate against it
once again swelling the ranks of the
terrorist networks that have
proliferated under the war on terror
they're now all over large parts of the
world and deeply motivated for revenge
not surprisingly to connect how we would
react under similar circumstances well
meanwhile we're developing the
technology to facilitate terror
targeting ourselves
there's an article in britain's leading
journal of international affairs david
hastings done a recent article he
outlines how the increasingly
sophisticated drones that we're
developing are a perfect weapon for
terrorist groups as he puts it they're
cheap easily acquired
and in general possesses many qualities
which when combined and make them
potentially the ideal means for
terrorist attack in the 21st century
he says you can already buy a small
drone on the internet for a couple
hundred dollars and they're getting much
more sophisticated perfect terrorist
weapons we're developing them and every
possibility that will be the victims but
that's not a concern because that has to
do with defense security the population
which is not a particular interest of
states senator Adlai Stevenson the third
he was referring to as many years of
service and the Senate Intelligence
Committee
he wrote that cyber surveillance and
metadata collection are part of the
continuing reaction to 9/11 with few if
any terrorists to show for it and near
universal condemnation the United States
is widely perceived as waging war
against Islam against Shias as well as
Sunnis on the ground with drones by
proxy and Palestine from the Persian
Gulf to Central Asia the Germany and
Brazil resent our intrusions and what
have they wrought well the answer is
that they've brought a growing threat of
terror as well as internet international
isolation the Stephenson is quite
correct about near universal
condemnation in the former CIA chief and
Michael Hayden that recently conceded as
you put it that right now there isn't a
government on the planet that agrees
with our legal rationale for these
operations except for Afghanistan
and maybe Israel and he's probably wrong
about Afghanistan Hayden's conclusions
are reflected in a international poll
that was just released by major polling
agencies in England and the United
States Gallup in the United States it
was released in December and one of the
questions was which country do you think
is the greatest threat to peace in the
world today and guess who was first the
United States was far in the lead nobody
else was even close second place
Pakistan had one-third the votes of the
United States and that was inflated by
the Indian vote other countries were way
down a world opinion of Iran was very
low world opinion sharply rejects the
domestic obsession that Iran poses the
greatest threat to world peace and in
fact it is an obsession shared almost
nowhere else that poll was not reported
in the mainstream media in the United
States we're not supposed to know things
like that it's not important now what
Americans are supposed to believe quote
President Obama is that for generations
the United States of America has played
a unique role as an anchor of global
security and as an advocate of human
freedom and that's what we're supposed
to believe not what the world thinks we
don't know about that actually Obama
produced this declaration while his
bombs were raining on Libya in violation
of a UN Security Council resolution 1973
that the United States Britain and
France had forced through it called for
a cease and immediate ceasefire
negotiations and actions to protect
civilians including the civilians in the
areas that were reduced to the level of
Grozny after Russian attack by NATO
bombs according to on the scene reports
from the Western press not the u.s.
press Britain other countries
and if most of the world sharply
disagrees with the preferred self image
we can cheerfully ignore them or condemn
them for their backwardness not
understanding our magnificence there are
historical precedents for that and
they're not particularly attractive
there's also virtually no
acknowledgement of the extensive polling
by Western agencies US and other Western
agencies in the Arab world with very
interesting results and what it shows is
that Iran is disliked but it's just not
regarded as a threat overwhelmingly they
rank the United States and Israel as the
major threats they face now in this case
Americans are supposed to believe that
the Arab support the u.s. stand on Iran
and that's what's reported constantly
but what's not mentioned is that they're
reporting the attitudes of the dictators
not the population standard practice is
to restrict attention to friendly
dictators ignoring populations that
reflects the dominant concern for
democracy and for people generally will
go on to nuclear weapons much more
important matter even incident
destruction by nuclear weapons has never
ranked high among the concerns of state
authorities so Apple record on that own
sample a little bit of it starting in
the early days of the Atomic Age
remember in the early days around 1950
the US was overwhelmingly powerful it
enjoyed remarkable security controlled
the hemisphere controlled both oceans
controlled the opposite sides of both
oceans there was one potential threat
not yet developed on the horizon that
was ICBMs with nuclear warhead
there's a comprehensive review of
nuclear policy by McGeorge Bundy a
national security advisor for Kennedy
and Johnson he had access to the highest
level sources and he has some
interesting comments he writes all quote
in the timely development of ballistic
missiles during the Eisenhower
administration is one of the best
achievements of those eight years yet it
is well to begin with a recognition that
both the United States and the Soviet
Union might be in much less nuclear
danger today if those missiles had never
been developed and then he adds an
instructive comment he says I am aware
of no serious contemporary proposal in
or out of government that missiles
should somehow be banned by agreement in
short there was apparently no thought no
discussion but not even thought of
trying to prevent the sole serious
threat to the United States the threat
of utter destruction
it just had zero significance not even a
staff paper discussing it well could it
have been prevented can't be sure of
course
the Russians were way behind in
technology knew it it's conceivable that
they might have considered such an
agreement and in fact there are
indications that that was true but in
the quite extraordinary hysteria of
those days you couldn't eat they
couldn't even be perceived so that one
suggestive indication of possible
opportunities is a remarkable proposal
that Joseph Stalin made in 1952 he
offered to allow Germany to be unified
with internationally supervised free
elections on one condition that it not
join a hostile military alliance and
that's hardly an extreme condition and
the light of the history of the past
half-century which I don't have to
review
to you well Stalin's proposal was taken
seriously by one respected political
commentator James Warburg but apart from
him it seems to have been entirely
ignored or ridiculed recent scholarship
has begun to take a different view one
well-known Soviet scholar autumn alum
bitterly anti-communist he writes
recently that the status of Stalin's
proposal is an unresolved mystery
Washington wasted little effort in
flatly rejecting Moscow's initiative on
grounds that were embarrassingly
unconvincing leaving open the basic
question was Stalin ready to sacrifice
the newly created German Democratic
Republic
East Germany on the altar of real
democracy with consequences for American
peace and American security that could
have been enormous that's a mystery
it was ridiculed dismissed not discussed
one of the most prominent cold war
scholars mehleb melvin Leffler reviewing
the recent research and the soviet
archives that have been coming out he
points out that many scholars were
surprised and discover that Lavrentiy
Beria the sinister brutal head of the
secret police proposed that the kremlin
offered the west a deal on the
unification and neutralization of
germany agreeing to sacrifice the east
german communist regime to reduce
east-west tensions and improve internal
political and economic conditions in
Russia opportunities that were
squandered in fact not even discussed in
favor of securing German participation
in NATO under the circumstances going
back to the early 50s it's not at all
impossible that agreements could have
been reached that would have protected
the security of the population of the
United States from the gravest threat on
the horizon the threat of total incident
destruction
but the possibility apparently was not
even considered
it's another indication of how slight a
role authentic security plays in state
policy I should add that none of this is
discussed in scholarship either the two
quotes that I mentioned are rare
it's just disregarded if state
authorities didn't care at all about
instant destruction of the population
and what interest is there in that let's
go on to the next topic meanwhile
repeating the mantra of international
relations theory that security and
national security is the highest goal of
state policy well this was revealed
again in the years that followed after
Stalin's death 1953
Nikita Khrushchev took over and he very
quickly recognized that Russia could not
compete militarily with the United
States the richest most powerful country
in world history and comparable
advantages and he understood that if
Russia wanted to escape its economic
backwardness and of course the
devastating effect of the war it would
have been necessary to reverse the arms
race and he took steps in that direction
he proposed sharp mutual reductions in
offensive weapons the incoming Kennedy
administration considered the offer and
rejected it instead turning to rapid
military expansion after that continued
even when Khrushchev unilaterally
reduced offensive weapons at one of the
leading international relations scholars
Kenneth waltz died recently supported by
other strategic analysts with close
connections with US intelligence he
wrote that the Kennedy administration
undertook the largest critique and
conventional peacetime military buildup
the world has yet seen even as Chris
check was trying at once to carry
through a major reduction in the
conventional forces and to follow a
strategy of minimum
deterrence and we did so even though the
balance of strategic weapons greatly
favored the United States again it's
severely harmed national security but
enhanced state power well there was a
Soviet reaction it was placing missiles
in Cuba in October 1962 to try to
redress the great imbalance and it was
also motivated by something else we
don't talk about it much here but
Kennedy was carrying out a major
terrorist war against Cuba wasn't a joke
it was a serious terrorist war under the
run by his brother Robert Kennedy for
whom it was the highest priority and
that terrorist war was scheduled to lead
to an invasion in October 1962 that's
when the missiles went in well that
brought the world through what Arthur
Schlesinger Kennedy's associate called
the most dangerous moment in history
that month late October the crisis
peaked on October 26th the Kennedy
received a secret letter from Khrushchev
offering to end the crisis by
simultaneous public withdrawal of
Russian missiles from Cuba and u.s.
Jupiter missiles from Turkey right on
Russia's border the Turkish missile the
Kennedy was surprised he didn't know we
had missiles there they were obsolete
missiles and I withdrawal order had
already been or had been been sent for
them and the reason was they were being
replaced by much more lethal Polaris
submarines than invulnerable well that's
what was going on at the most dangerous
moment in history at that point
Kennedy's own subjective estimate of the
probability of nuclear war was 1/3 to
1/2 that was a war that would have
destroyed the northern hemisphere was
President Eisenhower put it Kennedy
refused I think that must be one of the
most for
this decisions in history and worse yet
he's greatly praised for his cool
courage and statesmanship I think that's
worth reflection well ten years after
that a Henry Kissinger called a nuclear
alert was the last days of the 1973 is
Israel Arab War there was a purpose the
purpose was to warn the Russians not to
interfere with his delicate diplomatic
maneuvers they were designed to ensure
an Israeli victory but a limited victory
so that the United States would remain
in control of the region unilaterally
and the maneuvers were delicate the US
and Russia had jointly imposed a
ceasefire but Kissinger secretly
informed Israel that they could ignore
him
hence a need for a nuclear alert to
frighten the Russians away so that these
delicate maneuvers couldn't continue
luckily once again the Russians backed
down
but security the population had its
usual status namely zero it wasn't even
a concern ten years after that the
Reagan administration launched
operations to probe Russian air defenses
they simulated air and naval attacks
actually air attacks right into Russian
territory naval attacks and the gave a
warning of a very high level of actually
difficult and one nuclear alert the all
of this happened at a very tense moment
Pershing 2 missiles were being deployed
in Europe they had several minutes
flight time to Moscow Reagan had just
announced the SDI program called Star
Wars program which the Russians
understood to be a first strike weapon
now that's how missile defense is
understood on both sides standard
interpretation and other tensions were
rising well naturally all of this
aroused great alarm in Russia unlike the
United States
is quite vulnerable the u.s. is
invulnerable but not the Russians
they've been repeatedly invaded and
virtually destroyed actually that led to
a major war scare in 1983 was recognized
to have been serious but there are newly
released archives which revealed that
the danger was even more severe than
historians had assumed there's a recent
CIA study which is entitled the war
scare was for real it concludes that US
intelligence underestimated Russian
concerns and the threat of a Russian
preventive nuclear strike as a recent
article in journal of Strategic Studies
which concludes the Reagan exercises
almost became a prelude to a preventive
nuclear strike actually it was even more
dangerous than this we learned that last
September from a report in the BBC
reported that right in the midst of
these world threatening developments
Russia's early warning systems detected
an incoming missile strike from the
United States and they sent the highest
level alert there's a protocol for the
Soviet military to retaliate with a
nuclear attack of its own now there's an
officer a person who has to transmit the
reports to the higher-level
officer on Duty's Donna Slava Petrov he
just decided not to transmit the
warnings
this is disobey orders highest imaginal
disobedience of orders he didn't
transmit the warnings he was he received
an official reprimand and thanks to his
dereliction of duty we're here to talk
about it security of the it's not the
only case security of the population was
no more a high priority for Reagan
planners than for their predecessors or
up tilted and it continues up till the
present
one example before but there plenty of
others and it continues even I'm putting
aside examples like the Petrov case near
catastrophic accidents they happen all
the time that we don't have a full
Russian record than a fairly extensive
American record and it's it's appalling
I don't see a chilling new book on it
but Eric Schlosser if you want to know
some of the details it's very hard to
contest the conclusion of the previous
commander of this General Lee Butler who
said that the fact that we have so far
survived the the nuclear age as a matter
of some combination of skill luck and
divine intervention and I suspect the
latter in greatest proportion the
general Butler went on to describe the
US strategic plan of 1960 the calling
for automated all-out strikes as in his
words the single most observed an
irresponsible document I have ever
reviewed in my life he says with the
possible exception of it's probable
Soviet counterpart which we don't know
about but there are competitors like the
regular easy acceptance of threats to
survival
there are almost too extraordinary to
capture in words like the kinds of
indicated but the words are there and
they're worth reading and start with the
near hysterical rhetoric ravings
actually of NSC sixty-eight many of you
know that's the major early coastward
document and its content have been
described but not it's rhetoric and it's
worth worth reading it reads like an
insane insane ravings of absolute
lunatics you should read it to see if
you think it's an exaggeration you
should read it and write to the
president the words are also there and
high-level documents that outline
the US strategic doctrine there's one
example which in the Clinton years came
out an important time it's a document of
Stratcom the Strategic Command which is
in charge of nuclear weapons it's called
essentials of post Cold War deterrence
there's a high-level document right
after the end of the Cold War and
several years after the Soviet Union
collapsed actually it was also after the
United States had begun to expand NATO
to the east in direct violation of
promises to Gorbachev and when he agreed
to the unification of Germany within
NATO and actually that's a matter that's
on the front pages today in connection
with Ukraine the extremely serious
danger of course for expanding NATO to
the borders of Russia is no small matter
for them apart from the promise to
Gorbachev not to do it well let's go
back to the Stratcom document it's
concerned all mostly quoted it's
concerned with the role of nuclear
weapons in the post Cold War era and one
central conclusion is that the US must
maintain the right of first strike even
against non-nuclear States furthermore
nuclear weapons must always be available
because they should cast a shadow over
any crisis or conflict so they're
constantly used that just as you using a
gun if they go in to rob a store and you
aim it but you don't fire it it's a
point that Dan Ellsberg has repeatedly
stressed it's a mistake to say that the
weapons aren't used they're always used
the Stratcom goes on to advise that
planners should not be too rational
about determining what the opponent
values most all of which must be
targeted
it hurts to portray ourselves as two
fully rational and cool-headed that the
United States might become irrational
and vindictive
should be a part of the natural the
national persona that we project it's
beneficial for our strategic posture if
some elements may appear to be
potentially out of control and thus
posing a constant threat of nuclear
attack that's the document about
post-war post Cold War deterrence
nothing here about Jennens order justice
of the common defense or for that matter
about the obligation under the National
proliferation treaty to make good-faith
efforts to eliminate this scourge of the
earth and plans for the future are not
very promising the Congressional Budget
Office reported in December that the US
nuclear arsenal will cost 350 billion
dollars over the next decade and then
costs of modernization will quadruple
from 2024 to 2030 there's a study of the
Monterey Institute of International
Studies estimated that the US would
spend a trillion dollars on the nuclear
arsenal in the next 30 years a
percentage of the military budget
comparable to spending for procurement
of new strategic systems in the 1980s
under President Ronald Reagan and of
course the United States is not alone as
general Butler observed it's a near
miracle that we've escaped destruction
so far and the longer we continue to
tempt fate
the less likely it is that we can hope
for divine intervention
to save us from our folly well in the
case of nuclear weapons at least we know
in principle how to overcome the
threatening catastrophe it can be done
but there's another dire peril that
casts its shadow over any contemplation
of the future that's of course
environmental disaster and here it's not
so clear now that there even is an
escape although it is clear that the
longer we delay the more severe the
threat
and not at a distant future so the
commitment of governments to the
security of their population is very
clearly exhibited by how they address
this issue the issue of destruction of
the possibility for decent existence for
your grandchildren well there's a lot of
exuberance in the United States right
now about what's called a hundred years
of energy independence as we become the
Saudi Arabia of the next century
very likely the final century of human
civilization if current policies persist
and he might take a speech of President
Obama's to be a pretty eloquent death
knell for the species he proclaimed with
pride - ample applause read his words
and now under my administration America
is producing more oil today than at any
time in the preceding eight years and
that's important to know over the last
three years I've directed my
administration to open up millions of
acres for gas and oil exploration across
23 different states that we're opening
up more than 75% of our potential oil
resources offshore we've quadrupled the
number of operating rigs to a record
high we've added enough new oil and gas
pipeline to encircle the earth and then
some that's our president and the
applause also tells us something about
government commitment to security he was
giving this talk in Cushing Oklahoma
it's an oil town actually the oil town
it's described as the most significant
trading hub for crude oil in North
America and industry profits are sure to
be secured as producing more oil and gas
here at home will continue to be a
critical part of energy
any strategy as the president promised
and as we happily march toward the
precipice like the proverbial lemmings
well let me summarize finally there is a
sense in which security is a high
priority for government government
planners security for the state and that
means security against its population
security for the primary constituency
concentrated corporate power all of that
entails that policy must be protected
from public scrutiny in accept those
terms everything falls into place as
quite rational even the rationality of
collective suicide which is exactly the
logic that we're pursuing of course
that's if the general public permits all
of this to continue
that's always the fundamental question
