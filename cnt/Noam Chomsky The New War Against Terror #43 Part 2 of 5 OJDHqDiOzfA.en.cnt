before I get tried by the perfect order
but the CIA if I gave that impression I
wasn't being clear I don't think these
are vacuous concepts and I don't think
there it is subjected I think they're
very clear reasonably clear concepts now
not clear like quantum physics but
reasonably clear okay international law
is reasonably clear and for example when
the World Court reached its decision
condemning the United States for
international terrorism it had good
grounds and a solid argument runs
through hundreds of pages if you read it
the u.s. knew that it was a solid
argument that's why the u.s. refused to
accept the jurisdiction of the court I
and yes I was pretty clear it wasn't
black he was same with terrorists I
didn't make it clear let me say it now I
think the definition given in the US
code and u.s. army manuals is the right
definition I've always accepted the
definition that I quoted I think is
exactly the right definition okay
commands are every imaginable question
you know you can have a philosophy
seminar or you can make up cases which
doesn't feel good but in the real world
it covers almost everything
there's nothing subjective about it what
is the point is that it cannot be
accepted because of its consequences its
consequences tell us that we're doing
terrible things and therefore we don't
accept it I mean the Nazis weren't
carrying out counter-terror they were
carrying out terror I mean they called
it counter terror and the US military
agrees with them but for the memories we
don't have to accept that it's not a
vacuous objective concept that's true
you know if your your lawyers you know
better than I do I mean the legal system
does not apply trivia
to every situation that comes up so I
judges us a thing but nevertheless the
framework sometimes you need the wrong
frame or see change the laws but it's a
framework and then the same is true of
international law and the same is true
of terrorism the same sir of peace
World War I you know traditionally I'm
not a traditional howdy on languages
courses faculty and since we can't hold
up in understanding inheritance or
should i if I can restate your question
let's put it this I see if I get it
wrong supposedly the president of the
leading error state in the world and the
World Court condemns you for terrorism
then orders you to stop and the Security
Council tries to pass a resolution
calling on you to observe international
law and you veto it then what do you do
as president the United States
well you don't try to change the world
Court you don't try to change the UN and
stop your terrorism
[Applause]
but a crowd favorite sorry maybe all of
you around in the south well you figure
out what you think is there unknowing
look I think it's the wrong thing to do
to consume the plans that they are now
announcing that their plans their their
assumptions are that what they're doing
may very well kill a couple of innocent
people in Afghanistan okay I haven't
think that's wrong somebody else wins
right okay
I think it's wrong terribly wrong in
fact we monsters and as we edition like
that it's just really what you know
we'll have one more question on this
side and one more on that side and then
we'll be finished I think that Berkeley
what you have to be very very pensive
intense bombing most renowned statutes
were no they don't say hi the servants
are perfectly sir we're here
anyway to that and it clearly is not all
covered while any refreshing steady
matters I think they have a question
okay so much good because we need to
rock
why do you got time that we don't have
time tonight happened it was out deeper
than my question shown when the it was
prepared groups
this was more while in various
conversations people broadly and I flew
people didn't hyacinth last week but in
no way unimpassioned rallies recommend
if you top this great room intimidation
factor way through this assurances is
costly to wrap people's questions mini
quartz movements I think it's only fair
you know okay we're in agreement so what
are we talking about
fine that's a great idea let's form
organizations let's do all the things we
all know how to do when we want to
change policy I mean anyone agrees of
the policies wrong it's a country
intimidation factor you know we should
not even mention that I mean considering
what people face around the world the
kind of intimidation that we face is so
minuscule that it's embarrassing even to
talk about
[Applause]
without an address and my fly-around
legacy for this office you know think
tanks not part of our government not
parties you know miss relations black
president returned from correlations
that are discussed and I personally very
responsible not we're not very much at
rest
well I mean look I mean there are lots
of powerful institutions and there we
know you know I can't talk now about the
way the system is organized but we all
know there's a lot of concentrated fell
okay and that means that the choice of
action is determined often in secret in
terms of interests of those powers and
so on yet we know that we should how we
deal with it well two levels one level
is long-term level try to erode the
concentrated power and make the country
more free and democratic okay that's one
long term of Jackie what are you doing
to take your case you know you're not
going to save a couple of million
Afghans by trying to dismantle the
Council on Foreign Relations or
corporations or inhale we have it with
all the concentration of power and
centralization of authority
it still is true that there's a
tremendous range of action open to us
which can influence policy within these
structures that would be true even if it
was a totalitarian state it's certainly
true in a more free and democratic
society to find let's use the
opportunities that are available and
long term of
let's try to run opening the situation
like Christian not maximum tank
illumination floor for this I organize
people to oppose or change poverty okay
yeah unless there that's I can't blame
her on the council Foreign Relations
you're too young so I can't blame you
but I can blame people at me over a live
and we didn't have to let them but get
assassinated and it happens in this case
but it's mostly Belgium it's responsible
but and they fortunately after many
years are finally conducting an inquiry
into their own atrocity involvement in
the Lumumba's assassination but the US
was in a background there and could have
been stopped and the same with other
things I you know you want to blame the
Council of Foreign Relations Prime with
the first place to look is always in the
mirror first place okay after you've
decided I've done everything I possibly
can you can start blaming somebody else
yeah there's there's a serious mountain
distribution of power eternal the
country and we ought to try to do
something about that that's a long term
[Applause]
if you're not familiar with the American
cultures forum this is an opportunity
for all of us to explore different
aspects of American culture American
society it is a open forum which is
typically generated by students student
demand students in the past people have
asked for a whole host of different
presentations coming from different
cultural situations having to do with
the Native American populations
different ethnic types of presentations
also different religious presentations
having to do with Islam with what just a
host of different religions we also
spent a lot of times on political
presentations and one of the things that
is quite clear to us right now obviously
in the current set of conditions is that
by virtue of the attack we had on the
World Trade Towers and Pentagon building
justice last week that there is a great
degree of global political ignorance
about the causes background and reasons
for these things I was fortunate enough
to have students approach me with a
request to bring a noted expert in the
field dr. Michael 20 to come and speak
with us tonight on globalization on the
concept of American economic Empire
overseas and and hopefully we can
request some information on the concept
of economic economic imperialism
economic terrorism one of the things has
been happening on this campus if you
haven't noticed and I've been involved
in today I was in a panel earlier today
and we did a televised broadcast today
also we've been dealing with the issues
of why and how things like what happened
last week could have happened but also
we've always been dealing with those our
responses to it and one of the things
people have asked me over and over again
is what can we do about the type of
events which occurred can we find ways
to feel secure and there is a whole host
of reactionary responders who seem to
think the only way to solve violence's
with some other form of violence we've
been speaking out as a faculty as an
administration and as
generally as a student body against
violence for violence sake against
reprisals which may be domestic or
foreign because as we have seen these
type of responses these type of short
term a knee-jerk and typically
reactionary solution only bring with
them more violence one of the things
I've been trying to advocate for is a
root or radical solution radical the
word original word meaning root meaning
what we have to do is look at the causes
of the impression which Americans leave
overseas we have to look at the reasons
that generate sets of conditions which
have caused situations like what
happened last week to occur we have to
look at our own foreign policy on
economic policy and levels of
culpability levels of responsibility
which we hold for that and if we're
going to change the conditions which
create fear and climates of terror what
we're going to need to do is work as a
concept of a global community with
global responsibilities as opposed to
global exploitation along those lines
some of the information which may be
able to receive from reading dr.
parentis Brooks would be very very
useful for this I myself am in the
process of reading dirty truths right
now some of you may have read against
Empire and there will be a few other a
couple of new books coming out one is
history of mystery and the other is to
kill a nation the attack on Yugoslavia
which may be something you might want to
pick up let me mention those titles
again for you by dr. Prince so you can
be looking for them in City Lights
bookstore and other places history as
mystery would be one titled and the
other be to kill a nation we attack on
Yugoslavia the information you can find
in those books will help you to
understand the levels of global
responsibility which the United States
government has the levels of economic
influence which United United States
people carry and the fact that we in
certain ways vote on the prosperity of
other nations by where we buy our
clothing and how we spend our money it's
important to realize that our prosperity
typically has bought at the expense of
other groups of people around the world
and as as
as it's very important to realize our
responsibility doesn't simply end when
we put down some US dollars for some
goods but the impact of how we spend our
money the impact of how we allow our
corporations to operate overseas is
something that is directly proportionate
to the quality of life of other
individuals around the world with those
things in mind with a whole host of
questions which you might have remember
write them down will be a chance to ask
them later on with a whole host of
questions I would like to ask dr. Penney
let me waste no further time and
actually introducing dr. Michael
printing
it's very nice to eat here I'm going to
try can you hear me now that better
continue circling opportunity okay
alright anyway you gave most of the
lecture already I'll come back so much
more sick but I do want to do you want
to say that I know for many of you
September 11 is a date that will live in
your memory and it certainly has been
living in my memory for almost 30 years
it was on September 11 1973 that
us-backed military in Chile overthrew
the Chilean democracy which is a
democratic coalition government headed
by Salvador and a doctor civilian days
and about 30,000 people were killed in
that in that coup over over a period of
about several years another 100,000 were
driven into exile or or arrested
tortured and thousands more disappeared
never accounted for never showed up
Henry Kissinger who was Secretary of
State and Richard Nixon Nixon who was
president were the people who really
were very much behind that coup that was
an act of momentous terror it was a
terrorism death squads were used people
were dragged out of their houses people
put up against the wall in the stadiums
and summarily executed that's terrorism
at work and so it has been in the last
half-century that US leaders I don't say
the United States and I don't say we we
go and we do this and we go do that we
wait a minute we know we pay the taxes
we get screwed over we get drafted to go
or we have to go in the army they if
they who do this u.s. leaders have been
at intervene directly with force and
violence the terror bombing of Algeria
neighborhoods in Panama City how many
people have heard about it not that much
because the media didn't really give it
the kind of play that you would get
3,000 people killed there in Panama City
when George Bush the first George the
first invaded Panama the the two million
people who have died in Angola was a CIA
supported UNITA war of attrition against
Angola the almost a million who died in
Mozambique again with the terror squads
core enamel as an act that was the
headline that they had the abbreviated
title is it's not an acronym really and
again supported by US forces the million
people who were killed in the military
coup in Indonesia which overthrew
chicano a military that was trained
equipped advised and whose salaries were
even paid by CIA and US State Department
and such so they have been these acts of
mass murder now the American people are
very built that very little of that gets
even reported the Indonesian massacre if
I didn't wasn't even reported until
several months later and got a box like
this in in Time magazine and and one
story in the New York Times of an
editorial applauding the military saying
that's very good but it's a stabilizing
thing and in Nicaragua the Contras back
the US backed troops who went in there
and and hit what they called soft
targets which were farming cooperative
schools community houses brainer ease of
energy stations housing projects just
hitting and killing people and
terrorizing spreading terror and
disillusioned disabling and
destabilizing these countries but EOS
month now this is by the or attorney is
all a matter of public record Rios Montt
in Guatemala who went with the
Guatemalan army that imagine insane
murder machine called the Guatemalan
army
president clinton's last year remember
two years ago even went and apologized
to guatemala and said we're sorry for
our roles when rios montt went in there
and wiped out 600 mayan billa jizz 600
of them two hundred thousand people men
women and children chill every single
one of them in sight and and clinton
actually apologized that I feel your
pain I'm sorry he didn't explain why was
the u.s. supporting this club and this
Terrorizer and his murderers why are we
hated throughout the Middle East after
we bombed Somalia and killed ten
thousand people with a military
intervention
compliments of George the 1st and
Clinton who who continued it why are we
hated throughout Latin America it's not
just a Middle East
go to Latin America those are other
parts of the world specific world civic
bases and you'll find people who will
see the United States as intervening
everywhere intervening either directly
with their own troops as in Grenada
Panama Somalia Iraq Yugoslavia I was in
Yugoslavia in the summer of 1999 after
Clinton 76 days of bombing around the
clock you want to talk about terror you
could see it this is not by the way this
is not to justify or excuse what
happened in New York which is a horrible
thing but that's the point the horror
has come home and we can see suddenly
what other people have been going
through not with a plane going into a
building but with carpet bombing with
hitting knocking out bridges in the
Danube River depleted uranium in the
Danube River which is a source of
drinking water for millions of people so
cancer cases are the next year I went to
Iraq and I saw children with cancer they
could be the cancer the leukemia rate
among children is just skyrocketed
especially in southern Iraq around Basra
and there and to see these kids in these
hospitals is one of the most
heartbreaking things from the terror
bombing of US and NATO forces in
Rock spreading out that to please
uranium and everything else they said we
never had a high cancer rate in this
country until that happened
all of that is terrorist and so people
you see on media doesn't tell us that
immediately tells us that we are an
innocent nation we are an American
nation and has been held at a helping
hand to people all over the world and
now these forces of evil haters the
haters because we love freedom well I
think the I think the people are rather
innocent I think they're innocent of
what their leaders view in their name
and I think maybe it's time that we wake
up because the the first condition of a
democratic citizenry is to have a
critical view of what's going on I
remember during the Gulf War a student
saying to me well this is the difference
between you and me yeah it's not very
pretty what's happening there they are
destroying nothing but I had my faith in
President Bush I place my faith in
President Bush that was the first book
Bush the first judgment where he was
talking about and I said he said I trust
President Bush I said when you have your
faith faith and President Bush
faithfully doing religion hero politics
you know faith the way my Italian
grandma had faith in st. Anthony she's
wrong you go George Bush and ever you
light a candle to him are we talking
about faith what do you mean you trust
Trust trust which is something where you
put your interest in someone else 10
something you do only with very close
friends and loved ones and you men check
them out once in a while right that's
what Trust is but with democracy
democracy is about distrust democracy is
about accountability democracy is about
exposure it's about political
competition it's about debate it's about
showing us what are the reasons you're
doing this one of the reasons you want
another twenty billion for this another
twenty billion what are the reasons you
want to tax us even more in taxes even
more for what what the reasons you want
to send American boys and girl
over to this country at that time to the
other countries
what's the reason that we have 350
military bases all over the world why do
we have our fleet making port in about
40 different countries why are we why do
we why are we militarizing outer space
now with new forms of weaponry we hope
we'll be able to attack and immobilize
whole populations with no
electromagnetic weapons and all this
sort of thing why are they doing in a
why are we training and supplying and
financing the troops and the
paramilitaries and the police of scores
and scores of other nations is it
because the guard them from attacking
each other no El Salvador wasn't going
to invade Guatemala Guatemala wasn't
going to invade Nicaraguan the corrado
wasn't going to invade Honduras no it
was to honor them to the teeth to keep
their own people under the heel of those
client state rulers well why would we do
that
why are those u.s. leaders doing that I
would argue that it's not as they say to
protect democracy in these countries in
some cases they overthrew democracy I
already gave you an example in Chile in
1973 in Guatemala in 1954 in Haiti on
the father era steam death squads
killing patients a popular movement the
people mobilizing themselves for
something better that's not what US
policy is about because George Bush and
his friend and Bill Clinton and his
friend do not represent the interests of
the American people they represent the
interests of the transnational
corporations their goal is to make the
world safe for the fortune 500 to
present competing forms of political
economic governance the present
countries or movements or organizations
develop that say we want to use the land
and the labor and the capital and the
natural resources of our country for our
collective development for
so and we don't want to leave this open
and leave it that's just so much raw
material for you guys to come in take as
you want your agribusiness firms your
your bank's your investors your whatever
else
well that that really is what it is
about I would say because you can look
and you can see there are dictators in
the u.s. opposes some of them but also
loves others when Fidel Castro took over
in Cuba and for what he thought was a
populist dictatorship he was ask you
have freedom of the press you said no we
don't really you're not free in Cuba to
preach capitalism racism sexism or
imperialism or as those things we do
have a control press why don't you have
our capitalist point of view in in here
tulips research well we get all the
stations from Miami anyway but we'll be
happy to put your viewpoints on our
official television when you would make
time to put our viewpoint on your
television oh we can do that because we
have a free and independent press right
okay so we have told that we must oppose
Cuba's good Fidel Castro is a dictator
but wait a minute before Fidel Castro
took power in 1959 they had been 20
years of ruled by a dictator
his name was Batista but since there was
a butcher he was hated by the Cuban
people and the u.s. loved him kissed him
hugged him gave me nice nice with him
sent in paid trained his guavas M'Vila
is and all the sort of thing what's the
difference what was the difference
between Batista and Castro the
difference was that best Easter was a
cooperative dictator what does that mean
it means that he opens up his country to
US interests
he said come on in boys the tobacco
industry here
the best in the world right Cuban
tobacco Cuban cigar it's yours the
cotton industry the sugar industry the
magnesium the mining is shuffle the
tourist industry is a big one all yours
you guys come on in
you own it all Yankee you can have it
you can profit and I keep my people down
so that they work hard for less and the
less you have to pay them the more there
is for you and all you got to do those
take care of me my family my brother
Juan my brother Jose my cousin business
you give me my brutal you train my
police and paramilitary and we'll take
care of everything for you and so it was
a client state relationship so what you
had was US tax money going in there to
make the world safe when they Cuba faced
450 US investments even exporting some
of our jobs they are by the way I was
looking at guada I was looking at El
Salvador Gino is in El Salvador ITT
General Motors Firestone Microsoft I'm
saying what the hell can help Salvador I
mean there's just sweat some bananas
some sugar and one all these big
companies doing El Salvador well they've
gone in there you know they've gone in
there for that other resource that other
resource which adds value to any
production who gives you your profit
that other resource which is called
labor they go down for the labor and you
have Salvadorans making energy rods
rubber tires of automobile parts you
name it everything so they go our jobs
our jobs are being exported now I don't
begrudge other people getting jobs in
industrial world but at first what am I
getting getting decent pay but not when
it it's at the expense of people who
have been fighting to get a higher
standard of political economic democracy
need to give you a glasses so many coops
can undignified their next legging hey
am i doing so well good
alright another goal is not only to
prevent competing forms of capital such
as socialist or collectivist or
communitarian whatever else and that's
where the patent is been generally you
attack those those authoritarian
countries that are trying any kind of
distributive politics Iraq is a very
fascinating example what I'm going to
get to that minute of but you also
attack you also support certain
democracies if they are free market
democracies and you attack democracies
also that might be trying to
redistribute in Salvador I ended crime
in Chile was he did not interfere with
anybody's democratic rights not any
newspaper none radio station anybody any
demonstration whatever else what he did
do is you started interfere with certain
thinking economic rights ITT in the big
copper industry and you started saying
this should be publicly owned we got to
take some of this money spend less of it
on the military more on people more on
building up clinics schools of
neighborhood industries and the like and
that's when they hit him he wasn't like
fatigue dispute and sakes come on in
boys it's all yours
he did say we need a minimum wage if you
come in you got to pay our work as a
decent wage etc etc and corporations
really generally don't like that you see
if you're a head in corporation you
always have this problem that your
workers and others want to spend money
on really stupid stupid thing
stupid things like wages pensions
healthcare plans paid holidays sick
leave Environmental Protection
occupational safety when will it end no
but things every dollar I got to spend
on stupid things like that there's one
less dollar I can put in my pocket or
give to my stockholders and so I end a
was trouble so many had to be done don't
believe me listen to Henry Kissinger who
was Secretary of State
he said if you got to choose between
democracy in the economy you go for the
economy he said that I thought it was
nice and him so often they get a little
close to the truth you know oh look at
that Henry almost said something that
was true the other thing the other thing
that you the other thing US policy is
dedicated to now is the only to stop
competing forms of capital as in Libya
with Qaddafi who is turning Libya
there's another case Libya was run by
dictators before us loved them Qaddafi
came in with his with his Colonel took
over the country he took over a social
structure that was like Saudi Arabia
that is where a fraction of 1% obscenely
rich owned everything in Libya or
rattled all the oil revenues kicked them
out nationalize the oil industry took
the earnings from the oil industry and
started doing things like reforestation
Libyan people were allowed to go to
school free education for the first time
in the history free medical care so
forth and so on doing those kinds of
things that's not what the world should
be about the world is not to be
organized to benefit that 95 98 percent
it's organized the benefits that two or
three percent at the top okay
in addition US policy we're now seeing
is also dedicated to preventing
competing formations of capitals not
competing
capital form you get the different would
replace a socialist of collectively
society music its completing capital
form but it's also not dedicated to to
stopping competing formations of
capitalism that makes it clear competing
formation of capitalism not only
competing with within the global
capitalist sphere itself one of the
problem is the third world is not that
people is stupid or lazy or poor or
can't do anything in fact the opposite
is that people work developing and they
were developing the industries you know
you used to get certain countries in
Africa used to get raw leather hides
from them and then before you know you
got
conditioned finished leather then before
you know you started getting leather
goods purses shoes and all this sort of
thing hey we don't want that we don't
want those things competing with us now
for a while for a while for what they
were for a while they were allowing that
much of the third world was getting from
aid there was a feeling that well we
need we need to develop some level of
prosperity otherwise these people will
go communist and we can't have that so
what do we do we give them to me and one
sort of thing and when you look out for
your interest true but then suddenly
something happens the communist country
fell were overthrown so unions
overthrown and that sort of thing and
there was a big celebration said we want
we've won
there is an alternative system it's
going to be global capitalism from now
on shortly after that a rather querulous
note began to be injected in
conservative magazines and publications
and it went like fit so we now have used
to Europe going into a free market
assistance and that meant you know the
end of pensions and in demeaning wages
the end of waste guarantee of job
guarantees the end of all those things a
tremendous sudden tremendous crime in
crime homelessness poverty prostitution
beggary and the like also Russia Ukraine
Hungary Slovakia Bulgaria and now
Yugoslavia why why don't we do roll back
here - that is the whole idea is to
really oppose competing formations of
capitalism if I can undo your system
privatize it and de-industrialized it
and really impoverish it that elevates
the value of my capital I don't have to
worry about your prosperity anymore
there's no Soviet Union for you to get
competing aid from I don't have to worry
about it the world is ours so what we've
had now is a rollback wipe out the
economy flood its markets with
underpriced
Western subsidized goods privatize its
industries eliminate competing
capitalist forms eliminate nonprofit
public ownership one thing that happened
Yugoslavia the minute and Rosa which was
kicked out was this Costa Mesa
government came in and they put up for
privatization 7,000 businesses work with
controlled businesses worker owned
community controlled businesses hold and
put up for privatization most of
privatization by the way ends up to be
to speeds up your lives they buy it for
garage sale and we just put it out of
business or putting mothballs our very
good case is Saddam Hussein it's Iraq
Saddam Hussein was CIA he came and he
was working with the CIA to destroy the
Iraqi Revolution which he did he
destroyed the Kurdish independent party
he destroyed the the back battery he
destroyed the left wing of his own
fascist party he destroyed the Communist
Party he destroyed all that he was the
CIA's boy then he did something that was
got to get rather annoying because now
the auntie's up now it's no longer okay
sure I'll help you people do this step
and make sure you have private capital
because
better watch out to it the the Russian
we don't want you to go socialist now
he's not going to go socialist but he is
competing capitalist once he's doing
something else he's doing the Dalton he
started training engineers and a whole
technical technological and professional
class in Iraq Iraq had the highest
standard of living in the Middle East he
was looking for a better deal on the oil
prices he was getting uppity about the
oil prices and standing up to the US and
the West and that sort of thing any had
to be dealt with how is he dealt with
first of all the same way that Noriega
was dealt with the same way Qaddafi was
dealt with the same way in the most of
its is dealt with you demonize him you
talk about what a
edenian he is and that gives you license
and to bomb and attack his people so
this is what I think we have before us
and I think now we've explained a
mystery why after half a century of
Western investment in aid the third
world is not better off but poorest its
poorest things that have been before the
number of people living in poverty
throughout the world is growing at a
faster rate than the world's population
and the world's population is growing at
quite a pace isn't it poverty is
spreading as wealth grows and
accumulates the goal of Western
investment is not to develop containing
formations of capitalism or capital but
to advance the profits of capital
accumulation of Western investors the
relationship between wealth and poverty
is not just a judge to position
we often say look at all is well here
and and look at all this poverty here
isn't this terrible like it's just that
unfortunate haven't stand in fact it's
not just the juxtaposition but a dynamic
inter relation well creates poverty
that's how you get poverty by
accumulating wealth the way you get the
rich slave-owner
such luxury I'm a gorgeous glorious
plantations is by having slaves and
working in day and night James Madison
said that for every slave he had on this
much James Madison by the way was a
President of the United States he was
the fourth President of the United
States he said for every slave on his
plantation he reckoned he made two
hundred and seventy five dollars a year
in profits and it cost him only
twenty-four dollars to sustain that
slave so that that's quite a profit
that's where a good industry back in the
days when you know chewing seventy five
dollars could buy you Rhode Island or
something okay that's it you can't have
scheudle lords living in great castles
unless you have serfs whose labor is
being exploited to the expropriation the
surplus of their labor goes to the Lord
and you can't have big rich corporate
transnational capitalists unless you
have workers so the world is you see
divided into column a and column B and
column a are those people who live
mostly off earnings from investments
dividend on stock interest on bonds rent
on properties royalties on on the
natural resources like oil wells only
the sort of thing and in common B are
people who live mostly on wages salaries
fees commissions work in other words up
and what come people in column a and
column B have in common is that they
both live off the labor of the people's
in column B David Rockefeller so David
Rockwell he's retired now but he used to
work he was ahead of Rockefeller
Brothers
yeah he worked he could work very hard
but that can't explain the immense
wealth he was making David Rockefeller
will sit here for an hour with you and
he
this room he's richer than when he
walked in maybe not this week but
generally he is you walk out here for
because that's a little bit of money you
guys in the bank is already getting
chewed up lived by inflation right now
people in column a make up less than 1%
of the world's population the rest of
the people are in column B of course
there are many differences there people
who can make more prosperous and so
forth but for the most part everybody
still has to keep working and that
policy the policy in the class that
George Bush represents is is the people
in column a and none of that benefit
trickles down to us when Nike moved
closes down US jobs in Ohio where
they're paying people eighteen twenty
dollars an hour benefits millions and he
moves to Indonesia where they're paying
people eighteen cents an hour ninety
does that they say it's not for to give
you a better deal they still come back
and sell those shoes at why I mean
twenty hundred thirty dots 100 dollars
right so the goal of those who control
I'm going to end it right here the goal
of those who control the land labor
capital technology and resources of this
society and most of the world the goal
to get us back to 1870 that is the goal
is to get us back to a impoverished
population where the labor unions have
been broken with it no minimum wage law
where there's no child labor laws where
people work harder and harder for less
and less
the harder they can get you to work the
poorer they can make you then the harder
you will work for less and less you
might ask yourself why is it Americans
won't work for eighteen cents an hour
the way those Indonesians do is it
because we're so so much more self
respecting is that it no American would
take a job for 18 cents
no it's because we're no longer in 1870
we've had a century of democratic
struggles of organizing the workplace of
fighting for a better life a better
I better a better size of the pie and
the goal is always relentlessly by those
who think the pie was given to them by
God and they don't have to give anybody
a crumb or a slice the goal is to get us
back to 1870 in other words the United
States was a third world country a
hundred years before the term third
world country was ever coined in 1870 we
had child labor we had mass poverty we
had typhoid epidemics in Philadelphia
and Baltimore we had mass unemployment
we had people living in desperation
prostitution beggary on big time we had
a few people in obscene wealth obscene
riches and the mass of the people
struggling with a very small middle
class just hanging on by it's bleeding
fingers that is their goal to get back
to that where they can write the ticket
where they are not bothered by people
who who are trying to constantly better
their lives at the expense of those who
only ball the thing about the difference
between the struggle between the haves
and have-nots the haves are really the
habit all they want it all they want to
bring back 14 hour work days they want
no social services they say that they
want baked with gas and WTO and and
NAFTA and FTAA which is now pending the
goal is to eliminate public services so
any public service will be now being
considered an infringement and
interference with the private market a
lost business opportunity and the public
whatever it is in isset ality the state
government or federal government would
have to pay some imaginary lost
confrontations to any corporation that's
in that particular line of business no
social services no social benefits they
say that they don't want Social Security
then nibbling at it they
and come right out and say let's get rid
of the whole thing which is what they
want to do it doesn't work instead they
tell us it doesn't work it's going to go
bankrupt it's going to go so bankrupt
that's got its eighty hundred two
hundred billion dollar surplus and
they're dipping into it he's eager Bush
is eager to dip into that social
security and spend it on more farms more
more guns more satellites more outer
space missiles more aircraft carriers
all what you're going to stop a
terrorist with a little of with a little
ceramic knife aren't they as they've
done so brilliantly so far so they are
still fighting against the eight-hour
day they're still fighting against
occupational safety they call
bureaucratic intervention interference
they're still fighting to destroy and
rollback labor unions and they're doing
a very good job of that and you know
half a century ago
35 percent of our workforce will
unionize today it's down to something
like 13% they're still fighting against
public health programs against public
education against disability insurance
and always pension what we need then is
a global anti-imperialist movement there
is the US Empire and we have to oppose
it and we got to point out that the
patriotic thing the patriotic thing is
to have a government this is our flag -
the patriotic thing is to have a
government that works for the interests
of the people in column B and not for
the Rockefellers the Morgans the melons
the Huntington Hartford the Bill Gates's
and the others in column a we not only
need an anti-imperialist movement we
already have one we saw in Seattle
against the WTO in Washington DC against
the IMF and the World Bank in Prague in
Quebec City in Sydney on straight
in Philadelphia Los Angeles Genoa
they call us agitators but I have
another word for it when people get out
and they mobilize and they demand a
change and they expose an issue and they
confront that issue and they offer an
alternative
they call it agitators I have another
word for it I call that democracy
democracy and democracy and let's have
more of it thank you
[Applause]
yeah I'll do some questions of there's a
question I know someone has what what
about the terrorists what do we do about
that does anybody want to ask that
question what well the first
intervention in Afghanistan was in the
Soviet Union it was Pakistan in the u.s.
they went in there was a a military
officers revolt against the right wing
the military officers were leftist that
means leftist or people who did things
like wanting to educate children and
women in Afghanistan wanting land reform
and such emotion 18 tribes did not like
that idea the big landowners didn't like
that idea
the Pakistani military's languages so
there was this fight the left military
around Kabul in two other places was
heavily besieged they repeatedly call
for the so you need to come in the
soviets reluctantly by the way refused
first several others did come in and get
themselves involved in a proxy war
against the US and CIA lost it went out
the country was taken over by meridian
government the opium opium production
went up tremendously that was another
thing was that was the left offices in
the soviet that they interfered with a a
very profitable soviet so it was a very
profitable heroin trade coming out of
Afghanistan
some of the quote best heroin in the
world comes from that region and that
most of it comes from that region
through Europe into the u.s. into Europe
- and other places heroin productions up
again the Moshe Deena back in and then
suddenly there emerges another group
called the Taliban supposedly they're
college students yeah right they're
college students who had a whole
infrastructure had the best arms there
were a communication transportation
striking power organization and money it
turns out they were financed by the CIA
the most retrograde element has taken
over in Afghanistan and so you now have
you now have a Frankenstein monster in a
way that is you have a creation of the
West that now is less than friendly it's
all about actually saying what we want
to negotiate with you you know we're not
we're not going to invade your country
or attack your country don't attack our
country there is a way to stop terrorism
bombing Afghanistan the country which
has been ravaged by war for the last ten
years killing these people we've heard
him in these tribesmen you're looking
you're not going to get you know they
bummed that we've been with the US has
been bombing Iraq for now eleven years
they haven't scratched Saddam Hussein
once he hasn't missed a meal yet he has
slept in a warm clean bed every night
you killed an awful lot of other
beautiful people I can tell I can tell
me to Bush that and they're still doing
it so go bomb from hillsides in
Afghanistan which the super missiles
killed a bunch of the people you have
hundreds of thousands of people fleeing
in terror if terror at work already and
and this is causing even greater
starvation great a dislocation greatest
thickness illness when population just
start moving like that there's no
productivity going on
so it's got gotten terrible if you want
to stuff you want to stuff terrorism
then we should not or the u.s. leaders
should not try to be owning and
controlling the planet that's why we're
so hated I mean you could have a country
that has a farm policy that pushes for
international agreements for cooperation
why don't we want to and respect the
nuclear freeze why don't we sign on to
the land mines build it's got the land
landing why don't we stop the race of
armaments into outer space these are
some of the things you can do why don't
we start respecting the economic
development in other countries and the
cultural economic social cultural
religious development other countries
and and put and pointedly say we extend
the hand of friendship that your
development in well-being and prosperity
is not a threat to us it's something
that you have every right to and the
General Motors next year doesn't make
five billion dollars in profits because
now you Yugoslavia you've made your own
car and you've cut into the profits when
we're going to make they going to make
only four point nine billion in profit
or you can afford the hero treatment
that's General Motors problem but as I
say the prosperity and development of
other countries does not detract from
our own prosperity the poverty in other
countries does not add to our prosperity
as I gave the example of Nike they gave
the example of what happens to labor in
El Salvador but that would be the way to
be a country in partnership rather than
being country that's the old mighty
wants that says we can go in anywhere we
can tell any country what they should do
and what they shouldn't do and if they
don't do it will bomb the stuffing out
of them
who gives these leaders in Washington
the right to do that and dictate you see
and this is this is it the US Congress
in this in this orgasm discuss and start
an orgy of
this orgy it's like an organic movement
everybody screaming of patriotism for
these orgies bad enough or via
patriotism turns around and votes 420 to
one votes total power to President Bush
says we give you the power to pursue
all-out war against any nation any
organization or movement or individual
as you so choose you know you can get up
you can say I have I have special
information I can't reveal it but it's
coming in must say and Obama said he
wouldn't do that because France would be
all of Europe would be horrified and all
that but this but that's what it comes
down to and of course there are in fact
some of some of us allies are saying
wait a minute who appointed him king of
the world
wait a minute he has absolute total
power now to go bombing to see attack
anywhere you know in some of these
European countries have investments in
sections in Middle East and Africa and
land they don't particularly want to see
there on the Civic old factories get
bombed and their chemical plants and
whatever else so that's not the way to
do it you know when when I'm when Ronald
Reagan sent those Marines into Lebanon
and the French there were three
contingents went into Lebanon US Marines
French soldiers and Italian soldiers the
birth of Yeti daily unit went in
sometime later five Marines were killed
over a period of a week and a half from
sniper shots then a suicide truck with
explosives went right into the marine
compound exploded and 183 Marines were
killed so altogether that's 188 that
killed another suicide car that very
same time went into the French compound
and killed a large number of French
soldiers to the Italian compound wasn't
touched
and I wondered about that why that was
so and some time later I met a Lebanese
friend who was very involved politically
I said how was it didn't hit the Italian
compound and you know the president of
Italy at that time was a guy named per
tini he was a socialist he had been a
Protestant fighter against the Nazis in
World War two and he is very popular he
was known as the people's president he
was very much likely he did a lot of
good things he sent those troops into
Lebanon but with a different mandate he
said don't go in as conquerors go light
and they developed good relations with
the people the Italians his Lebanese for
instance said to me well they were
wonderful this is not to say Italians
are so wonderful compared to other
ethnic groups I'm not into that even
though I am Italian and have a lot of
ethnic pride since the story I do like
telling them anyway he said he said they
put up field hospitals they put up
clinics they help the people in Lebanon
people came in who hadn't seen a doctor
in their lives you know they got all
this kind of help and they did all sorts
of things like that
assisting population so these mad crazy
beasts Jules insane terrorists
apparently can make discrimination to
see you got to ask yourself why are they
targeting the US why don't they target
Denmark they just want to be evil and
killed people
why don't think target Denmark as a free
society democratic society and it's wide
open security measures in Denmark don't
even compare it to the US why do they
target Sweden I'll give you a soft
target why don't they hit Luxembourg I
thought we could take out Luxembourg why
would they go in and white lion do that
why didn't they hit that Italian
military compound but they did it the
French and American one if you act like
a conqueror and you're going to be hated
as a conqueror if you act as a friend
and partner then there's room for
cooperation and work and negotiation but
if you act as a friend and
and that and the partner then you're not
serving the fortune 500 anymore and that
might be a problem so it's time for us
to really become politically aware of
this back to not not believe do not
believe anything they tell you in terms
it may be true but that's the problem
always ask yourself is this true how
true what does he mean what's the part
of the story I'm not hearing and look to
alternative sources it would be at this
point that I might plug my books but I
won't do that by the way history it has
mystery and tequila nation are already
published they've been asked for about a
year now
any other questions I'm sorry my answers
tend to be very long and yes me it yeah
well again I do believe that the the
Liberation Army that was coming coming
in was a Tutsi army but it really made a
point that we're not tribal any Hutu or
Tutsi convenient I mean we want ethnic
it has all the aura of a Liberation Army
it had all the art of a nationalist
self-determining army that was going to
take his country and use its resources
in its land for its own its own
development it had a lot of support
among the Tipsy population and so the
Hutu were incited on it is whether Hutu
had some grievances because the Tutsis
don't forget what happened in Burundi
with Burundi exactly what Burundi I
pronounce right Ronde where the Tutsi
has Florida duty so you had the Hutu and
machetes were being brought in by the by
the locals where they come from they
came from someplace else then then
Rwanda they came from the web Bill
Clinton explicitly prohibited the use of
the word genocide in regard to Rwanda
even though there was a genocide was a
systematic killing of all those agencies
and I think it was for the very reason I
said it was the same reason why the
French French military came into Rwanda
and and stop that since the army and
stop them from stopping the magic is
that was that was that was going on and
look the other way when the massacres
were going they were complicit with it
it was a final solution against a
troublesome population that was becoming
political and politicized and critical
of the West and wanting to claim its
country for itself that's not I mean
there's a lot more about Rwanda that we
would have to talk about which I can't
on just women yes
democracy has function or critical
hockey assist certified before and we
were like when Lucia for information to
use colors as risk or only control
Lumiere
I've written a book about it called
inventing reality which came out two
years before
Chomsky's manufacturing content on any
one sentence it shows it shows have case
studies of it it shows that the news is
pretty much a highly processed product
and it's in accordance with those who
own the organization that the people who
write or speak for the media know who
they're working for and and and these
news media are all big giant
multinational corporations x warner and
bc they're all owned by big companies
did give me westinghouse actually they
actually the ownership key is changing
and combining soap so quickly they used
to be beg digging points that used to be
24 major just 24 major news cartels
around the world and then it was down to
15 and now it's down to about seven and
it's going to be down to more like five
producing so the big corporations and so
you know you got it
I thought with this whole world trade
tragedy of last week the news media was
not just a lap dog you know the
mouthpiece for power they call it
whatever the official them says they
send it out and that's that
I thought they actually started clearing
away which is what an ideological worker
is also supposed to do I guess they were
jumping in they were saying things
before the politicians ever dared to say
I think this is
Orion who first said that tom brokaw he
said it at about at about a quarter to
ten I mean the bomb the two planes hit
the two planes hit or maybe with 10:00
10:30 and I went when me when the
building came down he was saying this is
war this is war war has started is the
war later and today well they were
getting that word out already you know
this is evil this is something that is
never happen this is the worst atrocity
in history of humanity well I don't know
I I wish it was but I think there were
others that have been much much worse
worse act of terrorism certainly is
worse act of terrorism that we have ever
enjoyed on US soil that's gotten people
on set yeah chains of Nixon but I school
in 1942 and in 43 44 45 I was off to
protect freedom of speech and I see that
I want well thank you was that a good
War World War two
yeah I think it was a good war to stop
fascism that knock stop nitrogen it took
a bit of doing
yeah well that's what eisenhower said to
some of his troops he says now you know
what you're fighting for look at these
concentration camps yeah what I'll do if
this thing is a good war of course you
know Benjamin Franklin said the only
good war is the war that's prevented or
never fought and World War two could
have been prevented if we had been
firmer if we had listened to a very
strong element in Germany in the German
military there's any number of attempts
on Hitler's life matches that at one
time and they had made overtures to the
British intelligence service will knock
them out we'll take them out we'll even
put in the Conservative government they
knew who they were dealing with we'll
put in a Conservative government we
don't want this guy because this is
going to mean another world war and it
will mean the destruction of Germany the
German generals
and it was right because he got most of
them encourage them and killed most of
them but yeah well when it came you guys
like you we all owe you something
in the speech and I'm using it I didn't
want to go to waste
you put your blood sweat and tears into
it I think the lady makes your hand up
first
well I really I really do think that
most Americans do not know of us role in
Indonesia in all these different
countries that I talked about I really
don't think they have most of
information if you have area information
indicating otherwise that I would like
to see it I do know that despite the
monopoly propaganda barrage that they're
hit with you do get some very unusual
statistics like on Iraq a month a few
weeks before Bush went in on Iraq the
poll showed that Americans by very large
majorities prefer a negotiated
withdrawals to get Saddam Hussein to
take his troops out of Kuwait as opposed
to sending US forces to attack now what
Bush didn't want to hear that at all and
he was pumping up every one reason and
another every day were coming up with
another reason why they had to go in
babies were being torn from incubators
in Kuwait the Iraqi soldiers remember
five hundred babies torn from incubators
and thrown on the floors of the Iraqi
laughing and and then people suddenly
said that five rooted premature baby
incubator what is it all of Los Angeles
County has only forty five incubators
what is it what is a Kuwait specialized
in premature babies or what was some
what is it no but no way the piece of
trosset e stories were up and all into
something and then once once the troops
went in then what happens is the other
jingo wouldn't kicks in and to support
our troops
the flags get waved and and all that
sort of thing but remember remember you
know George the first when he was
bombing erupt and killing all those
people in Congress was calling him
passing resolutions praising him for his
unerring leadership courage and
fortitude and so forth his approval
rating was 93 percent and within a year
he lost the election to a mediocre
government from Arkin
so you see so it doesn't Manik George
George George the second you know his
approval rating has gone from something
like 32 percent up to sub to 80 percent
of the wave handling this but but it's a
crazy it's just so long you can keep
typing a flag waving and beeping you're
on USA USA USA after what we got to live
and living me facing certain realities
you know how things are really going so
I I am rather discouraged by the extent
to which I've seen this again again how
clean it can be easily demonized
I remember when colmar Qaddafi of Libya
this was years ago was the Qaddafi
Qaddafi there was a Qaddafi the Demian
Qaddafi and I'd go around and people
were Qaddafi I go lecturing around the
country people wear my Qaddafi Qaddafi
Qaddafi go and get your momma agassi you
know and I'd say Qaddafi what is Qaddafi
gonna do he's got it a little ragtag
here's a nation of three million people
and they actually convinced they
actually convinced people in our country
that this guy was a mortal danger to the
security and survival of the United
States with an army of 50,000 what's he
going to do with a ragtag army of 50,000
and he had and he had manifested no
interest in having hostile relations
with the US he repeatedly made overtures
I would like to negotiate a friendly
friendly position with the US and
instead he was targeted and bombed and
his little his little daughter was
killed in a terrorist attack by US plane
you see when the US planes come in with
jets that's called a raid that's not
called a terrorist attacks people down
there see it as a terrorist attack it's
the same thing in Palestine the
Palestinians are terrorists because they
use cars and machine guns whatever else
and the Israelis are retaliating with
jets and tanks and that's the best thing
as retaliation that's not seen as a
terror at
but it's using terror tooth and then the
same thing Noriega and then the same
thing with Saddam Hussein who is it was
a slimeball but but for the wrong
reasons I think they were attacking him
and killing his people and then we heard
about Milosevic and then and now we're
hearing it about Afghanistan Osama bin
Laden was again trained equipped good by
the CIA he and his cohorts were used in
the CIA war in Afghanistan against the
the Afghan Revolutionary Government and
now he turned around and he's gone to
business for himself
let's magic one more question because I
know you folks want to well maybe we
should make it two more questions one
here and one there because I see it jump
in that but I know
okay yes good I'll try to give short
answers well that was a very good
example of the media moving ahead
nothing of the responsive lapdogs to
officialdom but for jumping in and
putting all these things out out there
and clearing away so that so that the
politicians could feel snug and safe to
say those things the media was saying
that your people think well you know we
have the luxury democracy and maybe it's
a luxury we can afford as much as we
have or we've taken democracy for
granted but maybe we shouldn't take it
for granted too much anymore
because we're going to have to do with
less of it or our civil liberties that
they're saying is the sort of thing yeah
I think they will talk if they target
with if they can whip up enough history
if they will target political dissenting
groups one of the groups they're gonna
target are the anti-globalization
activists and see them as terrorists and
use the term against them as purveyors
of violence and also think you know he's
cute
handful of these young people dressed in
black smashing windows and Starbucks or
GAC store is called terrorism and
violence it's really just it's just a
deliberate systematic destruction of
corporate property as a form of
political protest nobody was getting hit
or something the police meanwhile coming
in in general you know Berlusconi's
government Yeti fascist little pigs
going in and bloodying people in their
sleeping bags and getting the hell out
of the middle of the night that that
wasn't called loans and killing one one
demonstrated as you know this is why we
have to stay alert to this whole
question about civil liberties and and
the best way to protect your freedom is
to exercise it vigorously that's the
best way as with the physical body so is
the body politic the way to keep you to
keep your body politic to keep your
community or democracy strong and to get
whatever little democracy we do have you
know voting for this one or that one but
it's to exercise dissent vigorously and
seriously to keep yourself quiet the
quiet end because we know this is a I
want to talk now is to do is to do the
work of your enemies you're silencing
yourself before they even have to list a
freeman to silence you yeah
well let me answer that before you go
through your shopping list wait before
you have assembly that's not necessarily
true you know people who work in these
countries at subsistence wages like
democracy Leah daughters in Mexico are
not all that particularly happy with the
kinds of jobs and the conditions of the
jobs and the seventeen-year-old 16 year
old girls were working in the Nike
factories in Indonesia do not like and
love us say there isn't really any
evidence of that but of course if you
compare that kind of miserable 12-hour
underpaid job to nothing then then yeah
it's but if you can give me the choice
between nothing and immediate starvation
or a job where I might be able to
scratch through a little bit of
something for four 12-hour days six
seven days a week I might have to take
that job but I don't I'm not really sure
that this gives them a a love for us
that's not my impression
well well I gave a whole lecture to the
contrary and they are but you certainly
are entitled to your opinion I hope you
might give it some critical examination
thank you
ladies gentlemen for your kind attention
[Applause]
[Laughter]
basically yes you guys cannot all go
home now those of you who are interested
in expressing an alternative viewpoint
of some kind like that keep in mind the
product of this particular presentation
lecture and whatnot is one that has been
actually critically researched and and
so if you hold an alternative point of
view it's it's of course in a free
speech acceptable but come up at us with
your research not you're just simply
your passion so other than that thank
you thank you very much anyone who might
be at Ava Mouse classroom and is looking
for their credit Ava Mouse classroom
here you go there's your a sign-up sheet
it's a serious would not really be
happenin Alice had not provided the
space much funding and a lot of
publicity many things so I want to
express my gratitude towards massarde
for help make helping like this happen
also thing is the Massachusetts
Foundation for the Humanities has
provided a lot of fun to this as well if
you guys before I forget to ask you
there's I don't know if I've already
asked this but there's audience
evaluation forms if you could fill those
out and just leave them in the box out
there when you leave that would be great
and I'd like to I'd like to thank
specific individuals who have helped me
along the way
george creamer has done a lot to assist
me and helped me figure out how this is
going to come together as a whole
Lisa Tong as well both of them have
provided a lot of financial assistance
as well as organizational guidance and
that sort of thing
ricardo barreto in the Urban Arts

the website and Rick McDermott and Jack
Fahey who have helped me organized the
space and you know helped me with a
technical assistance so I guess I just
like to say that tonight we are we are
lucky to have internationally recognized
historian playwright tell us what he
thinks the artists role in affected
affected social changes he is the author
of several texts which actively engage
non-academic audiences including what is
the future of history and his famous a
people's history of the United States
which is a increase in sales every year
since its first publication in 1980
almost 20 years ago
that's pretty much unheard of in the
publishing industry the importance of
what he has to say
is truly evident and the fact that and
I'm just going to read this here his
writings have been translated into
Japanese Italian serbo-croatian French
Spanish Hindi German Finnish Chinese
Korean and Swedish his place had been
performed in Boston Washington DC
Chicago San Francisco London Tokyo and
several other locations I think that the
most important thing to remember about
factors in is that he's been a constant
voice in presence in social political
activism that dates back to the first
sit-ins in Atlanta Georgia in 1960
protesting the exclusion of African
Americans are being served in white
restaurants where he sat alongside
others until they were all taken away
and rest
many of those that I know including my
own mother has had their understanding
of American history and their
understanding of what it means to be an
American transformed by his writings and
his actions and not forever thankful my
last night I was talking to my best
friend and I was saying you know how am
I going to introduce this guy he's done
so much and basically what he said to me
was just say here's one cool
 how is them
[Applause]
thank you I've never been introduced
that way I hope you caught that on the
video camera well I have never talked
about this topic I won't say I've never
talked but I've never talked about this
topic you know the art and society of
course I've thought about it my wife is
a painter I have artist friends some of
my best friends our artists some of them
are here observing me but as I say yeah
I had thought about of course all of us
have and what comes to mind when I think
of the you know the relationship of the
artist to society what should be the
relationship of the artist to society
and with me at always a question of what
should be and not what is you know and I
think of the word transcendent which is
a word I've never used in public but it
was the only thing I could come up with
to describe what I think about the role
of the artist and by that I mean
you know not you know immanuel kant's
well yes sort of close to it but not
really his idea of what is transcendence
something like it but the idea is that
the artist transcends the immediate
transcends here and now the artist
well transcends the madness of the world
transcends the madness of terrorism
transcend the madness of war and the
artist thinks outside the framework and
acts and paints and does music and right
outside the framework that society has
has created and the artist
it may just no more than and I don't
mean to minimize it by saying no more
that yes they do more than you know give
us a beauty and laughter a passion
surprise drama and that's that's good
that is the artist needn't apologize for
just doing that because in doing that
the the artist is telling us what the
world should be like even if it isn't
that way now and the artist is is taking
us away from the moments of horror that
we experience everyday in this world
some days more than others and and
showing us something else showing us
what is possible
but then solo he there's no need for an
artist to apologize about just giving us
something that is passionate and
beautiful and funny or any of those not
they'll need to apologize for that
but there is more as the artist can do
more yes should should do more not only
that but more where the artist is also a
citizen the artist is a human being I
mean I faced that in a different way and
that if I'm if I can be classified well
yeah the society classifies me I'm a
historian it scares me
can we classify our historian but I
don't want to be just a historian and
but there will be society that
disciplines us it puts us into a
discipline your historian you're a
businessman you're an engineer you're on
this you're at that and first things
somebody asks you at a cocktail parties
what do you do
which means you know what is your
profession what is it you know how are
you categorized and the problem is that
people begin to think that that's what
they are and that's all they are
that they're professionals in something
and either what professionalism being
used and you think ah you've got
you've got to be professional whenever
hear the word I get a little scared
because that limits human beings to
working within the limits set by this
profession as a historian I would face
this and it would be during the Vietnam
War there were the meanings of
historians to imagine what a wonderful
feeling that is to be among 2,000
historians at a meeting and and I
remember during the Vietnam War this
question was at one of our great
meetings of historians the war was
raging in Southeast Asia the question
was should historians take a stand on
the war and was a big debate on that
really the big debate on it and some of
us introduced a resolution saying you
know we historians think the United
States should get out of Vietnam a
simple little thing and then the others
who said no it's not it's not that we
don't think the United States should
stay in Vietnam not that at all
it's just the way historians it's not
our business a whose business is it so
the historian says it's not my business
and the businessman says it's not my
business and the lawyer says it's not my
business and you know the artist says
it's not my business and whose business
is it you mean we're going to lead the
business of the most important issues in
the world to the people who run the
country
I mean how stupid can you leave I mean
have we had enough experience
historically with leaving the important
decisions to the people in the White
House of the people in Congress or the
people in Supreme Court or the people
who dominate the economy we've had lots
of experience leaving the important
decisions to them because the citizen
doesn't know he's a citizen he thinks
he's only a doctor or a lawyer or
historian or an artist or whatever but
back in the 18th century Rousseau said
you know I see all sorts of people who
are doing this and doing that and doing
this and doing that but where are the
citizens among us
everybody everybody must be involved
there are no experts well they're up I
remember doing a Vietnam War I keep
going back because that there's certain
historical moments when learning is more
intense than at any other period this is
one of those moments too right now after
September 11 but Vietnam was one of
those moments when learning is
compressed into a short span of time and
place and one of the things we learned
about during those years was about
experts and about when war started and
people would ask questions why are we
there so when listen to the experts the
experts would be on television and tell
us why we're there and I remember the
British actor an artist right actors are
artists the British actor Peter astana
spoke out against the war in Vietnam
and then somebody said Liston ah he's an
actor he's not an expert and thus enough
replied there are experts in little
things but there are no experts in big
things they're experts in this fact and
that fact in that fact but there are no
moral experts it's important to remember
that that all of us whatever we do have
the right to make moral decisions about
the world and undeterred by the cries
that will come up oh you you don't know
your necks but these people up there
they know well takes only a little bit
of history to realize how dangerous it
is to think that the people who run the
country know what they're doing so the
word transcendent comes to mind when I
think of the role of the artist in
dealing with the issues of the day
and I use the word transcendent to
suggest that the Year role of the artist
is to transcend the given wisdom to
transcend the word of the establishment
to transcend the orthodoxy to transcend
to go beyond to escape what is handed
down by the government or what is said
in the press or what is said on
television
because there are people in the arts and
people in other professions who think
well yes let's get involved
let's get involved in the way we are
told to be involved and then you will
see the artists in me and the other
people in professions getting in line in
the way that people are expected to get
in line when the president says this is
what we must do and all everybody else
in politics echoes that and this is what
we must do and and we've seen this all
around now how many times have I read in
the press since September 11th well we
must be united and what does they mean
by that I would like us to be united but
United around watt and when people say
we must be united most of the time when
they say this they are saying either
explicitly or implicitly we must be
united around whatever the president
tells us to do then rather right TV
anchor and goods to the establishment
I know what an anchorman is dan Rather
gets up on national television says Bush
is my president when he says get in line
I get in line did any of you read that
yes he said it I mean I make up some
things I didn't make that up you say and
I thought here is there was a very
important influential journalist and
he's forgotten the first rule of
journalism which is think for yourself
he's forgotten what that great
journalist I have stone that the really
probably know one of the several
greatest journalists to the 20th century
what I have stone used to say when he
stopped working for them for the major
media he would he was working for
regular newspapers and then he realized
he couldn't be himself he couldn't say
what he wanted to do and so he
established his own little newsletter I
at Stone's weekly which became famous
for giving you things that you couldn't
get anywhere else and then I have stone
wasn't would be invited to speak two
classes of journalism students and he
would say I'm going to tell you a number
of things but you really only have to
remember if you really want to be a good
journalist you really only have to
remember two words governments lie
very important to remember government's
lie I mean not just the American
government governments in general lie
when they say all governments lied it
and they sounded like an anarchist
statement the anarchists have something
there yeah their rights to be skeptical
suspicious of people who hold
governmental power because the tendency
of people or governmental power is to
lie in order to maintain that power and
rather when he said that the president
says get in line Diana he violated that
you know Hippocratic oath of journalists
that is implied in the profession of
journalism of think of yourself the kind
of statement you would expect from a
journalist in a totalitarian state not
somebody living in a democracy and then
talking about getting in line and then
you have Al Gore who accepted his defeat
graciously so graciously that he became
humble overwhelmingly humble so that
when all this happened
Gore announced
Bush is my commander-in-chief I thought
I don't think he's read the Constitution
the Constitution says that the president
is the commander-in-chief of the Armed
Forces he's not the commander-in-chief
of the country of all of us is he but I
hear all these people rushing to get in
line
rushing to to get inside the perimeter
of power no and it's a job of the artist
to transcend that to think outside the
boundaries to dare to say things that no
one else will say and fortunately we've
had all through history artists who who
dared there to do that and I think of
well I think of Mark Twain and here he
was writing these these great novels
which everybody loved this story is a
wonderful wonderful storyteller but when
the United States went to war in 1898
against Spain and then after a quick
defeat of Spain was called a splendid
little war the United States went to war
in the Philippines that was not a
splendid little war that was a long and
ugly war to subdue the Filipinos who
wanted to run the Philippines themselves
a war which in its atrocities foretold
the war in Vietnam
and Mark Twain became one of the voices
speaking out against that war and when
Theodore Roosevelt in 1906 and by then
the war has been going on for five years
and it was several hundred thousand
Filipinos dead or you will not find much
in your history books about how many
Filipinos died in that war but in 1906
the US Army committed a massacre in the
Philippines you might call it an act of
terrorism that is in the sense that
innocent people were simply mowed down
by an army unit and and Theodore
Roosevelt sent a message of
congratulations to the general who
carried out the operation against these
these Morrow's these Muslims in the
southern Philippines who were virtually
unarmed who didn't know anything about
modern warfare and men women children
just mowed down every single one of that
and after Roosevelt congratulated a
general for this great military victory
Mark Twain denounced Roosevelt for this
and became one of the leading leading
protestors against the war in the
Philippines he stepped out of his role
as a just a story teller whom everybody
loved and got into the fray and they had
to say things that so many people in the
country were not saying and of course
people then questioned his patriotism
because as soon as you speak outside the
boundaries as soon as you say things
that are different than what the
establishment is telling you to say what
the newspapers want the media what
everybody including leading
intellectuals are telling you to say you
know as soon as you do that the question
of your patriotism arises
and Mark Twain said about patriotism and
about loyalty because people ask them
why aren't you well he said my kind of
loyalty was loyalty to one's country not
to its institutions or its officeholders
the country is the real thing the
substantial thing the eternal thing it
is a thing to watch over and care for
and be loyal to its institutions are
extraneous they're its mere clothing and
clothing can wear out become a ragged
ceased to be comfortable cease to
protect the body from winter disease and
death to be loyal to rags to shout for
rags to worship rags to die for rags
that is a loyalty of unreason this is
important because in the present
discussion boundaries have been set
lines have been drawn and people who go
outside those boundaries and dare to
criticize official policy
I called unpatriotic and disloyal when
they say that when they accuse the
Centers of that they have forgotten the
meaning of loyalty and the meaning of
patriotism patriotism does not mean
support for your government patriotism
means support for your country as Mark
Twain said or Emma Goldman said well
roughly around the same time Emma
Goldman feminist anarchist
said she can give a lecture on
patriotism and she said I love the
country but I don't love the government
and to criticize the government's when
you think the government is wrong is the
highest act of patriotism and when
somebody accuses you I don't know if you
will all face that situation but if
somebody accuses you of not being
patriotic because you don't go along
with up whatever the government is is
doing I think you ought to remind them
about the Declaration of Independence
and that according to the Declaration of
Independence and everybody praises the
Declaration of Independence when it's
hung up on a classroom wall but not when
people read it and understand that
during the Vietnam War a soldier was
disciplined for putting up the
Declaration of Independence on his
barracks wall the declaration
independence is that governments are
artificial creations they're set up by
people by the people of the country
governments are set up by the people of
country to achieve certain things
certain objectives the Equality of all
people in their right to life liberty
and the pursuit of happiness
governments are artificial creations set
up for those purposes and when a
government becomes destructive of those
ends as the Declaration said it is the
right of the people to alter or abolish
it
that's serious but that that is
democratic doctrine that is the idea of
democracy and therefore there are times
when it becomes absolutely patriotic to
point a finger at the government and say
the government is not doing what it
should be doing to safeguard the right
of people to life liberty and the
pursuit of happiness and I don't think
it would be wrong in our time with
everybody talking oh this is one world
globalization yes the world has shrunk
we're all part of the same planet I mean
they talk that way but do they mean it
you could test out whether they mean it
by suggesting that the words of the
Declaration of Independence the right to
life liberty and property apply not only
the people in this country but the
people in other countries to people
everywhere people everywhere in the
world have the same right to life
liberty and the pursuit of happiness and
so when the government becomes
destructive of that well then it is
patriotic to criticize to oppose the
government to become a dissenter to do
what we always praised when it was done
in other countries in totalitarian
countries and we we looked upon the
dissenters and the critics of this
governments as heroes for daring to
speak out
and I wanted to point to some other
artists who spoke out against war he
Cummings I sing a bowl up glad and big
who's warmest heart recoiled at war a
conscientious objector but though all
kinds of offices I'm skipping a little
but though all kinds of officers the
yearning nations blue-eyed pride their
passive paraded kick and curse until
full where their Clarion voices and
boots were much the worse and egged the
first-class privates on his rectum
wickedly to tease by means that
skillfully applied bayonets roasted hot
with heat Olaf
upon what were one sneeze does almost
ceaselessly repeat there is some I
will not eat and Eugene O'Neill the
great playwright
and this was six months after Pearl
Harbor this is important because he
Cummings was reacting to World War one
and other writers were reacting to World
War one the because that great martial
spirit that was summoned up in 1917 when
they were getting the United States into
war and and when they were marshalling
people into line and and the flag was
being waved and then the war was over
and people looked at the 10 million dead
on the battlefields of Europe and asked
what was this all about
and then the disillusionment began to
arise and people began to think again
because after that first wave of flag
waving and bugles blowing in let's this
we got to do this and look at the
terrible things they did and look at
they and yes some terrible things were
being done and so therefore we have to
do terrible things that's war whereas
terrible things done on one side and
terrible things done on the other side
and then after a while the second
thoughts come there are all these people
dead and what did we accomplish what
have we done
that's what happened that the world will
want that's what led to the writings of
John Dos Passos in Ernest Hemingway Ford
Madox Ford and that great novel that
great anti-war novel by Dalton Trumbo
Johnny got his gun which I recommend to
all of you and read it in one evening
and you won't forget it but it's good to
remember that even when the war is
presumably a good war because wars
always look good at the beginning
they always look good at the beginning
to a lot of people because this was this
rush of fervor based on something
terrible that has been done and
something that must be done in
retaliation and then only later the the
thinking begin and the questioning again
and so Eugene O'Neill was writing six
months after Pearl Harbor and writing
when the country was being mobilized for
war and this is remember this is the
good war you know there are good wars
and bad Wars I used to think so until I
was in a war exactly know there's no
such thing as good wars and bad wars I
had a student once who wrote on her
paper wars are like wines they're good
years and bad years good wars and bad
years but she said war is about like
wine wars like cyanide one drop in
you're dead you see but Eugene O'Neill
was writing in the midst of the that
early burst of war fervor after Pearl
Harbor so not an easy time to write this
but he you wrote this to his son it is
like acid always burning in my brain
that the stupid butchering of the last
war taught men nothing at all that they
sank back listlessly on a warm manure a
pile of the dead and went to sleep
indifferently bestowing custody of their
future their fate into the hands of
State Department's whose members are
trained to be conspirators card sharps
double double crossers and secret
betrayers of their own people into the
hands of greedy capitalists ruling
classes so stupid they could not even
see when their own greed began devouring
itself
in the hands of that most debased type
of pimp the politician and that most
Craven of all life and job worshipers
the bureaucrats well I mean I would
never use such strong language myself
but I'm willing to quote it when
somebody else says it and when I talk
about thinking outside the boundaries
