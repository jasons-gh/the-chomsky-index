about synagogues around the country are
finding that the rabbis are complaining
that they just can't really be a
physician
there's another reason right that's
right
and I guess I mean I wanted to make that
the folks this discussion but I was
sitting in my hotel room yesterday and I
was I was sitting in my hotel room
yesterday and I put on CNN and suddenly
the breathless coverage the air assault
on Syria began and all the pundits came
on and they were congratulating
themselves or incredibly confident that
they had this coalition with the UAE
Saudi Arabia Jordan Bahrain and Qatar
and how this represents one of them said
an inflection point and we're going to
hit him over the head with a two-by-four
one of them said and they were also
really excited about the f-22s that
we're gonna be used and I think those
are produced by Lockheed Martin I'm not
sure and and they were using all just
the classic euphemisms that we've heard
before when we hit them with it were
occurred to me know where it is
so my question I guess is what do you
think the objectives of this mission is
a proposed Isis and when was the last
time a you know a sort of a coalition
assault like this produce more stability
in the region a little kind of
understand the side note that this
report that you
it came out in the press alongside of
the lead story in The New York Times
about how the moment of Isis in Iraq has
failed to hold any territory at all
that's how successful it is and there's
a reason there's also a reason why the
Iraqi army that which had three hundred
and fifty thousand men that was very
heavily of Honor I've been trained by
the United States for a decade but this
is an army which had fought bitter Wars
like the war gets to ground huge wound
as soon as they were faced with a couple
of thousand lightly armed jihad ease the
generals around away the troops through
their arms and they won't run away
why what's why not this grand coalition
who is it
first of all my friend is occupied by
something basic basically occupied by
Soviet Saudi Arabia the UAE is a couple
of you know feudal lords the Saudi
Arabia is the source of the jihadis it's
the source of the jarring movement both
in funding and then ideologically I'm
there spreading of their extremist
Wahhabi Salafi doctrine is the roots of
the jihad a movement you could listen to
BBC this morning they had listened to
him driving yet they interviewed top
Iraqi security officials asking about
all these things and he said well first
of all you can't have a coalition unless
to manifested one of the most important
countries in the region of the US for
ideological reasons don't do that
secondly said it can include Saudi
Arabia because of just what I said
Saudi Arabia is the source of the
jogging movements thirdly said it has to
include us we don't like it but that's
the only army fighting Isis the cold
turkey for example refuses to
participate I mean at first they said
they were excused because there were
hostages and it's technically an
aggressive strike because if they
haven't gotten permission so regardless
of whether or not the the rubber but the
Tyrell is the one funded who they don't
have on presenting is the one who
noticed something namely October right
who's been following this very closely
as a fine journalist they just had a
book that came out on that what he
points out is he says that the war Hafez
Asian of Sunni Islam is one of the most
dangerous phenomena of this millennium
right the past month that's the source
of its spread from Pakistan all over
North Africa Saudi Arabia is not only
the most extreme radical Islamist force
in the world
but it's also a missionary force they
pour money into establishing their
madrasahs - which are a substantial part
of the source of the jihadi movement
that's why this Iraqi officials it until
Saudi Arabia stops funding and
ideologically promoting extremist
Judaism and how can it be part of the
coalition but there's the main US ally
and the countries that ought to be part
of it or not what you revered and
answered your question that this is a
violation of international law that's
irrelevant right because they only
applies to law abiding stance right but
the United States is a rogue's that it
dismisses international law I mean this
is a minor example that takes a the
invasion of Iraq and that's a radical
violation of international law that take
when Obama referring to my friend says
all options are open right that's a
radical violation of the UN Charter
right but none of this matters in a
rogue state that's like asking
it's like going Osama bin Laden your
violation
national right that what's the relevant
international globe has not applied in
the United States or Israel incidentally
so it's thinking that Israel thumb so
from what I understand there are two
sort of eras in Israel's history there
is and I could be getting this wrong
there's pre 1967 when Israel regardless
of sort of the violence associated with
statehood what is an aspiring country
American support of Israel wasn't
significant or over-the-top in some
sense it was vulnerable and it hadn't
initiated the expansion and the
settlement and the kind of
aggressiveness that came after 1967 when
they occupied the territory and it seems
like a lot of thinkers use that as an
inflection point and one of the rabbi's
that I kind of go back to Yeshua only
bovitz who was talking about how
basically a 3040 years we were the
apartheid state beyond that yeah they
said Israel is going to become true do
not right right and so do you and of
course it's interesting this sort of
debate between the rabbis because of
course there's this Rob kook and the
Greater Israel movement and of course
he's rabbis been worried about Zionism
informing state and political policy and
before 1967 from what I understand it
was a minimal sort of influence in terms
of the the rabbis at that point so my my
question is wasn't really sort of like
one year you know 1967 mark like a
significant difference in Israel
identity do you remember the time before
and the time after is two distinctly
different periods that certainly
distinct much more than that so for
example in 1964 I happened to visit
Israel several times for an
international conference and spent some
time there and it was kind of
interesting that at that point 1964 the
term Co loot right in Hebrew among
educated people was that term of
ridicule yeah there's these people who
talk about Co they understand that stuff
they have come back two years later it's
it's love yes the 67 occupation
certainly made a difference also had a
huge difference as you mentioned in u.s.
support and 67 remember Israel performed
a huge service to the United States
added to Saudi Arabia it's not talked
about much but at that time there was a
major conflict in the region was between
radical Islam symbolizing centered in
Saudi Arabia and secular nationalism in
Egypt that was the conflict and the
United States like Britain before
strongly supported radical Islam but
traditionally they've always supported
almost all the supported radical Islam
again a secular nationalism as the
threat and there was a war going on
between Saudi Arabia and Egypt in the
Yemen at the time kind of a proxy war
pretty serious israel smash secular
nationalism it defended Saudi Arabia it
met the u.s. British goal of destroying
secular nationalism remember Nasser was
compared with Hitler I thought this was
an immense service and it changed you
take a look yes you're right that's when
us support for Israel just exploded
happened again in 1970 in 1970 the US
aid Israel I think quadrupled
why because Israel performed another
service during the Black September
remember Houston and Jordan it looked as
though the Jordanian military force of
money that crushed the Palestinians
Syria made some indication of moving to
support Palestinians against the
Jordanian attack the u.s. initiative the
US was very much opposed to that and so
was Saudi Arabia
my Saudi Arabia regards the Palestinians
to the threat the US did not want anyone
did her fear this was right at the time
when the US was mired in Cambodia it was
impossible to talk about you as an
interventionist on the US asked Israel
intervene
Israel mobilized its forces which was
enough to indicate to Assad that he had
to back off and they backed off they
didn't move on
Portobello and so do you think 1967 gave
Israel at the sixth a war gave Israel
that pretext to initiate plans to occupy
all of Palestine that that did this was
just a matter of time and there was
never this period that Israel was sort
of content with the land outside never
content I mean starting in 1949 Israel
started expanding at that time they
couldn't invade another country but they
expanded into the Demilitarized Zone a
lot of the so-called terrorists remember
in Hebrew there wasn't a word for
terrorists until years later the the
people who are coming into the country
were called miss Donna named
infiltrators later they were called
knobbly but that the wisdom change
signified ideological change I remember
I was in a few minutes in 1953 going on
just going with friends up to guard
service in the evening some of them
wouldn't take rifles because they knew
that they miss Donna named we're just
the people who lived there who had been
driven out we're trying to harvest their
crops they don't want to drag them later
they became terribly insane people but
Israel was creating them the Israel
moved into the Demilitarized Zone
drove out bedouin groups these were
people who wanted revenge and they did
historic carrying out terrorist acts
thinking thinking this went on right up
to 67
about like the struggles with Syria as
Diane pointed out he said yeah the
conflicts with Syria have begin when we
encroach into the demilitarized zones
into what is regarded as neutral
territory
the Syrians respond and that gives us an
excuse for being attack on Syria and
what's more all the UN commanders
understood I never read their memoirs
every one of them came in very
sympathetic to Israel every one of them
left
I'm very hostile to Israel because they
could see all of this happening right so
I guess I have it's quite different
position so yeah you're right
one might wonder you know last question
before he Alda has a few questions for
you is you've mentioned that when you
and your wife were you know living
temporarily at kyboots
this was before the keyboards became a
hotbed for nationalism and militarism
that it probably so had a sort of
innocent an archaic socialist roots was
that also like an inflection point 1967
where the kibbutz became a kind of
breeding ground for the type of
nationalism that we see now in a culture
and it was a change after season there
were all kind of reasons but the kid
became close to 67 are quite different
from what they were in the early fifties
or the forties I mean remember that a
large part of the kibbutz wasn't sure
announcer a year up until 1948 was
opposed to the state David but Nationals
that's a big difference
that's when I was right
did you self identify yourself as a kid
what snack at least temporary well I'd
like to keep oats and we sort of staying
there but the reason was the kibbutz
where it was was considered the most
less plain in Israel it was the Center
for outreach to the Arab community of
America here it was way out of the
fringe but it was Stalinist you couldn't
imagine I mean I lived with relatives
who were stalling us like were over the
30s and the 40s but I never saw anything
like that they just wore shorts taller
this was particularly striking because
it was in 1953 you may recall that that
was the time was Stalin's last and
violently anti-semitic to purge the
Slutsky trials and Czechoslovakia which
were directed his Jews it was it was
real anti-semitic outburst one of the
centerpieces in the slums B trial was a
shalyah from the kibbutz movement word
of a order this is like a family they
won't do it they knew that he was
innocent you know he was charged with
being spy for you know the CIA and the
other that was a centerpiece of the
trial they knew he was innocent they
justified the trials I mean this is
beyond anything I've ever seen
but the ideological uniformity everyone
read the same newspaper had the same
thoughts it happened to be passionately
installing us on out of the moment when
for Jews to be Stalinist in the middle
of a big annex bidding for when they
knew that the guy
was the center of it was being framed
that's pretty extreme and in that kind
of environment I know I wouldn't have
survived
last
what would you propose is the best
method to bring about lasting change in
the shortest time possible with respect
to the israeli-palestinian situation
I mean what's been the barrier there's
everyone you know you listen to John
Kerry Obama everyone else they said look
everyone knows what the solution is and
basically that's correct there's been on
international consensus for 40 years on
what the short term what can be done
right now to overcome the immediate
problems in fact that proposal came to
the United Nations in a resolution in
January 1976 that you know that by the
Syria Egypt and Jordan brought a
resolution to the Security Council
calling for two states on the
internationally recognized borders a
green line with guarantees for the
sovereignty of each state and its right
to exist within secure and recognized
borders that's basically it the wording
of you would
- was vetoed by the United States the
veto means it's out of history so you're
not gonna find any reference to it
something I write in it but you find
virtually no reference to it the USB to
the same resolution in 1980 under Carter
from then on the US has been blocking
every effort to reach this settlement
that continues to the present the most
recent u.s. veto was February 2011 when
Obama vetoed a resolution calling for
the implementation of official US policy
namely stop of cell expansion settlement
expansions not all that significant
since the settlements problem but this
was calling for an end to settlement
expansion u.s. official policy Mojave to
and say take the gap leaders the Gaza
attack right in the midst of the Gaza
attack the world was very critical not
Obama he was critical of the the Rockets
and state road right but that reaches
American opinion entirely this I
mentioned I think before this article on
the sinigang take a look at it it's an
interesting article is about the
difficulty of talking about Israel
that's an interesting phrasing that says
this became particularly difficult
during the Hamas siege of Israel
imagine that phrase appearing anywhere
in the war right
the Hamas siege of Israel but in the new
york times it appears and they'll even
notice it because you know the
brainwashing of the american population
reflecting us policy which is pretty
constant under is extraordinary and
that's the problem until the US policy
changes israel is not going to change
its policies why should they but how do
you reverse the US policies and how do
you inform the american public i do to
exactly the way it's happening that
article in effect indicates by now
there's enough dissonance even in the
fairly religious you know not all that
religious but observant Jewish community
the partisans mega enough distance
either there with the rabbi scampering
of the issue and the broader community
much more so picks a colleges i mean
i've been talking about these issues for
fifty year right
I literally staff police protection
right here that MIT they had to have a
police protection the police would not
permit me to walk to my car without
protection because of the things they
picked up about assassination of Dennis
and so on that meetings were broken up
right here at MIT it was a lot worse at
other places Hank that was until maybe
ten years ago well now it is so change
the Palestinian solidarity is one of the
biggest issues on campus is huge
audiences can't get a hospital question
just a radical thing and it's seeping
into the general community it's a big
job
said we're done quickly well you know
there's nothing I never be done quickly
but efforts to try to break the
ideological fanaticism that allows the
New York Times to break blandly about
from us a siege of Israel the efforts
the brief that can't be carried out on
and are being carried out well if the
government has its own reasons for
supporting Israel nothing to do with us
but and they'll keep those reasons but
even a totalitarian state can't
disregard public opinion entirely semi
democratic state like this it's harder
disregarded and I think that's the
virtual point until American opinion
changes enough to compel the US
government to join the world not just on
this issue but this is one until that
happens I don't think is realized any
reason to change his policies I mean
they attack Gaza they start running out
of weapons the u.s. provides the more
weapons right and interestingly notice
where those weapons came from they were
pre-positioned in Israel for the use by
the US Army they're there for the US
army to use because the US regards
Israel as an offshore military base well
that's the reason for the relationship
but then in the midst of the attack on
Gaza when the arms ran low Obama he said
he didn't do it but the Obama
administration transferred weapons over
to continue the attack but this happened
during test led as well well it's big
attack or in the middle of cast led the
US was sending a shipment of arms to
Israel it had to go through Greece and
the Greek workers from the shipyard in
the court refused to send it on well
that's but the US was trying to rearm
them in the middle of the attack now
there was an effort at the UN to call
for a ceasefire and he was blocked it
did again this time that's normal
well why should Israel change its
policies as long as the world's only
superpower which is a rogue superpower
that's a fortune Glenn Greenwald's book
he put it Glenn Greenwald you're he's an
every oppresses state views mass
surveillance is one of its most critical
instruments of control I know you are as
long imposed control and monitoring and
surveillance of its citizens private of
the revolution through sabab now through
the Islamic Republic in America we now
learned that the NSA surveillance and
monitors everything we do from our
telephone calls to text messages to our
emails to this discussion so this
discussion anything you have it anything
electronic yeah so my question is why is
it that US citizens reserve not just US
citizens but people in general make a
distinction between the surveillance in
America and the Association of America
being a democratic state which is
criticism of you on what you want has
been doing the same exact thing that the
Americans are now implementing it's like
ask me why suppose I ran invaded Israel
that Weaver Syria invaded
well you know what the reaction would be
what's the reaction when the u.s. invade
Iraq nothing nothing I mean you get
people like Obama who was considered a
courageous critic because he said it's
not going to work
he said it's stupid that's like Nazi
generals who opposed the second front
because they thought they would have not
go Finland first that Duty phrase them
that's Obama but why can't you have a
recognition in the United States even
when we carry out let's call the supreme
international crime in the nuremberg
judgment supreme international crime is
aggression goes on to say the supreme
international crime differing from other
war crimes because it includes it
encompasses all of the evil that follows
meaning isis bank which is part of the
evil that follows yeah that's the reason
why Nazi war criminals were hanged does
anybody say Bush and Cheney and Rumsfeld
or DNA or even that they did it that
most you can say is they made a mistake
you know they're so far they lied or
something like that so why not ask that
the point is this is a very great watch
society deeply indoctrinated Society you
see it all over the media you see in the
universities you see it in scholarship
the United States is simply not treated
like
States we are separate we're different
normal standards don't apply to us
this is absolutely not unique to the
United States every powerful state in
history has been like this so sure that
the United States is like it the United
States has a history which has been very
harmful to it it's like what later than
said about Israel within 67 liquids we
mentioned warned the Israelis that
they're going to become to do Nazis
they're going to be coming on seas
because that's the dynamics of victory
the u.s. is an unusual Society it has
gone through its entire history
defeating others never loses anything
the the reason it's kind of interesting
that 9/11 was considered so shocking
because it was the first time since
eighteen since the war of 1812 that
anyone that they've never been an attack
on US national territory yet already
other country like maybe you know it's
the one in the South Pacific somewhere
on an island but it's nothing like that
and a river of continual destruction of
others
is very harmful to the national
character I mean the country after all
was founded on genocide extermination of
the indigenous population and slavery
which were they never ended right we're
seeing the reserves of it right today
those are huge crimes so you might face
them so I think you just mentioned - -
yada
the irony of using the term siege to
apply what Israel is undergoing and it's
the same way Israel refers to this as a
defensive war when they're occupying the
country such a interesting rhetorical
tool it's almost what more wealth term
was thinks what was it the double think
okay but let me give you the undersigned
so you didn't find any aggressive war
history that wasn't justified as content
right so it takes a Hitler's invasion of
Poland Hitler - the greatest speeches
it was defending Germany from the wicked
terror of the Pope the wild terror of
the poles what could he do the wild
terror of the poles was a tactic German
so but my question is that how much did
it because I try I try opening books of
logic and they have this impenetrable
math for me I'm not a mathematician by
any by any measure but logic at its core
is incredibly simple right so I always
wondered to what degree the people
speaking out and using rhetorical tools
in such strange ways are actually making
these significant errors in logic that
are not aware of and if we're if we're
actually conscious of how how many of
our statements and observations are
basically know what was written with
that so was Hitler conscious that he
wasn't defending Germany
well Tara the polls was he conscious
that he when he said he's defending
Germany against the Jewish conspirators
both having conspiracy to destroy the
white race was he conscious of it well I
doubt it and in fact we even have
evidence for that I said I wrote about
this years ago a little bit back in the
1960s the RAND Corporation you know
connected the government released some
very interesting materials the Japanese
counterinsurgency literature records of
Japanese counterinsurgency in the 30s
and it's they're talking to each other
you know it's not propaganda but they
were counting at the most horrifying
massacres and torture and destruction
slaughter but you read the rhetoric
fairness it's no gold it brings tears to
your eyes they're trying to bring a
earthly paradise to the people of China
who are being attacked by the Chinese
bandits and they have to defend the
people of China by massacring a couple
of thousand people in that game but
they're obviously mented they were only
talking to each other if they could have
meant that that why can't the Americans
are Nazis in fact that sometimes I think
it's probably conscious like in 1947
there was a decision to change the name
of what we call the Pentagon it was the
War Department throughout all of
American history that 1947 became the
Defense Department as soon as you saw
that you knew from now on the United
States is never gonna be involved in the
tanks apart once you change the Defense
Department's of war departments that
much must have been
good miss the same edition you know it's
Israeli Defense Forces
okay so Israeli Defense Forces but in
every country that even Nazi Germany was
engaged of Defense great thanks for your
time thank you I think so sir create
some photos with you sure
