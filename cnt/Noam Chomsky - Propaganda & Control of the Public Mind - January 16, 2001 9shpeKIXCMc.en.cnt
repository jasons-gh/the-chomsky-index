it's it should be understood to be a
real war and it's not a new war it's an
old war furthermore it's a perfectly
conscious war everywhere but
specifically in the United States where
there happens to be a very free country
but it happens to have a highly class
conscious business class and always has
and it's very free and open so you have
a lot of information about it they talk
you have their records and they have
long seen themselves as fighting a
bitter class war except they don't want
anybody else to know about it
occasionally someone else gets the news
rather famous case which I'm sure you
know was Doug Fraser about 20 years ago
1978 I think when he pulled out of the
labor-management council and condemned
business leaders for words were roughly
like this for having decided to fight a
one-sided class war against working
people the poor the unemployed
minorities even members of the middle
class and for having torn up the fragile
social compact that had been achieved
during periods of growth and prosperity
in fact had been achieved primarily oh
he didn't say this primarily through
rather militant struggle very militant
struggle under harsh conditions back in
the 1930s now the only thing wrong with
his statement is that it was way too
late in fact that war that he's talking
about was initiated as soon as the
fragile social compact was established
back in the 1930s and very openly
there's no if you want that's you don't
have to go to secret records to find out
about it nor do you have to have been at
the wrong end of the clubs when the
strikes were broken up in the late 30s
to know about it it was completely
public the reason it's not well-known is
because neither the educational system
no
or scholarships like Harvard and so on
pay any attention to it it's not a topic
that study so there's no doubt that one
of the major issues of 20th century
history surely in the United States
is corporate propaganda that's a huge
industry in fact it it extends over the
obviously the commercial media but the
the whole range of systems that reach
the public the entertainment industry
television a good bit of what peers in
the schools a lot of what appears
straight out in the newspapers and so on
huge amount of that comes straight out
of the public relations industry which
was established in this country early in
the century and sort of developed mainly
in the 20s and on and has become an
enormous industry it's now spreading
over the rest of the world but it's
primarily here and its goal from the
beginning perfectly openly and
consciously was to control the public
mind as they put it and the reason was
that the public mind was seen as the
greatest threat to corporations
that's from early in the century
business power was strong but it's a
very free country by comparative
standards and it's hard to call on state
violence not impossible but hard to call
upon state violence to crush people's
efforts to achieve freedom and rights
and justice so therefore it was
recognized early on that it's going to
be necessary to control people's minds I
should say that's not a new insight
either you know you can read it and
David Hume and the Enlightenment where
it was already recognized and in fact
you back the earliest stirrings of
democratic revolutions in England in the
17th century and there already was
concerned that we're not going to be
able to control people by force and we
therefore have to control them by other
means controlling what they think what
they feel their attitudes their
attitudes toward one another I mean all
sorts of mechanisms of control are going
to have to be devised which will replace
the efficient use of force and violence
that was a
to a much greater extent earlier on and
as has been fortunately declining you
know not uniformly but often declining
through the years particularly here
leading to the need for other methods of
control you don't have to move very far
from the Cambridge a leak to learn about
it the major the leading figure of the
public relations industry is a highly
regarded Cambridge liberal Roosevelt
Kennedy liberal died recently Edward
Bernays who wrote the standard manual of
the public relations industry back in
the 1920s which is very much worth
reading remember I'm not talking about
the right wing here this is way at the
left liberal end of American politics
his book is called on propaganda or
maybe just propaganda I should mention
that terminology changed during the
Second World War
prior to the Second World War the term
propaganda was used quite openly and
freely for controlling the public mind
it got bad connotations during the
second world war because of not Hitler
and that sort of thing so the term was
dropped and now there's other terms used
but if you read the literature in the
social sciences and the public relations
industry and so on back in the say 20s
and the 30s they describe what they're
doing as propaganda this manual is for
the rising public relations industry and
he opens by pointing out that the
conscious manipulation of the organized
habits and opinions of the masses is the
central is the essential feature of a
democratic society it's the essence of
democracy as he later pointed out and he
said we have the means to carry this out
now he said we have the means to
regiment people's minds as efficiently
as armies regiment their bodies and we
must do this first of all that's the
essential feature of democracy but also
sort of footnote it's the way to
maintain
power structures and authority
structures and wealth and so on roughly
the way it is it's worth remembering
something else that they usually don't
teach you very much about in school and
that is if you back to the origins of
American society it was founded on the
principle that was stated very
explicitly by the leading framer James
Madison at the constitutional
conventions that the as he put it the
primary responsibility of government is
to protect the minority of the opulent
against the majority I and Madison
recognized his smartguy that this was
going to be a serious problem if a
democratic system were established it
was going to if people had the right to
vote he used England as his model
England was the model for democracy in
those days right it's like talking 1780s
and he pointed out in the debates on the
Constitutional Convention something
which everybody got to read in third
grade in a free society I mean this is
the origins of our society you know he
pointed out that in England if they had
the right to vote which fortunately they
didn't he said pretty soon you would
find people calling for redistribution
of property and for a tax on property
rights for what nowadays we call
agrarian reform was mostly an
agricultural society he didn't use the
term agrarian reform but the same thing
he said people will start calling for
agrarian reform obviously that's
intolerable and we have to protect our
own society against that kind of
injustice by protected by ensuring that
the rights of property prevail he
recognized that he said its problem now
he was already concerned in the 1780s by
what he called symptoms of a leveling
spirit that is people are trying to you
know feel the property oughta more
equitably distributed that's a danger
but he said that the danger is going to
become much more severe over time as
more and more people are marginalized
and dispossessed
and secretly yearn for a more equal
distribution of life's blessings now if
those people get the vote we're going to
be in trouble because it's gonna be hard
to protect the minority the opulent
against the majority which is what
governments all about and he therefore
designed the constitutional system which
was intended to prevent that danger the
system the way he's set it up he and the
other framers but it was virtually
unanimous and there's virtually no
disagreement about this the the one
person who might have disagreed
Jefferson was not part of any of this
stuff the he the constitutional system
as he designed it was supposed to put
power in the hands of the wealthy who
are the more capable set of men I'm
quoting and power must reside in the
hands of the wealthy the more capable
set of men with the general population
fragmented factionalized
dispersed you know in conflict and so on
and so forth well this is like we're not
1780s ok it's in a pretty stable system
and as it's been harder as the franchise
has increased so over time more and more
people did get the right to vote and
that just raised the danger
furthermore the the power of the state
to coerce by violence but this and that
includes the power of private power like
the power of say Carnegie to hire
bankers and so on as that has declined
the need to resort to these other method
measures of factional ization instilling
hatred marginalizing people straight
propaganda and so on that's increased
and very consciously so by the time you
get to the 1920s where I started from
it's recognized that huge resources must
go into the conscious manipulation of
the organized habits and opinions of the
masses now we have to regiment them
their minds as well as an army regiments
their bodies and we have the methods for
it and
methods are advertising entertainment
straight propaganda in the media schools
so on and so forth the 20s was an
important period in this regard it looks
as if labor is under attack now but
remember in the 20s it had been smashed
the major American historian of labor
historian David Montgomery has a book
which you probably know or should if you
don't call the halt the fall of house of
labor very you know sort standards
important book on history of the labor
movement it ends in the 1920s because
that's when the house of labor had
fallen and after with a lot of violence
in that case state violence Wilson's Red
Scare the leading labor leader was in
jail Eugene Debs were the New York Times
had said years ago he ought to be sent
and so on it was there had been a big
strike wave in the during the at the end
of the First World War
smashed labor movement destroyed the
whole thing wiped out as Montgomery
points out at the end of his book labor
had been virtually destroyed working
people had to privatize their lives and
aspirations they sort of work out
survival strategies for themselves not
with others because the modes of
cooperation and common struggle had been
eliminated and they did it he ends up by
saying you know in a most undemocratic
America which is true it was a highly
undemocratic country using a combination
of modes of violence and coercion and
repression and increasingly propaganda
to prevent the dangers that Madison was
worrying about you know almost two
hundred years earlier that more and more
people would secretly sigh for a better
better access to life's blessings and
might even do something about it if they
had a functioning democracy which
therefore couldn't be permitted
I should just comment in fairness to
James Madison that this these remarks
are not quite correct the reason was
that Madison was pre-capitalist
he's like just about everybody
you know Adam Smith you know all the
great figures from the Enlightenment
they're mostly pre-capitalist and very
anti-capitalist in conception you know
you can't say they're anti-capitalist
because there was no modern industrial
capitalism around for them to have an
opinion about and this is a matter of
interpretation you know not how you read
text so you can read them a lot of
different ways but the way I read them
they were very anti-capitalist that
includes Adam Smith and I think you can
demonstrate that right but certainly
Madison was he believed that when he put
power in the hands of the wealthy class
of men you know the more capable set of
men the wealthy of the country that they
were going to be as he put it
enlightened Statesman and benevolent
philosophers who would devote themselves
to the welfare of all okay that's a very
pre-capitalist conception you know that
once you give power to the hands of the
rich they're just gonna be benevolent
philosophers and they're gonna devote
themselves you know every minute of
their day to the welfare of everyone
else I mean it's like what corporate
executives tell you you know they're
sort of understand you have to say that
but by now yeah nobody I suppose nobody
believes except the people who read
these you know watch these movies which
show you how it worked in those days
Madison really believed it and he very
quickly discovered that it wasn't true
within a few years but listen I think
1792 he was already very upset about the
fate of this Democratic experiment which
he thought was failing he condemned what
he called the daring depravity of the
times as the business leaders who have
now been given power used that power he
said to become the tools and tyrants of
government they overwhelm government
with their powers and combinations and
they're bribed by its largesses and
they're just serving self-interest you
know not the interest of the general
public and he thought that was
deplorable and the so on but that's
because in the end he perceived the way
this the system that he had designed was
actually functioning
that description you know rhetoric is
kind of nice some people don't use fancy
rhetoric like that today but it's a
perfect description of today what's
called the industrial capitalist system
today is in fact one in which private
power is the tool and tyrant of
government overwhelms it by it's
combinations it's bribed by its
largesses that's a pretty good
description of 1997 with all the changes
that have taken place since 1792 there's
a good deal of stability to all this
including the commitment to the
principle that the primary goal of
government is to protect the minority
the opulence from the majority read
yesterday's budget proposal carefully
and you'll get a good example of how
that commitment plays itself out and the
increasingly significant idea increase
overwhelmingly significant idea
particularly among liberals you know
like saber knows that it is necessary to
control people's minds because there are
too much of a danger the end we as one
of the leading take a look at say the
encyclopedia of social sciences in big
encyclopedia in 1933 so this is still
pretty second world war there's an
entrance act as an entry on propaganda
remember propaganda was a usable term
and the entry on propaganda is written
by a very distinguished political
scientist liberal political scientist
Harold Lasswell one of the founders of
modern political science in fact
communications and so on and it's worth
reading the pager to you know your rocks
it out and read it he says these are
paraphrases but they're pretty close to
quotes the he says that we must not
succumb to democratic dogmatism 'he's
about people being the best judges of
their own interests they are not you
know we're the best judges of their
interests we smart guys and we must
therefore ensure that those idiots out
there don't get into trouble you know by
actually using their theoretical right
to vote to interfere where they don't
belong like in the public arena so we
got to keep them out of the public
arenas
now and make sure that it's just a smart
guys who are in there now it's for their
good of course it's kind of like you
don't let you know your three-year-old
my case grandchild
run across the street you know because
she may want to run across the street
but beyond improperly or have that
choice and the same is true about the
masses they have to be controlled they
have to be controlled at the workplace
they have to be kept out of the
political arena they're not going to
understand the need to protect the
minority the aqualen against the
majority they're going to have all these
strange leveling impulses and they're
going to do all kind of things which
will you know mess the world up and all
sorts of horrible ways so for their
benefit we have to regiment their minds
the way in army regiments their bodies
ensure that they're under control make
it very clear that they don't
participate in workplace management and
certainly not in the political arena
they're to be outside somewhere and the
dedication with it with which this task
has been pursued is pretty awesome
I if you I mean just to take a right
after the fall of the house of Labor in
the 1920s when American labor really was
smashed and people were privatized and
tried to accommodate individually to a
most undemocratic America as Montgomery
and others have pointed out at that was
a time when there was great sort of you
know Oh about the end of history and the
taupey of the Masters and it's all over
you know that's good guys at one
everybody else's at our feet kind of
like some of the stuff you read today
all right and it's sort of looked like
that you know it's pretty much looked
that way well a few years later is you
know the whole thing collapsed and there
was militant working class struggle and
all sorts of other popular activism and
there had to be an accommodation it'd be
some kind of accommodation to the to
these unwashed masses who were getting
out of line you know sit-down strikes
and all sorts of things and there was
indeed there was this fragile social
compact that
Doug Fraser referred to was indeed
established when I wasn't in a gift you
know it was won by struggle and the
meaning the labor laws and the limited
social system in fact American workers
back in the 1930s began to get the
rights that had been standard long
before even in much more brutal
societies you read the right-wing
British press over the say early part of
this century they can't believe how bad
American workers are treated you know
the same was true of visitors from
Australia and so on by the 1930s the US
was sort of brought into the more or
less the mainstream of industrial
society on these matters to a limited
extent in fact but to some extent and
that caused hysteria among the masters
so you read the business press by 1936
or 37 again these are things which in a
really free society everybody would
study in elementary school because
they're really important that these give
the real framework of the society in my
view the they were talking about the
hazard facing industrialists and the
rising political power of the masses and
how we must do something to save
ourselves or our way of life will be
gone and we don't have a lot of time to
do it
they started right away by the late 30s
there was a big anti labor campaign that
had built up its with new techniques you
know there was still use of force but it
was understood that that's not going to
work the way it did so there was a shift
to more propaganda community Oregon the
main idea it's called a Johnston the
Mohawk Valley formula I guess said what
was going something like that yeah
Mohawk Valley formula was designed by a
lot of public relations hotshots around
the 3637 at the time of some of the
steel strikes to have a new what they
called scientific methods of strike
breaking we don't just come in you know
with clubs and shoot people and smash
their heads and that sort of thing we do
it the scientific way because the old
way doesn't work anymore and the
scientific methods of strikebreaking
were in fact drawn from the public
relations ideas of the kind of the day
talked about the main idea was to
mobilize the community against the
strikers and the union activists to
present a picture which is by now so
standard that you can hardly turn on the
tube without seeing it because it's just
poured out and you know like streams
ever since then the basic idea is to
present a picture of the world that
looks kinda like this there's there's us
you know kind of big happy family in the
community the you know the honest
workman going off every morning with his
lunch box his loyal wife who's making
the meals and taking care of the kids
the hard-working executive who's toiling
day and night and the interests of you
know his workers in the community the
friendly banker who's running around
looking for people to lend money to and
so on and so forth that's us you know
and we're all in harmony harmony was a
big word we're in harmony we're all
together it's Americanism you might take
a look at that word Americanism it's an
unusual term it's the kind of term that
you only find in totalitarian societies
as far as I know so like in the Soviet
Union anti-soviet ism was considered the
gravest of all crimes you know and the
Brazilian generals had some concept like
that and he Brazilian but try say
publishing a book on anti Italian ISM
and see what happens in the streets of
Rome or Milan and people won't even
bother laughing so ludicrous idea the
idea of Italian ISM or you know Norway
ism or something like that or it's just
the objects of ridicule and societies
that have some kind of residue of a
democratic culture inside people's heads
I don't mean in the formal system but in
totalitarian societies it is used and as
far as I know the United States is the
only free society that has such a
concept maybe there's another
if it you might try it in places you
know but anyhow Americanism is an anti
Americanism and unamerican ISM and so on
these are concepts which go along with
harmony and getting rid of those
outsiders and all that kind of stuff
another part is simply to induce hatred
hatred and fear among people so it's a
diverse society you know you go to
Europe most places are pretty uniform
this is a very diverse society so it's
easy for propagandists it's pretty easy
to get people that you know hate the guy
next door because looks a little
different there one thing or another and
huge campaigns go on to instigate
divisions among people I don't have to
tell you about this it's all so familiar
you go on but but these are very natural
techniques of social control if you
can't control people by force you have
to control their minds you have to
control their attitudes yeah exactly
like they say well going back to the
Mohawk Valley formula the idea was to
move into a community flood it with
where there's a strike going on flood it
with propaganda you know take over the
media the churches the schools I've been
everywhere else pour in this propaganda
about harmony and so on the way I
described it and then there's those bad
guys out there we're trying to disrupt
our harmonious lives you know like that
union organizer is probably a communist
and anarchist anyway and probably
unamerican then he's trying to you know
destroy all these wonderful things we
have and we got a band together and kick
him out you know we have to defend their
way of life against this a lot of
religion gets thrown in remember that
the United States an extremely
fundamentalist country I mean you look
comparatively comparative statistics it
usually religious fundamentalism
declines as industrialization goes up
close correlation the United States is
off the chart you know it ranks with
devastated peasant societies it's
probably more fundamentalist than a
grant there's all why this is so is I
don't know but I'm in fact a complicated
question but one factor is that it was
certainly consciously fomented by
business leaders that goes way back to
the 19th century
when they were supporting their favored
I'm een john d rockefeller favorite
evangelist was a poured a lot of money
into was some guy who said that people
ought to have more enlightened ideas
than labor agitation that was one of his
famous phrases and the more enlightened
ideas are you know go to church and
listen to orders and you know do what
they tell you and shut up you know
that's the more enlightened ideas and
it's a really interesting case because
the Mohawk Valley was the model that was
later used for strike breaking and
destruction of the labor movement in the
post-war period so it's quite
interesting to see what happened right
there it's only out know any literature
on this do you yes these are untouchable
topics you know and you can almost say
that anything that's important you know
it's gonna matter for people's lives
it's gotta be sort of off the agenda and
it sort of makes sense you don't want
people to know about it like you don't
want people to know the wrong kind of
thing if that makes sense you know it's
like it's not a conspiracy or anything
it's just common sense if you have a
certain degree of power and authority
and privilege you just don't want people
to know things that might be harmful to
them because they're really like
children remember and we're the ones who
have to make the decisions for them
there's an enormous amount of money and
effort goes into this it's not the only
thing but any means there's a lot of
other reasons why the United States is
so unusual in this respect but this is
one of them and it's used I mean whether
that's the source or not it's certainly
used you know always another technique
of trying to create the marginalization
of people the removing people from the
actual social and political struggles
that might make their lives better
you know maybe they and to keep them
from working with one another by
dividing them up in all sorts of ways
and in a myriad techniques you know find
the fashion to keep the hated masses
with out of the public arena where they
don't belong and certainly out of
anything having to do with control of
the economic system where it's
unthinkable that they should have a role
that's got to be in the hands of private
tyrannies that's unquestionable
where the united states has acted
internationally it's the same way no
yeah you look at the trail of
intervention it's almost always the same
not just third world countries for
example like I just came back from Italy
okay you may not know this but Italy was
the target of the major CIA activities
since its origins the internal record
runs dry around the mid seventies so
don't know can't say after that but from
the origin of the CIA in 1947 up to at
least the mid 70s
Italy seems to have been targeted more
than any other country in an effort to
undermine Italian democracy Italy was
regarded as sort of a third semi third
world country had a very strong labor
movement and when the American army in
fact the American British Army's what
they did what they called liberating
Italy and 1943-44
they were appalled to discover that
northern Italy had been liberated by the
resistance which had established
functioning society with very strong
labor control the resistance was mostly
labor and peasant based they held off
the Germans that liberated most of the
place they had instituted labor man
worker management in factories they had
thrown out what were called what these
Americans and British they had they were
protecting workers but they call you I'm
now speaking for the terminology of the
u.s. British documents they were keeping
useless workers and throwing out
arbitrarily dismissing owners and bosses
and that's of course intolerable and the
system was functioning I further where
they were focusing on unemployment which
was recognized was Italy's major problem
but that's their problem not our problem
our problem is to restore the
traditional structure which meant
traditional hierarchies actually it
meant restoring fascist structures and
fascist collaborators and so on and our
big effort was made to do that and it
was did not entirely successful by 1948
when the first election took place it
looked as if
labor based forces would probably win
and a huge effort went into trying to
ensure that that wouldn't happen by
withholding food Italy was starving by
restoring the police - fascist control
by all sorts of threats and manipulation
great big operation and the first major
CIA operation among others and they took
it really seriously again something you
would learn in a free society is this
thing called the National Security
Council you know which the main planning
outfit which publishes them doesn't
publish but it produces documents
top-level planning documents which are
among not the only important ones but
among the most important ones they tend
to get released maybe 35 years later so
you can look back at them so we have
them now from the late 40s and the first
one NS C 1 1947 is devoted to Italy and
it calls for it says you know we're
gonna try all these measures to ensure
that Italy doesn't have a free
democratic government which would have
don't say it this way but what amounts
to that which in which there'd be a big
role for the organized working class in
Italy but and they say but if this
doesn't work you know if the Communists
as they call them which means in fact a
lot of them working on meanness but if
the communist comes power through a
legal vote through a legal election then
the United States is going to declare a
national emergency and is going to
support military activities inside Italy
to overthrow the democratically elected
government that's how seriously they
took it back in 1947 they also knew
exactly why the Communists were powerful
and you read it in the records
extensively because they were honest
because they were supporting
working-class interests it's true that
they were collaborationists they weren't
trying to separate Italy from the
Western alliance or anything but they
were defending working class interests
and people supported them and I had a
mass based working class party there
were plenty of others besides communist
but they had to be prevented either by
coercion like say withholding food and
violence or if that didn't work by
direct intervention military
intervention that was taken very
seriously and in fact
goes up to the prison you know how was
it the wealthy chin will pull the wool
over the eyes of the American worker by
controlling the power and government and
using it against the working public use
it against everything well take right
now let's say as an example there's a
couple days ago I don't know if your
father I put myself through the pain of
reading the New York Times every day for
some masochistic reason which I won't
try to explain but the they've got a you
know their Big Chief correspondence or
the main thinker is a guy named Thomas
Friedman who had an article three or
four days ago in which he big think
piece in which he said well he said the
the Cold War is over so you know the
breakdown isn't hawks and doves anymore
we have to have some new breakdown and
he said the new breakdown he says
there's two one is between
integrationists and was the other term I
forget you know anti integration it's
that means people are in favor of more
globalization and what they call free
trade which isn't free trade and all
that kind of stuff and people who want
to slow it down or end it that's one
break and the other is between people
who were in favor of a safety net and
those who think that everybody oughta
you know be on your own and get what you
can okay so those are the two ways
people break up and I can see four
possible types of people right two of
them he sort of dismisses as lunatics so
there's this apathy stays and Ross Perot
they fit into two of those boxes the
other two boxes are sort of saying
people Clinton and Gingrich and I'll put
aside Gingrich Clinton but Gingrich and
just gets right to your point I think
Gingrich is put in the corner that says
integrationist and that will take the
hindmost you know everybody for
themselves
well that's testable no it's testable
that that's Gingrich is positioned for
example on the question of whether
Gingrich is an integrationist like in
favor of free trade we can ask how he
reacted when the Reagan administration
instituted the greatest wave of
protectionism since the 1930s
that's just straight protectionism
alongside of huge increase in public
subsidies to private power to industry
along with say the biggest
nationalization in American history to
take over of continental Illinois Bank
and so on and so forth that's all
radically an integrationist okay hon
newt gingrich react we can ask that
question answer is he thought it's great
you know uh what about the safety net
story
I mean Gingrich is in favor of people
sort of being out there on their own you
know a rugged entrepreneurs and so on I
mean you can check that too he
represents the county district Cobb
County Georgia which happens to be that
and he happens to hold the national
championship in bringing federal
subsidies to his rich constituents to be
precise among suburban counties in the
United States Cobb County ranks third in
federal subsidies ranks right after
Arlington Virginia which is part of the
federal government so of course they get
a lot of federal subsidies like the
Pentagon's there and so on and Brevard
County Florida which is the home of the
Space Center so that's another part of
the federal government but if you move
outside the federal government itself
Gingrich's District is number one you
know they get more federal subsidies
than anybody the biggest employer in
Cobb County is locking which is a
publicly subsidized private profit
corporation they don't you know I mean
they sell plant commercial planes but
those are just as everyone knows they're
just you know kind of they use military
technology is the way the system is
designed technology is developed under
the guise of the military and then hand
it over to private power when when it
works that's true of everything
airplanes computers the internet you
name it and Cobb County is right center
this well he's in favor of being you
know you all out on your own
fighting in this harsh world ridiculous
he's the biggest welfare freak in the
country that's literally true except
that he wants the welfare to go to very
rich people notice this is not what's
called corporate welfare their corporate
wealth what they call corporate welfare
which also never gets touched to some
different category completely that's
like giving a special you know shot in
the arm to some particular corporation
this is not quite different this is the
way in which our economy works the way
our economy works take any done just
about any dynamic sector of it you know
at least but I know and I've studied and
you find that it's based on massive
public subsidy and privatization of
profit public pays the costs and takes
the risks and private systems make the
profit if there isn't any Cobb County is
just an extreme example of this now you
asked how come people are deluded well
how often do you read this you know I
mean like these aren't particularly
subtle facts I mean these are like
glaringly obvious facts but okay because
the reason is because people like Thomas
Friedman and everyone else in the
business knows you're not supposed to
write about these things I mean I don't
know I'm not claiming he thinks about it
you know in fact the people who write
about it are probably more deeply
propagandized that even than the people
they're talking to you know you cannot
be a good propagandist unless it's in
your bones
I mean it's extremely hard to lie I
think we all know that from personal
experience
you know it's hard the lie to people
everyone of us lies to people all the
time unless we're some kind of crazy
angels but the way we do it if you I'm
sure you know this is you first convince
yourself that what you're saying is true
you know like your you know your
eight-year-old you're an eight-year-old
kid and you steal a toy from your
brother you know and your mother comes
in and yells at you you don't say well
you know I wanted to do it and he had it
so you know I took it because I'm
stronger than him what you say is it
really wasn't his and besides he'd taken
a toy of mine and anyway I needed
he did so it was right for me to take
okay you know I'm if people that haven't
had that experience there are some other
species I think but that kind of
experience goes all the way up to being
a hotshot journalist for the New York
Times you know you don't even make it
into those circles unless you're already
so deeply overwhelmed by doctrine and
propaganda that you can't even think in
other terms and so you'll read say you
know liberal columnist in New York Times
very angrily saying when people talk
like this nobody tells me what to write
I write anything I feel like which is
absolutely true and if they didn't if
you know people with real power weren't
sure that they were going to say the
right things they wouldn't be in a
position to write anything they feel
like well how does that work you know it
starts from childhood it starts in the
in kindergarten on television
there's selection for obedience from the
very first moment you just think about
I'm guessing maybe I'm wrong so you tell
me I'm wrong but at least when I think
about my own school experience or any
other school experience I know about
there was selection for obedience I mean
I ended up going to fancy colleges like
this place and the way I did it was I
know exactly how I did it by shutting up
you know like if I thought that the high
school teacher was a horse's ass which I
did most of the time I didn't say hey
what you're saying actually sometimes I
did and got thrown out of class but I
learned not to say anything just say
okay you know I'll do the next stupid
assignment and because I know that
that's the way I get ahead and
ultimately all do this and that all
right and you know you if you're you
know whatever ability it takes to do
this kind of thing and you are
sufficiently disciplined and passive you
sort of make it through up to the higher
echelon there are people who don't I
mean I I know something like somebody on
kids just didn't and they get into
trouble they're called behavior problems
or
you know disruptive or you and stick
drugs in them or something or other
because they're just too independent you
know and people who are independent or
pain in the neck you know they disrupt
the system and then they're gonna be cut
off one way or another I can tell you
just you know at in graduate school
teaching mostly graduate school and you
read applications you can detect between
the lines when the person who's writing
a recommendation is telling you keep
away from this person they're gonna
cause you trouble
which means usually they're gonna go off
and do the wrong thing or something like
that it's it's III don't want to
exaggerate in the sciences it's somewhat
different and the reason is the sciences
simply require this kind of independence
they'll die
you know unless people are challenging
all the time and questioning so when you
look at people who are say studying
physics at MIT or something yeah it's
totally different because you just
encourage people to be challenging and
creative and so on and so forth but in
most areas you don't you you want them
to be passive and obedient and
supportive and to fit their you know to
fit some kind of niche inside a
managerial system which is top-down and
doesn't make too much of a fuss and so
on and the people who don't accept this
they're weeded out and one or another
fashion it's a tricky question I don't
mean to suggest there's an easy answer
to your question or series I don't know
it but it seems to me that an awful lot
of our whole system of the kind of
thought control by that I mean education
you know television family life all
sorts of things it's sort of geared to
supporting that kind of passivity and
institutions that break out of it as the
labor movement does they're subject to a
lot of they're crushed in so far as one
congressional I mean the labor movement
always broke out of this its picture was
always different from the very beginning
you go back to the beginnings of the
labor movement it's you know farmers
bitterly opposing the degrading and
you know oppressive modes of industrial
capitalist organization that we're being
forced on them actually one of the most
interesting books I know if you haven't
read it I urge you to is the first
modern book on labor history that I know
of
by a guy named Norman where around 1924
it was just reprinted so it's easy to
get but it's about the labor movement in
eastern Massachusetts around 1850 and 60
it's mostly quotes from the labor press
which are just fascinating it's mostly
young women from the farms what they
called factory girls like eighteen year
old kid comes in from the farms and
she's working in the mills and Lowell or
artisans and Boston you know and people
like that they they're impressed they're
very lively extensive press big in fact
you know it's like the scale of the
commercial press in those days that's
very interesting I mean it's very
eloquent very well written they took for
granted as the labor movement always has
unless it's beaten out of people's heads
that those who work in the mills ought
to own them they regarded industrial
capitalism as just another form of
slavery this is without you know no
marks no socialism you know no foreign
radicals none of that stuff it's all
just working people from their own
experience you know very literate
incidentally likely one of the things
they complained about was that their
culture was being taken away from like
an artisan in Boston if he had the extra
money would hire a boy to read to him
and that meant read classics you know
they and they regarded the they said
look the values that we fought for in
the American Revolution they're being
taken away from us we're being forced
into another kind of tyranny which we
don't want namely the tyranny of the
hierarchic industrial system and they
also opposed the what they called the
new spirit of the age this is like 1850
the new spirit of the age is gained
wealth for getting all but self over
here that one little fancier but the
same thing that is drilled and
everyone's head every day today you know
you got to gain wealth forgetting about
everybody else well they were trying to
drill it into people
in 1850 and they were resisting because
it's degrading you know it's not the way
human beings are it takes a long time to
drive normal human sentiments out of
people's heads and they keep popping up
again and in fact I think that at least
looks to me the whole history of the
labor movement is a struggle against the
new spirit of the age well that's one of
the reasons it's constantly repressed
and other independent efforts are also
constantly repressed not always
successfully like the world's a lot
better than it was 100 years ago or 50
years ago for that matter because these
struggles tend to you know they get
repressed but they leave a residue
they have successes and then they're
beaten back and then they go on from
those successes and over time it's
already gets better structures that are
based on Authority and dominance will
try to repel just normally act with
anybody even thinking about it to block
such tendencies now sometimes they think
about it like in these in the manuals of
the public relations industry they think
about it very hard but you know they're
putting out the billions of dollars a
year to control the public mind you
better think about what you're doing but
most of the time you don't think about
it you're just part of it no like you
know think about the fact that when you
go through school you're being trained
for obedience and passivity but I think
if you look back you'll probably at
least if you're like my experience will
recognize that that happened and when
you watch television let's say if you
know some sitcom you don't think well
I'm being exposed to the Mohawk Valley
formula but you are I mean that's the
picture of life that's presented day
after day after day on you know like
people of personal problems or something
like that but nothing that would bring
them together to work for some you know
to struggle against the new spirit of
the age I mean what's the last time you
saw a sitcom about that
and in fact what you what you get is
this exists you know this stuff that
flows out of the PR industry very
consciously no I mean that in that case
mostly conscious another aspect of it is
demonizing labor so a major element in
the huge public relations propaganda
after the Second World War you know was
strictly demonizing labor and the labor
movement knew that you know there was a
fairly substantial
repress even then as late as the 1950s
there were still about 800 labour
newspapers which are reaching maybe 20
or 30 million people a week you know not
commercial media but pretty substantial
and they're interesting reading too they
were struck they were trying to as they
put it provide this is just I'm not
talking about anything radical you know
it's like no left-wing press or anything
just labor newspapers you know the
conservative American labor movement
we're talking about developing antidotes
to the poisons of the kept press
commercial media who were demonizing
labor at every opportunity and trying to
undermine our achievements and glossing
over the crimes of the corporate rulers
who run the society you know stuff like
that
there's a good book on this one two of
the firt is just tells you something
about American academic life the first
study that I've ever heard of you know
in the United States on this major theme
of modern history just appeared
University of Illinois press book called
selling free enterprise by a woman named
Elizabeth phones Wolfe Fon is - Wolfe
it's kind of a political but like
shouldn't have it sorry I can see any
special point of view but the material
and it is pretty revealing it's the next
part of the story that I was going to
get to this hazard facing industrialists
you know and the rising political power
of the masses that led to the Mohawk
Valley formula and so on that terrified
the daylights out of the business
community now it was kind of put on hold
during the second world war but it took
off immediately after the Second World
War at a huge scale instantly you know
and that's what she's talking about
selling free enterprise the idea was as
they put it
remember that the United States came out
of the second world were pretty social
democratic like most of the world you
know like just looked like those Italian
workers who had to have ideas about
worker management beating either their
head by force an awful lot of people in
the United States - like maybe half
thought that there ought to be popular
control over industry in some fashion
you know this is so exotic in the United
States that the fashion was never
described but somehow but the government
could do a better
than private power things like that
there was an enormous support for social
programs you know medical programs and
so on that had to be beaten out of
people's heads and fast the leaders of
the public relations industry she quotes
a lot of them they said look we have
three to five years to save our our way
of life we have to fight and quickly win
what they called the everlasting battle
for the minds of men and indoctrinate
people with a capitalist story so fully
that they can repeat it you know on
every opportunity and on and on like
that and they weren't kidding around I
mean for example about a third of the
material in American schools elementary
schools was coming straight out of
corporate propaganda offices by the
early 50s sports leagues were taken over
the churches were taken over the
universities were attacked and it was
across the board you know major effort
to try to win the everlasting battle for
the minds of men and it's still going on
you know I mean here it's conscious now
that part of its conscious most of it is
most of the participants that's just you
know it's not in your bones
I mean you've gone through the
especially if you've been through in a
lead educational system and you know
then it's you're really deeply
indoctrinated in it so I don't how to
measure this it might but like personal
feeling is that you find more passivity
and obedience in the elite centers than
you do like you know on the streets or
in state colleges well you know Adam
Smith once you're supposed to worship
Him but not read him you know but worth
reading he once remarked somewhere that
if you find two businessmen talking to
each other they're involved in a
conspiracy against the public you know
something like that and yeah there's
something to that but you know it's not
as though I mean there you can read
descriptions like what you're saying
incidentally in the business press so
for example in the Financial Times in
London which is like the main you know
the most important business newspaper in
the world a couple of years ago they had
an article by the economics
correspondent of the BBC you know it's
all very establishment
in which he said that something like
this that what's evolving is what he
called a de-facto world government in a
new imperial age and the de facto world
government is a set of shadowy
institutions under the areas or another
there but you know what they're doing
which basically served the interests of
transnational capital and financial
institutions and he said for example the
g7 you know the seven big rich countries
meaning just their executives and their
leadership nobody else knows what
they're doing the IMF the World Bank you
know the then the GATT council now it be
the World Trade Organization and yeah
they get together and they're running in
the affect the world government I think
that's kind of a you know it's kind of a
metaphor I mean like it's not that they
get together somewhere and say okay
here's what we're going to do they do
get together but it's usually extremely
boring like if you were unfortunate
enough to have gone to this Davos
conference the other day I'm sure you
would have been bored out of your mind I
mean I can go and I didn't see the
document but but having read things like
I did I do a lot of reading of this
stuff like the trilateral commission is
one of them and they publish regular
documents I so boring I mean after after
a couple of years I stopped subscribing
you know it's so predictable and boring
and pablum and so on and so forth and
besides you can read it in foreign
affairs or the you know the organized
business page wherever you want any day
but yes they do get together and
sometimes when things get scary they
really do things so they take the
trilateral commission the one
publication of theirs which really is
interesting and worth reading this is
the Commissioner was put together by
David Rockefeller around 1973 and it's
one of the ones that people refer to and
they talk about this you know secret
nexus of rulers and so on although they
say it's mostly a bore but in 1975 the
first publication was very interesting
and I urge you to read it if you haven't
done it it's called the crisis of
democracy and it's very much in line
with the kind of stuff I was talking
about before
remember this is F this is the first
getting together after the 60s okay all
this ferment went on in the 60s which
you
women and minorities and all kind of
people are supposed to be kept in their
place we're suddenly trying to get into
the public arena and do something about
their interests and that again drove
people crazy just as as did the
working-class struggles in the 30s so
here you have a gathering of a Leeds
trilateral means United States Europe
and Japan so these are elite elements
mostly liberal on the liberal side
incidentally like if you look at the
composition it's around roughly speaking
around Carter Democrats in fact the
whole Carter Administration including
Carter himself was drawn from this group
that's roughly the complexion both in oh
in all three of the countries and they
were concerned about what they called
the crisis of democracy and it's
interesting to read what they said
because at that point they were
concerned the crisis of democracy is the
fact that normally passive and
marginalized parts of the population the
overwhelming majority are suddenly
coming trying to get into the public
arena to press their demand well you
know like if you believe the stuff they
teach you in civics classes that's
supposed to be democracy but if you're
smart enough to have made it to Harvard
you know that that's the crisis of
democracy we got to stop it and in fact
the the the American reporter you know
the guy who wrote the u.s. part of it is
a professor at Harvard shortly after he
got one of my favorite titles he was
called professor of the science of
Government at Harvard I've always liked
that one yeah yeah I think he's now a
university professor or something but
his he was he wrote the American side of
this trilateral thing but the others are
more or less the same I don't mean it
suggests he's different I think he's a
kind of like a New Deal Democrat or
something probably isn't he something
like that you know what I'm talking
about Jesse Helms okay this is the there
in fact he gave his ideal described the
good old days sort of let his hair down
a little is that in the in the good old
days he said before the crisis of
democracy
he said Truman had been this is almost a
quote Truman had been able to run the
country with the help of a few Wall
Street lawyers and fin and Sears
okay that's that alleged conspiracy
you're talking about of course he's
exaggerating you know it wasn't just
Truman and a bunch of Wall Street
lawyers infinite seers but that's the
image that would be perfect we had that
there'd be no crisis of democracy but
when you have women and blacks and young
people and old people and farmers and
all these scum trying to get into the
public arena yeah that's a problem
exactly the problem that Madison worried
about in fact so you got to somehow
marginalize them all right in this case
they were public I mean it is public in
a way I mean that is you can read it you
got to work a little to find it but and
it's worth reading but most of the stuff
is it's very boring it's like it's like
the literature of social science all
right hard work I mean you got to do it
if you feel a duty you know most of the
countries in the world have normal
bilateral relations with Cuba why is the
u.s. virtually alone in its hostility
toward Cuba what explains US policy let
me just report again some truisms that
you would read all over the front pages
of the newspapers if they if there was
any commitment to trying to tell
important and uncontroversial truths
there's nothing I'm going to say that's
in the least controversial but let me
just run let's run through the history
because it's interesting Cuba was the
first foreign policy problem for the
United States goes back to the 1820s
this is no new thing back in the 1820s
the nice guys like Thomas Jefferson and
so on who were planning to take over the
hemisphere you know saw a Cuba is the
next place to pick up okay they'd
already stolen Florida from its
inhabitants claiming to have taken it
from the Spanish but actually from its
inhabitants and their eyes were now kind
of moving toward the West but also on
Cuba that was the next prize well it was
a little problem of the British fleet
you know there was a British deterrent
just as in the 1960s there was a Soviet
deterrent and in fact the British were
the hated enemy and
days mainly because of their power they
were preventing the United States from
expanding like they prevented the United
States from conquering Canada a couple
of times which the US has been trying to
do since 1775 and may have finally
achieved in the so-called free trade
agreement but yeah Cuba was sitting
right there you know it's a valuable
place he couldn't get there cuz the
British are in the way John Quincy Adams
I guess it was suggested that we just be
patient he said it'll drop into our
hands like a ripe fruit by the laws of
political gravitation okay meaning by
the time we get stronger and the British
get weaker will things will shift around
we'll be able to take it over okay by
the end of the century that had happened
by the end of the century the British
were sort of being pushed out of the
game the United States was getting more
powerful and during something that is
sort of ludicrously missed titled the
spanish-american war the United States
intervened in Cuba primarily to prevent
it from liberating itself from Spain you
take a close look that's an
interpretation so you want to make sure
you know don't take my word for it but I
think if you look you'll find that what
happened is that the intervention in
Cuba was primarily an effort to make
sure that its liberation from Spain
didn't mean liberation and in fact Cuba
is quickly turned into an American
plantation with all kind of restrictions
on its options and you know bought up by
American agribusiness and so on and so
forth when Cuba tried any funny ideas
about moving towards independence it was
smashed down for example Franklin
Roosevelt is famous for the good
neighbor policy we don't intervene
anymore and the affairs of our neighbors
well take a look at 1934 when Cuba made
the mistake of trying to elect a sort of
I guess moderate social democrat of more
or less independent ideas as president
that's going too far
okay so out the and that's how it
continues up through 1959 okay 1959
Kaster it comes along there was a little
bit of toying with the question of
whether we can in court maintain the new
Cuba in our system or not and this is
not a new policy issue remember its back
the 1820s hasn't changed much within a
couple of months it was decided that
Castro's too big for his britches
there's no Russians incidentally he's
anti-communist you know how can a
jailing members of the Communist Party
there's no question of the Russians or
the Communists or any of this kind of
stuff by late 1959 u.s. planes are
already bombing Cuba from Florida bases
any State Department claims they didn't
know about it you know yeah sure okay
but I mean try try that if say Cuban
planes bomb the United States you know
and say well okay the Cubans didn't know
about okay so but it was happening by in
March 1960 the Eisenhower administration
made a formal decisions now it was
secret but now it's be classified so you
can find out about it they made the
formal decision to overthrow the Cuban
government and take it over
yeah that's March 1960 remember no Cold
War no Russians no communists just
independent Cubitt from that point on
March 1960 up until today Cuba has been
subjected to extensive international
terrorism economic strangulation without
an end and it's not trivial stuff just
to give you one small example this one
comes from an absolutely impeccable
source Raymond Gard Huff who's very
conservative and respected historian
right inside the CIA and the
intelligence apparatus now writes
historical work on all this stuff take a
look at his books on reflections on the
Missile Crisis which he's writing sort
of partially from the inside partly from
as a historian a little item in there
somewhere where he's at the peak of the
Missile Crisis you know before it you
know when it had sort of theoretically
been solved but it was still was not
over so like the missiles were still
there at the peak of the Missile Crisis
one of the operate when the Mongoose
teams these terrorist teams that the
Kennedy had sent into Cuba to smashed
the place up one of them which is
apparently acting out of control at the
time like
no evidence that Kennedy had ordered it
to do this but so maybe was on its own
but one of them blew up a petrochemical
plant in Cuba which according to him he
said he doesn't verify it but he says
it's alleged and he apparently takes it
seriously the 400 workers were killed
yeah
suppose Cuba blew up a factory in the
United States and 400 people were killed
I think it might make the newspaper in
fact they'd probably be nuked we nuke
them you know okay but this is us and
this is incidentally one tiny footnote
to a long history of terrorism and this
was right at the peak of the Missile
Crisis when I said for all I know Cuba
had its fingers on the missiles I don't
know that but anyway somebody did okay
now try just for those of you who want
to know about why people believe what
they do just just do a little check and
find out how much information you can
find out about this okay
I mean I've told you of it I'll save you
the trouble this is it I've repeated it
in probably 20 times and books that
nobody would dream of looking at it
reviewing and so on but that's one
little item and then it goes on to
poisoning crops and livestock and
shooting down fishing boats and
straightening hotels and you know
blowing up airplanes and all sorts of
things
meanwhile the economic strangulation
goes on okay
permanently now the only issue debated
in the United States for a long time
there was a pretense we got to do this
because of the Russians okay because you
know Cuba is a tentacle of the Russian
monster trying to strangle us I mean in
a in an intellectually free country
everybody would laugh in fact when
Kennedy once tried to get the Mexican
ambassador to join in some anti Cuban
action back in the early 60s the Mexican
ambassador actually told him you know
he'd like to do it but if he announces
it in public in Mexico that Cuba's a
threat he said 40 million Mexicans will
die laughing okay well that's and that's
basically true I mean the idea that Cuba
could be a threat even if it's owned by
the Russians I mean you know it's it's
as if I mean I'd like to try to find on
it came to think of it counterpart but
let's suppose say
that before the end of the Cold War
Russia had been carrying out massive
terrorism against Denmark and strangling
the country let's imagine it could do
that because it thread said that Denmark
was a threat well you know Denmark was
way more of a threat to Russia than Cuba
is to the United States
I mean Denmark's an advanced industrial
country it's it's a member of a hostile
military alliance you know well armed
them the Russians that said that you
wouldn't laugh it would be a sign of
their lunacy and you know maybe we got a
murdered them or something like that but
we say that all the time and that's okay
because that's us you know we're
probably indoctrinated to just to judge
how much of a Russian threat it was bear
in mind that the formal decision to
overthrow the government was taken in
march 1960 when there's no Russians okay
and it continues under the pretext of a
Russian threat as long as the Russians
were around and then what happened when
the Russians disappeared okay so
November 1989 Berlin Wall Falls no more
Russians what happened to Cuba I mean if
the story of the last 30 years that we
hear from Arthur Schlesinger and
everyone was true well we should have
welcomed Cuba with open arms
no more tentacles of the Russians that
what happen no we made the we made we
drew the noose tighter okay all of a
sudden it wasn't because the Russians
were a threat it was because we loved
democracy so much as you can easily
demonstrate by looking at what we do
around the world okay but sudden and and
if you take a look at the educated
classes take a look at the educated
classes they skip a beat from one day to
the next it's defending ourselves
against the Russian threat to loving
democracy okay with this history out in
the open
now that's a real achievement I doubt
that a totalitarian state could achieve
anything like that
anyhow up until now it's well we love
democracy so much and then the only
question is well what's the best way to
achieve democracy is it the helms-burton
Act or is it by the Canadian Prime
Minister going there you know and this
is discussed as if it was serious that's
the interesting part I mean this is
discussed as if you know it's not 40
million American Mexicans died laughing
which it ought to be
you know it's discussed as if it could
conceivably be serious I can't possibly
be serious the only question is how to
make sure that Cuba will go back into
the box in which it was supposed to be
put in like 1820 if they can force it
back there by one or another means fine
we'll accept Cuba will even call it
democracy and it's run by some brutal
murderer you know like we call Mexico a
democracy we call Colombia democracy in
fact the best democracy in the
hemisphere even has an independent
political party you know which was
allowed to function in 1985 since that
time about 3,000 of it activists have
been murdered mostly by security forces
and paramilitary forces including every
presidential candidate and most of the
mayors but you know rights there's got
to be a democracy and since we love
democracy so much we think it's fine no
but it so maybe if Cuba ends up with
democracy like that it'll be fine as
long as it follows orders and you know
there ought to be a 100 million
Americans who die laughing over this and
the fact that they're not is an
indication of the grip of the doctrinal
system which is really powerful and in
this case primarily among the more
educated sectors you know who I mean if
they don't know these things it's a
conscious decision not to know takes
work not to know these things like you
don't have to you know really explore
the battle for the minds of the masses
and the fact that it's critical to
mobilize with masks
any rights for water do you see any
solutions shorter sure I mean the
solutions that have worked all through
history I mean how did the how did
workers rights get established in the
more or less in the 1930s I mean it was
a threat there was certainly a threat
like when you know when working people
took over General Motors yeah it's no
joke people got scared yeah okay because
the next thing they'll come to their
heads is what do we need the bosses for
like maybe they'll get as smart as the
factory girls and Lowell you know 150
years ago and say look we don't need
this guys we'll run it ourselves and you
got to make sure that that doesn't
happen because that's really trouble so
yes there was a accommodation and in
fact right through history that's the
way it's worked I mean we now every you
know nowadays people who consider
themselves were less progressive that
term is supposed to mean think that they
got a pretty rotten life look at our
problems well you know plenty of
problems but it's a lot better than it
was 30 years ago 150 years ago or 100
years ago so like nowadays you're
worried about how to defend some sort of
protect some kind of medical system
worrying about that thirty years ago
there wasn't a or it takes a woman's
rights ok plenty of problems about
women's rights like you know the way
permit of actions being used to attack
people was it wasn't a problem thirty
years ago there was no right you know or
take you know issue after issue it's
just things are over time you know the
struggles take off on a higher level
than before so like the 19th you think
it looks bad for labor now have a look
at the 1920s you know the fall of the
house of labor in a most undemocratic
America when workers could do nothing
more than try to pursue individual
survival strategies and that remember
that was the period of mass
industrialization you know establishment
of the automobile industry it's like
it's not it's like not a rural country
well what you know what you do is try to
keep making things better
is it a revolution or not that's kind of
like a question of definition I mean if
it's possible I mean I think myself I
agree with those mill
hands and Massachusetts that the people
who work in the mill so to own them
generalized well alright if they're
steps toward that happening I guess you
could call it a revolution but I don't
see why it shouldn't just happen and
great public relations employ and see I
think all that stuff is totally
illegitimate I mean and that goes way
back to something much earlier why
should corporations have any rights at
all okay okay I mean that's not like
it's not in a constitution you know a
corporate rights are the result that
it's not even by legislation
I mean corporate rights were achieved
mostly through courts and lawyers and
pretty recently
you know the main decisions are early in
this century like it's not founded and
you know it's not graven in stone or
anything like that actually it's pretty
good literature on this if you're
interested the best book is by a Harvard
professor uh uh that I know guy named
Morton Horowitz who's at the law school
has a couple of books called the
transformation of American law one of
them I think goes up till like 1860 and
the other from maybe 1860 to 1960 but
the main theme of the book of the two
these two big volumes is it's
interesting reading you know it sounds
kind of dense and so on but it's you
find interesting reading the main theme
is how the legal system was reshaped to
accommodate to the needs of private
power okay all the way through that's
been the main theme of the legal system
how to modify it so that illegitimate
tyrannical Authority is given more and
more power undermining democratic
principles that's basically he didn't
say it in those words but what comes
down through and the big step you know
the major step probably was the transfer
of rights to private tyrannies which is
what corporations are early in this
century and as he points out he didn't
go into it much this he really what I
think he's right this developed out of
ideas kind of hegelian ideas about the
rights of organic entities over
individuals which are also at the roots
of Bolshevism and fascism
I should mention that that comparison is
may sound exotic now but it wasn't along
you know 60 years ago you read say
mainstream American political economists
like Robert Brady important political
economists it's kind of a blow night
back around the night early 1940s I
guess he wrote books about you know a
big business assistant power things like
that in which he points out you know
these things are basically totalitarian
and structure you know in which they are
so where they get their rights well
through courts and lawyers by playing
one state against one another
incidentally that's something worth
thinking about when you listen to this
devolution business know the point of
getting power down to the states is so
that any business even a middle sized
business can make sure that the money
goes into their pockets not in the
pockets of poor people it's trickier to
do it at the federal level so that's why
you get all this new philosophy about
you know federalism and so on not that
federalism would be bad but you know not
when you've got private tyrannies around
this establishment of private court of
private corporate power as a dramatic
example of that backer exactly what year
but like early in this century maybe
around nineteen five or something the
state of New Jersey figured it could
make a killing by getting the big
corporations to move from New York where
they always were over to New Jersey
simply by giving them a lot of gifts you
know it's kind of like when Alabama gets
investment from Germany you sort of the
taxpayers pay for it but you know
somebody makes their killing that's and
that's exactly what they did so New
Jersey gave corporations all sorts of
you know gifts essentially to move
across the river and that's why you have
so many things called you know Standard
Oil of New Jersey and that sort of thing
yeah because they moved across the
rivers they could be incorporated there
at and it's a lot cheaper for the big
power because the taxpayers of New
Jersey paid him Delaware was another
case well of course New York had to
accommodate you know because everybody
moving across the river
that's the new federalism back at the
early part of this century so that's the
and by such a mechanism public funds did
end up in big deep private pockets and
corporations gradually got rights that
they you know that are my opinion
totally illegitimate those rights can be
taken away very simply without a
revolution in fact every corporation has
a state charter I mean and they're
supposed to be there for some public
good you know well like it's it was true
maybe 200 years ago like 200 years ago
we could like establish a corporation
that would like build a bridge across
the Charles River or something okay
that's what a corporation was supposed
to be it's changed a bit over the years
by now they are huge tyrannies I mean
bigger than states involved in all kind
of strategic interactions with one
another in violation of any conceivable
princess market principle and so on and
so forth there's no reason why they
should exist
I don't think and the media it's just
part of it it's particularly harmful to
democracy when media systems are in the
hands of private tyrannies it's bad
enough if the guys who you know making
shoes is or cars that's bad enough
but when it's control over the doctrinal
system and information that's much worse
that's why I think the stuff that's
going on in telecommunications now is so
should really have a lot more attention
than it does I mean here's this huge
system you know built that public
expense I mean you guys paid for it you
know
and as usual being handed over to
private power now that it's profitable
and it's very likely I think most media
analysts with their head screwed on see
and indeed even report that it's going
to end up in the hands of a half a dozen
mega corporations internationally well
that's worse than the oligopolies that
run steel and computers because here
we're talking about a new mode of
information and communication and so on
as always built at public expense and
right now we're in the middle of it
being handed over to private power and
sadly not being reported
I mean like it's not that there's no
reporting like you've heard about the
Telecommunications Act but it wasn't
discussed as a public interest issue it
was discussed as a business issue and in
fact most of the reporting was in the
business pages this is the big
legislative achievement of last Congress
you know Telecommunications Act of 1996
I reported in the business pages and not
as a public interest issue like it's not
supposed to be a question of public
interest whether major systems of
information and interchange are handed
over as gifts to Rupert Murdoch that's
not supposed to be an issue of public
interest the only thing that was
discussed was like to give it the six
corporations or 12 you know or do you do
it this way or that way well you know
that's effective indoctrination when
these ideas when these things don't even
occur to people takes real
indoctrination but yeah I think you're
right these are this is worse than the
handing over of decision-making power to
private tyrannies because in this case
it's also handing over you know access
to the things that they're going to eat
is for control of the public mind these
systems could also be as deliberate
people Kate well
just adopted but she couldn't stop but
there's still a lot of problems yeah I'm
not sure how good the good stuff is I'd
ret I'd like to I mean I haven't the
details haven't come out yet but from
the reporting that I've heard you know
I've read maybe you know more the actual
proposals that are going to come along
are going to be granting benefits of one
kind or another to people of income
levels kind of like mine you know people
up to the level of like you know 80
hundred thousand dollars a year well you
know what that I forget the last figures
but I think the median income in the
United States is something like around
thirty some now the idea of giving rich
people special benefits so their kids
can go to school well okay who's paying
you know well the poor people are paying
so I'm not so sure it's such great stuff
when you look at it the same with other
things you know the big investment firms
Lehman Brothers in this case are now
circulating brochure those of you who
are wealthy enough must be receiving
these things you know they're
distributing brochures to their rich
customers telling them look we've taken
over the health system we've taken over
the crimp the criminal system you know
we're right now taken over the welfare
system we're in Richie there's a new way
to enrich ourselves at public expense
now not their words you know this is my
translation the way we will do it is by
setting up eeehm OHS okay educational
management organizations which will do
wonders for the educational system like
HMOs do for health care about the same
in fact namely they will be able to take
more and more money away from the system
and put it in private you know private
power meanwhile reduce shaping care so
that it mostly benefits the rich in
harms everybody else and now we can do
it to the educational system the last
big government
it's not put this way it's all put in
terms of efficiency and what nice people
we are and we're going to make
everything so better much better for
everyone like because we're just the
benefactors and so on but go through it
and that's what it is yeah I think those
are probably the new plans that will be
coming along and I would be very
cautious about the clintons proposals
look at them really carefully see to
what extent they're lending themselves
after all remember he is he is not he
has made no secrets about what he is I
mean he is and always has been a
moderate Republican candidate of the
business community he's he's never
pretended to be anything else
you know never pretended to be anything
else he is a business candidate he his
main influence on the Democratic Party
was to move it over to the Republican
side with the Democratic Leadership
Council he never excellent it's not like
a secret or anything he said it you know
I made it very clear his record in
Arkansas was like that his influence in
the national government was like that so
whatever the Democratic Party may have
been which you can sort of debate it's
now like if you can find a difference
between clock Dole and Clinton I'd like
to know what it was you know I mean a
policy difference
they're both moderate Republicans
instantly the business press is very
well aware of this I mean it's take take
a look at the Wall Street Journal
editorial the first couple of years you
know or reporting the first you know
throughout the whole Clinton years and
at first they were a little nervous
because he had some of this populist
rhetoric but pretty soon within a few
months you start getting you know
editorials in the Wall Street Journal
and articles in fact not just editorials
about how Clinton is the best president
the business has ever had you know they
quote the Ford company executive is
saying we're getting along with it much
better than we did with Bush and Reagan
and on and on now of course you know
they'd prefer the Gingrich guys actually
with some ambiguity I should say because
they don't like the small business
aspect of the Gingrich people there's a
delicate balance there between holding
off the crazies and making sure that
they're really rich people get
everything so there's been a problem but
the as far as Clinton was concerned they
were perfectly happy with him yeah he's
a moderate Republican so and I don't
think he I don't think you can say that
he's deceived anyone you know if you
look at his positions all the way along
they've been very clear people didn't
want to see it that's their choice but
it's been clear it's been clear to the
business press it's been clear his
policies exactly what kind of education
program would be crafted out of that I'd
be very suspicious about it and I think
it's worth a very careful look I mean
there's plenty of problems with the
educational system but the main problem
is that way too few resources go into it
now it's not that we don't have money
you know like there's no budget crisis
or anything like that the country's just
flooded with money again read the
business press you know it cannot find
adjectives exuberant enough to describe
you know the dazzling stupendous profit
growth and you know what are we going to
do with all those funds and so on the
country is just flooded with money
capital but all getting very narrowly
concentrated okay there's plenty of
money around to improve the educational
system and we know exactly where has to
come from all right but III think that's
its main problem I mean teachers are way
underpaid you know and they're under
educated they're not given enough
respect too many kids in school in a
classroom you know not enough
educational materials and so on and so
forth not there's no special you know
nobody has any brilliant ideas about
Lisa I've never heard anything about how
people should be educated except you
know kids natural and enthusiasm and
creativity ought to be allowed to you
know all right work in constructive way
and all this kind of stuff know what
what's missing is the resources fine so
let's provide the resources so maybe
they won't have such dazzling stupendous
profits next year and instead kids will
get a better education I think that's
what I have but what I'm worried about
is it's going that the system is moving
towards the kind of privatization which
just imposes costs on the public you
remember all this privatization you hear
about it's supposed to be very efficient
and by some measure you know by some
ludicrous measure it probably is
efficient you know and they're part of
the reason why it's efficient is you
don't count the call
okay so like if you suppose they're
talking about privatizing the MTA around
you know the public transportation thing
all right suppose you privatize the
system you and I know how to make it
more efficient by the economist measures
you throw out union workers and you get
temps for half the price and if there is
an accident because they never had any
training well it's just people are
getting killed you don't measure that
and you cut off the so-called
unprofitable bus routes okay or subway
were it's like you don't make a lot of
money at 11 p.m.
okay so let's throw them out well
suppose somebody's stuck somewhere at 11
p.m. and wants to get home oh well you
know it's entrepreneurial values you
know let them hire a limousine or
something you know and in ways like that
you can make the system more efficient
simply by transferring the costs over
the public where you don't measure the
costs okay so you know it looks nice and
efficient on some some you know some
economists paper but of course you just
this huge costs transferred over to the
public which you don't measure we all
know this and that's what privatizing
the educational system will be also it's
doing something else it's it's going
after exactly that moral conception that
underlies the labor movement from its
origins namely we're in it together
you know it's not just gain wealth
forgetting all but self like I we should
care an i that my kid can go to school
but the kid down the street can go to
school that's what's being driven out of
people's heads you know there's a very
powerful effort to drive any of that out
of people's heads you're only supposed
to care about yourself unless you're
rich of course if you're rich you're
part of big socialist structures called
corporations with strategic alliances
and player support from the state and
then you're allowed to have all these
feelings about yeah we work together for
us the rich guys but everybody else is
supposed to be on their own you know
you're not supposed to care whether the
kid down the street goes to school it's
like breaking it's I mean should be very
familiar to people in the labor movement
this is the main propaganda against the
labor movement
time I mean right-to-work laws
everything else you shouldn't work
together that's bad if you work together
you might do something that matters okay
so just be out on your own you know and
if you can get a voucher so maybe your
kid you go to school forget about
everything else I look this this is a
very much a business run Society you
know I mean about the last figures I saw
about one out of six dollars in the
whole economy is spent on marketing it's
extremely inefficient use of funds of
course marketing doesn't produce
anything any public goods but marketing
is a form of manipulation and deceit
it's it's an effort to create artificial
wants you know to put people to control
the way people look and think about
things a lot of that marketing is
straight propaganda advertising
instantly most of it is tax free or a
lot of it is tax free which means the
way our system works you pay for the
privilege of being propagandized you
know of having all this stuff dumped on
you those are not small figures that's
like a trillion dollars a year in 1992
something on that order and yes these
when you're when you've got that much of
a commitment to controlling minds and
manipulating desires and so on and doing
all the things they talk about in the
public relations literature I'm not
making it up you can read it there and
the social science literature because
this is also standard academic book -
well you know when you've got those
stakes you're gonna work on it hard and
it's gonna be hard to fight against
that's what makes organizing tough it's
not just you know well you know way
better than me and I'm not gonna have to
talk about it but you have to break
through a lot of psychic resistance the
whole history of the labor movement
tells you that and as I say this was
well understood by mill hands and Lowell
miner fifty years ago but yeah it's a
big battle and you're not just
struggling against somebody who calls it
a right to work act you're struggling
against five hours a day of television
and the movie industry and the books and
the schools and everything else
the scale of the efforts to win the
battle for men's minds is enormous I
mean I thought I knew something about
this stuff but when I read Elizabeth
thongs Wolfe book I was pretty shocked
just to see the scale of the efforts and
the dedication you know the frenzied
dedication to winning this everlasting
battle it's really pretty impressive
although if you think of the stakes it's
not too surprising okay let's just talk
about the principle okay I mean the
principle as far as I can see goes right
back to the Enlightenment you know like
if you go back to classical and lighten
them thought I'm not talking about Adam
Smith and you know Jefferson and those
guys the sort of core idea is people
have a right to control their own work
you know okay that the that if a person
here I'll quote some a standard formula
back in a 18th century you know leading
heroes of the Enlightenment is if a
person works on it if a person does
beautiful work under external command
meaning for wages we may admire what he
does but we despise what he is because
not for human being okay that goes all
the way through classical liberal
thought and lighten men thought I mean
you know Alexis de Tocqueville says
under wage labor the art advances the
artisan declines now you find this going
right into the working-class movements
and Lowell and Lawrence I think that's
just natural I wouldn't try to convince
anybody oh but it seems to me if you
think about it yeah why should you work
on command I mean if you work on command
you're some kind of slave now why not
work because it's coming out of your
needs and interests I mean like cheap
for me to say I'm gonna fence a
university and a science department and
I can do that one of the nice things
about being in the Sun in science is a
fast
fancy universities you really do have
workers control I'm to a very large
extent we control what we do you know
want to work on this topic I work on
that topic I mean you got to sell it to
funders and this and that but the degree
of workers control at the elite level is
quite substantial I mean that's why it's
such a privilege to be in a science
department you know enormous ly
privileged existence forget the money if
they pay you one-tenth the amount of
money it would still be a much better
existence than working on command now I
think people do know that you know I
don't think that these Enlightenment
ideas are hard to grasp I think people
know that if you work on under external
control you may despise admire what the
person does but despise what he is
because his labor you know the sort of
central part of your life is being done
at somebody else's orders and you're not
controlling the way it's done or why
it's done or how it's used or anything
else well you can't have every
individual controlling every single
thing but that's why you have democratic
structures because people control things
together you know okay
i I I don't know how to I wouldn't try
to convince anybody of this because I
frankly just don't believe that everyone
doesn't know it I think maybe I'm
sentimental but it seems to me if you
sort of cut away waves of you know
layers of distortion and delusion these
things that we're considered pretty
obvious two hundred years ago still
obvious what about the idea that the
Cold War serves certain ideological and
political purposes for the US and now
the u.s. is seeking a new paradigm
there's something true about the fact
that the Cold War paradigm was extremely
useful as a way of controlling people so
like they take the labor movement you
know one of the ways of controlling
undermining and destroying the labor
movement was weeding out the activist
elements on the principle that there are
somehow not loyal enough to the state at
this time of
you know when the enemy is at our
throats well like any propaganda even
the most vulgar propaganda that comes
out of Stalinist Russia there's always
some thread of truth to it he just
couldn't have propaganda that doesn't
have some you know marginal element of
truth and there was some marginal
element of truth here too but it wasn't
very real it's like the Cuba case you
know so yes this has been a very
terrific hammer to use over people's
heads and it was understood I should say
if you haven't read it yet you should
read NSC 68 which was everybody agrees
was the fundamental Cold War document
it's kind of interesting that it's
content everybody recognizes it as the
major document but nobody quote with
very few exceptions on one but I have a
book called bettering democracy which in
the first chapter has a lot of extensive
quotes from NSC sixty-eight it's April
nineteen fifty and it sort of laid out
the basic picture of the Cold War and
it's quite fascinating to read for one
thing because when you can see why
diplomatic historians don't quote it
this was written by the real hotshots
you know Dean Acheson Paul netsy all
these smart guys it reads like a bunch
of raving lunatics you know I don't take
my word for it read it you know I mean I
concede I picked out the most dramatic
examples but read the whole thing if you
feel like it's not that long in my view
it sounds like a bunch of raving
lunatics which is why nobody ever cites
it but they do make some points I mean
the picture they tell is kind of a fairy
tale you know on one hand there's
absolute evil that's the other side it's
kind of like a fairy tale you'd be
embarrassed to read your grandchildren
there's this total absolute evil
you know the Kremlin listen that witch
is planning to destroy the whole world
and everything that ever existed and so
on on the other side there's utter
perfection that's us
you know we're like super angels the
only thing we ever do is you work you
know slave for the benefit of this and
that and it's portrayed and the picture
of a you know as I said
an exaggerated fair parody of a
fairytale there's never any evidence
given because it's just like a matter of
definition they say it's it's a it's an
it it's an essential nature of the
Kremlin that it acts this way so you
don't have to even give evidence because
it's just part of their nature and it's
the central property of our nature that
we do this sort of thing okay so there's
no evidence given in fact there is
evidence scattered around very carefully
scattered around so that anybody it's
going to look for it's not hard time
finding it and when you find when you do
put together the evidence I did in the
same book you find that it completely
undermines whatever thesis they have
about relative power but forgetting that
then comes the proposals the proposals
are we're involved in a real war it's a
real war you know Cold War we have to
fight it like a war to prevent this
monstrous thing from destroying
everything and allowing utter perfection
and magnificence to win and in a war
you've got to have things like just
suppression we have to have suppression
of dissent among us one of our
weaknesses is that we're too tolerant
and to open and to free they say that
you know and that's a weakness so we
have to have just suppression and
control of dissent and you know make
sure that everybody is obedient and so
on and the way to do it is through they
also call for military Keynesianism that
means transferring public funds to
private industry which was a big issue
then because everybody knew that the
economic system is not going to function
without a tremendous amount of public
funding state funding poured in so that
was crucial and that's true of the
International economy too at that time a
very heavily reliant on military
spending to revitalizing the and they
know all that and it's laid out but also
that it would be an ideological weapon
it would be a weapon to control people
and that's true it was I mean from then
until the game started to go away in
1989 around then it was a tremendous
weapon of flood control anything you
wanted the block just yell or do you
know yell cold war didn't matter how
crazy it was sometimes there was some
truth to it sometimes not so yes you
need a new paradigm
because how're we gonna beat people over
the head now that we don't have that
around anymore and if you look through
the 80s it was already obvious through
the 1980s that this stuff is going to
lose its efficacy you'd have to be a big
genius to figure out that the Soviet
Union was in trouble so you look at
stuff say I was writing since the early
80s have been saying look they're gonna
have to go to something else and in fact
right through the 80s there's an almost
desperate search for something else you
know international terrorism or crazed
Arabs or Hispanic narco traffickers
there something or other that we have to
defend ourselves against or otherwise
how you gonna control everybody okay
domestic crime mostly manufactured you
know US doesn't have crime levels very
different from other industrial
countries it doesn't in fact but a very
different perception of crime welfare
queens you know sort of by implication
black driving around in Cadillacs and
you know that sort of thing
so there's all sorts of effort to you
know manufacture enemies for people to
hate but a foreign enemy is much better
and so here's where the science of
government comes in now let's get back
to this Clash of Civilizations thing
Huntington's you know everybody is
flailing around for some paradigm you
know some big thing that you can use to
control people and Huntington's ideas
Clash of Civilizations
so you know there's Islam and us all
these other things and the reason why
the world the idea is the reason why the
world is so disorderly is because you've
got all you know with a cold war gone
you've got all these ethnic groups
killing each other and so on well as
usual it's always a good idea to start
by asking about the facts whenever you
hear anything said very confidently the
first thing that should come to mind is
wait a minute is that true you know so
is it true I mean is it true that
there's more ethnic conflict now than
there was 20 years ago
well take a look I in most of the big
conflicts that are going on around the
world are we're going on right through
the Cold War
like Burundi and Rwanda that were huge
maskers going on in the early 70s
actually I wrote about him at the time
nobody was talking about him because it
wasn't interesting but they were there
there are some
the in fact or takes a you know in fact
just about everyone you pick goes way
back now there are some that are new
those in within the former Soviet system
including Yugoslavia you know within the
old so-called communist system yeah
they're new
so like the war in Chechnya or you know
other by John Armenia
you know Tajikistan you know these
things are all new but that's standard
any time a tyrannical system breaks down
you have all sorts of conflict internal
to it just take a look at the breakdown
of the European empires every single one
was like that Muslim were worse so first
of all the very factual basis is very
thin now what about the principal clash
of civilizations like say the big bad
guy is Islam well there are few problems
with that our the most fundamentalist
Islamic state in the world is our big
Ally Saudi Arabia how's that fit you
know I mean Saudi Arabia's are real it's
not fundamentalist enough for some of
the people in it but it's pretty extreme
are we trying to undermine Saudi Arabia
of course not they're sitting on all the
oil you know in fact there are clients
that's a family dictatorship but we keep
in power because they make sure that the
money from oil doesn't go to the people
of the region but goes to London in New
York so they're ok there's no clash of
civilizations there that's state
fundamental what about individual you
know like nots non-state well by far the
worst ones are the guys who are tearing
Afghanistan to pieces now you find
created more crazy Islamic
fundamentalist around the NEM I don't
know about them where'd they get their
power from your pocket you know they got
six billion dollars or so it's claimed
from the United States in Saudi Arabia
and through the 1980s now they're
tearing Afghanistan apart but it's not
our you know nothing that we did you
know we're only wonderful people so how
where is this clash of civilizations
between Islam in the West I don't see it
I mean Indonesia is a Islamic state do
you see us trying to undermine Indonesia
I mean in a lot of rotten things in
Indonesia like for example wages are
about half the level of China which is
not so munificent do you see us doing
anything about that I mean I I think
this is all for us you know I mean I
don't mean to say total for us like
there must be a new paradigm you know
something that people can build their
careers on and write books about and so
on and so forth which can then be turned
into a device of controlling people that
part is true and maybe this will work or
if it doesn't you try something else
