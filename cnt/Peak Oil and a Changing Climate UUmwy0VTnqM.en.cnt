Peak Oil and a changing climate
hi I'm Tom Harvin join me and listening
to various experts discuss fossil fuel
depletion and global warming Peak Oil
means a production peak it means that
you can no longer increase production
it's not a reflection of directly of how
much oil is under the ground it's a
reflection of how much you can extract
in any given year and so the inheritance
of oil that we have is finite and at
some point with a finite resource you
can no longer increase production year
on year and we are arguably at that
point right now and so we are looking at
a plateau at the moment but ultimately
we're going to be seeing the our ability
to produce oil declining year-on-year I
first became concerned about fossil fuel
depletion about 12 years ago when I read
an article in Scientific American called
the end of cheap oil by - petroleum
geologists I immediately understood as I
hadn't before the the central importance
of energy to modern industrial societies
and particularly oil because we're
dependent on oil for about 95 percent of
our transportation planes trains
automobiles ships basically if the oil
starts if the oil stops flowing our
society starts coming apart at the seams
every different Society has its own
level of socio-economic complexity that
will be associated with a certain energy
requirement and a certain energy
returned on energy invested estimates
vary as to what we would require for our
current level of civilization I would
imagine it's actually not that much less
than ten to one because this is an
extremely complex society I think that
the requirements are going to be
significant so we are going to have to
produce a significant surplus in net
energy terms in order to maintain our
current systems I do not think we're
going to have
the energy surplus that we need we're
already arguably down to about ten to
one on average so I think we're very
close to that that breaking point where
socio-economic complexity would have to
decline because there's not going to be
enough energy net energy is what you
gain after you subtract the energy that
was required to exploit the resource
this is also known as energy returned on
energy invested so in 2011 one barrel of
oil is required to fuel the production
machinery for 10 barrels to be extracted
nine barrels are the surplus that
society uses to maintain and grow keep
in mind that the surplus of energy is
what we used a fuel industrial
agriculture build roads keep
transportation moving produce
pharmaceuticals heat homes make plastics
the list goes on and on well the United
States up until the mid 70s was an oil
exporting nation and we hit Peak Oil
around 74 and we began importing oil
quite substantially by the late 70s
which is why Jimmy Carter was talking
about it and we are now one of the
world's largest importers and we're
importing more than half of our oil so
Peak Oil for us was the beginning of an
economic disaster we're now borrowing
money from all over the world so that we
can buy oil for ourselves when the
planet hits Peak Oil and it looks like
it's probably this year maybe last year
if at the very worst next year that the
when the planet hits Peak Oil it's going
to be a far more problematic issue the
thing that's worth discussing now is
what post peak production looks like a
lot of people look at these charts that
have a very smooth decline curve that
always looked a little strange to me so
I did a lot of research into trying to
figure out what that meant and it turned
out that it's it's just sheer nonsense
there's no reality behind it at all and
I've identified many many factors that
combine and various unpredictable ways
it's really too complicated to predict
but the chance of this very smooth
decline I would say is zero it's going
to be a stepwise decline
and various parts of the planet will be
cut off from transportation fuel
permanently at various times there will
be disruptions and then it will be a
permanent cutoff from that point on
people are always talking about various
new finds of oil as though you know this
is going to save the day Peak Oil yeah
yeah look at all of oil are finding off
the coast of Brazil well yes it's true
Petrobras the Brazilian state oil
company has been having very good luck
finding oil in deep offshore waters in
the in the the sedimentary basins off
the off the coast of Brazil problem here
is that we're talking about ultra deep
water oil now we had a problem not too
long ago in the Gulf of Mexico with the
explosion of an oil rig called Deepwater
Horizon and the problem there was we
were using some pretty advanced
technology in some pretty inhospitable
environments we were drilling a mile
deep in ocean water and there was a
problem the explosion huge oil leak the
worst environmental disaster in American
history okay what's happening in Brazil
we're talking about not a mile of ocean
water but two or three miles of ocean
water this is going to put oil drilling
technology to the ultimate test we're
talking about having to invent new
technologies to to operate in
environments that you know nobody has
ever operated in before the resources no
I mean we're not they were running out
of cheap oil we're just making it we
have to look for it in more expensive
places and they have to look for it in
places that are more destructive to dig
out in more dangerous places like deep
water so as a matter of the difficulty
is increasing and that's the big issue
and so it's not a matter of resources we
being reduced it's in fact what I fear
is that they're not I mean it's too bad
we're not running out of oil in some way
because we're not focusing on it we know
that we can keep going on this
trainwreck this environmental trainwreck
we're heading into well interestingly
you know now in the third quarter of
2010 there's there are more and more
reports coming out from places other
hurtness mostly other than the United
States basically informing the public of
the developed world that we've got a
problem and it's you know the problem
that I've just described a combination
of energy and problems with capital and
wealth combining to suggest that we may
be going out of business so you know
really essentially the problem is we've
got too many people using too much stuff
too fast in an economy that only knows
how to grow think about it this way you
know just like our banks were too big to
fail so our energy system is too big to
fail if only someone had said five or
six years ago
look this financial thing is out of
control yes we're making a lot of money
doing it just like Exxon is making a lot
of money peddling oil but we're gonna
have to bite the bullet and deal
realistically with this instead of
pretending that we're all making money
if we've done that we might have well
have stopped things short of the kind of
financial collapse that we saw that
financial collapse was bad it's nothing
compared to what is happening
ecologically on this planet that's the
too-big-to-fail problem we've really got
to address for example the America the
Chamber of Commerce the main business
lobby the American petroleum industry
other business lobbies have publicly
proclaimed in fact with enthusiasm that
they are carrying out a campaign to try
to convince the population that global
warming is liberal hoax and it's it
succeeded unfortunately the latest polls
I've seen show maybe a third of the
population believes in anthropogenic
global warming the media contribute in
their own way so for example when the
New York Times that runs a front page
article on what meteorologists think
about global warming namely they don't
believe it
meteorologists are pretty faces who read
scripts telling you if it's not
arraigned tomorrow what do they have to
say any more than your barber but that's
presented as if it's a significant
contribution to the discussion the same
when they you know in favor you know in
pursuit of the fabled objectivity
present the two sides one side is
ninety-eight percent of scientists who
know anything the other is side is a
Senator Inhofe and a couple of
stragglers and that's the two sides and
you're supposed people are supposed to
make a choice between them
they leave out a third side which is the
substantial number of climate scientists
who believe that the consensus
predictions are much too optimistic
including some of the leading scientists
right here who've recently run what they
call the most extensive modeling ever
done that concludes that it's far worse
than anticipated at their own results or
an understatement because they don't
take into account such things as Effects
of methane after permafrost disappears
and so on so that's the debate that
people are presented with and it's not
surprising that the effort to
manufacture consent to the belief that
doesn't mean anything is pretty
successful what's rather interesting
about this and tells you something about
the nature of our society is that those
same CEOs and managers who are trying to
convince the public that it's a liberal
hoax know perfectly well that it's
extremely dangerous they have the same
beliefs that you and I have but so
they're they're caught in a kind of an
institutional contradiction as
leaders of major corporations they have
an institutional role now that is to
maximize short-term profit and if they
don't do that they're out and someone
else is in who does do it so it's they
don't it's basically institutionally
speaking it's not a choice that's going
to happen in the major institutions so
they may know that they're mortgaging
the future of their grandchildren that
in fact may be everything that one will
be destroyed but they're caught in a
trap of institutional structure that's
what happens in market systems financial
crisis is a small example of the same
thing you may know that you're what
you're doing is carry systemic risk but
you can't calculate that into your
transactions or you're not fulfilling
your role and somebody else replaces you
in fact in the United States it's
actually a legal obligation to do that
for corporate executives so and that's a
very serious problem it means that we're
marching over the cliff and doing it for
institutional reasons that are pretty
hard to dismantle there's other factors
like the the anger and fear and
hostility in the country about
everything carries over to this so if
you look at polls
everyone hates Congress they hate the
Democrats they hate the Republicans even
more they hate big business they hate
banks and they distrust scientists so
why should we believe what these
pointy-headed elitists are telling us we
don't trust anything else we don't trust
them all of this combines the latest
election a couple of days ago is a yes
you could almost interpret it as a kind
of a death knell for the species there
was an article in Bloomberg Businessweek
you know not a radical rag exactly
they're running through the new
Republican Republicans coming to
Congress and they're worried about them
one of the reasons is because they are
global warming deniers almost all that
means the powerful house
these are like science and technology
and so on are gonna in the hands of
people who think there's nothing to it
or at least claim that they think that
what they actually think is another
story
in fact one of them was quoted as saying
can't be a problem because God will take
care of it no you know if this was
happening in some small country and you
know maybe you know I don't know what
Minako or something wouldn't matter much
but when it's happening in the richest
most powerful country in the world it's
a it's a danger to the survival of the
species nobody else is going to do very
much if the United States doesn't do a
lot not just some but take the lead so
we're essentially saying let's kiss each
other goodbye
right now there's basically a
stranglehold on political power in this
country by an elite that divides itself
into two camps Republicans and Democrats
and what have to mate what have you
maybe even more but it's really the same
bunch of people and the same bunch of
people is almost militant in refusing to
look at reality and it's almost a
question of them at some point being
wheeled out of their offices along with
the office furniture it's not like they
can be really spoken to without it being
once complete waste of time so I see
that quite similar to what the old
communists went through I think we are
going to see a lot of things happen that
will impact on the climate change debate
and sometimes for the better
not always however because if people
start burning particularly filthy things
if people get really cold and they have
no power they will burn anything and
they will not care at all what that does
to the climate because economists call
this the discount rate goes up in other
words they devalue the future in
comparison with the present and if
people do not know where their next meal
is coming from and their house is
freezing they are not going to care
about climate change however important
an issue it may be beyond the horizon
that they're thinking of if we take peak
oil as
a signal to get our act together about
fossil fuel that'll be wise if we take
it as a signal to go burn as much coal
as we possibly can then we're doubly
screwed so this is you know where the
signal we're getting from our oil
reserves around the world is a strong
signal sort of like global warming not
quite as strong maybe but an important
signal that we should take seriously the
need to transition on to something else
well climate change is real I mean even
even the oil company shells are starting
to admit it now they're just saying no
it's not that big a deal I can't my show
the other day we wrote a book about how
carbon dioxide it's good it's food for
plants didn't you know I mean you know
they're trying to pull every weird
little canard out of a hat but the
bottom line is that when people see
their neighborhoods being destroyed by
tornadoes when they see cities being
wiped out by hurricanes when they see
you know here in Pakistan right now
you've got 2 million people have been to
this place by flooding in the Indus
River you see the glaciers that are
freshwater supplies to to at least half
of the world's population vanishing as
that becomes more and more impossible to
ignore the conversations going to change
thing that is hard is for us to do at
the moment is to come up with a
consensus about reality that is
consistent with the way things really
are going you know to come up with a
coherent picture of what's happening to
us and what we're gonna do about it and
you know the noise in the system in the
form of so many people's ideas and
opinions about what's happening and so
many memes and narratives and stories
that are floating around there along
with wishes hopes delusions and other
not helpful intellectual material you
know is making it very hard for us to to
articulate where we are in this point in
human history and what we're going to do
you know unfortunately history is tragic
and the history doesn't care if we're
incompetent history doesn't care if we
make blunders
he doesn't care for sloppy history
doesn't care if we don't pay attention
you know
reality has mandates of its own and you
know we're good we're gonna find out the
hard way that with the cost of not
paying attention is is there a cover-up
of Peak Oil and all these other things
peak everything well I think there is to
a certain extent I think in the US
Department of Energy in the
International Energy Agency there are
people who understand the situation and
would like to sound the alarm and they
are being muzzled I'm convinced that's
the case however well in a broader sense
I think that's more or less inevitable
because if we have a political system in
an economic system that are so entwined
with economic growth that if anyone
comes out and tells the public you know
eken well economic growth may not be
possible anymore and we're just all
going to have to get used to living with
less you know what does that do it makes
the stock market crash it makes
investments go sour the whole economic
system starts to come apart nobody but
wants to be responsible for that
especially especially after what
happened in September 2008 so everybody
just wants to put a nice smiley face on
things
and and assure all and sundry that you
know we'll have plenty of energy in the
future either there's lots of oil out
there in you know the Canadian tar sands
or someplace or if there isn't enough
oil we'll be able to get all the energy
we need from you know nuclear and solar
panels and wind turbines and we and we
shouldn't worry whatever you do don't
worry about economic growth or energy
but it's a lie we should be very worried
because this is the whole basis of our
modern way of life and that basis is
being gradually taken out from under us
