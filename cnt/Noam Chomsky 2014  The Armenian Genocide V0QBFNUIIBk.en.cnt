and what is your opinion on the genocide
of our
news which was the first in 20th century
well actually i was in
turkey um about a year ago to give the
uh
memorial lecture for ron think the
uh turkish armenian journalists who
exposed the armenian massacres and
it's uh i mean it was a huge atrocity
no question about that a very complex
one
so the first time i was in turkey for
example was
around 2000 and i was there
to support kurdish rights i was there
for trial and so on and among other
things i went to jarvacure
where kurdish the kurds had just been
subjected to
really horrible atrocities in turkey
right through the 90s it was awful
and this was kind of the tail end of it
and i was taken in jarvac here by
kurdish
friends to i asked to visit the armenian
quarter
the arbitrary was the place where the
final massacres took place
mostly by kurds i mean the
the internal psychological conflicts are
hard to describe
they themselves were just barely
emerging from
major slaughters incidentally backed by
the united states which provided about
80 percent of the arms and here they
were being
i was asking them to show me the
remnants of
a massacre in which they were among the
major perpetrators
the final i almost hate to use the words
but almost a final solution for the
armenians in
turkey well they took me there was an
old church
one church falling apart no roof
you know pieces of total wreck but
remnants of the building were there i
asked if
anyone had collected the relics and they
were
uncomfortable about it they took me to a
little store nearby small store where
there was
an armenian man roughly my age who
had collected relics from the church
and that was about the remnants of the
armenian community in jarvakir i mean
i was there last year for the front dink
lecture
very substantial change the church had
been rebuilt
reconstituted there's at the runtink
memorial there were probably hundreds of
thousands of people
demonstrating big march through istanbul
supporting bringing up the truth about
the armenian massacres
the police didn't interfere it was too
big a
too big a demonstration to interfere
with
the final it ended at the
publishing house where hunting worked
and where he was assassinated and
his wife his widow was there i was there
and those
big crowd talks and so on it's an
enormous change
and a positive one so
it was a terrible atrocity but there's
now the beginnings of
coming to terms with it it's not easy
other countries have similar problems i
mentioned before that the support for
israel is primarily from the anglosphere
think about the anglosphere for a minute
what
makes those countries similar
in the united states australia and
canada
these are settler colonial societies
societies where the english colonists
came and virtually exterminated the
indigenous population
all of them not everybody but
horrible atrocities have we come to
terms with
why would this might this be related to
support for israel
well i don't think it's hard to figure
out especially when you recognize that
these are extremely religious society
societies with extreme fundamentalist
religious elements which
take a literalist interpretation of the
bible
you put all that together and it's a
cultural fact
over and above the geopolitical facts
that lie behind this
have these societies come to terms with
their extermination of the indigenous
population
it's a long time it hasn't happened
have they come to terms with the legacy
of
slavery which is still alive remember
you know
look at the number of black males in
prison that's
the legacy of slavery 500 years have
they come to terms with it
no turkey is beginning to come to terms
with a major crime
and i think that should be applauded and
supported but
without taking a superior stance
there's very few countries that don't
have something to look back on
thank you very much
