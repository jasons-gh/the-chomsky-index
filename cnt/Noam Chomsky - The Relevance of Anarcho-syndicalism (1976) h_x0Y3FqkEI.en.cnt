professor Chomsky perhaps we should
start by trying to define what is not
meant by an ik ism the word anarchy
after all is derived from the Greek
literally meaning no government now
presumably people talk about Anarchy or
anarchism as a system of political
philosophy don't just mean that as it
were as of January the 1st next year
government as we know understand it
would suddenly ceased there would be no
policemen no rule of the road no laws no
tax collectors no they've pushed office
and so forth there presumably means
something more complicated than that
well yes to some of those questions no
to others they may very well mean no
policemen but I don't think there would
mean no rules of the road in fact I
should say to begin with it
the term anarchism is used to cover
quite a range of political ideas but I'm
going to follow your lead and think of
it as the libertarian left and from that
point of view anarchism can be conceived
as a kind of voluntary socialism that is
at a libertarian socialist or
anarcho-syndicalist or communist
anarchist in the tradition of SAV
Bakunin and Kropotkin and others had in
mind a highly organ organized form
society but a society that was organized
on the basis of organic units organic
communities and generally they meant by
that the workplace or the neighborhood
or both and from those two basic units
involving the place where a person works
and spends his creative energies and the
place where he lives in relation to his
neighbors and others around him from
those two basic units there could drive
through federal arrangements highly
integrated kind of social organization
which might be national or even
international in scope where decisions
could be made over a substantial range
but by delegates who are always part of
the organic community from which they
come and are returned to it and are
revocable and in general would live
there in fact so it doesn't mean a
society in which there is literally
speaking no governments
much as a society in which the primary
Authority and source of authority comes
as it were from the bottom up to not
exact on the top-down where
representative democracy as we have it
in the United States and in Britain
would be regarded as a form of from the
top-down authority even though
ultimately the voters decide well
representative democracy as in say the
United States Great Britain would be
would be criticized by an anarchist of
this school on really two grounds first
of all because there is a monopoly of
power centralized in the state and
secondly and critically because
representative democracy is limited to
the political sphere and in no way in a
serious way encroaches on the economic
sphere and anarchists of this tradition
have always held that the Democratic
control of one's productive life is at
the core of any serious human liberation
or for that matter any significant
democratic practice that is as long as
there as long as individuals are
compelled to rent themselves on the
market to those who are willing to to
hire them and as long as their role in
production is simply that of ancillary
tools then there are striking elements
of coercion and oppression that make
talk of democracy very limited if even
meaningful historically have there been
any sustained examples on any
substantial scale of societies which
approximated to the anarchist ideal
there are small societies a smaller
number that have I think done so quite
well and there are a few examples of
large scale libertarian revolutions
which were largely anarchist in their
structure as to the first small
societies extending over long period I
myself think the most dramatic example
is the Pratt's the Israeli kibbutz in
which for a long period may or may not
be true today but for a long period were
really were constructed on
on anarchist principles that is of
self-management direct worker control
integration of Agriculture industry
service personal life on an egalitarian
basis with direct and in fact quite
active participation in self-management
and were I should think extraordinarily
successful by well almost any measure
that one can getting poor they were
presumably indeed still ha in the
framework of a conventional state which
guarantees certain well they were
services well then after the histories
rather interesting up until said since
1948 they've been in the framework of a
conventional state prior to that they
were within the framework of a colonial
Enclave and in fact there was a
subterranean society largely cooperative
society which was not really part of the
the system of the British Mandate but
was functioning outside of it and to
some extent that survived the
establishment of the state though of
course it became integrated into the
state and in my view lost some of the
fair amount of its libertarian socialist
character through this process and
through other processes which are unique
to the history of that region which we
need not go into however as functioning
libertarian socialist institutions I
think they are an interesting model that
I think is highly relevant to advanced
industrial societies in a way in which
some of the other examples that have
existed in the past or not a good
example of a really large-scale
anarchist revolution or a largely
anarchist revolution in fact the best
example to my knowledge is the Spanish
revolution in 1936 in which over well
most of Republic in Spain there was a
stripper
quite inspiring in my view anarchist
revolution that involved both industry
and agriculture over substantial areas
developed in a way which to the outside
looks spontaneous though in fact if you
look at the roots of it one discovers
that it was based on Oh three
generations
of experiment and thought and work which
had extended anarchist ideas to very
large parts of the of the population in
this largely pre-industrial though not
totally pre-industrial society and that
again was well by by both human measures
and even anyone's economic measures
quite successful that his production
continued effectively workers in farms
and factories proved quite capable of
managing their affairs without coercion
from above
contrary to what lots of socialists
communists liberals and others wanted to
believe and in fact you can't tell what
would happen that that anarchist
revolution was destroyed was simply
destroyed by force but during the period
of its death in which it was alive I
think it was highly successful and as I
say in many ways really inspiring
testimony to the ability of poor working
people to organize manage their affairs
extremely successfully without coercion
and control how relevant the Spanish
experience is to an advanced industrial
society when my one might question in
detail it's clear that the fundamental
idea is the the primacy of the
individual initially in isolation but
with other individuals and and the
fulfilment of his freedom this in a
sense looks awfully like the founding
ideas of the United States of America
now what is it about the American
experience which is made freedom as used
in that tradition become a suspect and
indeed a tainted phrase in the minds of
anarchist and libertarian socialist
thinkers like yourself well many
anarchists let me just say I don't
really regard myself as an anarchist
thinker I'm a derivative of a fellow
traveler let's say anarchist thinkers
have constantly referred to to the
American experience and to the ideal of
Jeffersonian democracy very very
favorably however what they and so you
know Jefferson's concept that the best
government is the government which
governs least or throws the
- that that the best government is the
one that doesn't govern at all there's
one that's often repeated by anarchist
thinkers - to modern times however the
ideal of the Ilia concepts are
Jeffersonian democracy putting aside the
fact that it was a slave society
developed in an essentially pre
capitalist system that is in a society
in which there were no there was no
monopolistic control of there were no
centers of private power let's say
significant centers of private power in
fact it's striking to read today to go
back and to read some of the classic
libertarian texts if if one reads say go
home fun Humboldt's critique of the
state in 1792 a work that certainly
inspired Mill and a significant classic
pure libertarian text he doesn't speak
at all of the need to resist private
concentration of power rather he speaks
of the need to resist the encroachment
of coercive state power and that is what
one finds also in the early American
tradition but really any kind of father
the one kind of power there was I mean
Humboldt takes for granted that
individuals are roughly equivalent in
their private power and that the only
real imbalance of power that one sees as
the centralized authoritarian state and
individual freedom must be sustained
against its intrusion the state of the
church I mean that's what he feels one
must resist know when he speaks a
Humboldt for example of the need for
control of one's creative life for thee
when he's when he D cries the alienation
of Labor and that arises from coercion
or even instruction or guidance in one's
work rather than self-management in
one's work he's giving an anti a an anti
status he's developing an anti status or
ante theocratic ideology but the same
principles apply very well to the a
capitalist industrial society that
emerged later
and I would think
had he been consistent would have ended
up being a libertarian socialist rather
than thee
then these precedents suggest that the
there is something inherently
pre-industrial about the applicability
of libertarian ideas in this way that it
necessarily presupposes a rather rural
simple society in which the technologies
production are fairly simple in which
the economic organization tends to be
small scale and localized and in which
all the problems which we associate with
modern industrial society just aren't
there well let me separate that into two
questions one how anarchists have felt
about that and two what I think is the
case as far as anarchist reactions to
that there there are two there there
there has been an anarchist tradition
which was and one might think say if
Kropotkin is a representative which was
which had much the character you
described on the other hand there's
another anarchist tradition that
develops into anarcho-syndicalism which
simply regarded anarchist ideas as the
proper mode of organization for a highly
complex advanced industrial society and
that tendency and anarchism merges or at
least into relates very closely with a
variety of left-wing Marxism the kind
that one finds in say the council
communists that grew up in the
Luxembourgian tradition and that is
later represented by by Marxist
theorists like say Anton Pannekoek and
well in who developed a whole theory of
workers councils in industry as the and
who is himself a scientist and
astronomer very much part of the
industrial world Dutch Dutch Marxist no
it's the latter not so which of these
two views is correct I mean is it
necessary that anarchist concepts belong
to the pre-industrial phase of human
society or is it the rational mode of
organization for a highly advanced
industrial society
well I myself believe the latter that is
I think that industrialization and the
advance of technology raises
possibilities for self-management over a
broad scale that simply didn't exist in
an earlier period and that in fact this
is precisely the rational mode
for a an advanced and complex industrial
society one in which workers can very
well become masters of their own
immediate affairs that is direction of
and control of the shop but also can be
in a position to make to make the major
substantive decisions concerning the
structure of the economy concerning
social institutions concerning planning
regionally and beyond because they can
have in fact objectively now that is
technology permits and industrialization
permits institutions do not permit them
to have control over the requisite
information the relevant or the relevant
training to understand these matters a
good deal can be automated much of the
necessary work that is required to keep
a decent level of social life going can
be really consigned to machines at least
in principle which means humans can be
free to to undertake the kind of
creative work which may not have been
possible objectively in early stages of
the Industrial Revolution I'd like to
pursue in a moment the question of the
economics of an anarchist society but
could you sketch in a little more
broadly began a political Constitution
of an anarchist society as you would see
it in modern conditions but the big
political parties for example what forms
of government residual forms of
government would in fact remain well as
let me sketch what a kind of what I
think would make the perhaps a rough
consensus and one that I think is
essentially correct beginning with these
two modes of immediate organization and
control namely organization and control
in the workplace and in the community
one can imagine a network of workers
councils at a higher level
representation across a factory or
across branches of Industry or across
crafts and on to General Assemblies of
workers councils that can be regional
and national and international in
character and from another point of view
one can project the system of governance
that involves local assemblies again
federated regionally dealing with
regional issues
crossing crafts industries trades and so
on and again general at the level of the
nation or beyond it through Federation
and so on
now they each of these and exactly
exactly how these would develop and how
they would enter enter and relate and
where they need both of them are only
one well these are matters over which
anarchist theoreticians have debated and
many detailed proposals exist and I
don't I don't feel competent to take a
stand in fact I think these are
questions that's pretty much what have
to be worked out but there would not for
example be direct national elections and
political parties organized from coast
to coast does it wear off from north to
south of Britain to win those kind of
elections because if it's the word there
aren't really create a kind of a central
authority which would be what I call to
the idea of any I know the idea of
anarchism is that delegation of
authority is rather minimal
that is participants at any one of these
levels of government representatives at
any one of these levels of government
should be directly responsive to the
organic community in which they live and
in fact the optimal situation would be
that participation in one of these
levels of government should on the one
hand be temporary and even during the
period when it's taking place should be
only partial that is the members of a
workers council who are for some period
actually functioning to make sure
transitions that other people don't want
to don't have the time to make should
nevertheless be in part also continuing
to do their work as part of the
workplace or neighborhood community in
which they belong now as for political
parties that my feeling is that an
anarchist society would not forcefully
present prevent physical political
parties from from arising in fact
anarchism has always been based on the
idea that any sort of procrustean bed
any any sort of system of norms that's
imposed on social life will will
constrain and very much underestimate
its its energy and vitality and that all
sorts of new possibilities of voluntary
organization may develop that we mean
even think of today at that higher level
of the material and intellectual culture
but I think it is fair to say that
insofar as political parties are felt to
be necessary anarchist organization of
society will be failed that is it should
be the case I would think that where
there is direct participation in
self-management in economic and social
affairs then factions conflicts
differences of interest and an idea an
opinion which should be welcomed and
cultivated will be expressed at every
one of these levels why they should fall
into two or three or in political
parties I don't quite see I think that
the complexity of human interest in and
life is that does not fall in that
fashion parties represent basically
class interests or large classes would
not exist in and classes would have been
eliminated or transcended in such a
society one last question the political
organization is there not a danger that
with this sort of hierarchical tier of
assemblies and quasi governmental
structure without direct elections that
the central body or the body that is in
sometimes at the top of this pyramid
gets very remote from the people on the
ground and since it will have to have
some passive is going to deal with
international affairs for example deal
with other countries may even have to
have control over Armed Forces and
things like that that it would be less
democratically responsive than the
existing regime well first of all there
would be direct elections under any
accepted direct elections would be at
every one of these levels that is as far
as the lowest level is concerned they'd
elect the next level the next level
would then a little about that now the
question is I think it's very important
the property of any libertarian Society
will be to prevent an evolution in the
direction that you describe which is a
possible evolution and one that
institutions should be designed to abort
to prevent and I think that that's
entirely possible I mean I myself I'm
totally unpersuaded that the
participation in governance is a
full-time job I don't
think it is it may be in an irrational
society where there are all sorts of
problems that arise because of the
irrational nature of institutions but in
a properly functioning advanced
industrial society organized along
libertarian lines I would think that
executing decisions taken by
representative bodies is a part-time job
which should be rotated throughout the
community and furthermore should be
undertaken by people who are at all
times continue to be participants in
their own direct activity now it may be
it's possible that it is necessary to
have it that that governance is itself a
function on a par with say steel
production if that turns out to be true
and I think that's a question of
empirical fact that has to be determined
that can't be projected out of them all
right but if it turns out to be true
then it seems to me the natural
suggestion is that governance should be
organized industrially as simply another
branch of Industry that is the civil
servants or others who are involved in
this form of activity taking it to be
just by hypothesis no a meaningful and
useful form of activity that they
themselves should be organized as simply
one of the branches of industry with
their own workers councils and their own
self-governance and their own
participation in broader assemblies now
that's I might say that in the
spontaneous development of workers
councils that has occasionally appeared
here and there in the world
well for example Hungarian Revolution of
1956 that's pretty much what happened
there was as I recall a workers council
of state employee ever they call
themselves civil servants or something
like that who were simply organized
along industrial lines as another branch
of Industry that's perfectly possible
and it should be or could be a barrier
against the creation of a the kind of
remote coercive bureaucracy that
anarchists of course feared
frohe Strom ski I'd like to press you a
little bit further about the way in
which effective democratic control would
be achieved consistently with
discharging the necessary functions of
society if you're suppose that there
would continue to be a need for
self-defense on quite a sophisticated
level I don't quite see from your
description how you would achieve
effective control by the system of
part-time representative councils of
various levels from the bottom up over
an organization as as powerful and as
necessarily technically sophisticated as
for example the Pentagon which is a body
with which you'll Feder I had a long
record of conflict over the Vietnam War
and other matters in recent years can
you describe how the Pentagon could won
the same time be efficient as a defense
organization and nonetheless properly
responsive to democratic control within
the United States if it wasn't that
analysts Society
well first we should be a little clearer
clear about terminology you refer to the
Pentagon as is usually done as a defense
organization and in fact I remember very
well in 1947 when the National Defense
Act was passed that established the
current system of war making the former
War Department the the American
Department concerned with war at that
period up to that time was always
honestly the War Department and it had
branches and its name was changed in
that act to the Defense Department and
any sophisticated person and I don't I
was a student then and didn't think I
was very sophisticated but I knew and
everyone knew that this meant that to
whatever extent that the American
military had been involved in defense in
the past and partially it had been so
this was now over since it was being
called the Defense Department that
matter was going to be a department of
aggression nothing else would've never
believed anything to that's officially
denied right sort of on the assumption
that were well essentially had captured
the nature of the modern state and
that's exactly the case I mean the
Pentagon is in no sense a Defense
Department
it's not has never defended the United
States from anyone it has only served to
conduct aggression
and I think that the American people
would be much better off without a
Pentagon I don't they certainly don't
need it for defense
I think it's intervention in
international affairs has never been
well you know never is a strong word but
I think you can you would be hard put to
find a case certainly it has not been
its characteristic opposed to support
the freedom or Liberty or to defend
people and so on that's not the role of
the of the massive military organization
that is controlled by the Defense
Department rather it's its tasks are are
to both quite anti-social the first is
to preserve an international system in
which what are called American interests
which primarily means business interests
can flourish and secondly it has an
internal economic test I mean the
Pentagon has been the primary Keynesian
mechanism whereby the government
intervenes to maintain what is
ludicrously called the health of the
economy by by it's by inducing
production that means production of
waste now both of those both of those
functions serve certain interests in
fact dominant interests class in
troodontid class interests in American
society but don't think that they had
any sense serve the public interest and
I would think that that this system of
the production of waste and the
destruction would essentially be
dismantled in a libertarian Society now
one shouldn't be too glib about this if
let's say a well if one can imagine
what's a social revolution in the United
States that's rather distant I would
assume but if that took place it's hard
to imagine that there would be any
credible enemy from the outside that
could threaten that social revolution we
wouldn't be attacked by Mexico or Hawaii
or something like that it's part of the
United States Cuba let's say the
American Revolution would be would not
require I think defense against
aggression on the other hand if a
libertarian social revolution were to
take place a in Western Europe then I
think the problem of defense would
very critical because I mean it cannot
surely be inherent in the anarchist idea
that there should be no self defense
because such an accused experiments as
they have been have on the require
actually been destroyed from our third
eyes not yeah but look I think that
these questions have to be cannot be
given a general answer they have to be
answered
specifically relative to specificall
specific history historical an objective
Bishop it's just that I found a little
difficulty in following before the break
your description of the proper
democratic control of this kind of an
organization on the basis that the
defense organization itself would become
some kind of workers cooperative and I
would because I find it a little hard to
see other generals
controlling themselves in a manner which
few would approve of well that's why I
do want to point out the complexity the
issue it depends on the country in a
society and talking about in the United
States one kind of problem arises if
there were a libertarian social
revolution in Europe and I think the
problems you raise would be very serious
because there would be a serious problem
of defense but as I would assume that if
libertarian socialism were achieved at
some level in Western Europe there would
be a direct military threat both from
Soviet Union and from the United States
and the problem would be how that should
be countered that's the problem that was
faced by the Spanish revolution there
there was a direct military intervention
by well really three-pronged by fascists
by communists and by the liberal
democracies of background and the
question how one can defend oneself
against a PAC at this level is a very
serious man however I think we have to
raise the question whether centralized
standing armies with high technology
deterrence are the most effective way to
do that and that's by no means obvious
for example I don't think that a Western
European centralized army would itself
deter say a Russian American attack to
prevent libertarian socialism the kind
of attack that I would quite frankly
expect at some level maybe not military
at least economic nor on the other hand
with a lot of peasants with pitchforks
in Spain we're not only peasants we're
talking about a highly sophisticated
highly urban industrial society and it
seems to me it's best method
method of defense would be its political
appeal to the working class of the in
the countries that were part of the
attack that's part but again I don't
want to be glib it might need tanks it
might need armies and if it does I think
we can be fairly sure that that would
contribute to the possible failure or at
least decline of the revolutionary force
for exactly the reasons you mentioned
that is I think it's extremely hard to
imagine how a how a an effective
centralized army deploying tanks playing
strategic weapons and so on could
function if that's what's required to
preserve the revolutionary structures
and I think they may well not be deserve
if the basic defense is the political
appeal or the feel of the political
economic organization plus we could look
in a little more detail at that you
wrote in one of your essays that in a
decent society everyone would have the
opportunity to find interesting work and
each person would be permitted fullest
possible scope for his talents and then
you went on to ask what more would be
required in particular extrinsic reward
in the form of wealth and power only if
we assume that applying one's talents in
interesting and socially useful work is
not rewarding in itself and I think that
that line of reasoning is certainly one
of the things that appeals to a lot of
people but it still needs to be
explained I think why the kind of work
which people would find interesting and
appealing the fulfilling to do would
coincide at all closely with the kind of
work which is it where needs to be done
if we're to sustain anything like the
standard living which people demand and
are used to well there's a certain
amount of work that just has to be done
if we were to maintain that standard of
living it's an open question how onerous
that work has to be let's recall that
science and technology and intellect
have not been devoted to examining that
question or to overcoming the onerous
and self-destructive character of the
necessary work of society the reason is
that it has always been assumed that
there is a substantial body of wage
slaves who will do it simply because
otherwise they'll starve
however if human intelligence is turn to
the question of how to make the
necessary work of society itself
meaningful we don't know what the answer
will be my guess is that a fair amount
of it can be made entirely tolerable
it's a mistake to think that even
back-breaking physical labor is
necessarily owners many people I
included do it for relaxation if it's
under our own control part time and so
on well this weekend for example I got
it into my head to plant 34 trees in a
meadow act behind the house for example
from the State Conservation Commission
which meant I had to dig 34 holes in the
sand well that's you know for me and
what I do with my time mostly pretty
hard work but I have to admit I enjoyed
it I wouldn't have enjoyed it if I'd had
work norms if I had an overseer if I'd
been ordered to do it a certain moment
and so on on the other hand if it said a
task taken out of just interest fun that
can be done and I think that a good and
that's without any technology without
any you know without any thought given
to how to design work consortium
I put it to you that there may be a
danger that this view of things is a
rather romantic delusion entertained
only by a small elite of people who
happen like professors perhaps
journalists and so on to be in the very
privileged situation of having jobs and
since that they are paid to do what
anyway they like to do that's why I
began with a big if I said we first have
to ask to what extent would be let's
call it the necessary work of society
namely that work which is required to
maintain the standard of living that we
want question first question is to what
extent need this be onerous and
undesirable that's an unknown question I
think much less than it is today but
let's assume there is some extent to
which it remains owners well in that
case the answer is quite simple that
work simply has to be shared has to be
equally shared among people capable of
doing it and beyond that a certain
number of Mencia working on a photo
would be a production line and some of
that is collecting the garbage and if it
turns out that these are really tasks
which people will find no self
fulfillment in incidentally I don't
quite believe that
as I watch people work craftsmen let's
say automobile mechanics for example I
think one often finds a good deal of
pride in work I think and in fact I
think that that kind of pride and work
well done and in complicated work well
done because it takes thought and
intelligence to do it especially when
one is also involved in management of
the enterprise determination of how the
work will be organized what it's for
what its what the purposes of the work
are what will happen to it and so on and
it seems to me all of this can be
satisfying and rewarding an activity
which in fact requires skills and which
the kind of skills that people will
enjoy exercising however I am thinking
hypothetically now suppose it turns out
that there is some residue of work which
really no one wants to do whatever that
may be okay then I say that that residue
of work must be equally shared and
beyond that people will be free to
exercise their talents as they see fit
did you professor that if that residue
were very large as some people would say
it was like it accounted for bad work
involved in producing 90% of what we all
want to consume then the organization of
sharing it on the basis that everybody
little did a little bit of all the nasty
jobs would become wildly inefficient
because after all even the nasty job you
had to be trained to do and equipped to
do and that the efficiency of the whole
economy would suffer and therefore the
standard living which it sustained would
be produced well for one thing not what
I mean I think this is really quite
hypothetical because I don't believe
that the figures are anything like that
as I say it seems to me that if human
intelligence were devoted to asking how
technology can design to fit be designed
to fit the needs of the human producer
instead of conversely that is now we ask
how the human being with his special
properties can be fitted into a
technological system designed for other
ends namely production for profit my
feeling is that if that were done we
would find that the really unwanted work
is far smaller than you suggest but
whatever it is let's say whatever amount
it is notice that we have two
alternatives one alternative is to have
it equally shared the other is to design
social institutions so that some group
of people will be simply compelled
do that work on pain of starvation those
are the two alternatives
well now given us felt not compelled to
do it but they might agree to do it
voluntary because they were paid to do
it in a month which they felt made it
was but well but you see I'm assuming
that everyone essentially gets the
essentially equal remuneration don't
forget that we're not talking about a
society now where the perhaps you are
where the people who are do the owners
work are paid substantially more than
the people who do the work that they do
on choice quite the opposite
at the way our society works way any
class society works the people who do
the unwanted work of the ones were paid
least that is that work is done and we
sort of put it out of our minds because
it's assumed that there will be a
massive class of people who cannot whose
only who control only one factor of
production mainly their labor and have
to sell it and they'll have to do that
work because they have nothing else to
do and they'll be paid very little for
it now one can imagine so let's I accept
the correction let's imagine three kinds
of society one the current one in which
the undesired work is given to wage
slaves that's the current system let's
imagine a second system in which the
undesired work after the best efforts to
make it meaningful the undesired work is
shared and let's imagine a third system
where the undesired work receives high
extra pay so that individuals
voluntarily choose to do it well it
seems to me that either of the two
latter systems are consistent with
vaguely speaking anarchist principles I
myself would argue for the second rather
than the third but either of the two is
quite remote from any present social
organization or any tendency in
contemporary social organization
let me put development to in another way
it seems to me that there is a
fundamental choice however one disguises
it as to whether you organize work for
the satisfaction that it gives the
people do it or whether you give
organize it on the basis of the value of
what is produced to the people who are
going to use or consume what is produced
and that a society which as it were was
organized on the basis of giving
everybody the maximum opportunity to
fulfil their hobbies which is
essentially the work for work sake who
finds its logical combination here in a
monastery where as it were the kind of
work which is done is namely prayer is
work for the self enrichment of the work
and where nothing is produced which is
of any use to anybody and do we live
either from those standards living will
you actually starve well there are some
factual assumptions here and I disagree
with you with other factual assumptions
my feeling is that part of what makes
work meaningful
is that it does have use that its
products do have use work the work of a
craftsman is in part meaningful to that
craftsmen because of the intelligence
and skill that he puts into it but also
in part because the work is useful and I
might say the same is true with
scientists I mean the fact that the kind
of work you do may lead to something
else that's what it means in science you
know may contribute to something else
that's very important quite apart from
the elegance and beauty of what you may
achieve and I think that that covers
every field of human endeavor
furthermore I think that if we look at a
good part of human history we'll find
that people to a substantial extent did
get some degree of satisfaction often a
lot of satisfaction from the productive
and creative work that they were doing
and I think that the chances for that
are enormous ly enhanced by
industrialization why precisely because
much of the most meaningless drudgery
can be taken over by machines which
means that the scope for really creative
human work is substantially enlarged now
you speak of work freely undertaken as
hobby but I don't believe that I think
work freely undertaken can be useful
meaningful work done well also you pose
a dilemma which many people pose between
the desire for satisfaction and work and
the desire to create things of value to
the community but it's not so obvious
that that's a dilemma that that's
contradiction it's by no means clear in
fact I think it's a false that
contributing to the enhancement of
pleasure and satisfaction and work is
inversely proportional to contributing
to the value investor portable but it
might be unrelated I mean take some very
simple thing like selling ice creams on
the beach
a public holiday it's a it's a service
to society undoubtedly people want the
ice creams they feel hot on the other
hand it's hard to see in what sense
there is a group either Crossman's joy
or a great sense of social virtual
nobility in performing that touch why
wouldn't I must say Atlantis kiss they
were not rewarded for I've seen some
very cheery looking ice cream vendors
you only like the idea a lot of money
and they haven't liked the idea that
they're giving children ice cream which
seems to me a perfectly reasonable way
to spend ones time as compared with
thousands of other occupations that I
can imagine
recall that a person has an occupation
and it seems to me that most of the
occupations that exist especially the
ones that involve what it's called
service that is relations to human
beings have an intrinsic satisfaction
and reward associated with them namely
in the dealings with the human beings
that are involved that's true teaching
and it's true of ice cream vending I
agree that ice cream vending doesn't
require the commitment of intelligence
that teaching does and maybe for that
reason it will be a less desired
occupation but if so it will have to be
shared however what I'm saying is that
our characteristic assumption that
pleasure and work pride and work is
either unrelated to or negatively
related to the value of the output
that's an assumption which is related to
a particular stage of social history
namely capitalism in which human beings
are tools of production is by no means
necessarily true for example you know I
feel if you look at interviews with
workers on assembly lines for example
that have been done over and over again
by people who do industrial psychology
you find that one of the things they
complain about over and over again is
the fact that their work simply can't be
well done the fact that the assembly
line goes through so fast that they
can't do their work properly their pride
and craftsmanship is itself to mean let
me just mention another well I just
happen to look recently at a study of
longevity in some Journal of gerontology
asked me when I was reading that and it
tried to trace the factors that you
could use to predict longevity length of
life and you know cigarette smoking
drinking genetic factors everything was
looked that turned out to the fact that
was the highest predictor and a
successful predictor with job
satisfaction
not people who have nice jobs live long
people who are satisfied with your jobs
now what leads to job satisfaction sit
and I think that makes the deal sense
you know because that's where you spend
your life and that's where your creative
activities are now what leads to job
satisfaction well I think many things
lead to it and the knowledge that you're
doing something useful to the community
is an important part of it which many
people feel I mean many people feel and
many people are satisfied with their
work are people who feel that what
they're doing is important to do they
can be teachers they can be doctors they
can be scientists they can be craftsmen
they can be farmers I mean I think the
feeling that what you're doing is
important is worth doing you know
contributes to those with whom you have
social bonds that's a very significant
factor in in one's personal satisfaction
and over and above that there's the
pride in and the self fulfillment that
comes from a job well done
from simply taking your skills and
putting them to use I don't see any
reason why that should be why that
should in any way harm in fact I should
think that that would enhance the value
of what's produced but let's imagine
still that at some level it does harm
well okay at that point the society the
community has to decide how to make
compromises each individual is both a
producer and a consumer after all and
that means that each individual has to
join in those socially determined
compromises if in fact there are
compromises and again I feel that the
nature of the compromise is much
exaggerated because of the distorting
prism of the a really course of and self
destruct and personally destructive
system images
you say the community has to make
decisions about compromises and of
course communist theory provides for
this in the toe thinking about national
planning decisions about investment
directions of investment and so forth in
an anarchist society it would seem that
that you're not willing to provide for
that amount of governmental
superstructure that would be necessary
to make the plans make the investment
decisions to decide these kind of
compromises into between whether you
give priority to what people want to
consider or whether you give priority to
the work people want to do I don't agree
with it I mean it seems to me that
anarchist or for that matter left
Marxist structures based on systems of
workers councils in Federation provide
exactly the set of levels of decision
making at which decisions can be made
about a national plan similarly state
socialist societies also provide a level
of decision-making looks at a the nation
at which national plans can be produced
there's no difference in that respect
the difference has to do with the with
the participation in those decisions and
control over those decisions the
anarchist and left Marxist views views
like the workers councils theory of say
the council communists who were Marxist
select Marxist in their views those
decisions are made by the informed
working class through their assemblies
and their direct representatives who
live among them and work among them in
the state social assistance the national
plan is made by a by a federal via
national bureaucracy which accumulates
to itself all relevant information makes
decisions offers them to the public and
occasionally every few years puts itself
comes before the public and says you can
pick me or you can pick him but we're
all part of this remote bureaucracy
these are the these are the poles is the
polar opposites within the sort within
the so in fact it is a very considerable
role for the state and possibly even for
not civil servants for bureaucracy but
it's the control every that's different
well actually I don't as I say I don't
really believe that we need a
separate bureaucracy to carry out the
governmental decision you need vessels
of expertise oh yeah but experts the
expertise is very much
let's take expertise with regard to
economic planning ok this certainly in
any complex industrial society there
should be a group of technicians whose
task is to produce plans and to lay out
the consequences of decisions to show
and explain to people who have to make
the decisions that if you decide this
you're going to likely get this
consequence because that's what our
linear programming model shows and so on
but the point is that those planning
systems are themselves well they're
industries and they are simply part of
the they will have their workers
councils and they will be part of the
whole council system and one and the
distinction is that these planning
systems do not make decisions they
produce plans in exactly the same way as
automakers produce autos the plans are
then available for the for the workers
councils and council assemblies the same
way that autos are available to write in
now of course what this does require is
an informed and educated working class
but that's precisely what we were
capable of achieving in advanced
industrial societies this is really
basically the last question which is how
far does the success of libertarian
socialism or anarchism is whether really
depend on a fundamental change in the
nature of man both in his motivation his
altruism and also in his knowledge and
sophistication I think it not only
depends on it but in fact the whole
purpose of libertarian socialism is that
it will contribute to it it will
contribute to a spiritual transformation
precisely that kind of great
transformation in in the way humans
conceive of themselves and their ability
to act to decide to create to produce to
inquire precisely that spiritual
transformation that social thinkers from
the left Marxist tradition from Lexus
Luxembourg say on overthrew
anarcho-syndicalist have always
emphasized so on the one hand it
requires that spiritual transformation
on the other hand
that its purpose is to create
institutions which will contribute to
that transformation in the nature of
work the nature of creative activity
simply in social bonds among people and
through this interaction of creating
institutions which permit new aspects of
human nature to flourish and then the
building of still further libertarian
institutions to which these liberated
human beings can contribute this is the
evolution of socialism as as I
understand it and very finally presence
key what do you think of the chances of
societies along these lines coming into
being in the major industrial countries
of the West as we refer to them in the
next quarter century with it I don't
think I'm wise enough or informed enough
to make predictions and I think the
predictions probably reflect personality
more than judgment or generally about
such poorly understood matters but I
think this much at least we can say
there are obvious tendencies in
industrial capitalism towards
concentration of power in narrow
economic empires and in what is
increasingly becoming a totalitarian
state
these are tendencies that have been
going on for a long time and I don't see
anything stopping them really I think
those tendencies will continue they're
part of the stagnation and decline of
capitalist institutions now it seems to
me that that development towards state
totalitarianism and towards economic
concentration and of course they're
linked will continually lead to
revulsion to efforts at personal
liberation and to organizational efforts
at social liberation and they'll take
all sorts of forms I mean throughout all
of Europe in fact there are in one form
or another there is a call for what's
sometimes called worker participation or
co-determination or even sometimes work
of control now most of these efforts are
minimal I think that they're misleading
and in fact may even undermine efforts
for the working class to liberate itself
but in part they respond they're
responsive to and in a strong intuition
and understanding
that coercion and oppression whether by
private economic power or by the state
bureaucracy is by no means a necessary
feature of human life and the more of
those concentrations of power and
authority continue the more we will see
revulsion against them and efforts to
organize to overthrow them sooner or
later they'll succeed
I hope so it's going to be a time of
turmoil perhaps also of as you would say
it's of creativity professor Chomsky
thank you very much
