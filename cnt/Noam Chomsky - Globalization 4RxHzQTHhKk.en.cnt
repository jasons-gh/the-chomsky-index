globalization first of all what is it
you know I mean globalization just
misused neutrally globalization just
means international integration okay
everybody's in favor of it and it's been
the core principle of the left and the
working-class movement since their
origins that's why every union is called
an international okay everybody's in
favor of globalization now the term has
been appropriated by a narrow sector of
power and privilege to refer to their
version of international integration the
investor rights version and that makes
sense for them to try to buy you know to
own the term because anyone who's
opposed to their version then becomes
anti-globalization meaning some kind of
primitive who wants to go back to the
Stone Age or something like that
it's a bad error on the part of the
critics of this investor rights version
of integration to accept the term
anti-globalization they should not we're
all in favor of globalization the
question is is it going to be an
interesting the interests of private
power but everybody's in favor of it
okay like nobody's opposed to the fact
that you can call up your friend and
Italy or something like that that's
integration right now has internet just
using the term neutrally now what has it
increased there hasn't decreased well
you know in many respects it's
decreasing so if you look at
international economic integration there
are a lot of different measures I mean I
mentioned one there's a technical
measure which is convergence towards a
single price and wage single market
well that's declining during the period
of the last 25 years has been declining
furthermore it's predicted to decline
even further okay so the investor rights
version of globalization is predicted by
its advocates to lead to less
globalization in the technical sense
more globalization in their sense means
they have control more of the wealth and
power in the world so that's one
question take what Adam Smith meant by
it okay are you supposed to love Adam
Smith the core of free trade
Adam Smith is what he called free
circulation of labour meaning people can
go wherever they want if you don't have
that he can't begin to talk about free
trade well if we measure that what's
happened to globalization well it turns
out the peak period was about over a
century ago relative to population the
ability of people to move around was
higher then than it's ever been since
not for pretty reasons incidentally I
don't mean that the reasons were nice
the reasons were that people from who
are fleeing the horrors of the
Industrial Revolution in Europe could
come to the United States and Massacre
the population and take over their lands
okay like it wasn't a pretty reason but
the fact just in terms of movement of
people across borders is that it was
higher then than it is now and that's
why I'm you know my parents didn't end
up in a gas chamber okay because there
was a lot of globalization in the sense
of movement across borders that's
declined and if I what has any on the
other hand other by other measures
globalization has increased very fast
like movement of capital so increase of
capital flow across borders has just
increased escalated astronomically in
the last 25 years many international
economists mainstream ones can assume
conclude that that's a substantial part
of the reason why the International
weather performance of the International
economy has been so poor in the last 25
years and it has by almost every
macroeconomic measure the performance of
the economy is worse than the past 25
years than it was in the preceding 25
years considerably the period that's
called globalization the last 25 years
has seen a decline in just about
everything
rate of growth rate of investment even
the rate of growth of trade has declined
in the last 25 years and a lot of
economists attribute that to the
increased financial volatility the huge
increase in capital flows across borders
in fact this period of globalization
what's called globalization past 25
years it was really initiated by the
breakdown of capital controls the
Bretton Woods system the preceding 25
years was based on control of capital
movements you know the countries could
control capital movements and currencies
were regulated relative to one another
within a pretty narrow band which backs
speculation and that was a period of
huge growth the period since has been
much worse
so by that measure freedom of movement
is a speculative speculation on against
currencies that kind of thing capital
flow of foreign exchange movement that's
just escalated enormous ly so by that
measure there's more globalization you
measure by people less globalization by
capital movement more globalization in
fact this very you see it very
dramatically in the us-mexico relation
so the us-mexico border is of course an
artificial border like just about every
word it was established by conquest ok
u.s. conquered half of Mexico that gives
you the border that's been a very porous
border throughout history people go up
and back pretty freely in both
directions for all kinds of reasons
it was militarized in 1994 under
Clinton's operation gatekeeper that it
was militarized in order to stop the
movement of people across the border
that is to cut back international
integration why in 1994 well because
that was the year when NAFTA was
initiated NAFTA is called claimed to be
something that increases integration
between Mexico and the United States but
not people by measured by people it cuts
back the flow that's why you had to
militarize the border why did they want
to militarize the border well because
what they predicted in Mexico is what's
called an economic miracle from NAFTA
which means a disaster for most of the
population what was predicted was that
the effect of NAFTA on Mexico would be a
devastating blow to the majority of the
population which is in
it happened wages have dropped
precipitously hundreds of thousands of
people driven off the land investment
has declined though foreign investment
is increased and in general it's been a
kind of a economic miracle economic
miracle means that for a small sector
wealthy people and for foreign investors
it's fantastic that's the definition of
a miracle for most of the populations
been awful and they expected that and
that's why you had to militarize the
border so did that increased integration
or decrease it well yeah it's an
ideological question depends what you
want to measure when you're militarize a
border to prevent people from moving
freely by adam smith's measure it
decreases it okay by the measure of you
know the owners of the economy it
increases that they make more profit
what about trade you know everybody
reads the trade increased between Mexico
and the United States did it well not by
Adam Smith's measures before NAFTA you
know in 1993 there was plenty of
so-called there was plenty of movement
of commodities across the border but
about 50 percent of it was internal to a
firm okay that's not trade okay at least
by classical economic measures that's no
more trade than if General Motors move
something from Indiana to Illinois you
know if internal to it a latarian
institution a command economy you move
something and it happens across a border
that's not trade in any meaningful sense
well it was 50 percent before NAFTA now
it's about 66 percent so what about
actual trade you know trade in some
meaningful sense well you know nobody's
measured it but I wouldn't be surprised
if it's declined yeah we don't know that
it's even grown even as fast as it was
growing before and intra firm transfers
are only a small part of centrally
managed interactions there's also what
are called strategic alliances you know
like IBM and Toshiba makes some deal or
there's what's called outsourcing when a
corporation
uses some small non-unionized outfit
somewhere to make things very cheaply
and they don't have to worry about wages
and benefits but they control it and if
it happens to cross borders that still
centrally managed well there haven't
been any really careful analyses that
I'm aware of but the few studies that
have been done ones I think workings
institution estimated at around 70% of
cross-border interactions are probably
centrally managed in one fashion or
another you know intra firm or strategic
alliances or you know outsourcing or
other devices actually you could only
get answers to this one if anybody
studied it and nobody studies it and to
if you could get into the the old
question firmer question if you can get
into the internal workings of the pellet
Arian institutions that are running the
command economies that are running it
but these estimates are probably and
somewhere in the right ballpark which
means that very little of what's going
on across borders is trade in any
serious sense
some things are have definitely declined
like movement of people in the case of
NAFTA not just by accident by
militarizing the border just there two
ago Bush announced further
militarization of the border
that's cutting back international
integration I mean pretext is drugs but
you know that's pretext for anything the
so you just can't answer these questions
simply about globalization there's just
too many different ways of looking at it
if you look at it from the point of view
of people's interests
looks very different than if you look at
it from the point of view of investors
interests just totally different will
there be a change over the future well
you know that's nobody can predict human
affairs at all so much depends on what
people like you decide to do it's a
question of will and choice
