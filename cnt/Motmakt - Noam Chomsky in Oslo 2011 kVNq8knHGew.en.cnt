Hello and welcome to Motmakt's event here at Litteraturhuset:
Noam Chomsky - Beyond State Socialism.
We are fortunate to have Professor Noam Chomsky with us for a session -
- with the theme of libertarian socialism and libertarian organization.
Many of you who are familiar with Noam Chomsky are aware that he in addition to being -
- a professor of linguistics also is a libertarian socialist; just like us in Motmakt.
We are therefore naturally delighted and proud to have him here tonight.
Tonight Chomsky will participate in a conversation with Adrien Wilkins from Motmakt.
They will have a conversation for about an hour and a half -
- and we will have time for three questions from the audience.
Everyone here have been offered to put questions to Chomsky -
- and we have picked three people who get to do that when the conversation is over.
We have a very strict schedule and delays so there will not be time for any more questions.
And finally: After the event you should go check out our book stand -
- where we sell a lot of exciting Chomsky titles and other cool books.
Now it only remains for me to wish a warm welcome to Professor Noam Chomsky!
As I said, there are three people here tonight who have been selected to ask questions to Chomsky.
We start with a question from Johannes Bennetzen.
Next question is from Sveinung Legard. It is you.
I am coming back there so you get the microphone.
Say your name.
