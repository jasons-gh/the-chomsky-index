this new monstrosity will almost
completely encircle the town which will
it for me strangled with the nine city
of Kenya the Israeli side of the road
providing these settlers in the West
Bank with easy access to Jerusalem and
beyond the israel-palestinian side of
course Israeli army has no access to
Jerusalem part of the moving those who
live like dogs to the east forum step
towards voluntary transfer well actions
like these which take place Volvo to the
West Bank hand insignificant in
comparison with the savage cruelty of
the torture yes needless to say what
it's taking place in the young diva
territories daily is vastly more
significant than the words that are
exchanged in Annapolis
so vacuous coming however the the
transpired was thank you as the
Annapolis conference is not entirely
without injures one point of interest is
location the u.s. Naval Academy there
are other being places and
padaria told but there's only one that's
responsible for sending major battle
groups to Menace the coasts of Iran it's
a critical component of the criminal
threats of force against the criminal it
was barely concealed that the purpose of
the meeting in Annapolis was to bring
together both the moderates that is the
brutal dictatorships and fundamentalist
extremists who the United States types
of favor those are moderates and
conventional discourse they're supposed
to form an alliance against Iran which
has been a hated enemy ever since it
broke free of us for over 90 s 0 v9 some
backgrounds will do it Iran's refusal to
follow orders is now so dangerous that
commentators are proclaiming excitedly
that we're entering the Cold War 2 as
the u.s. seeks to control to contain
Iranian influence to establish a bowl
against Iran's growing influence in the
Middle East would the national press
well containing Iranian influence is no
small problem in Iraq good relations
with Iran are welcomed but much of the
majority Shia population the largely
 south is now virtually how to
control the occupying army with the
British throne it also has a good source
of Muslim gratz enormous level
Prime Minister amake Washington's man in
Baghdad met last August with geraniums
Supreme Leader early he and President
managed up front of the jaws and other
senior officials and he thanked 10
around for its positive and constructive
role in Iraq few days before that Afghan
president needs a favor to them the
opsin border of Iran described it ran as
a helper in a solution in his country in
Lebanon 14 goals most Lebanese see
iranian-backed Hezbollah as a legitimate
force defending their country in Israel
Russian post in Palestine Deranian bet
hamas won a free election eliciting
savage punishment of the
population by the us-israeli Alliance
for the crime of coating your own way
another notable episode and was growth
democracy promotion and even in the
moderate state's rule by to us bad
parents mutter sympathy for Iran is
unpleasantly strong so
indicated well worse yet Iran has been
admitted as an observer to the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization which also
includes Russia with enormous resources
and Central Asian states and has called
for removal of the US military presence
on the least us requests to again
observer status was here and China's
even making inroads into the drool and
brown and we study rated moves towards
independence that are called Iranian
influence in a doctrinal system these
definitely do threaten Washington's
control of the world's major oil energy
resources and to stand that guy it's
worthwhile to take the day off for photo
option Annapolis and like the front page
photo that you Anna saw in the New York
Times and elsewhere showing Lawson on
there to the gauging worshipfully the
cited arms would
the official things were different just
keeping the newspaper of record the
theme of the lead story before the date
for the Annapolis meeting with George
Bush's quotes ambitious vision the
two-state peace he is pronounced as his
vision the White House mantra since 2002
to States israeli-palestinian living
side by side in peace and security
actually we're vision appears that half
a dozen times in the article that's an
important for the journalistic
convention previous presence that
presidents had ideas proposals
continuing to see you receive standard
version there are barriers to realizing
the bushes vision that one is that Hamas
rejects the vision and seeks only the
destruction of Israel although other
Arabs like the Saudis are slowly coming
along and the Annapolis meeting is
supposed to provide solid evidence of
that slow Arab reconciliation this
time's jerusalem correspondent Steven
Erlanger that maybe even
boss the Palestinians are desperate
because they are a dead end times
columnist Roger common explain they've
been losers over the last six decades to
ineptitude corruption and eric hypocrisy
that's arm the Israeli soul and is
frustrated Washington's best efforts of
brokering a settlement and so it
continues without putting any more the
u.s. is the honest broker digital seeks
peace but is threatened with terror and
destruction although some Arabs are
slowly beginning to consider the
peaceful accommodation for which the
United States and this Israeli Hal I
have yearned for so many years and has
become the
with us mantra under bush well notably
missing from the impressive stream of
rhetoric are any facts and is a good
reason for that tax or main they're
inconvenient I'll very briefly review
the record with apologies for most of
new mature familiar with the history so
let's begin with the slow Arab
reconciliation which is being in
Annapolis actually began 35 years before
and was when Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat offered Israel full history in
accord with what was an official US
policy this was in return for israeli
withdrawal in the northeast signed out
of cyanide egyptian cyanide where the
Labour government though was violently
expelling a thousand farmers destroying
two towns cemeteries
in the desert to build the wall to the
city of yummy string of human semen
surrounding Israel recognized so that's
proposal to be a genuine peace offer but
decided rejected Henry Kissinger one an
internal bureaucratic battle in the
United States and the u.s. adopted his
position called stalemate nah
negotiations just for supporting
Israel's rejection of the offer that was
a fateful decision
the history of this confrontation by
choosing expansion instead of peace
Israel established the fundamental
relation of dependence on a farm master
and that's a decision that exists with
bitter consequences well the slow Arab
reconciliation which again in 1931
continued in 1976 when the leading Arab
states growth of the United Nations
Security Council resolution calling for
estate settlement on the internationally
recognized border with guarantees for
the security of every state of Rio
