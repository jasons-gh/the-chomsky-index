lots of different I go question from the
clothes as much support do you say now
I've read and while interviewed me with
you I actually have to apologize if in
my court separate disorder then I'm
always sure who made it have you said
about the bottom in a meeting so knowing
that the issues that have been quite
series actually extremely serious is
sort of good that you used mostly
convert the free velocity of eg for
orkut meetings in terms of the issues
that are both on the table but now you
said that this social movement is
extremely disorganized it's like a bit
force but I feel this parlor between
being disorganized and being extremely
serious while the other you have an
extremely organized force is why people
don't know if this is a question of
everybody yes and reactive so can people
just organized something serious
basically yeah in fact it takes take
even the meetings of the world social
forums i'ma finish you've been there but
good you go to the meeting for the world
social forum there by now maybe hundred
thousand people there plus many more on
the side tivities that are going on the
Via Campesina but if you look of it look
what's happening there are intense
discussions on various constructive ones
about a huge variety of issues and they
themselves are separate
so the people who are there are groups
that are working on some how would you
organize a future cooperative society to
overthrow current institutions there are
others or organized around how can we
ensure that peasants have control of
their own seeds others are concerned
with the gay rights others are working
on environmental issues that may keep
the world from being destroyed but those
are separate discussions they're all
very serious they even one collection of
buildings that are disorganized so I
don't see any and in fact that people
can talk to each other to like give to
you know whatever comes up with in one
group can be assessed with others
although their concentration of interest
is different as it should be so that's a
I just don't see any problem of this
organization and seriousness hasn't done
a good one in fact the organized groups
no they let's say you know when there
are say Marxist organ highly organized
groups with a strict ideology and so on
I don't regard them as particular series
a little bit effective there is serious
in the sense that there a problem
serious problem often but and disrupt it
but they're very very honest so there's
no old communist parties very organized
didn't experience
