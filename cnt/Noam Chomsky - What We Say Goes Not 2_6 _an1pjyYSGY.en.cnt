resources are critical in the world
order and with regard to them by one of
the leading post war planners I fig
Roosevelt planner who continued through
many mostly liberal administration's
later aberle pointed out that if we can
control Middle East oil we can control
the world and therefore it's quite
critical to control Middle East oil very
live issue today that was 1951 the
actually a good part of Cold War history
is a matter of establishing and
safeguarding these principles that's the
real meaning of the word defense and
stability and security and it holds for
the present as well well again it's
quite revealing to look at the immediate
reactions to the US government reactions
to the fall of the Berlin Wall the Bush
administration's wish one immediately
produced a new national security
strategy defense budget and the gist of
them was that they're worth reading but
the gist was that everything's going to
remain the same except the pretext will
change so up until now it was the
Russians are coming no more Russians
we're going to have the same policies
but different predicts in particular
they said we have to maintain what they
call the defense industrial base it's
another euphemism that means high tech
industry high tech industry is sustained
by especially in the early years the
post-war period by a pentagon spending
all under the pretext of the fence so
it's called the defense industrial base
so that has to be maintained we have to
maintain huge military forces not to
defend ourselves from the Russians but
to defend ourselves from I'm quoting
from the technological sophistication of
third world powers we have very
disciplined
intellectual community so nobody left
but with regard to the Middle East the
crucial part was the intervention forces
met the major US intervention forces
since Carter were aimed at the Middle
East and this the early post Cold War
doctrine 1990-91 said well we have to
maintain those intervention forces
directed at the Middle East and then
came an interesting phrase where the
threats to our interests could not be
laid at the Kremlin's door in short
we've been lying to you for 50 years but
the Kremlin's going gone so now we have
to come clean the threats couldn't be
laid at the Kremlin's door the threats
are what's called radical nationalism a
radical nationalism is independent
nationalism it amounts to exercise of
sovereignty and that's unacceptable lung
very traditional principles from the
Second World War of limiting any
exercise of sovereignty within the grand
area the area that we control so we have
to maintain the intervention forces and
that way if you look back at the history
of the of intervention in the Middle
East that's exactly true in fact almost
everywhere the Russians are sometimes
the Chinese were used as a pretext but
the reason almost always was just to
crush any illegitimate exercise of
sovereignty and the phrase illegitimate
is redundant it means any exercise of
sovereignty which is not within the
framework that we tolerate or Institute
all over the world including the Vietnam
War and much else just keeping the
Middle East two crucial countries where
Iran in Iraq Iran as I'm sure you know
had a parliamentary regime which was
overthrown by the United States and
Britain in 1953 because they were trying
to take control their own energy
resources
that's an exercise of sovereignty so
illegitimate iraq was a british
protectorate until nineteen fifty eight
there was a military coup in 1958 of the
karim qassem coup which overthrew the
british client state that caused real
hysteria and the United States and
Britain Eisenhower sent military force
to Lebanon apparently armed with nuclear
weapons the British said of the Jordan
the United States and Britain both
established doctrines the doctrines were
that in the words of the British Foreign
Secretary that the that in the british
protectorate equate which was a source
of a lot of britain's wealth the Britain
would ruthlessly intervene if anything
interfered with its control over quate
and Mara what it was you know internal
democratic uprising or anything and the
United States announced the same
doctrine for Saudi Arabia where the big
guy so we take the big prize there the
little guy they take the little price
that was nineteen fifty eight the
concern at the time was that the cousin
coup that might which was secular
nationalist both the United States and
Britain were consistently supporting
extremist fundamentalist regimes and
forces that's runs all the way through
what they were worried about was secular
nationalism that's the worst enemy
because it might take over its own their
own resources for regional development
that's what NASA threatened that's why
he was equated with Hitler in fact and
the chasm coup was interpreted by the
United States as NASA right there was no
evidence for
and in fact beyond it was interpreted as
a kremlin plot to destroy the west by
inspiring the arab states to take over
their own resources and use them for
regional development where of course
there are our resources and we need him
for our wealth and power the United
States wasn't having any of that the by
1960 35 years later a Kennedy organized
a military coup CIA coup I which
overthrew the the Kassam regime that was
the first u.s. collaboration with Saddam
Hussein which was involved in it and
with the Baath Party the CIA gave the
coup regime the names of large number of
leftists called communists they were
slaughtered also hundreds of
professionals and political figures that
standard operating procedure exactly the
same thing was done in Indonesia two
years later the continuing with Iraq in
skip some intervening events in 19 and
Iran in 1979 some of the system was
really severely shaken up there was a
revolution in iran which overthrew the
tyrant that the u.s. had installed in
1953 the show and iran started on a
paths of independent development and
exercise of sovereignty intolerable of
course the US reacted at once Carter try
who was then president tried to
instigate a military coup when that
failed the US turned to support of its
friend Saddam Hussein who invaded Iraq
was a bitter brutal war in 1982 Reagan
removed Iraq from the list of states
that support terror
which is a perfectly arbitrary list so
as to enable the United States to
provide needed aid to Saddam for his war
against Iran and it was a brutal vicious
Wars Saddam used weapons of mass
destruction no threats he used them a
chemical warfare hundreds of thousands
of Iranians killed we've kind of
forgotten all these things conveniently
but Iranians remember them and talk
about them the u.s. backing for Saddam
was so excited on later turned the
weapons on his own on Iraqis they're
called his own people but they're not on
Kurds in Iraq that was the landfall
massacres and the Halabja massacre the
Reagan administration denied that Iraq
did it we had to support our friend
tried to blame him on Iran facts are
unambiguous and known Reagan was able to
block congressional action to punitive
action by 1987 the u.s. entered the word
directly and effectively won the war for
Iraq Iran capitulated the friendship of
the United States and Saddam was so
intimate that Iraq was given license to
do something that no other state in the
world has other than Israel namely to
attack a u.s. ship and kill dozens of
seamen Israel did it in 1967 they
attacked the USS liberty the u.s. kind
of pretended it didn't happen and in
1987's I'm saying did attacked the u.s.
USS start operating in the Gulf killed I
think 37 seamen and got away with the
light tap on the wrist after all friends
have to take care of each other that was
nineteen eighty-seven Iran capitulated
once the US had entered the war and you
after the war was over us support for
Saddam increased we now moved to george
bush
in 1989 Bush invited Iraqi nuclear
engineers to the United States for
advanced training and nuclear weapons
production in and also expanded more aid
to Iraq partly because at us
agricultural interests were benefiting
from it agricultural system had been
seriously harmed by the war and
particularly by the atrocities against
the Kurds so they needed agricultural
aid in april nineteen ninety Bush
President Bush sent high-level
senatorial delegation to Iraq led by
Robert dole who was later Republican
presidential candidate and their mission
was to convey bushes greetings to his
friend Saddam and to assure Saddam that
he could ignore the critical comments he
might hear from irresponsible
journalists in the US press we have this
freedom of speech business here can't
shut him up but just ignore them because
they don't mean anything that was read
the transcript the transcript has been
available for a long time it is really
embarrassing fawning before so dumb that
was dole senator Simpson other
distinguished figures that was april
nineteen ninety a couple of months later
in august 1990 Saddam made his first
mistake all of the things that I just
described were fine he made his first
mistake he disobeyed orders are more
likely misunderstood them and he invaded
Kuwait as the the US took that as a
opportunity okay we're going to show the
world what happens if somebody disobeys
orders the we know pretty much what the
US was concerned about at the time Colin
Powell who is the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs warned an internal discussion
that what's likely to happen he said is
that Saddam will withdraw leave a puppet
regime behind and the Arab states will
all applaud and we're not going to allow
that to happen in fact if that had
happened it would almost duplicate what
the United States had just done a couple
of months earlier in Panama there was
minor thug in Panama who would had
disobeyed orders so there was invaded
Panama bombed the slums killed probably
a couple thousand people many more than
said I'm kill them kuwait as far as we
know and manage to kidnap the bad guy
brought him to the United States where
he was tried for crimes that he
committed almost entirely while he was
on the CIA payroll nobody blinked an
eyebrow at that and they established a
puppet regime the only difference
between that and what Powell projected
for queit is that the Latin hiring
States weren't happy in fact they
bitterly condemned it and refused to
accept the the u.s. client regime as one
of the democratic states of the region
in the organization and in fact this day
panama commemorates a day of mourning on
the day of the invasion every years
never reported here but anyway so dumb
they were afraid i might try something
like that and that couldn't be allowed I
said I'm realized pretty quickly that
he'd made a bad mistake and he began to
try to offer various negotiations
possibilities the press was disciplined
enough not to report them there was one
newspaper long on Newsday a suburban
paper in New York which was getting
leaks from from the government nobody
leaks anything to Long Island Newsday
they leaked to New York Times but Long
Island Newsday actually happens to be on
the New York newsstands so there were
headlines saying you know Saddam offers
