it's a Stannis's straight to Tillet
aryan concept it was used it's used in
totalitarian states like in the Soviet
Union the harshest criticism against
dissidents was their anti Soviet okay so
as a Sahara was any Soviet because he
could attack the crimes of the Kremlin
was evinced the Russian people with the
answer Russian culture that was
associates and saying the Russian people
are awful and quite contrary to Russian
nationals extreme Russian nationals but
they were anti-russian because they were
condemning to the crimes of the state
and totalitarian states do identify
themselves for the nature of
totalitarianism with the society the
culture you know the people and so on I
know only one democratic country nor
less democratic country which has adopts
this totalitarian concept that's the
United States
I suppose that somebody him say Italy it
condemns Berlusconi and they were called
anti Italian I think would collapse and
laughter in the streets when I had
tagging he's attacking burrows moment
but in a totalitarian culture like
Western intellectual culture if you
attack the holy state you must be Adi
America I said I don't know any example
other than nothing like King Ahab or the
Soviet Union or say the Brazilian
military dictatorship under the
Brazilian military dictatorship if you
Chris has torture your auntie Brazilian
it's a totalitarian concept what's quite
interesting about the United States and
England and what part of Europe is that
this totalitarian concept is accepted
uncritically with regard to the United
States there are even books by people
you know considered liberal scholars
Nepal Hollander if you massive respected
scholar called the anti Americans who
are the aunty Americans run through the
list of people criticize government
policy ok if you're a deeply committed
to
terian so deeply you can't see it that's
in the American
