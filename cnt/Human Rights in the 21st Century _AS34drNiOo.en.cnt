well good evening ladies and gentlemen
and welcome to the London School of
Economics to those who have come from
outside the school there was a couple
who came down from Scotland and have
been queuing since midday for this
lecture and we were pleased that they
were we were able to get them in we have
two other lecture theatres where this is
being podcast or webcast and I think you
can also see it on your computer on the
LSE system so there are a large number
of people which of course is entirely a
testament to the popularity of our
speaker this evening professor Noam
Chomsky I should say that this lecture
is held under the auspices of our Centre
for the study of human rights and of
course professor Chomsky subjects this
evening is human rights in the 21st
century and we couldn't have anybody
more appropriate to handle that tricky
subject than Noam Chomsky I'm not going
to read out the titles of his 40 books
on linguistics and his similar number of
books on foreign policy issues indeed
I'm extremely hesitant about introducing
him at all since almost certainly I will
make some error in grammar or syntax
which will reveal some dark secrets
about my ancestry but I think that noam
chomsky epitomizes what we aim to do at
the LSE in that he is if you like the
personification of the engaged academic
someone whose scholarship is
unquestioned quality but who also
throughout his academic life has
remained engaged with the great issues
of the day he has been a professor at
MIT since 1955 when I was only just
alive and continues to lecture and teach
there as well of course as producing a
remarkable number of publications and
commentaries on the passing scene so
without any more an introduction I'm
delighted to welcome professor Chomsky
he will talk to us and then take
questions afterwards you are very
welcome to the school
a few hours ago I was on a panel at so
asked with an old friend Polly I'm
talking about foreign policy in the
Middle East and I was supposed to talk
on u.s. foreign policy and he was
supposed to talk on British foreign
policy he opened by saying it's easy
there isn't any applying to say the same
thing about the human rights and the
imperialism but is rather rooted in the
South more deception as it is in the
World Summit version but not the version
preferred by the West the crucial
paragraphs of the World Summit
Declaration everyone agrees our
paragraphs 138 139 their provisions had
never been seriously contested and in
fact had been affirmed and implemented
for example with regard to apartheid
South Africa that furthermore the
Security Council had already determined
that it can even use force under Chapter
7 to end massive human rights abuses
civil war violation of civil liberties
and so on these are resolutions 925 929
940 mid-1994 and as a number of analysts
legal analysts have rightly observed
that most states are signatories to
conventions that legally obliged them to
respect the human rights of their
citizens r2p
section not mentioned is the United
States it's therefore not surprising at
all that the General Assembly adopted
the summit declarations while the sharp
north-south split on the so-called right
of humanitarian intervention persisted
without any change well the second
version of r2p in the Evans report
differs fundamentally from the summit
declaration in it's crucial paragraph
the Commission considers the situation
on quote in which the Security Council
rejects a proposal or fails to deal with
it in a reasonable time in that case the
report author
action within area of jurisdiction by
regional or sub regional organizations
under Chapter eight the Charter subject
to their seeking subsequent
authorization from the Security Council
now that paragraph is plainly was
written to apply retrospectively to the
bombing of Serbian just what was
forcefully rejected by the global South
and the world summer version of r2p this
provision of the Evans Commission
effectively authorizes the powerful and
nobody else to use force that will and
the reason is very clear
the powerful unilaterally determined
their area of jurisdiction so the OAS
and the Union they can't do it but NATO
can and does so NATO unilaterally
determined that its area of jurisdiction
includes the Balkans but rather
interestingly their area of jurisdiction
does not include NATO itself we're at
about the same time as shocking crimes
were committed against Kurds in
southeastern Turkey throughout the 90s
all off the agenda because the decisive
military and diplomatic support for them
was by the leader of the free world it's
peaking in the very year when it was
praised for its the noble phase of its
foreign policy with a saintly glow of
course with the aid of other NATO powers
so plainly that couldn't be included
NATO later determined that its area of
jurisdiction extends to Afghanistan
that's what's being debated now an
effect will be on the Secretary General
of NATO
Scheffer he informed a NATO meeting in
2007 that NATO troops have to guard
pipelines that transport oil and gas
that's directed to the West and more
generally have to protect sea routes
used by tankers and other crucial
infrastructure of the energy system
that's global on these expansive rights
accorded by the Evans Commission are in
practice restricted to NATO alone
they're radically violating the
principles adopted by the world summit
they explicitly opened the door wide to
resort to r2p as weapon of Imperial
intervention will they fortify the
long-standing us hope and demand that
NATO be regarded as a instrument of us
power part of the reason is to make sure
that Europe doesn't move in an
independent direction no long term
foreign policy concern well let's turn
to the second question how is r2p
applied in practice the answer I won't
run through the details but the answer
will surprise absolutely no one who has
the slightest familiarity with history
or elementary understanding of the
structure of power run through the
highly selective example applications
but just take a couple of examples so
for example there's no thought of
devoting pennies to protect the huge
number of people dying from hunger and
lack of health care or a deprivation of
other rights that are dismissed as myths
and dangerous incitement by Washington
such as the examples I mentioned
protected populations are also barred
from protection for example the victims
of the u.s. Israeli attack in Gaza who
are protected persons under the Geneva
Conventions but merit no protection
under r2p
those who are the direct responsibility
of the Security Council
are also unable to appeal to r2p a
striking example was Iraqis in the 1990s
subjected the murderous sanctions under
the saintly glow of Clinton's policies
and Blair's formally administered by the
Security Council but to the face with us
British sanctions these were condemned
as genocidal by the administrators of
the UN programs the respected
international diplomats Dennis holiday
successor Hans von sponeck both of whom
resigned for that reason or the victims
of the worst massacres of recent years
which are in the eastern Congo and here
only the ultra cynical might suspect
that the neglect has something to do
with the fact that the worst offender is
US ally Rwanda and that the
multinationals are making a mint from
robbing the region's rich mineral
resources with the crucial aid of the
midget militias that are tearing the
place to shreds everyone has a cellphone
is benefiting from that and just as the
rational would expect actually r2p is
rather like what's called democracy
promotion the leading scholar advocate
of democracy promotion and the Reaganite
to Thomas Carruthers he roof release
concludes from his careful enquiries
that the u.s. promotes democracy if and
only that stance conforms to strategic
and economic interests it's a pattern
that runs through all administration's
right to the president he concludes that
leaders are for some strange reason
schizophrenic like they need psychiatric
treatment and he's kind of puzzled about
this critics sometimes speak about
double standards but there's no puzzle
and there's a single standard it was
described accurately enough
Adam Smith we're supposed to Revere but
my breed he was speaking of England and
his day where as he put it the merchants
and manufacturers are the principal
architects of policy and they make sure
that their own interests are most
peculiarly attended to however Grievous
the effect on the people of England but
particularly the victims of what he
called the savage and justice of the
Europeans elsewhere thinking but
specifically of India well a lot has
changed since his day but that principle
remains there's one of the few operative
principles of international and domestic
affairs
there was great indignation last summer
when the president of the General
Assembly Miguel disco toe called a
session devoted to r2p the London
economists warned of the danger that in
their words an angry inconclusive
General Assembly debate might undermine
this idealistic effort to establish a
new humanitarian principle now coming
under attack at the United Nations an
attack that the journal conjured up as I
mentioned virtually nobody opposes r2p
and the forum adopted at the World
Summit those very good reason to oppose
the events commission version and the
Selective application of the summit
declaration The Economist editors were
however encouraged that the angrily
angry opponents they conjured up I
should say I was one they would at least
be countered by one panel member quoting
Gareth Evans a former Australian foreign
minister and roving global
troubleshooter who makes a bold and
passionate claim on behalf of a three
word expression which in large part
thanks to his efforts now belongs to the
language of diplomacy responsibility to
protect and they're owed Evans is
accompanied by a picture is showing in
and on his face grieving that the bold
is bold and passionate claim is coming
under threat and the subtitle says a
lifelong passion to protect well the
journal chose not to run a different
picture from about the same time which
had some light on his lifelong passion
it shows him with his Indonesian
counterpart Polly amethyst joyously
celebrating celebrating the treaty that
they had just signed that granting
Australia the right to rob the oil
resources of what the treaty calls the
Indonesian province of East Timor
retrieve treaty offered nothing to the
people of East Timor their remnants the
ones that managed to survive the
western-backed onslaught on East Timor
and it's furthermore the only legal
agreement anywhere in the world that
effectively recognizes Indonesia's right
to rule East Timor so the Australian
press reported directly as far as I know
now that Evans politest picture is quite
familiar among people who happen to see
a problem when their own countries
provide the decisive support for
aggression that led to one of the worst
slaughters of the modern period the
continuing right through the chorus of
self-congratulation in 1999 at a level
well beyond Kosovo before the NATO
bombing and of course the past record
was far exceeded the atrocities of the
Balkans well that's all an uncomfortable
topic so the factual record is best
avoided or denied as is regularly done
that sometimes in quite remarkable ways
which I won't review well the journals
choice of a photograph should come as no
surprise that 20 years earlier when the
basic facts of the near genocidal
western-backed slaughter when those
facts were quite well-known
the editors described the great mass
murderer and torturer who heart though
as at heart benign which indeed he was
towards far
investors at least and he denounced the
what they called the propagandists for
the gorillas in East Timor and Irian
Jaya with their talk of the armies such
savagery and use of torture that in the
propagandists include the church and a
steam or thousands of refugees in
Australia and Portugal which somehow
journalists couldn't find Western
diplomats and the journalists who did
choose to see the most respected
international rights monitors and more
recently a UN Truth Commission all
propagandists rather than intrepid
champions of human rights because they
had quite the wrong story to tell its
usual criterion and who could be a more
noble and passionate supporter of r2p
then the person who celebrated his
achievement in granting Australia the
rights to the sole resources of the
territory that had been brutalized with
full Australian support while adding the
explanation that it matters little
because the quote the world is a pretty
unfair place littered with examples of
acquisition by force that's all true but
none of this seems to be a matter of
concern for the advocates of
highly-selective r2p and also to the
Western intellectuals who feign great
indignation the other fellows crimes
while easily condoning or denying their
own updating a leading theme of the
inglorious history of intellectuals from
the earliest records well what then are
the hopes for human rights in the new
millennium
I think the answer is the one that does
reverberate through history including
recent years it's not a law of nature
that we have to subordinate ourselves to
the violence and deceit of the principal
architects of policy and the doctrinal
manipulation of the servants of power as
in the past
and aroused and organized public can
carve out space for real concern for
human rights including r2p in fact today
more easily than in the past because
they can benefit from the legacy of past
struggles and their achievements
thank you very much we have time for
some questions so I hope that people
will both catch my eye which you have
done and also we'll wait for a
microphone to come so could we have a
mic on the front row fourth one fourth
person along and if you could give your
name and if you could make sure you
speak pretty loudly but not just for us
but because there are people in other
halls listening and unless you
articulate so articulate it clearly
thank you hi my name is Samir is that
all right yep my question was do you
agree that countries should intervene
when there is a violation for example is
there humanitarian crisis and if so what
would qualify as a humanitarian crisis
that is at what stage does it become the
country was intervening just using
humanitarian as intervention as an
excuse to further its its interest well
I think that the World Summit reached a
good conclusion the same conclusion as
the World Court since 1949 there can be
a right of intervention when it's
authorized by the Security Council if
individual countries except for
themselves the right to use force in
what they call the area of their
jurisdiction which is a right accorded
only to the US and NATO because they can
define their jurisdiction well in that
case I think we get exactly the
consequences that the court and the
global summit and the high-level planet
panel anticipated and which is in fact
happen thank you
next one that yeah guy standing up
hello my name is John Annika form we are
change media a recent scientific paper
published in the peer-reviewed open
chemical physics journal proves the
presence of the military grade in
centenary nano-thermite
in dust samples taken from Ground Zero
this coupled with the opinions of nearly
a thousand architects and engineers that
openly support the controlled demolition
of hypothesis are inconsistent with the
official explanations given by the 9/11
Commission and the subsequent NIST
reports when these explanations have
been contradicted by peer-reviewed
science and have been disputed by so
many experts in the relevant fields how
can you maintain your stance that the
findings of the 9/11 Commission are
correct well what you're referring to is
a statement by a thousand people most of
them basically unknown who claim certain
make certain claims about technical
facts which I'm in no position to
evaluate I don't know if there's
nano-thermite in the bottom of building
seven or if it means anything if there
was and the obvious thing for them to do
is present their findings to the people
who can make evaluations so instead of
sending ten thousand letters to me they
should send them to the civil
engineering department at MIT or other
places or if they should publish your
articles
this publish their article things in
accessible scientific journals just like
other people do so for example
supporters of intelligent design
biologists and there are some they
publish their articles in standard
scientific journals so they can be
discussed and Outsiders like me I don't
know much about bacteria outsiders can
make an evaluation of what these claims
amount to because the debate well that
hasn't happened you could say and you
know thousands of letters tell me that I
should learn enough so that I can make
the judgement myself well you know I
know enough about science to know that
you can't learn enough in a couple hours
on the internet if you want to
understand these things you're going to
have to do what there's a region reason
why say mit has graduate courses and
civil and mechanical engineering and
physics and math I mean you just can't
pick it up by roaming around the
internet and so the question is well
should I take off the time years in fact
to learn the technical background and
study the structural characteristics of
the buildings so that I can make some
evaluation of you know nano-thermite or
whatever it is and I think there's a
good reason not to do that because these
people who are referring to that they
don't seem to understand it are in fact
working very hard to absolve George Bush
and to implicate Saddam Hussein and
Osama bin Laden and the reason is
extremely simple I mean everyone agrees
this is uncontroversial that the
destruction of the World Trade Center
was attributed to Saudis okay now
suppose the Bush administration had done
it they'd have attributed to Iraqis I
mean they're trying very hard to find an
excuse to invade Iraq
and if they had attributed it to Iraqis
it would have been a walkaway they
immediately get total popular support
they get a UN resolution and NATO would
pass a supportive resolution they could
go straight an attack when they
attributed to so bootys first of all
they alienated their most powerful ally
in the region most important ally and
secondly they forced themselves to jump
through hoops to try to concoct some
sort of a pretext for invading Iraq you
know weapons of mass destruction
connections between al-qaeda and Saddam
you know coal business which of course
collapsed exposing them to ridicule and
they also diverted their efforts to a
sideshow invading Afghanistan for which
there was very little purpose and
getting themselves caught up in that and
delaying the invasion of Iraq which they
wanted the first place so they couldn't
have done it short of lunacy and if it's
lunacy you don't want to talk about but
who does who did who did it point to and
who would have gained by attributing the
destruction to Saudis well I can think
of only two people the one is Saddam
Hussein who wanted to divert us attack
on Iraq and the others are song bin
Laden
I'm the city's worst enemies to try to
get the United States to hate Saudis
it'd be wonderful at least I can't think
of anyone else who might have benefited
so it seems to me all these huge efforts
are essentially directed to absolving
the Bush administration and blaming
Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden and I
just don't see any point in taking off
years of study to prove that thanks hi
my name is Frederico I was just
wondering if you could say a little bit
about human right there no women's
rights in the 21st century considering
the fact that the convention of the
discrimination against women is released
ratified and most contested Human Rights
document if you could say a little bit
about yeah women's rights in the 21st
century and I won't
would you say something about the
women's rights in the 21st century given
that the Convention on women's rights is
that one of the least ratified
conventions
well women's rights have improved
considerably in the in the last 50 years
and it wasn't from conventions it was
from activism young people lots of
others picked up things that have a
pretty ancient vintage I really worked
on them in the 1960s and then I and
their aftermath seventies in the 80s and
one result was a very substantial
extension of women's rights it was a
long way to go there's a report just
came out from the world Icahn World
Economic Forum's reported here a couple
days ago ranking countries in terms of
how they deal with women's rights
Britain was I think around 40 is there
something like that so yes there's a
long way to go but there's been a vast
improvement and that's the way human
rights are protected I can't even think
of an exception so it takes a freedom of
speech which is extremely important you
know it's one respect in which the
United States is to my knowledge alone
in the world in setting a high standard
for the freedom of speech way beyond
Britain which has horrible laws and
principles the restrict freedom of
speech but the u.s. does have high
standards they're not in the bill of
rights they did not exist through the
19th and early 20th century they began
to be talked about a little bit in
dissenting judgments in the Supreme
Court around the 1920s and gradually
there were a few comments about it but
they really the court reached a high
standard
in the 1960s now that was in the context
of the civil rights movement in the
context of the civil rights movement the
court addressed a case Sullivan V
Alabama I think it was called which was
a case brought by the state of Alabama
condemning the civil rights movement
Martin Luther King and others for the
crime of seditious libel not seditious
libel goes no way back in history and
it's sustained in most countries like
Britain there's a still a law of
seditious libel effects even been
brought up occasionally in recent years
a seditious libel is assaulting the
state with words okay and a seditious
libel becomes a more serious crime if
the words are true because then it
assaults the state even more dangerous
well in the and that was the charge in
the 1964 case the civil rights movement
had denounced racist sheriffs in Alabama
it's a state and so they were charged
with seditious libel and although out
the Supreme Court and Supreme Court
struck down the law which was a US law
as it is just about everywhere else in
England for example and okay that raised
the standard for civil rights there was
a further improvement not so value
judgment improvement in the standards
least when my judgement in 1969 in a
case involving the Ku Klux Klan you know
a violent vicious racist
terrorist group there were charges
against them for you know speech
incitement and so on racist speech and
the court decided the court reached
essentially the Enlightenment standard
which I think was correct
that speech should be protected up to
participation in imminent crime so for
example if you and I go into a store and
you
and I say shoot that's not protected but
up to participation and an imminent
crime speech should be given protection
well the court did accept that and in
the case of the Klan and I think that's
right and again I think the u.s. is
probably alone in the world and having
such a standard but all of these things
came in the course of popular activism
otherwise it wouldn't have happened just
like women's rights just like minority
rights in fact it's hard to think of a
counter example so yes a long way to go
but tremendous improvement thank you guy
on the third row yeah with a stripy
sweater
my name is pong Thank You professor
for the presentation I totally agree
with you regarding the responsibility to
protect that it needs to go through you
read un se but do you think that that
needs to be like modification of the
university's new United Nations Security
Council since the member who are sitting
in the Security Council for example like
China will always be though intervention
in Burma and the second question
relating to that what do you see in term
of the row of China and the protection
of human rights the first question is
that he agrees with you generally but
says that if it's and if these rights
are need to go through I mean if a
resolution easier to the Security
Council don't you think that the balance
of the Security Council is wrong
particularly with China which will
always veto an intervention in Burma and
secondly what do you think more broadly
about the role of China well there's a
common view that the Security Council is
prevented from acting by China and
Russia but there's an easy way to
determine whether that's true or not
take a look at the record of vetoes that
will take you ten minutes on the
internet and what you will discuss what
you will discover is very
straightforward
up until 1965 the US didn't veto any
resolutions in the early days of the UN
Russia was vetoing all the resolutions
not a very simple answer for the reason
why US power was so extraordinary right
after the Second World War that the UN
was just an instrument of us power and
the United States was using it to beat
Russia so of course they vetoed
everything and that led to an
interesting chapter of academic social
science anthropology and other fields
the leading scholars martyred me two
others developed a series to try to
explain why the Russians were so
negative how come they're saying no all
the time and the main theory that was
developed and you know seriously
discussed was that Russians raised their
children and swaddling clothes and that
makes them negative so when they get the
Security Council they're always saying
no I was a grad student at the time at
Harvard maybe three of us thought that
this was comical we used to call it
diaper ology but that was the that was
the exes serious academic explanation
for the Russian Vitas and in the 50s the
UN became more diverse with
decolonization and with the
reconstruction of the other industrial
societies by the mid 60s it was no
longer a pliable instrument of us power
and that's when the Vitas started from
that point on till the present as you'll
discover if you look the United States
is way in the lead in vetoing Security
Council resolutions Britain is second
and nobody else is even close okay
that's the record of vetoes and of
course the most extreme way to violate
the Security Council resolution is to
veto it and we know exactly who's
responsible well that's not the way it's
usually presented in the academic
literature I remember reading a review
of security vetoes by an eminent Oxford
scholar of international law who pointed
out accurately that the rush
are in the lead and vetoing Security
Council resolutions yeah it's true if
you take the first days of the UN and
you eliminate the last 40 years which
slightly changes the story when you look
in the background so yes there's a
possibility that China might veto
something though I don't I'm not sure
China's ever even cast a veto so but it
could happen on the other hand the main
meat those are the United States and
Britain okay and yes they continue to
block Security Council action I
mentioned a couple of cases before but
it continues all the time and it's
problem so what do you do when say the
take that just take the example I cited
when the UN the United States evita to
Security Council resolutions calling on
all states to observe international law
and supporting the world court judgment
against the United States for massive
international terrorism and when Britain
abstained politely well what do you do
in that case the answer is written much
you can do except by the populations of
the countries the population of the
countries can do a lot they can condemn
it you know they can organize they can
demonstrate they can act they can put
into pen to office a government that
cares about an international law and
international terrorism well nobody did
it and part of the reason why nobody did
it is because nobody knew of that it
wasn't reported it's not discussed you
know you have to go to the court records
or the scholarly literature to see what
happened parts of the scholarly
literature most of it doesn't discuss it
and you know that's the way you get
human rights protected but nobody's
going to carry out an intervention in
the United States nobody's going to
intervene and in the United States and
Britain when they implement genocidal
sanctions in Iraq as they did or when
they invade Iraq a couple years later in
fact what happens is
that the invaders of Iraq are lauded for
their achievement like for example there
they can be nominated to be President of
the European Union to take one one
example ok well the only people who can
do anything about that are the
populations of the countries as far as
China and Burma is concerned I don't
think China a lot of the protecting
Burma I don't think that Chevron should
be one of the major investors in Burma
I'm pretty sure that British Petroleum
is still a major investor in Burma I
know it was up to a couple few years ago
so and those are things we can do about
that we can't do a lot about China we
can do a lot of that Chevron and British
Petroleum and tooth all and so on so
yeah let's take a look at the things we
can do something about and do them and
when we do that we can try to think of
ways in which we can deal with countries
where we can't do anything about the
standard procedure almost like a
definition of intellectual life is the
opposite the standard procedure is let's
torment ourselves about the crimes of
others which we can't do anything about
and let's ignore or deny our own crimes
often much worse ones which we can do a
lot about that's the guy in the t-shirt
which says I love Cannes Australia and
since you since you have a go at the
Australians which of course is
guaranteed to make you popular in
England I think I ought to give him a
chance ok turns out I'm Canadian but I
was wondering my name is Alex I was
wondering if you could comment on the
role of institutions elite academic
institutions like the LSE in society how
you see it and and perhaps what what it
could be as opposed to what it is
incidentally I gave talks about this in
Australia all over the place and they
were very popular one of them was given
in Canberra at the National Press Club
where the world first club that was
broadcast over national television they
liked it so much they repeated it over
national television Australians were not
at all happy about this stuff that it
was here that was very strongly had very
strong opposition in fact the population
of Australia compelled the government in
1999 to start trying to do something
about the atrocities of the government
was supporting any steam war and it
wasn't Australian led a peacekeeping
force that was allowed to enter after
Clinton called off the dogs
now that's another fact that Western
intellectuals can't look at there was 25
years of massive destruction Clinton in
Clinton's view Suharto there was our
kind of guy the US and Britain supported
it right through the atrocities of 1999
which were increasing Britain was the
worst even after the destruction of even
after the European Union had imposed
finally a some kind of embargo on arms
Britain kept supplying them they were
supplying jets to Indonesia this is
called the ethical foreign policy I
think this would was called at that time
but the United States finally under
Clinton under tremendous pressure
international and domestic a lot of the
pressure was coming from the right wing
Catholic Church sources and also popular
groups finally Clinton told the
Indonesians okay the game is over
literally like a couple of words they
instantly withdrew and allowed a
peacekeeping force to enter an
Australian let peacekeeping force to
enter without resistance well what does
that tell you about the preceding 25
years tells you a lot but try to find
somebody who mentions it because it
tells you too much about ourselves and
therefore
it's off the agenda that's not about
your question I thought the question you
really you would answer I mean you know
way more about the LSE than I do so you
can evaluate what butts roll isn't what
it does I mean I could tell you
something about universities I know
better like my own for example well my
own is an interesting case it's it's not
it's a it's a school of engineering and
science
LSE but and I've been there for over
fifty five years so I've seen it undergo
a lot of changes in the 1950s it was
about a hundred percent supported by the
Pentagon in fact I was there in a
laboratory that was a hundred percent
supported by the three armed services
now interestingly it was probably the
freest university in the country I mean
I was able to survive at MIT with my own
political activism and views and because
they didn't care Pentagon didn't care I
mean the Pentagon knows something about
the economy that economists prefer not
to look at that the economy depends very
heavily on the dynamic state sector so
if you use computers and the internet
and flying an airplane they use
satellites on and on you're in fact by
now if you use pharmaceuticals they get
you know genetic engineering anything
like that you're relying pretty heavily
on the state sector very heavily the
electronics based economy although you
know a couple of decades after the
Second World War was carried out
developed under the pretext of defense
so like you don't go to the population
and say look we want your taxes so maybe
40 years from now your kids can have a
laptop what you tell them as the
Russians are coming so you pour a lot of
money into defense and the Pentagon
and admirals who understand something
about the economy put it into places
like MIT and say do whatever you feel
like if you want to organize resistance
to overthrow the government that's fine
as long as you're doing your work and do
your work
and that's been the way it was it says I
could never have survived that Harvard
down the road but it would have been
impossible but at MIT was okay this lab
that I mentioned with 100% supported by
the three Armed Services was one of the
main academic centers of resistance in
the country I don't mean protest I mean
resistance I'm like I was facing a long
jail sentence others were but they
didn't interfere because they knew you
know that their priorities were
different then it kind of continues like
that now MIT itself was a very kind of
conservative place like that fifty years
ago when I got there if you walk down
the halls of MIT
what you saw was well-dressed
deferential white males
okay now you walk down the halls and
looks like this okay that's that's you
know that's a big change and it came
from the usual sources in this case
mostly student activism and that
affected the attitude towards what goes
on so questions about the uses of
Technology never arose until the late
60s when there was a small group of
students who were pretty active some of
them you may know like Michael Albert
run zenit and others and they
essentially radicalized the student body
so much so that within a year Mike
Albert was elected student body
president on a program so radical I
can't even repeat it but and some of the
actions that were taken were quite
interesting that most of my opposed
terrible tactical judgment but I was
working with as close to all these
students but for example there was an
effort back in the 60s to set up what we
call sanctuaries for deserters it was
usually small peace groups or church
groups or something he set up he
somebody wants to desert you organize a
few people to stay with them until the
FBI comes and picks him up so the
students at MIT wanted to set up a
sanctuary I mean I thought the idea was
crazy nobody cared of an inning but they
decided to go ahead anyway and over you
know I participated Thor's crazy and
they had a there was a Marine deserter
interesting serious guy he knew exactly
what he was doing everybody went through
it and talked it through and they said
they took a room in the Student Center
and maybe ten people were there with
this deserter tried to call a press
conference nobody came without going
into the details with within two weeks
the entire Institute was shut down
thousands of students were in the
Student Center there was an ongoing
24-hour sixty style 60 style event
ranging from seminars on everything you
can think of to the rock music - smells
that I couldn't identify but
and the whole Institute was changed to
totally change
I'm the administration this is a couple
months later called close to the
Institute for a day to consider problems
of ethical uses of technology what does
it mean what should we be doing you know
and it's triggered stayed like that
under the Union of Concerned Scientists
which is a an organization of scientists
and engineers and Nobel Prize laureates
and others that grew out of that it does
very good work and the atmosphere of the
place change that institutions are not
fixed you know they can be changed
through the activities of participant
it's usually young people who do it
actually business things happened in the
70s which are highly relevant to what's
going on today the big issue today you
know all supposed to be excited about is
whether Iran is developing nuclear
weapons and missiles there's a lot to
say about that in the 1970s when the
Shah was ruling Iran the US government
wanted strongly to provide Iran with
nuclear technology because he was an
ally after all that was Kissinger Cheney
Rumsfeld Wolfowitz all trying to press
the to get Iran to develop nuclear
technology which of course can be
converted into nuclear weapons and MIT
was pretty naturally picked out as a
place to do it so an agreement was made
secretly for the nuclear engineering
department to essentially sell itself to
the Shah of Iran didn't call it that but
they would bring in Iranian nuclear
engineers and the show would give some
unknown
of money to MIT well like every secret
agreement it pretty quickly leaked out
and the students were galvanized they're
huge protests it was finally a student
referendum in which 80% of the student
body opposed it it was so much of a fuss
that the faculty had to react so what do
you do you call a faculty meeting
usually nobody goes to a faculty meeting
because it's too boring you know some
guy reading something fall asleep this
time everybody showed up must have met a
thousand people there because it was a
big event on campus and no had a debate
about whether this should go through
there were maybe a handful of us I was
one maybe five or six others on the
faculty who spoke up in opposition and
finally it was voted about 80% in favor
now that's quite interesting because the
faculty are the students of 20 years ago
or 10 years ago but enough had changed
so that the students were just entirely
different in their social ethical and
other commitments so you get the
distinction and of course that ends up
changing the Institute because the
students will be the faculty 20 years
from now and those kinds of changes as
talk about MIT because I know it but
similar changes were taking place in
many many places I'm they probably were
here in fact I remember things at LSE
you know I don't talk about that much
but I happened to be teaching at Oxford
in 1969 and I was invited to give a talk
at LSE by one of the great figures here
Karl Popper at that time there had been
a student demonstration in which
students I think took down an iron gate
that had some significance to forget
what and there was one young sort of
radical on the faculty Robin Blackburn
was a personal friend actually I just
had dinner with him
but we were reminiscing about there was
a petition circulated at Oxford where I
was saying a very mild petition in
support of academic freedom I don't
think it even mentioned Blackburn in the
LSE but said like academic freedom would
be a nice idea or something like that
and there were people who signed it at
Oxford almost all American visitors I
mean not the Oxford members of the
Communist Party and so on they didn't
want to sign it I think mostly on kinda
like class grounds or elite grounds or
whatever it was but the Americans even
right-wing Americans and supporters who
Nixon they all signed the petition and
knowing what it was you know I find when
I got to visit LSE at first they
wouldn't I said I would only go if they
allowed Robin Blackburn in he was not
allowed on campus so finally reluctantly
they made some special arrangements and
he was guided in by people who guarded
him and watched him every minute to make
sure we can go to the bathroom or
something but that was LSE in 1969 I'm
pretty sure it's quite different now and
it certainly didn't look like this at
that time but but you know that's really
for you to you and people who know
things about it to say but the
institution's can't change and they do
very noticeably well let's say one
conclusion I hadn't expected from this
evening is that I should go out and seek
funding from the Ministry of Defence but
I'm gonna take we've kind of over time
but I'm gonna take one last question the
woman on this third row if that's okay
with you sure it's to run let's have one
more
thanks okay really quickly authors like
mark Hauser have suggested that there is
a universal grammar of morality I was
wondering what your thoughts are on that
and if you think there's a sort of
innate notion of human rights that we
have well I think the answer has to be
yes for reasons that David him discussed
it wasn't just Adam Smith who had smart
things to say Scottish enlightenment was
a great place if I had a choice to go
somewhere
would be Scotland in the late 18th
century but Hume wrote about this he put
it in different terms and we would use
but he pointed out that humans have the
capacity to make moral judgments in new
situations in ways that conform to the
understanding of others and he says the
only way in which this is possible is if
there are principles that are part of
our nature they're in his terms their
instincts meaning part of our nature he
said these are different from the animal
instincts that we share with other
animals like no obvious ones so we have
some kind of instincts that are an
original part of our nature and these
somehow yield judgments in novel
situations which are comprehensible to
others and often accepted by others and
if we reach different judgments we don't
just have to throw Sh you know throw
stones at each other we can have a kind
of moral discourse about it and try to
find common ground see if we can go from
there and he says well these are just
human capacities so it's only possible
if we would now say you know part of our
nature if it's just genetically
determined and it's like a grammar so
the term amoral grammar is not
unreasonable some fixed set of
principles that yields consequences that
we use all the time like when you and I
aren't talking and understand each other
in the more place it's because we share
internal principles that produce that
allow us to interpret and understand and
novel expressions that are appropriate
to situations but are not caused by
situations crucial distinction being the
issue in the seventh that's the core of
Cartesian philosophy for example human
was picking it up from that background
so yeah there has to be a moral grammar
that further words got to be shared
humans have
fundamentally not evolved in any
meaningful ways since they left Africa
maybe fifty thousand years ago
superficial changes no skin color things
like that but as far as cognitive and
moral capacities are concerned there's
the slightest evidence of any change I
mean you take a child from an infant
from a Stone Age village in Papua New
Guinea and raise it in London you know
be indistinguishable from anybody here
in speech and moral judgment than
everything which means that we're all
basically identical it's in fact known
that a genetic variability among humans
is extremely slight as compared with
other animals and it's pretty obvious
reasons for it I mean modern Homo
sapiens is a very recent development
maybe 100 or 200 thousand years which is
just nothing on the evolutionary scale
and there was a diversity in Africa but
only one strain survived the ones who
came out of East Africa and maybe fifty
thousand years ago 75 thousand years ago
now maybe it's a little more complex
than that but something like that is
apparently true so there's no
possibility really of any significant
variation so it must be shared among all
of us and if there seemed to be sharp
differences in moral judgment for
example or cultural practices or
languages it has to be superficial
because it must be that fundamentally
it's all shared
okay then comes the empirical problem
let's try to find out what it is and in
fact there's interesting work on that
there's a book coming out by from
Cambridge Press University Press by John
McHale as IJ former student of mine at
MIT who has done very good work
a part of his work was a critique of the
critical analyses of John Rawls Rawls
when his theory of justice or famous
known that he originally took this point
of view quite explicitly but he came
under such attack from philosophers that
he kind of dropped it and pursued other
things well we file reviews the critique
and argues I think very effectively that
has no grounds and argues that Rawls
should have kept with that kind of
grammar based model and then he develops
it and he also began to do experimental
work with some of the experimental
psychologists at MIT and trying to test
moral judgments from infancy on and also
comparatively and by now a lot of others
have been doing it to mark Hauser who's
a primatologist and cognitive scientist
at Harvard has worked on this he has a
book that came out a couple years ago
called
I think moral grammar in fact what moral
minds yeah and and there you know others
are doing it too and it I mean
something's got to be correct about it
for Humes reasons but to try to find it
out it's not so simple you know it's
pretty hard to find out anything about
insects and humans are not only far more
complex but we're barred from doing the
experiments that would teach us
something like you couldn't learn a lot
about human capacities if for example
you could raise infants and controlled
environments okay we don't do that
fortunately but if there were a lot of
mangle is around we would do it and we'd
probably learn a lot and you can't do
invasive experimentation with humans so
you can't stick electrodes into the
brain and figure out what this cell is
doing when you do so and so we happen to
know a lot about human visual system but
that's because it's almost identical of
the visual system of cats and monkeys
and we do allow ourselves to torture
them maybe rightly or wrongly but we do
it
find out a lot about the visual system
but you can't there's no comparative
evidence possible and very little
comparative evidence in these cases
because there aren't any other organisms
that have the moral and linguistic and
other faculties it's some unique thing
that developed somewhere in East Africa
maybe one hundred thousand years ago and
this is nobody else around I mean maybe
it developed many times but humans also
happened to be a pretty savage creature
and right through human history large
way back a million years ago
large animals disappear with protohumans
Europe and whatever might have been
around in Africa is gone the
Neanderthals
hung around until maybe thirty thousand
years ago but that's about it
so we it's basically no comparative
evidence and and you can't do invasive
experimentation you can't you can't do
the experiments that come to mind
Aleksei raising infants and controlled
environments so you have to find pretty
indirect ways to try to study these
things language moral grammar and so on
but I think there's a pretty good reason
to believe that there's something
critically important there and this
violates the assumptions of almost all
of contemporary philosophy
but it's a dogma that it can't exist not
for human you know he was willing to
accept and those things have there's
also all kind of doctrines and they you
know say the modern postmodern
literature that says everything's is
social construction and a little
different said that that has to go to
the extent that it's comprehensible not
big problem for me because I don't
understand it but the and a lot more you
know but but I think Hume had his finger
and thank you
you
