for every problem that we face we know
of solutions the question is will enough
people young people find the ability the
commitment the dedication to implement
the kinds of solutions that we know are
possible is a way to predict it's a
matter of will and choice it's a matter
of action not speculation that was noam
chomsky i'm sam Fragoso and this is talk
easy
welcome to the show
[Music]
hey everyone thank you for being here
this week today on the show we're doing
something a little bit different as the
coronavirus crisis carries onward I want
to have on two people that I thought
could speak to our current situation
the first is Noam Chomsky a philosopher
author and linguist professor and
historian he is also Noam Chomsky and
needs no further introduction for me my
talk with him comes later in this
episode and in it he addresses the
potential political and sociological
ramifications this crisis may have on us
but to start I called up dr. Ashish Jha
he's the director over at the Harvard
Global Health Institute some of you may
remember dr. JA from an episode we aired
just a month ago many more of you are
probably familiar with dr. JA from your
television sets as he's been a recurring
face on MSNBC Fox CNN and PBS throughout
this pandemic this week I asked him
about the current climate within the
medical industry and the stories he's
hearing from the front lines inside the
hospitals as resources run scarce we
also discuss a realistic roadmap to
recovery
to better understand when we may be able
to return to something like normal life
dr. JA has a kind of even keeled
temperament about him that I have found
very very comforting in these trying
times I hope you may feel the same so
why don't we try calling him up dr. JA
thank you so much for coming back how
are you doing I'm good I'm well I'm
keeping safe keeping healthy how about
you oh well hmm it was that the wrong
question to ask say no no I'm glad
you're immediately asking me questions
in your article for four
just a couple days ago yep you compared
our current predicament to a war zone
yeah you wrote we're on a battlefield
wearing blindfolds for people who didn't
read that article tell me where you
think we're at as everybody knows we are
in the biggest most consequential
pandemic of a century and if we do
things well if we're smart we manage the
issues effectively
we'll probably still lose millions of
people and across the world but if we
miss handle this if we don't do the
things that we know we need to do it'll
be 10 times that it'll be completely
devastating to our to our country to the
world and a fundamental part of managing
this disease is knowing who's infected
and who isn't and that's how we make a
game plan that's how we decide where
we're gonna put our energy and efforts
by focusing on people who are infected
letting people who are not get back to
their lives can't do any of that without
testing people and it's the sort of
public health 101 that we have somehow
not managed to get right so far hmm when
you're talking to policymakers and folks
in DC what has that dialogue been like
people I think understand on some basic
level that we need to have testing but I
think there have been couple of stories
that have settled in that are really
problematic one is people think well
surely we've solved this by now it is so
basic so 101 how could we not have fixed
this and the president says every day
that we fix it we're testing more than
any other country in the world and and
turns out you know we haven't fixed it
right and the other narrative that has
settled in is testing was important
early but it doesn't matter anymore
and that I find even more frustrating
because you know it mattered early it
mattered snap it will matter in three
months it is the single most important
thing the most important tool we have
and it just stands to reason if you want
to if you want to figure out how to get
humanity through this you gotta know
who's infected you gotta know who do you
focus on and and otherwise we're gonna
be shut down the way we are so I these
two narratives keep coming up I keep
battling them people get it and then a
week later people seem to have forgotten
where has that second narrative come
from some of it I think came from a good
place in that at some point when we
really just failed on testing and it
became very clear that our country was
gonna get overwhelmed with infections
and that hospitals were gonna get
overwhelmed that many many people were
gonna die that a lot of people said okay
testing is important but we got to focus
on other things too and we've got to
focus on getting doctors and nurses
their equipment we got to focus on the
intro hospitals are well stocked all
completely true and we got to focus on
social distancing also true and so in
order to say this is more than just
testing which I agree with it shifted
from its things other than testing and
you can see that subtle shift when you
move to a new thing or an add-on a thing
it's easy enough to forget the first
thing that was so critical I think
that's been part of it and the other
part of it is because it just hasn't
moved as as much as it needs to I think
a lot of people have decided well maybe
it's not so important that maybe we can
focus on something else instead so let's
talk about one facet of testing for a
second a major concern across the
medical community is the country's need
to test people who are asymptomatic
people who are not sick people who are
healthy yeah and these doctors say that
until we do this
the data we have is unreliable yeah some
doctors say we're reporting dangerous
outputs
data that has very little foundation in
reality can you walk me through this
yeah so the way to think about it is if
you take a hundred people who are
infected and this is based on the best
evidence we have as of today if you take
a hundred people who are infected what
we know is that probably about 15 20 of
them will end up getting really pretty
sick sick enough to need hospital kit
and some chunk of those people maybe
four or five out of that hundred end up
needing ICU care and you know one or two
out of that hundred and I've actually
done but what about the other eighty who
are not so sick as to need hospital care
here the data really is unclear we think
I think and again I hope you hear a
little hesitation in my voice because we
don't know what we think is out of that
80 maybe 40 or 50 have symptoms they
have fever they have a cough they feel
they feel terrible and and they want to
get tested but they usually can't
because we don't have enough testing
capacity and another 20 or 30 out of
that hundred the rest of the folks
barely feel anything at all they might
feel completely well or if they might
feel a little off but nothing serious
and they are going around spreading the
infection as much as anybody else's and
so we're not going to get our arms
around this disease and we're not gonna
bring any kind of control to the
infection unless we can identify who
those folks are and get them to not go
out to restaurants and not go out to
bars and stay at all and it's fine when
we're all shut down that it's okay it's
not okay so not great you still want to
identify them but the moment you open up
those asymptomatic people are gonna be
the neighbor in your office the person
in the cubicle next to you the person
sharing your lunch with you and that's
gonna be a real problem so we want to
identify people who are sick we still
can't test them we want to test them but
we want to test a whole bunch of other
folks who are asymptomatic because we've
got to know who's infected and who's not
and if you're infected
you can't be going after restaurants and
parts not until you're better
well you know on the subject of
endangering yourself and potentially
others there was this report given by a
nurse in New Orleans I don't know if you
saw it but she said the following to the
New York Times as health care workers
were all the biggest carriers were
infecting people the people that are
taking care of you are just as infected
when it comes to doctors and nurses
themselves she said there's a strong
culture of not testing there's a fear
that tests may run out and a concern of
Steep hospital bills when pressed by the
New York Times on why these health care
workers wouldn't just get tested or stay
home she said I don't know we needed
people and we needed people to be
working even if you're afraid that you
might be sick it's a culture where one
doctor says to another oh are you sick
but are you that sick I mean we all got
it right and we've heard these accounts
from across the country that was from
one nurse in New Orleans but I've been
in contact with a doctor in Baltimore
a doctor in Chicago all of these health
care workers are on the front lines and
almost all of them have resigned
themselves to the fact that they will
get this disease it's not a matter of if
but when for these people and they're
just hoping they won't need the ICU I'm
curious have you been hearing similar
reports and if so how could this
possibly be sustainable I have and it is
again it's is borne out of a very
important ethos in medicine but it's
hugely problematic right now and and and
the ethos is one of you know the patient
comes first so you wake up in the
morning and you're having a bad day you
put it aside and you go to work and you
take care of people because the patient
is there and they need you
and not only does a patient come first
but your brothers and sisters your
fellow doctors and fellow nurses they
they come second right after the patient
so if you are not there they're gonna
have to take care of more people and
you're gonna increase the burden on them
and so you have to do your part we see
sentiments like this in the military we
see this in in other situations where
people are facing what feels like a
common enemy which it is in this case
coronavirus and challenging situations
is that you don't want to be the person
who calls in sick and says I know that
means that you're gonna have to take
care of a lot more patients today but
I'm gonna stay at home I get where that
culture comes from I have participated
in that culture and in retrospect I have
thought about times when I clearly
should not have gone in to work but I
did and and didn't even think twice
about it but in this context that
culture born out of a really great place
and good motivations is harming harming
all of us is harming doctors and nurses
but it's also harming patients because
then we can end up being the conduit for
more infections so it's it's very hard
and it's very hard to change culture in
the middle of an outbreak you know but
this is a place where great health care
leadership becomes important and and I
think senior clinical leaders need to
make this point very plainly that you're
not doing anybody a favor you're not
helping your patients you're not helping
your fellow providers doctors and nurses
when you do this and for them if not for
yourself but for them you have to stay
home you have to take care of yourself
and you have to protect yourself because
there will be nobody left to take care
of sick patients if everybody gets if
all the doctors and nurses get sick but
what's the alternative look like I mean
they stay home but there is a finite
number of health care workers riot yes
no and this is where you know this is
where early action would have been so
helpful is that if we could have
prevented the number of people who got
very very sick
would have been less of a strain and of
course this is why people need to
continue to stay at home right now until
we are at a point where you know the
health system is not so strict but but
we've been doing a lot to try to expand
the the pool right we've we've had
retired doctors and nurses coming back
we've had doctors and nurses from around
the country flying in to New York with
the expectation assumption and I I don't
think they expect it but I expected that
when their home towns get hit that a lot
of doctors from New York will pick up
and go there that kind of camaraderie is
wonderful and it's and it's great and
that will help but it may not be enough
but nonetheless what I've been saying to
my friends and colleagues is if you're
feeling sick you got to stay home you
got to take care of yourself because at
the end of the day you sick in the
hospital is worse than you not at the
hospital at all of the health care
workers that you've spoken to over the
past few weeks
what has their general temperament been
like there is this incredible sense of
focus and mission right now I think some
amount of frustration that that our
country has not supplied them with basic
protective equipment that our government
has chosen not to prioritize their
safety but remarkable in that that no
one I have spoken to suggest that that
somehow then makes their obligations to
their patients sort of null and void
that it advocates you know kind of their
personal obligation and and this is
interesting because one of the things
that I've been thinking about is of
course doctors and nurses have an
ethical responsibility to take care of
patients but society has an ethical
responsibility to make sure that doctors
and nurses are protected and if society
through its government says we're not
doing bad we're just not going to do it
it's not a priority then does the
initial ethical obligation of doctors
and nurses to patients still remain
and the answer I've heard from my
colleagues is absolutely yes absolutely
yes we're not backing off even if
society is not doesn't have our back
I think it's heroic it also in some ways
breaks my heart because it means a lot
of people are getting sick and a lot of
people are dying and that's just
frustrating but the sense of mission is
very clear what's the most horrifying
story you've heard behind closed doors
in terms of the kinds of things the
doctors and nurses are having to go
through yes you know and some of this
has made it out into the media but you
know having to having to wear garbage
bags because there's no gowns that can
protect you having you know the stories
that I've heard about the face mass so
you have to use day-in day-out and after
a while it starts smelling but you can't
toss it because there is not another one
and there's no easy way to clean it
without ruining its protective
capability and so you continue to wear
it you know these are small stories but
I think over time they accumulate and
they grate on people but people continue
again I haven't heard anybody say that's
it I give up I'm walking away they feel
like their obligation is to the patient
in front of them and so even with that
stinky face mask or the garbage bag as a
as a gown they're gonna do what they
need to do there's also this economic
consideration that I don't want to leave
out you know I have a friend here that
hospitals are notorious for mistreating
and exploiting providers pandemic or not
she said hospital administrators who
know nothing about clinical care could
care less about patients or providers
they only care about the bottom line and
this is coming from a few folks who work
on the front lines that the more
renowned the hospital the worse it is
they think low pay and being overworked
and appreciated is acceptable for the
privilege of working for one of these
big hospitals and that behavior that
sort of mentality is still embedded in
the system even in this crisis have you
heard about this yeah I think my
experience and I've certainly heard of
the this idea right and there is
definitely examples of hospital
executives who care fundamentally about
the bottom line and only about the
bottom line and actually one of the
things I've written and talked a lot
about is what are the obligations of
hospitals that are nonprofit because
nonprofit is another way of saying you
don't have to pay taxes we're giving you
a break we as society and but you owe
something for that nonprofit and a lot
of hospitals have forgotten that they
have a mission that society has given
them a big financial break for and and
this is a huge general challenge you
know in this outbreak I've seen a mix so
there are hospitals that have continued
that same path I spoke to a very senior
hospital executive about 10 days ago and
we were talking about hospital capacity
and he said I don't plan to cancel any
elective surgeries they are my most
lucrative procedures and I said so what
are you gonna do with Kovac patients and
he said I'll find a way to make sure
they go elsewhere it's ok I guess you
can try and this was your friend Holly
let's just say that someone I've known
for 20 years right
by the way of our two conversations this
is the first time you've backed paldon
been like no no he's that he's not my
friend
I swear I just I just happened to have
been in my life for two decades I'm
sorry yeah look it's hard to know how to
be friends with someone like that you
can you can appreciate them he's a smart
guy he he is very effective at his job
but there is a disconnect on values that
really does make it hard for me to feel
like what France you know I'd have a cup
of coffee with them but I don't know
that I'd anyway doesn't matter but but
he represents a
you know a slice a chunk of hospitals a
chunk of organizations that I think are
doing that but I also have colleagues
and now people I'd call friends who you
know senior hospital leaders who said
for the next three months I'm not gonna
take a salary or I'm gonna cut my salary
in half and I'm just gonna take those
dollars and donate it to frontline
providers so they get a little extra and
they are there at 11 o'clock at night on
a Sunday not on the frontlines bothering
the doctors and nurses but one step
behind you know working the phones
trying to make sure that the equipment
is showing up trying to make sure that
so it's a pretty heterogeneous set of
responses but I think it'd be unfair to
not call out those people who have done
the heroic work they're not on the
they're not taking care of the patients
but they're taking care of the people
who are taking care of the patients and
I've seen that too and it's been
heartening and it's been at some very
very big academic famous academic
medical centers so we've seen some
excellent behavior as well so so it's a
bit of both before we get into what the
next two or three months may look like
yeah I'm curious what is a piece of this
evolving story that you think is not
getting enough coverage in the
mainstream media what are we missing
what are we not talking about enough
there are a couple of things that I've
been thinking a lot about that I feel
like maybe I'm not hearing so much about
it is remarkable to ink how well the
American people not everybody but most
Americans how well they have adapted to
or let's say how well they've been
compliant I hate that word but with this
idea of social distancing I mean it's
really working people really are staying
home people really are staying away from
each other and that's such an odd thing
to ask people to do right like all of a
sudden your governor said hey don't go
out don't spend time with friends and
family don't and people more or less
have done it
and I think it's amazing I have to tell
you I've been I just assumed there'd be
a lot more pushback a lot of people
saying I'm going to go on with my life
and there's been a little but very
little so I think that's been remarkable
and I think it has not gotten enough
attention and it has been hugely helpful
the other part of it though Sam and the
part that I worry about is what is
happening at home for folks we've seen
little bits of data about increases in
domestic violence we've seen little bits
of data about increases in loneliness
and mental illness but while people
while I just spent all this time
celebrating that people have been
compliant with this and have done it I I
think we have paid very little attention
to what the impact on people's lives has
been and we're not done right were right
now still in the first half of April and
this is not ending in April and I don't
think it's largely ending in May and I
worry a lot about what people's lives
will be like how much suffering there is
that word just we're gonna uncover over
time and realize how expensive social
distancing really was I mean how tenable
do you think it is for people to
socially distance and self isolate for
the rest of April and through most of
May do you see that happening this is
gonna get harder and harder right and I
think we've got to get through April and
we've got to try to get through as much
of May as possible and part of this is
you know I'm talking to my public health
friends the kind of experts that I spend
time talking to and they're saying
things like oh I shakes you're being too
optimistic we need to have everything
shut down through July and then maybe we
can open up for a month and maybe six
weeks and we'll have to shut down again
and they're showing me data and models I
look at and them data and models are
pretty good and I get why people say
that and I get why they think that's
what we need to do and they're not
technically wrong but my take is that is
untenable
I can't imagine saying to Americans
basically through July I just don't
think it'll work I don't think people
will do it I don't think people can and
so on one hand I'm fighting that battle
of trying to convince my public health
friends that we got to open up much
sooner and then of course on the other
hand I'm hearing from everybody else
that I just can't keep going so you know
this really gets us to where we need to
go in the future I think we've got to
hold on as long as we can and I hope and
pray that we can hold on through a good
chunk of May and then we've got to open
up slowly and we've got to open up
deliberately and we've got to open up in
a data-driven way and this is why I keep
emphasizing testing because testing
gives us data and at that point we've
got to let people get as much of their
lives back as we can tolerate mm-hm and
we have didn't understand that the
moment we let up the virus will start
circulating more robustly more
vigorously and the longer we are open
the more the virus will spread in our
communities so there's no question that
that it will increase and this is why a
lot of people think well we'll just have
to shut down again I think that a very
vigorous testing tracing isolation
strategy can allow us to stay open we
won't go back to life as usual but I
think so many of the things that we're
all missing and craving in our lives
just basic social interactions outside
of them maybe two or three people we
live with we I think will start being
able to get that back but we're really
caught between a rock and a hard place
there is no easy path out of this so
that's why I've been pushing forward
please stay at home but as soon as we
can
um let's start relaxing at least some of
these restrictions so people can start
getting back to work and maybe kids can
start going back to school right I think
everyone is eager to get back to work to
go back to school
well maybe not go back to school but
they want to feel something that is
vaguely normal yeah so let's talk about
a reasonable roadmap for this country a
lot of the timetables predicting when we
can reopen America are based on how
South Korea dealt with the situation how
they managed to keep offices and
restaurants open during the crisis yeah
walk me through how they manage this
South Korea and Singapore and a couple
other places did a few different things
that I think are worth understanding and
then maybe I can shift to how that might
play out here but but fundamentally what
those places did was they they had a
very robust tracing tracking program so
that meant what I mean by that is if you
got infected if you were found to be
infected
um you got quarantine but they would
track down everybody you had spent time
with and quarantine all those people as
well a lot of the bigger venues came got
closed oh they did a reasonable job of
keeping restaurants and and other social
gathering places open but with a lot
more social distancing built into them
and that I have been arguing is our path
forward so when I look for ahead let's
say we can get through most of May and
we have really good testing data so we
know where it's safe talk when we open
offices can start letting people come
back to work but if it's a super crowded
office maybe it's only half the people
come back on on Mondays and Wednesdays
and the other half people come back on
Tuesdays and Thursdays or some sort of a
you know halfway opening I can imagine
restaurants and bars opening but I can
also imagine a rule that says they can
only meet the GAR they can only fill up
to 50% of fire-code capacity which will
necessarily mean that you know they'll
be there'll be a lot more space there
will be fewer crowds there will not be a
packed bar on a Saturday night that you
will go to I don't see any possibilities
of a baseball game where 30,000 fans are
packed into a stadium because you do one
of those and a few of the folks there
are infected and a couple of them are
super spreaders and you will fuel an
outbreak that will shut the whole city
down for four weeks and cities will
decide that a single baseball game isn't
worth shutting the whole place down for
four weeks so those are the kinds of
changes that I think are going to be
necessary and coupled with and here's
where he starts getting tricky so
coupled with this very vigorous tracing
program that you know there's this at
South Korea and Singapore did where
you're gonna wouldn't have to decide how
much civil liberties were willing to
give up so we may have an app on our
phone and and this may very well come to
be that is put in there by your carrier
and when you test positive it will send
an alert to everybody you've been within
six feet of in the last five days and it
won't say hey a shisha is positive but
it'll say someone you were in close
contact with was positive in the last it
someone even contact with the last five
days and then all those people need to
go get tested and anybody who's positive
that needs to get quarantined and that
cycle begins again for them and this is
the kind of vigorous program we're gonna
need to have if we're gonna have a shot
at staying open now people are gonna be
like I'm not super comfortable with that
and I understand and my response is how
comfortable are you shutting down for
several months again because those are
going to be our choices and the choice
of life goes back to normal
I can do what I want that's gonna be not
with us until this pandemic comes to an
end and under the best of circumstances
the pandemic comes to an end in 12 to 18
months from now you know I listen to the
president he says we want to open up we
will be great life will be back to
and we want to open up May 1st and I
play out that scenario in my head and I
say okay let's do what the president has
suggested what happens what happens is
that we open up May 1st the first couple
of weeks will be great and everybody
will feel like oh thank god
we're over this thing and by late May
then rates of infections will start
getting very very high across all of
America and by early June the hospitals
will be filled up again and people will
be dying at alarmingly high numbers and
we will shut down and when we shut down
we'll have to be shut down for three
months and so will be shut down through
the summer into early fall and there are
public health people who think this is
gonna be our cycle we're going to open
shut open shut and we're gonna
potentially spend 50 to 70 percent of
our time shot I lay that out for folks
and I say that's the most likely
scenario and the question is what are
you willing to do for an alternative
scenario how much are you willing to
sacrifice and I find that most people
find the scenario I've laid out of open
shut open shut to be intolerable the
idea that we'd open for 4-6 weeks and
then shut for three months just feels
intolerable and I think it is
intolerable I think the economic effects
I think the social impacts of that will
just be awful and so then the
alternative is okay I'm willing to make
some sacrifices if I'm infected I'm
willing to go be quarantined for two
weeks because I don't have another like
there's no third alternative that says
you just get to have your life back and
everything will be fine
not that I know of and so trying to help
people understand that that our choices
are limited but if we if we all
collectively agree on that kind of
middle path of testing isolation
quarantine tracing um we can get enough
of our lives back that you know Sam you
and I've never met each other but we
could we could get together for a drink
and talk and that would be lovely
but we can only do that if we're willing
to go through that through that I can't
wait to get a drink with you in 2023
it's gonna be so long 20 20 s and we're
gonna do it this year oh my god that
would be great
um you keep going back to this idea of
sacrifice but do you think our country
is willing to forfeit civil liberties in
the name of public safety and let's
think about what that would look like
you know that would include rigorous
monitoring of our cell phones
checkpoints where our temperatures would
constantly be taken rules and
regulations for not just everyone with
the virus but anyone you may have
exposed to it yeah and I mention all
this because there are large swathes of
this country that really believe in
their hearts that one of the key
principles of the Democratic Party is
that everyone just wants to take their
guns if that sounds silly it's because
it definitely is but I have to mention
it because there are a lot of people
across this country that will tell you
they want less government in their life
not more of it even when it comes to
public safety yeah can I let me let me
tell you how I think this plays out okay
this is where federalism you know the
fact that we states are have a certain
amount of sovereignty has been a real
challenge in our country in many times
in our history but has also been a real
boon and in this pandemic it's been both
when our federal government refused to
act on social distancing a bunch of
states did a governor of Ohio shut down
Ohio much earlier than the federal
government suggested they should so did
parts of California so there's other
places Washington state but it's been a
real challenge in that when we're trying
to get ventilators all of a sudden we
have 50 states all competing for
ventilators and competition is not
helpful in this so there are times when
federalism is helpful other times when
it's really harmful
on this issue it's going to be helpful
even though I wish we could have a
single national program one could
imagine that Massachusetts has already
committed to a pretty aggressive testing
tracing program the governor our
governor was a Republican just last week
said we're gonna do this and what will
happen is States will open and
Massachusetts will be able to stay open
because of this and states that say
we're not doing that we're just not
gonna do it they're gonna see their
numbers rise and we're going to start
seeing people get sick and people die
and at some point people in those states
are gonna say you know nobody's going to
a restaurant or nobody's going out to
the bars because the hospitals are full
and they're but people are dying and
it's awful and people in those states
are going to clamor for an alternative
that is not how I want to make policy
that's not what I want
but I fear that that's what's gonna
drive some states to say okay give us
another option and they're gonna see
states like Massachusetts in Ohio and
and I think California and other places
relatively open not perfect but
relatively open and they'll say we want
that and they'll understand that the
cost of that is somebody maybe it's not
their government probably not the
federal government but somebody will be
able to track down everybody that they
have spent time with and they'll have to
give up that information I don't know
how else you do it except making the
cost and the benefits of this which you
know it's a real violation of civil
liberties I don't love the idea that
like if I got sick somebody would figure
out everybody I have been in contact
with in the last five days I don't love
that but I'm willing to give that up if
it means that I get to you know I get to
go to the office I get to see my friends
I get to go out for a drink with a
friend everyone's know
I think when people see that that's the
trade-off
they will make it but I worry that until
people have seen the benefits of this
effort and this approach they won't you
know so much of the discourse around
covin 19 is about readiness how we can
best prepare ourselves for when this
virus returns yeah the return either
this fall or early next year seems like
almost a given at this point yeah and
yet do you see any way in which this
virus could be eradicated to have this
specific virus eradicated yes this virus
is now in our community in every
community around the world and only two
things will bring this pandemic to an
end only one of two things the first is
we get a highly effective vaccine and we
are 12 to 18 months away from that or
second that we have so many people
around the world infected that we
essentially achieve what people call and
I hate this term but I use it because I
don't have a better one what people call
herd immunity the idea that so many
people have been infected and have
become immune that the virus no longer
finds susceptible hosts 60 70 percent of
the world's population will have to be
infected for that to occur maybe as low
as 40 percent but still a very large
number and there is no third thing that
I know of because even if we did
everything else right with massive
social distancing we can get the
infection rates very very very low but
we can't get it to zero somebody will
have it somebody will spread it and the
mole as long as one person is infected
in America it the virus will continue
spreading until again we hit that number
of large numbers of people having been
previously infected so you know this
pandemic comes to an end when we have a
vaccine that's really the story and
until then the virus can be a small part
of our lives it can be a major part of
our lives
it won't go away and I shouldn't call it
a small part of our lives it'll be an
important part of our lives no matter
what but it can either completely
paralyze us or it can let us have some
semblance of our lives back but that
will be difficult to pull off and we'll
have to give up some things in order to
get that last thing before we go we've
talked about everything and everyone but
you so before you go on to any number of
cable network shows that I've seen you
on by the way I think you've become like
the Jude Law of MDS everywhere I look I
see your face on the television I was
like wow he got that role and he got
that role I think all these people need
to be paying you a lot of money since
they still have it and are profiting
greatly from this crisis which is
something I don't even want to get into
but really how are you and your family
faring right now how are you keeping it
together well thank you for asking I you
know I have not in this outbreak been on
the front lines with my fellow
physicians and nurses and others and I
feel like but I'm so part of this
mission I have a job and my job is to
try to take the incredible amount of
science that's being generated take all
the uncertainty and all the data and try
to communicate it to people in a way
that's honest and fair and not
sugar-coated but also comprehensible and
to the extent that I feel like I'm doing
that I'm gonna keep going and the
personal toll or whatever is pretty
trivial and I think about people who are
out of jobs people who are you know in
really bad situations at home and can't
get away all right you know we've got
the stand or challenges the kids are
going crazy everybody's patience is
being tested you know life is life is
hard but for me like life is hard
compared to what it normally is
but I think it's really easy compared to
what most Americans are going through so
I feel mostly blessed and I feel like I
have a job in front of me and I gotta
get to it and I gotta do it and through
the public stuff but also a lot of stuff
I do on the background
I'm calling people and I'm trying to get
folks to move on issues that I think are
important
talking to policymakers just trying to
feel like a five years from now I can
look back and feel like I did something
useful in the middle of the biggest
pandemic that humanity faced that's the
goal and to do it for myself for my wife
for my kids for you for all of us
because we really are in this together
right like if you keep doing what you're
doing and I keep doing what I'm doing
and we're all working pulling in the
same direction Sam we are gonna get
through this so that's been my
motivation well I appreciate your
cautious optimism here and truly thank
you for all the hard work
I know these past six weeks have been a
lot for you and your family and many of
your colleagues on the front lines so
truly thank you thank you thank you
thank you I appreciate it I'm not
terribly optimistic we're gonna get that
drink this here but I certainly hope we
do I will I do too dr. John all right
thank you very much thank you so much
for having me back on
[Music]
that was dr. ashish ja he's the director
of the Harvard Global Health Institute
in Cambridge Massachusetts to learn more
about dr. JA you can visit our site at
wwlp.com before we get into Nome I
wanted to take this time to thank a few
people who recently made donations to
the program shirelle Gellin Ulrich
hammer Linda Butler and sunrise heirs
and yes in case you're wondering none of
those people are made up they all just
have incredible names if you'd like to
make contribution be sure to visit our
site at www.imtcva.org that we put into
this thing
week after week but that said let's get
into the next conversation Noam and I
first spoke back in 2016 two weeks after
President Trump was elected in that
interview which you can find in our show
notes he offered some grim
prognostications that
have unfortunately come to pass since
then I'll admit this conversation is a
little shorter than our normal episodes
I'd like to say that was planned but we
had some technical difficulties it turns
out sending a microphone to someone in
another state is not so easy right now
nevertheless it was an honor to sit with
noam once again we'll be having him back
on this summer for those who want to
hear more from him I know I do
so without further ado here is Noam
Chomsky
[Music]
Noam Chomsky thank you so much for being
here with me how are you doing I'm doing
fine
are you fatigued by the technical
challenges oh yeah I have to go back to
MIT and get a PhD in computer science I
wanted to start you know in the
aftermath of 9/11 you were called on by
innumerable publications and TV networks
to speak on the attack to provide an
academic and historic context to what
was happening we're now in this similar
if more grave moment with the
coronavirus have you tried to make sense
of where we're at in this country the
United States is way behind other
countries in dealing with it the
countries in the perimeter of China have
done quite well at Taiwan South Korea
Singapore Hong Kong the New Zealand
apparently has almost completely
conquered the virus seems to be stopped
essentially in Europe they sort of
dithered for a long time but some of the
better organized societies have it under
control
Germany has I think the lowest death
rate in the world Norway's also doing
pretty well the others are coming to
terms with it the Britain kind of
bungled it at first it seems to be going
the United States is a total disaster
it's the epicenter of the crisis it's
the only country the only major country
where it can't even provide data to the
World Health Organization
because it's so out of control the Trump
administration the way they handle that
is almost indescribable they knew by
January from Chinese information just
what was happening
but couldn't get to the White House US
intelligence was trying to reach the
White House as we just learned today one
of the top advisors Peter Navarro late
January was reporting the Chinese
information to the White House nobody
could get through Trump was either
playing golf or watching his ratings on
Fox TV or something so was one day it's
just flu another day it's serious
another day to go back to work and they
forget it it's terrible and I was the
first person ever notices in any event
the situation is disasters
we can ask several questions one
question is why is the u.s. so behind a
deeper question is why did this happen
altogether I mean as to why the u.s. is
so behind we can look at the wrecking
ball in the White House in fact it's
almost incredible ever since Trump got
into office he's been cutting back every
year cutting back the health related
elements of the government Center for
Disease Control and so on just cutting
them this year he produced a budget on
February 10th when the epidemic was
raging all over the country the budget
called for Reid to further reductions in
Center for Disease Control than every
other health-related element of the
government if after reductions just
about everything that it relates to
human welfare and an increase in funding
an increase in subsidies for the fossil
fuel industries it's almost madness you
can't describe it well that's the United
States it's feel pardon the expression
Trump is busy turning it into what he
called the shithole country that's the
United States now what about the deeper
question of why this haven't all
together here we get the real issues
which have to be dealt with if we don't
want the another pandemic to recur which
is very likely predictions are they will
keep recurring each would be worse than
than at last the last major one there
were others was the SARS flu SARS can
cover on a virus to 2003 at that point
scientists knew with high confidence
that this is going to recur and take a
look at what happened the virus was the
identify the genome was sequenced people
started working the drug started working
on vaccines the vaccines were developed
but they were never pushed through the
testing phase then in a sane society the
entities that are concerned with health
would have started working to prepare
for the next pandemic so they'd be ready
for it
and I could abort it before it start
well who are they
first of all they're drug companies drug
companies follow capitalist logic they
look at market signals and the market
signals say there's no profit in trying
to fend off a major catastrophe the
profit lies in doing things that will
sell today ok so that's what they did
well so far that's just ordinary
capitalist logic a suicidal but ordinary
then comes another hammer blow the
neoliberal version of savage capitalism
which begins with Reagan really you may
recall that one of Reagan's first
pronouncements was government is the
problem not the solution
so in again in a sane world when the
drug companies failed because they
observed capitalist logic the government
would move in adjust the way the
government basically produced the Salk
vaccine which
offered free and which ended the plague
of polio but that was then when we were
still under the basically New Deal
system of regimented capitalism now
we're in the regime since Reagan of
unrestricted capitalism let it go wild
so the government couldn't intervene to
deal with the market collapse and it's
very interesting to see how it happened
in detail so President Obama and his
administration recognized that there is
a problem and it turns out if you take a
look at the hospitals today the real
bottlenecks thing that's causing the
major crises is the lack of ventilators
well that was forecast so Obama did
contract with a small company that was
producing high-quality low-cost
ventilators well it was bought up by a
larger company of Covidien and they
shelved the project now presumably
because it was competing with their
expensive ventilators and in one thought
that by later they turned to the
government and they said they wanted to
cancel the contract because the project
of low cost high quality and laters
wasn't profitable enough okay that's
capitalist logic again it was well known
that a crisis was on the way author
Trump's term it was well known and he
kept every year cutting back defunding
the health-related
institutions and cutting back the
surveillance of them and so on but it
was still well known as late as October
there was a high-level simulation of a
pandemic crisis showing how how severe
it was in December on December 31st
China reported to the World Health
Organization that they were finding
pneumonia like symptoms of unknown
etiology a week later Chinese scientists
figured out what it was they informed
the World Health Organization that it
was another corona virus they identified
the genome sequenced it that provided
the information to the world at that
point it was public knowledge US
intelligence knew all about it
for months they tried to reach the White
House to tell try to break through to
explain the decision of your crisis
other countries as I mentioned did
respond
these station countries are have it
under control the New Zealand is
apparently killed it if we want to
prevent a recurrence of this we've got
to try to go back to the root not the
ended idiosyncrasies in the United
States but the root of it which is in
market failures that are bound to recur
and the neoliberal hammer-blow that says
the government can't intervene I should
clear that that mantra of that
government is the problem that only
holds when the fate of the population is
at stake if corporate the corporations
are in trouble then government is the
solution
that's the world we're living and if we
don't do something about it it's going
to recur worse and remember that right
in the background
is a growing crisis that puts all of
this into the shadow we will recover
from the corona virus at great cost in
the United States at much greater cost
than is necessary because of the
I don't know what to call it the force
in the White House mm-hmm but we will
recover there's something else from
which we won't recover while we're all
talking about this the Arctic ice sheets
are melting leading to a feedback effect
as the ice sheets melt first of all they
raised the sea level but beyond that
they reduced the reflective capacity of
ice and are replaced by dark water which
means that instead of reflecting the
sun's rays we now absorb them so the
feedback loop goes into operation and it
accelerates global warming which is an
existential crisis and one that Trump is
dedicated to accelerate we know the
details and this is indescribable
there has never been a crime like this
in human history literally the u.s. is
leading the way to trying to destroy the
prospects for organized life on Earth
and it's not that they don't know it the
high that the corporate world knows that
the administration knows it they all
understand it perfectly we'll it is just
to illustrate that a couple of weeks ago
a memo was leaked from JPMorgan Chase
the country's biggest bank the memo
warned that the their words were the
survival of humanity is at risk if we
continue in our present course including
the bank's loans to fossil fuel
industries so it's all understood
nothing less than the survival of
humanity but capitalist logic says race
ahead right and the in insanity says
let's accelerate and amazingly in my
view and just can't understand his loyal
adoring base
Republican Party voting base they love
it the more he destroys things the more
it destroys the country the more he
harms them the greater the applause
maybe somebody can explain that you know
the this capitalist system you're
describing
I think the virus has exposed these
glaring issues we have with economic
inequality in this country and this is
not a new issue right you know in
writing the Constitution James Madison's
chief concern was to protect the
minority of the opulent against the
majority he knew that if the poor could
vote freely that they would get together
and take the property of the rich the
Constitution in many ways was set up to
prevent democracy but the issue totally
predates this country if we go back to
Aristotle and I know you've talked about
this he believed in a welfare state that
happens could then reduce inequality so
I'm curious where do you see America
heading on this issue once we're on the
other side of the crisis well that's up
to us it's up to people like you
Withey there is this planning going on
right now about the post-crisis world
the corporate sectors working hard to
try to ensure that the post-crisis world
will still be in their hands that there
will be the masters and if they're not
countered and overwhelmed by popular
forces they'll win and we'll move on to
suicidal policies and face the
consequences and maybe some people
survive living in high mountains and
isolated valleys but we're leading to a
crisis of a kind that is almost
unimaginable
I mean bear in mind that we're now
approaching the global temperatures of
over a hundred thousand years ago when
the sea level was about
25 feet higher than it is today we're
moving toward that crisis rapidly there
have been other severe crises in Jeolla
we're not that not talking about human
history geological history we're getting
near that 65 million years ago the an
austere asteroid hit the earth it caused
a huge environmental crisis that wiped
out I think about 75% of species and at
the age of the dinosaurs gradually life
recover finally led to us that's what we
are now doing to the earth we're killing
species at a massive rate already we're
soon gonna doom a human society and
millions of other species and we know
what's wrong it's not hard to find out
the things I've identified are right on
the surface as they are not quantum
physics you just have to think for a
minute they're right in front of your
eyes the refusal of the drug companies
to prepare following good capitalist
logic doing exactly what they're
supposed to do the inability of the
government to intervene as it did for
example with polio that's a gift of
Ronald Reagan Milton Friedman the other
apostles of new liberalism and those who
followed them including Clinton and
others Obama's will okay that's where we
are can all be changed you know you have
been batting around some of these ideas
before the corona virus took hold on a
personal level I'm curious Noam do you
feel less hope now than ever
not really done I'm old enough to
remember the rise of fascism in Europe
I'm old enough to remember listening to
Hitler's addresses over the radio to
Nuremberg rallies and the massive
applause and adoration have to say it
I'm kind of reminded of that when I
listened to some of trumps rallies so
it's quite a different situation at that
time it looked as though fascism the
spread of fascism was just inexorable
couldn't be stopped was going to be
spread over all of Europe maybe all of
Eurasia and who knows how far do beyond
I mean that was a hideous threat now
that's childhood memories but it turns
out it wasn't unrealistic the US
government was making pretty similar
assessments in the in 1939 a high-level
commissions were established from the
State Department and the Council on
Foreign Relations the main
non-governmental Foreign Relations
institution closely integrated to the
government they started Studies on what
the post-war world would look like and
their assumption was there would be two
superpowers the United States would
control the Western Hemisphere would
take over the former British Empire
which controlled the Far East and Nazi
Germany would control the rest all of
your most always Eurasia England all of
Europe that was a horrifying prospect
and it wasn't in the analysis of
government analysts it wasn't really
changed until the Russians began to
defeat Nazi Germany the Russia was
almost totally responsible for the
defeat of Nazi Germany after Stalingrad
and the huge tank battle at Kursk where
the russians defeated the cream of the
Nazi army and then started moving into
Germany became pretty clear that Nazi
Germany wasn't going to survive the war
and the u.s. planning shifted to a
broader attempt to incorporate large
parts of Eurasia and
Asia in the u.s. dominated system so
there was a time when it really looked
as if the ultimate evil was going to
triumph the depression was pretty
serious very serious and forth but today
we have a different kind of crisis it's
a natural crisis the world is telling us
you can't go on like this if you go on
like this
you're doomed coronavirus will be
horrible but Hitler seen Spanish flu was
worse covered others farther back but
you're not going to recover from the
melting of the Arctic ice sheets and the
other extremely dangerous developments
that are taking place as global warming
goes out of control you know I think
this is a period where many people in
America and across the world are taking
stock of their lives and asking where
they find value and purpose you once
said I believe we go from dust to dust
and there's no meaning in our lives
there's meaning that we provide to life
there's no meaning outside of our own
enrichment of their own life which we
can so I'm curious with that have you
searched for meaning
sure every minute of the day
my children my wife I play with my dogs
who fortunately are keeping quiet
instead of barking hmm do my work have
friends all over that puts meaning in
life your father you know who you really
learned a lot from I mean you guys would
have these Friday Hebrew readings every
Friday night as a kid he was a principal
and professor and and he wanted to
educate people so that they would be and
I quote well integrated free independent
in their thinking concerned about
improving and enhancing the world and
eager to participate in making life more
meaningful and worthwhile for all do you
feel like you've continued his legacy we
had different focus of interest but he
was dedicated educator committed pretty
much doing educator and that's something
I've tried to follow in my own life to
what extent succeeds that's for other
people to decide hmm do you not think of
those questions for yourself do I think
of them of a legacy you mean yeah that's
not worth thinking about I think of
doing the best I can under current
circumstances that what the legacy will
be as I said that's up to others to
determine we started this conversation
me asking you for context of our current
life do you see the possibility of a
radical shift where we address issues
like inequality and education the
dysfunctional health care system people
unable to survive on minimum wage as a
result of this crisis look for every
problem that we face from the huge
existential ones like global warming
nuclear war to the kind that you're
discussing which are very serious for
all of them
we know of solutions the question is
will we find will enough people young
people people like you find the ability
the commitment the dedication to to
implement the kinds of solutions that we
know are possible including for
everything you just mentioned you can't
predict there's no way to predict it's a
matter of will and choice and for those
topics there's no predictions it's a
matter of action and not speculation
walter Lippmann wrote the public must be
put in its place
so that it may exercise its own powers
but no less and perhaps even more so
that each of us may live free of the
trampling in the roar of a bewildered
herd and that thinking ties into what I
said earlier about James Madison and
even what Lewis Powell would say in his
memorandum from 1971 it's people as
spectators of actions not participants
but let me ask you after 91 years of
life and after steadying people through
the annals of civilization do you think
we could become participants in this
country I think it's not only possible
that there are very encouraging signs of
it all around us so
take one example that take the case of
the green New Deal some form of green
New Deal is essential for survival you
go back a couple of years it was either
not talked about at all or was just an
object of ridicule now it's right on the
legislative agenda that may be something
to be done about it the wall depend on
the next election in November but it's
right in the center of attention how did
that happen it wasn't a miracle group of
young people
sunrise movement that took the lead from
a large popular movement and began to
take serious steps towards it
leading to sitting in on congressional
offices where they were supported by
Alexandria LoCascio Cortes other young
legislators who would come in and the
wave of the activism that bernie sanders
stimulated and inspired okay they
awakened some attention that by now the
co-ceo Cortes and Ed Markey from
Massachusetts senator joined in
proposing legislation now debated to be
improved fixed modified that it can
become the law of the land and offer us
a path to the survival of humanity to go
back to the JPMorgan Chase memo that's
of significance and important and it
tells us that popular action can do
things in fact that memo from JPMorgan
Chase pointed out that the bank should
put an end to its funding of fossil
fuels and one of the reasons they gave
is that their reputation is at stake why
is their reputation at stake the
because of activists who are pounding on
the doors and saying you can't get away
with this okay we can affect the
behavior of the existing institutions
and we can modify and change them that
and it's there are significant efforts
to do that okay that tells you the
answer to your question is definitely
yes if people take up the cudgels and do
the work
your friend howard zinn once said that
what matters is the countless small
deeds of unknown people that lay the
basis for the significant events that
enter history one of my favorite
statements of his I always quoted he was
a wonderful person what do you make of
that statement in this moment it's
absolutely correct can you tell me the
names of the members of the sunrise
movement who said it in Pelosi's office
can you tell me the names of the young
people who participated globally in the
October Global Strike these are the
people who change the world those are
the heroes of history we don't know
their names
so yes since comment was accurate
significant and it's a kind of a
guideline of like that should shine in
front of us as we follow the meaning and
significance of that comment well I like
to say I'm certainly glad to know your
name and I thank you for all the work
that you have done over the years and
always for being so generous with your
time thank you very much and good luck
