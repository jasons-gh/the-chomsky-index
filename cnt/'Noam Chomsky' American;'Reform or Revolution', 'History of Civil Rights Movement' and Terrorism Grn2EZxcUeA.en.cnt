here's a question will US society and
its economy be reformed without direct
action militants and revolution well you
know talk about one should think through
these things carefully let's let's think
about a revolution I mean if a
revolution is going to be at all
constructive you know not just establish
some horrible dictatorship worse than
you happened there's only one way it can
come about that's if a large mass of the
population in fact the large majority
come to recognize that changes that they
want cannot be instituted within the
framework of existing institutions that
means that if you're a real dedicated
revolutionary you're a reformist there's
no conflict between reform and
revolution what you want to do is press
the institutions as far as possible to
yield to just popular demands and if the
population comes to recognize look it
can't be done anymore okay then you can
talk about a revolution but not before
and if you look at people who are really
interested in revolutions like Karl Marx
they they press this all the time in
fact he even believed that in the in
England you know country that interested
the most the freest country of his day
parliamentary system England in the
United States might be possible to
establish a communist revolution without
any violence at all just by pressing
forward within the framework of the
institutions that they have well maybe
so maybe not but that's the criterion so
I think just again endorse what one and
Amy said you have to try in every
possible way to bring the the changes
bring about the changes that we think
ought to be made by means that are
available
and going back to occupy I agree with
Amy it was a tremendous achievement but
there's a gap the 99% have to
participate and that hasn't been
achieved and that's pretty important
it's good it's good to bring it to
public attention put it on the national
agenda get people to think about it but
that's only the first step the next step
is to engage the 99 percent and that's a
hard task just as it has been with every
popular movement and you have to
remember if you look at the history of
popular movements they have had
successes now it was a much freer
gesture country than it was not that
long ago but it's always partial
successes actually the civil rights
movement which was mentioned a couple of
times is a very interesting example and
should be thought about when you listen
to the speeches on Martin Luther King
Day or you know you read the glowing
reports of the civil rights movement
they almost invariably end in 1963 with
his great I have a dream speech the
Martin Luther King didn't stop at that
point he went right on actually he moved
to the north to try to organize programs
was first in Chicago about the horrible
housing situation and not just for
blacks although there's a race class
correlation so largely but and that was
just beaten back he kept trying to
organize a movement of the poor in fact
when he was in Memphis as somebody I
think Amy said he was assassinated while
taking part in a sanitation worker
strike public worker strike he also gave
and I have a dream speech then very
powerful one but try to find it it was
the evening he was assassinated he used
his normal biblical rhetoric you know he
said he felt like Moses standing on a
mountain he
see the promised land of land of freedom
and justice he was not going to get
there he knew that but you can get there
if you struggle on then he was
assassinated the mark he was planning a
march on Washington poor people's March
to set up a poor people's movement the
March took place right away it was led
by his widow Coretta King started from
the motel where he was assassinated in
Memphis it went through the major places
of big civil rights struggles in the
South you know Selma Birmingham and so
on it got the Washington and they set up
an Occupy movement they set up a tent
camp in Washington to try to bring to
Congress the plea to do something for
the poor which is the the suppressed the
poor working people and so on the
Congress which is the most liberal
Congress in American history now let him
stay there for a while and then sent the
police in in the middle of the night
smashed up the camp resurrection city
and drove him out of town well that part
of the civil rights movement it wouldn't
be objective to talk about it it's the
wrong story what actually happened is
that northern liberals were ok pretty
happy about denouncing racists sheriffs
in Alabama you know it makes us feel
good but not us please if you look at
what happened in the north the racism
was deep remain steep efforts to break
into it have been beaten down at every
point whether it's busing desegregation
almost anything you can think of not for
us you can you can vote in the south if
you like and what's happened to the
country is pretty shocking
I'm sure you've all looked at the maps
after the election you know they blue
and red maps first thing that springs to
mind is this is the Civil War it's
almost identical to the Civil War
the Confederacy in the north the only
difference is the names have inverted
the what's called the red states now
used to be the Democrats blue states
used to be the Republicans now it's
switched now what happened is in the
night and there's a reason for that in
the 1960s the civil rights legislation
infuriated northern liberals didn't want
to hear about it yeah it's okay down
there but not us and Richard Nixon came
along and recognized that nobody could
build up the Republican Party but what's
called the Southern Strategy just take
the racist south and call it Republican
and invert it and a lot of things happen
that people should think of it like take
blessing the blessing was one of the
programs that turned the white working
class against it drove the white working
class into the ultra reactionary parties
and you can see why so you take a look
at the way busing was set up the
programs were organized by you know
liberal judges Democratic judges but
typically they'll take Boston where I am
you know liberal judge Harvard trustee
they said we got a set of a bussing
program which forces Irish kids into the
black areas and black kids into the
Irish Aires but not into the suburbs not
into the affluent white suburbs we were
out of it well you know take a Irish you
know telephone workers nothing worked
all his life he was finally able to get
enough money to buy a small home and the
Irish section of the city where there's
people I came around and his kids go to
the high school he can chair for the
foot cheer for the football team and
he's got a life all of a sudden some
liberal judge out in the suburbs tells
him your kids are going to have to go
into the black ghetto and black kids are
gonna have to come
how do you think he react becomes a
racist he starts voting for Nixon Reagan
Romney totally undercutting his own
interests but northern liberals have a
lot to answer for about this and in fact
this goes way back to the Civil War if
you look at American political history
after the Civil War there were about 10
years of relative freedom for blacks
African Americans then there was a
compact it was a Reconstruction period
then there was a north-south compact in
which the North basically said do
whatever you like and what they did was
criminalized black life literally which
re-imposed the form of slavery in many
ways worse than the original a slave
owner had to at least care for his
property but when you throw people in
prison and the state provides them to us
cheap labor chain gangs minds you know
industrial plants it's fantastic you
don't do anything state takes care of so
it's a form of slavery which actually
lasted until the Second World War when
labor was needed free labor was needed
and it's never true and it affected the
political system you look at the
political parties that formed after
reconstruction they were sectional
parties the slogan was you vote where
you shoot if you were in the Confederacy
you vote Democratic if you're in the
north
you look Republican there was some
mixture because Catholic workers in the
north were Democrats they were in
Tammany run you know establishments but
it's basically the story and in one way
or another it goes till today it's one
reason we've never had class-based
political parties their sectional
they're based on a racist and other
criteria which are not very pretty and
you get what you saw Wednesday morning
and the map
the newspapers these are pretty deep
problems and uh you know a lot of the
people we are the circles we were part
of you know are implicated in this
wasn't just racist southerners
thank you I'm afraid we're close to the
end of our time and this question
intrigues me so I'm gonna end with this
one terrorists primary primary weapon is
fear fear is used as a reason to
increase military spending and to
violate civil liberties however
terrorism can never be completely
eliminated how can this catch-22
situation be changed well I think we can
take long steps to eliminating terror
one very simple step is to stop
participating in it
and I'm not joking
I mean people now talk about the war on
terror is being declared by George W
Bush in 2001 that's totally false it was
declared by Ronald Reagan as soon as he
got into office the core of American
foreign policy he said was going to be a
struggle against state-directed
international terrorism and then comes
all the fancy rhetoric plagued as a
modern age you return to back barbarism
and so on then came ten years of massive
terror by the US it's why it's never
talked about I mean hundreds of
thousands of people were killed in
Central America well over a million in
South Africa where the United States
supported the Reagan particularly
supported the apartheid regime as part
of the war on terror he even had to
override congressional sanctions by the
late 80s to keep supporting them and the
reason was explicit the African National
Congress is some quoting one of the more
notorious terrorist groups in the world
that's Mandela's African National
Congress as you probably know Mandela
himself only got off the terrorist list
a couple years ago he had their special
dispensation to come to the United
States Middle East tens of thousands of
people killed in the war on in the
terrorists war and the worst terrorist
atrocities there were literally run by
the United States so for example the
worst the peak of interest in the media
in international terrorism was 1985
that's when media editors picked
terrorism in the Middle East as the
leading story of the year and it was
fair the worst terrorist act in the
Middle East was in Lebanon a truck
bombing which killed 85 roughly 80
people women and girls when they were
leaving a mosque the truck bombing was
set up to go a big truck bomb to go off
when people are leaving the mosque
hundreds injured but that's not part of
the doesn't enter the the story of
terrorism for very simple reason it was
organized by the CIA they were trying to
kill a cleric quietest cleric Sheikh
Fadlallah and they missed they just
killed you know eighty other people a
big fuss a couple weeks about a bill
about a bombing in Lebanon which killed
some people and yeah it's terrorist act
didn't come close to this the next major
terrorist act in that year was the
Israeli bombing of Tunis on no pretext
just you can kill him
they killed about 70 people you know
smart bombs whole business the u.s.
participated by not informing its
Tunisian ally that the bombers were on
their way u.s. Sixth Fleet pulled back
in fact they have to fly over the
Mediterranean refuel of course the u.s.
knew it and informed the third major
terrorist act was a what the Shema in
Paris the great dove he was Prime
Minister I called
the Iron Fist operations in occupied
southern Lebanon was illegally occupied
in violation of Security Council orders
and there was resistance so Israel
carried out major terrorist operations
against what they call terrorists
villagers in southern Lebanon that was a
third major terrorist act
none of these enter the discussion for
the usual reasons the reason that it was
picked in that year was because there
were Palestinian terrorist acts in which
one American was killed okay that's a
different story
so yes there's an easy and you can
easily extend this but a major way to
stop terrorism is to stop participating
it and that goes right to the present
take say the global assassination
campaign if anybody else was doing that
we just call it state terrorism
state terrorism and it elicits terrorism
in response
so you bomb a village and you know was
Ariston and kill a couple dozen people
pretty soon their cousin or uncle wants
to come back and kill you and this is
normal and we have plenty of evidence
that is all over I mean it takes a one
of the cases where terrorism was
actually ended not just reduced but it
ended a serious case a recent case in
Northern Ireland the IRA was a terrorist
organization they were carrying out
pretty serious actions no joke you know
practically killed the whole British
cabinet once I was in Northern Ireland
in 1993 went from Dublin to Belfast it
was a war zone
I met a lot of people and had contacts
one of the people I met was an IRA hit
man who was underground
he had just broken out of a British jail
and he was in some place where he was
secure so I was able to meet him there
through some civil rights activists and
we talked for a couple hours I basically
asked him one question what do you think
you're doing
by killing Protestants and British his
answer was very simple
they killed my cousin I'm gonna kill
their brother they're gonna kill my
mother I'm gonna kill their children and
that's how it's gonna go well
couple years later this guy was on the
negotiating team he's now in the
government what happened is here the
United States played a good role
incidentally under US pressure the
British finally got it into their heads
that the way to deal with the rising
cycle of IRA terror was not by more
violence but by paying some attention to
the legitimate grievances and they were
there and as soon as they started doing
that terrorism declined the negotiation
started I was in Belfast year ago
this tensions like ethnic tensions in
any city but there's it's a peaceful
city not a war zone that's the way you
deal with that the minor amount of
terror that they do and dealing with a
major amount of terror that you do
yourself list by stopping
