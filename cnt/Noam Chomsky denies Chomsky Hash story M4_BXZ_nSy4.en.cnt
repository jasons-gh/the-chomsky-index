ever heard of that particular gossip
there's actually nothing to it we verily
spent a very pleasant day together
walking through the Dutch countryside
with the patient's fallen partly because
we just wanted to have a chance to talk
to each other but partly is an
experiment to see how we would make out
with me speaking English and him
speaking French that's how much English
it I don't know much French turned out
we're pretty well so we decided to have
the discussion and two languages English
and French but we just spent time
talking I'm sure there was nothing
