this long question but just summarize it
suppose we favor stateless society in
the long run it would be a mistake to
work for the elimination I've said that
it would be a mistake to a limit to work
for the elimination of the state in the
short run and we should be trying to
strengthen the state because it's needed
on the check of power of large
corporations yet the tendency of a lot
of anarchist research my own to is
others is to show that the power of
large corporations derives from state
privilege and governments tend to get
captured by concentrated private
interests that would seem to imply that
the likely beneficiary the more powerful
state is going to be the same corporate
elite we're trying to oppose so if
business both derives from the state and
is so good at capturing the state why
isn't abolishing the state a better
strategy for defeating business power
than enhancing the state's power would
be well the very simple answer to that
it's not a strategy and since it's not a
strategy at all it can't be a better
strategy the strategy of eliminating the
state is back in the level of let's have
peace and justice how do you proceed to
eliminate the state ok can you think of
a way of doing it I mean if there were a
way of doing it in the existing world
everything would collapse and be
destroyed you just can't do it and
there's nothing to replace it if there
was a rich powerful network of you know
cooperatives community organizations a
worker control of industry you know
extending over the whole country and the
whole world in fact yeah then you could
talk about eliminating the state but to
talk about eliminating the state in the
world as it exists is simply to keep
yourself in some remote academic seminar
or small group you know saying gee this
would be nice it's not a strategy so it
can't be a better strategy
we are faced with realities what is
described here and in fact it's true
I've written about plenty about it too
is that we have a number of systems of
power closely interlinked
one of them's corporate power business
power that's by far the most dangerous
of all that means effectively
unaccountable private tyrannies a second
pretty closely linked to the mistake
power and the combat is correct as the
combative tater says I've written about
it too a lot that state power tends to
be overwhelmingly influenced by
concentrated private power okay those
are real problems now we face strategies
so for example let's say take takes a
health care ok right on the front pages
what's the strategy for dealing with the
fact that at tens of millions of people
it can't get the best health care they
can get is to be dragged to an emergency
room when it's too late to do anything I
mean that's a real problem and that's a
huge part of the population second
problem is that in a privatized
unregulated health care system like the
United States and I should say like
because it's the only one in a
privatized unregulated health care
system where the drug companies are so
powerful that the government isn't even
allowed to negotiate drug prices in that
kind of system first of all health care
is strictly rationed by wealth very
strictly and secondly it is designed in
such a way that the federal budget is
going to be destroyed you just take a
look at the tendency lines there won't
be anything left for schools for social
security for
worker safety anything what will be left
this is for the military
that's untouchable keeps going up
another problem we look at Obama has the
biggest military budget since the Second
World War so but as long as that is over
there
untouchable another elephant in the
closet the radically inefficient
privatized unregulated health care
system is extremely harmful for people
except for the wealthy they do fine and
is also going to destroy everything else
so what do we do about it well it's not
a strategy to say okay let's abolish the
state that doesn't do anything about it
in fact it's just a gift to the
corporate state power sector because it
offers nothing a short term answer is to
do what the midget large majority the
population has wanted for decades unable
to develop a sensible national health
care system of the kind that we every
other industrial country has one variety
or another well has to be a larger
majority opinion so you don't break down
many walls to organize people about it
has been for decades it's strongly
opposed by the corporate state axis but
that's not unbreakable you know their
victories have been won we could go into
details you know like what do you do
about the fact that the Democrats who've
sold out for obvious reasons on even
minor palliate is like a public option
and so on what do you do about the fact
that concrete fact it was just an
election in Massachusetts which
surprised everyone totally almost
completely misrepresented but when did
that but one of the striking things
about the election was that the union
members Obama's natural constituency
the Muslim didn't bother voting because
there's tremendous apathy and they were
working-class areas the election was won
by the wealthy suburbs but of those who
voted most of them voted for Scott Brown
the Republican against the Democrats
shooting themselves in the foot
incidentally is one of the first things
that happened is to knock off one
possibly pro-union member from the
National Labor Relations Board but had
reasons the reasons are very clear just
read the labor press the reasons are
that Obama made a very explicit that he
was going to willing to compromise or
give up on everything except one thing
taxing union members for their health
care plans so sure people are enraged
about that I know I should maybe it's
not a hardest position just a simple
elementary human position well okay if
you're interested in the long-term
project of the question are namely
dissolving state and corporate power you
should be paying attention to that they
should be organizing workers on that you
shouldn't leave it to rush limbaugh
to organize people with real legitimate
grievances that's the way to fascism you
should be out there organizing them
themselves on their concerns you know
their concerns can be related to and
easily related to much longer term
anarchist style projects but that's
where anarchists should be working
