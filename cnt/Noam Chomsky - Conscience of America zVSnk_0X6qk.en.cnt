political activist author linguist noam
chomsky is all of this and more he's
America's most outspoken critic of u.s.
foreign policy and the mainstream media
yet the New York Times has called
Chomsky nothing less than the most
important intellectual alive today over
the years his provocative views have
inspired some and enraged others over
the years you've written about and given
voice to an array of alternative views
on issues as diverse as Vietnam and
human rights and the role of the media
your views traditionally tend to be a
little bit more critical and I've spoken
especially as it relates to you the u.s.
foreign policy I mean I've got a quote
here where you're saying that the United
States is a violent and terrorist rogue
state with no interest in the rule of
law you know that's pretty harsh stuff
when I actually mostly based on quoting
official documents mm-hmm so the
official u.s. position is has been for
years even public that well Dean Acheson
put it pretty clearly about 40 years ago
he said in cases where there is a
challenge to the position prestige and
power of the United States the propriety
of a response is not a legal issue so in
others we do what we want with there's a
and in fact and that's been reiterated
very recently so Clinton spoke to the
United Nations a few years ago and he
said that the United States will act
multilaterally when it's possible but
unilaterally if we feel there's in our
interest and just last year of the
Secretary of Defense William Cohen
reiterated that even more strongly said
the United States will take unilateral
action in matters relevant to its
interest which include such things as
access the to markets and resources and
the u.s. is quite happy to use violence
and terrorists means to do that but the
notion of America being a violent
terrorist rogue state I mean you there
seems to be a certain level of
acquiescence to America's involvement
right now
and country's almost saying you know why
don't you get more involved in Sierra
Leone
why don't you play your role as world
leader of ensuring that you know civil
society is maintained throughout the
planet that's not the u.s. role the u.s.
does get involved very extensively so
for example take a look at say arms flow
that's a good measure of involvement if
most of the arms flow is from the United
States it's the major arms producer and
exporter there are two countries Israel
and Egypt which are always in the lead
that has to do with domination of the
Middle East put them in a separate
category if we look at the rest the
results quite interesting so for example
open right now the leading recipient of
US arms in the world happens to be
Colombia Colombia also has the worst
human rights record in the hemisphere
and has had it for 10 years and has been
the leading recipient of US arms for 10
years that's incidentally a correlation
which is pretty well established over
the years Colombia moved in the first
place in 1999 replacing turkey what
about Turkey well Turkey's a military
ally and strategic outpost so it always
gets a fairly high level of arms it shot
up in 1984 and it stayed very high right
through 1998 in 1997 the flow of arms to
Turkey was higher than the entire period
pre 1984 had nothing to the Russians
nothing to the Cold War what it had to
do with is the fact that Turkey was
carrying out a violent murderous
repression of its Kurdish minority
killing tens of thousands of people
creating 2 to 3 million refugees
destroying 3,500 villages which is 7
times Kosovo under NATO bombing and it
meet an 80% of the arms were coming from
the United States now that's not
creating now why did it shift to
Colombia well the reason is because
turkey finally succeeded in repressing
its the internal insurgency Colombia
hasn't yet
seated so the arms flows switching to
Columbia well you know that's not
preserving civil society that's
maintaining state terror well and you've
been very very you know vociferous in
pointing out the inconsistencies of us
initiatives based on on human rights
rationale and that do you believe that
for you take a look an example like Cuba
for further Prince's for the United
States we cannot support this regime
because of the way they treat its
citizens yet and others it ignores
what's behind that what motivates
America in in your view and it causes
that inconsistency well first of all I
don't see it isn't inconsistency it
seems to be very consistent so it's
consistently in support of the what are
called US interests which happen to be
the interests of dominant sectors within
US society which are primarily corporate
interests it's not a big secret and it's
not at all surprising in fact every
state behaves like this every you know
the states are not moral agents they may
pretend to be in intellectuals may
produce flowery flav phrases but the
fact is states are institutions of power
power often means violence and they're
they act in the interests of dominant
social groups internally okay
now in one of your recent books the new
military humanism you focus on possible
and again you're very critical of the
NATO and us-led interventions in into
that country at the time that view
you know outraged many of what you might
see is your natural liberal allies who
saw Kosovo as a moral war I mean there
was an attempt to stop you know ethnic
cleansing it was a genocide
what was your response to those eighty
two problems with it for one thing it
did not stop it it initiated it
contributed to initiating it as
anticipated notice the bombing led to a
very sharp escalation of atrocities that
was anticipated but as the bombing began
the NATO commander Wesley Clark informed
the press that it is in his words
entirely predictable that it will lead
to a very rapid escalation of atrocities
shortly after he informed the press that
it was never the intent of the native
command to put an end to ethnic
cleansing in order to stop atrocities
which of course is true because it led
to an increase in them so in the first
place in the narrow case of Kosovo that
was not the it was not intended to stop
atrocities in fact it led to an
escalation of them but there's a much
more significant issue if someone
believed that this is a war fought for
principles and values and humanitarian
purposes and so on there is a simple
test namely what are you doing in other
cases where you can very easily stop
atrocities so it takes a each team or
the other big issue in 1999 in the early
months of 1999 same time that concerns
were being expressed about Kosovo and
preparation for the bombing right at
that time
Indonesian commandos trained and armed
by the United States we're entering a
steamer to carry out what they called
Operation Clean Sweep a mass
intimidation and terror operation
starting in February which carried out
extensive massacres had killed maybe
5,000 people or so by the first half of
the year giving ample warning this was
an attempt to intimidate the population
so that they would not vote for
independence in a referendum that was
being planned
they gave ample warning open public
warning and much more has now come out
through leaked Australian intelligence
sources that they were going to that if
the population voted the wrong way they
were going to carry out a mass
destruction okay population voted the
wrong way they then did exactly what
they said they were going to do this is
the Indonesian army and it's
paramilitaries armed and trained by the
United States and Britain primarily
and they then expelled about 85% of the
population from their homes very
violently and destroyed about 70% of the
country well what was the position of
the United States and Britain during
this entire period in official position
right to the end the official position
is it's their responsibility and we're
not going to take it
from them okay notice that there's no
sovereignty here no issue of sovereignty
straight invasion with us British
backing the Indonesian army had already
killed about a third of the population
hundreds of thousands of people now
here's a very easy way to stop
atrocities
tell them to call it off you don't the
bomb Jakarta you don't have to impose
sanctions you just have to stop
participating in the atrocities will
stop providing the arms and the
diplomatic support right in the middle
and I can go on case after case in the
middle of this performance we have the
people you're talking about complaining
that I'm objecting to the to their
pretense and it certainly is a problem
or a war of a moral law how can you be
carrying out a moral oh maybe the maybe
the bombing was right or maybe it was
wrong that's a separate question but how
can you be pretending that this is a
moral endeavor while at the very same
time you're participating in massive
atrocities which are worse than those
you claim you want to stop well I want
to talk about even another case because
you've probably been most vocal in
criticism of the bombing of northern
Iraq and ongoing sanctions in in that
country what's happening in Iraq is well
its first of all what's happening in
Iraq is that sanctions are being imposed
which are destroying the country
devastating the population and
strengthening Saddam Hussein I he's not
suffering his power is greater than
before and there's not going to be an
internal rebellion when people are so
demoralized and devastated that they can
barely survive that's the effect of it's
exactly how many people have been killed
we're not certain but it's probably on
the order of a median maybe and the
country has certainly been devis
was a relatively developed country and
it's been reduced to one of the poorest
in the world not that is the effect of
the sanction so why is it being done
well there's an official reason it's
repeated over and over again every UN
session every public pronouncement what
he said is the following
it said this man Saddam Hussein is such
a monster
that we can't let him deserve up that's
survived why is he a monster not only
did he develop weapons of mass
destruction but he even used them
against his own population the ultimate
atrocity all of that is absolutely true
but it's missing a few words it is true
that he developed weapons of mass
destruction and used them against his
own population with our support those
are the words that are missing with our
support the development of weapons of
mass destruction was in the 1980s the
use of the gassing of the Kurds which is
what they're referring to was in 1988
the US and Britain responded to that by
increasing their support for their
friend Saddam Hussein increasing his
ability to develop weapons of mass
destruction and by putting to the side
suppressing the mass murder of the Kurds
not that tells you something that tells
you one thing it tells you as those
can't be the reasons they can't possibly
be the reasons for the sanctions because
we were supporting him when he did these
things and continued to support so the
reason so point number one is the
political leadership and that's not just
the United States and Britain that's the
Netherlands and you know every Western
spokesman says the same thing they're
all lying transparently the media and
other commentators who were repeating
this are not telling the truth
they are omitting the crucial words with
our support which are very crucial and
that we want to find out what's
happening we have to look elsewhere okay
they've also been very critical about
the media and you've written extensively
and given talks about how the media
clues with political leaders to both set
the agenda and to maintain the status
quo give our viewers some insight into
how you believe that works well first
question is does it work and I think the
answer is yes I can't give the evidence
here but just take the cases we've been
discussing and ask how much has been
presented about that an answer is
virtually nothing how does it work it
seems to me fairly straightforward the
media are part of the system of power
in the United States for example I mean
talk about that what are the media there
are major corporations parts of even
bigger mega corporations like General
Electric and Westinghouse and so on they
like other corporations they produce a
product and they sell it to a market the
market is advertisers so other
businesses that's where the money comes
from the product is audiences they sell
audiences to advertisers and for the
major media the ones that kind of set
the agenda like New York Times
Washington Post and so on they're
selling privileged audiences so you have
major corporations selling privileged
audiences to other businesses what
picture of the world do you expect to
emerge from this system well it's one
that will reflect the interests of the
sellers the buyers and the brother right
you've described this process in your
landmark book as manufacturing consent
give us a current example of how where
you want to see that happen well to take
say come on take Turkey in Cologne they
transition from leading recipient of US
arms just last year was from Turkey to
Colombia honest media would tell you
that they would say look we completed
the operation of massive ethnic
cleansing and atrocities in Turkey we
have not yet completed it in Colombia so
the leading flow of arms is shifting
from Turkey to Colombia if you look more
closely you find that's exactly what's
going on but that's not what things
presented turkey was barely reported on
the case of Colombia as it's reported
but in the content under a pretext under
a pretext of the drug war which can't
possibly be taken seriously this is not
a drug work I mean this is a
counterinsurgency operation attempting
to destroy a peasant based insurgency
which the government hasn't been able to
control that it isn't a drug wars
obvious on the face of it there the
abuse of lethal substances is a serious
issue by far the most significant by
orders of magnitude is tobacco that's by
far the most lethal drug in
national trade in the United States
alone there were about 400 thousand
deaths tobacco related deaths last year
and 16,000 from all hard drugs combined
the Supreme Court recently just
identified tobacco use as the leading
public health hazard the also it's a
huge international trade the matter
export export of tobacco from the United
States has increased about fivefold
under the free trade regime other
countries are compelled to accept US
lethal substances under pain of severe
trade sanctions furthermore they must
accept advertising for them aimed at
vulnerable populations or else there are
trade sanctions Colombia cartel is not
permitted to put ads on CBS television
and saying extolling the wonders of
cocaine here is a major lethal substance
by far the most the worst which is
forced on other countries not we can go
on but this is enough to show that it's
not a drug
it's a it's a counterinsurgency we're
not going back to the media why is this
presented under the pretext of a drug
war like what I've just said is not
secret information it's quite public
yeah I'm interested too how the media
treats you because the same media that
ignores these issues you know often you
know ignores or dismisses no I'm Chomsky
as his views are so extreme he's from
Neptune I mean you've you've heard that
before me
what's your response so though is it
from Neptune to report what the Supreme
Court just decided and on the most on
the greatest health hazard in the United
States or to point out that was just a
straight fact that the US is using its
alleged free trade enthusiasm to force
other countries to accept lethal
substances and advertising for them I
don't think that's from Neptune that
ought to be headlines if the media do
not want these to be headlines that's
something that they have to answer for
it and it's only it's not me it's every
critic but you have been called the
conscience of the American American
people but I wonder in recent years when
what appears at least on the surface
to be a growing consensus in favor of US
dominance around the world trade
liberalisation globalization whether you
ever feel like a lone voice out there
you know contrary I feel I'm right in
the mainstream so let's let's take say
what's called trade liberalisation and
that's not what's happening with what's
called liberalisation is in fact a
complicated interaction of
liberalisation and protectionism and the
interests of private power but let's
call it that who supports this certainly
not the world at least not if the people
of the world count so for example just
last last month there was there were
meetings of the it's called g77 it's the
non-aligned countries basically they
account for 80 percent of the world's
population they had meetings right here
in the hemisphere in Colombia and Cuba
and produced a declaration declaration
of the South Summit in which they
bitterly condemned the process of
globalization as it's being carried out
not because they're against
globalization but because it's being
carried out in a way which is harmful to
the PUC they see it as harmful to the
population of the world they called for
a reorientation which would aim at the
right of independent national
development ending of poverty the the
right of development which they
prioritize is officially opposed by the
United States they condemned what they
called the so-called right of
humanitarian intervention which they
call a considerate guides for
traditional imperialism under its
familiar moralistic trappings this is
this is 80 percent of the world's
population well I did a database check
in the United States the declaration was
not reported that's 80 percent of the
world's population well let's take the
United States and Canada
these are democracies so we have polling
and we know what people think on the
trade issues of populations opposed
despite overwhelming propaganda so the
media about a hundred percent in favor
of it as is the entire corporate world
and is very little criticism permitted
nevertheless on the issues the
both the population of Canada in the
United States have been consistently
pluralities have been consistently
opposed that is of people who pay
attention no majority generally that's
not a marginal position that's a
position right in the center of opinion
well we're starting to see you know
growing protest against or seeing the
visible visible but if I looked at the
poll like at the time of NAFTA sure the
despite in the United States which I
know better
despite a I'd say a hundred percent
enthusiastic media support a public
opposition persisted and remained a
plurality now to speak to take part in
that opposition is not to be
marginalized that is the media were
marginalized when you see this visible
evidence of protest at the IMF at the
way or WTO the OAS do you see this as
the worm kind of turning you see the
population starting to rise up against
the status quo I don't see the worm is
turning I see the general opposition
taking a more visible form and it's been
doing that for a long time let's take
the multilateral agreement on investment
right which were there what were there
weren't big public risks but there were
there was plenty of protest actually
initiated mostly in Canada although the
effort was to Ram this home in secret
it's a huge investor rights agreement
which they knew the public was going to
be opposed to so it was kept secret by
the media incidentally for years it
broke through largely because of
Canadian activism what Barlow's and
others when it did break through when
broke through the media self-censorship
instantly very quickly within a couple
of months there were protests all over
the world and the OECD the organization
of the rich countries had to back down
that's not this is a matter of general
public attitudes becoming harder to
suppress do you see the internet as
providing an alternative means to get
public views and forums discussed
outside of traditional media you know
take say the multilateral agreement on
investment they in I'm in the organizing
for that was none
mostly on the internet because it could
not be done through the mainstream media
they wouldn't permit it so it was done
through the Internet
a lot of the planning and organizing for
the the recent demonstrations has also
been by getting around the mainstream
information system or information
control system by using this it seems
true in other countries like take say
Indonesia the protests against the
Suharto government it could not be done
in the Indonesian press they were done a
lot of it was done through the internet
it was an internet organizing system and
in fact whether this will continue or
not is a real Madol matter for a
struggle we know certainly what the
corporation's want they don't want it to
be used for information and activism and
if the public is willing to struggle to
maintain control of what it created and
not to hand it over as another weapon of
domination will then it will remain that
way but it's not going to happen
automatically over the years you've been
involved in broad broad broad spectrum
of issues I'm interested what's what's
consuming you right now what's really
really your passion these days basically
the same issues the issues of human
rights democracy freedom justice there's
been a major attack on democracy in the
last 20 25 years that's in fact a large
part of what's called globalization that
what's called globalization is a kind of
a cover for the shifting of
decision-making away from instruments of
popular sovereignty like governments and
sovereign static countries in the more
democratic countries that means the
public to some extent of these shifting
of decisions away from them into private
tyrannies which is what corporations are
call them something else if you like but
they're private tyrannies so as
decisions are shifted to investors
lenders banks manufacturing corporations
and so on which is what globalization is
in fact this form of it that is an
attack
popular sovereignty and it's intended
that way so financial liberalisation
which is a big piece of the current
globalization system that creates what's
called sometimes a virtual Parliament of
which has veto power over national
planning it can exercise that power
simply by attacking currencies and
withdrawing capital and that constrains
what governments can do and in we're
democratic states that means it
constrains what people can do means you
can't carry out social and economic
planning which will be aimed for the
welfare of people rather than for
profits because if you do that there
will be an attack by the virtual
Parliament that's a major consequence of
financial liberalisation and it is
understood back in the 1940s when
written in the united states keynes and
white created the Bretton Woods system
one of the was based on stabilization of
currencies and control of capital and
these were the quite explicit reasons
for it it was to allow governments to
carry out national socio-economic
planning without fear of the virtual
Parliament when this system was
dismantled in the 70s through state
initiative United States Canada Britain
and others that led to a major attack on
popular democracy that's only one
example incidentally this form of
globalization that's been instituted
also has harmed the economy so if you
look at say growth rates they've been
for the less developed countries they've
been cut by about half during the last
20 25 years for the industrial countries
is almost as much cut by maybe a third
and the same is true of other
macroeconomic statistics in fact what's
called a fairytale economy in the United
States a Goldilocks economy it's a fairy
tale for a very small number of people
for about 80 percent of the popular
workforce in the United States wages
have stagnated or declined than work
have greatly increased that's an
unprecedented failure of the economic
system especially during the period of
moderate growth in the last 10 years
these are all aspects of globalization
if you like that of a particular form of
globalization well you know these are
things that I think that most people do
care about and to take part in that a
general opposition to the form in which
private power and government power is
directing the world I think that's as I
say I don't think that marginalize is
one that means you're right in the
center of things it's fair that you're
as motivated as you ever have been of of
these things Noam Chomsky I want to
thank you very much for joining it's
been a real pleasure ok
