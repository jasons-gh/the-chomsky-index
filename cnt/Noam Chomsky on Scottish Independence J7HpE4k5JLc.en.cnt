well I think
national capital isn't gonna like it and
there may be some harsh reactions but it
may be a another step towards the
gradual fragmentation of the
nation-state system in Europe so other
things are happening elsewhere like
Catalonia may have a referendum so far
it's not clear whether the government
will permit it certainly the population
wants it and it would be a referendum
for greater degree of autonomy as
something silver might happen to the
Basque Country there were other part
part of the reaction to the
centralization of the European Union has
been a rise of regionalism and local
cultures local languages moves towards a
local autonomy these are kind of
conflicting processes European Union
policies have now been very heavily
centralized so much so that the national
governments of virtually abandoned
independent socio economic policies
adding over the brussels bureaucrats so
this is a natural reaction to it
UK is a little different because they
were never totally absorbed into the
European Union so they themselves have
kept separate but now these are for the
development it wouldn't surprise me
terribly if something similar happened
in Wales
you
the UK has been in kind of a funny
construct for a long time I'm just what
Britain is is highly contested is it
England is it collections at a federal
collection even the so-called English
Constitution is of course not written
Constitution is very ambiguous about
that and a lot of debate about it but I
think it's I mean the nation-state
altogether is a pretty artificial
construct in nation states were
established almost entirely by violence
and they bring together and they force
into a single mould the people who often
have little to do with one another they
speak different languages they have
their own cultures they've different
traditions different religions you know
and the effort to mold them into a
single entity with a role subjected to
the same fixed national culture and
social commitments service to state
power and so on that's been pretty hard
even the effort to establish borders has
been a very very violent process Europe
was the most savage place in the world
for centuries while the nation-state
system was being imposed finally Europe
is now free from internal wars there's a
lot of debate about the reason and the
the political science literature enough
talk about the Democratic peace and so
on my feeling is the reason is the basic
reason is quite different Europeans did
recognize had to recognize in 1945 that
if they ever try to fight another war
though there's wipe out everything you
can't fight wars with that degree of
destructive power
so therefore it moves to a period of
more or less peaceful integration but if
you look around the world whether
conflicts raging all over the place
virtually all of them have to do with
nation-state systems and boundaries that
were imposed by the imperial powers
almost everywhere
I said take Iraq the British carved out
Iraq in their own interests not in the
interests of the people of the region
and there are sharp differences among
the Kurds and the Shiites Sunday and so
on furthermore Britain drew the
boundaries of Iraq for their own
interests again they want they drew the
northern boundaries so that Britain not
Turkey would be able to exploit the oil
resources they drew the southern
boundaries so that Iraq would be almost
landlocked that's why the Principality
of quate was separated out and if you
look around Africa is the same thing
Asia you know I said take Pakistan the
British drew a line called the Durand
Line separating what was India from
Afghanistan now separates Pakistan from
Afghanistan the line cuts right through
the Pashtun area and so we kind of
pushed under stunt Pashtun never
accepted it
the Afghans never accepted it now if
people cross that border we call them
terrorists they may be going home you
know and the same is true of just about
every that take say the us-mexico border
that was established by a war of
aggression in which the u.s. conquered
half of Mexico you take a look at the
names of the cities in the southwest and
western United States San Francisco San
Diego's Santa Cruz I mean Spanish names
people went it was a pretty open border
for a long time people went up and back
for
work for visiting relatives and cultural
reasons commercial whatever the board
has been slowly militarized the sharp
increase in militarization was actually
in 1994 and that was connected with
NAFTA the so-called free trade agreement
the US officials understood perfectly
well and in fact said that the effective
NAFTA will likely be to drive
impoverished Mexicans across the border
NAFTA is going to essentially wipe out
Mexican agriculture Mexican campesinos
can be perfectly efficient but they
cannot compete with highly subsidized
the US agribusiness so they'll be driven
off the land that's still happening
right now people are compensating those
are being driven off the land well what
do they do a lot of them come the earth
so you get an illegal immigration
problem you have to militarize the
border the things like that are going on
all over the world I mean I remember it
struck me very not that I didn't know it
but it struck me very dramatically sixty
years ago my wife and I were students we
were living in Israel and we were kind
of hitchhiking you know students
backpacks and we were hitchhiking up in
northern Israel and we were just walking
one evening and a car a Jeep came along
on a road behind us and the guy got out
of the Jeep and started yelling at us
and and Hebron told us you got to come
back what had happened is we'd walked
into Lebanon at that point the border
was unmarked now I suppose it's
bristling with you know tanks and so on
but and the border was just artificially
drawn right through the Galilee by the
British and French for their own
purposes I had nothing do with the
people there and all the same is true
almost everywhere and one of the
reactions to all of this is the kind of
coalescence of more or less coherent
groups
than ever totally so into regions that
they where they feel more comfortable in
running their own affairs and I think
that's pretty much with the Scotland
referendum is about
you
not
simple I mean you can't separate
yourself from the world these days maybe
Bhutan can't but most states can't
so Scotland if it moves towards
independence in some form we don't know
what form would have to figure out ways
of determining how it can become
enmeshed in the international treaty
system that's not so simple like pick
Wendy go back couple hundred years when
the American colonies separated
themselves from England they one of
their main tasks immediately was to
become what was called treaty worthy to
be treated by the European that European
powers were of course the dominant
powers to be treated by the European
powers as a nation which could enter
into their system so it has become
treaty worthy worthy of accepting
treaties that had a double-edge at the
time the colonies American liberated
colonies wanted for two reasons
one to be accepted by the European
powers to be treated you know by the
international treaties of the day the
other was because the Westphalian system
the you know the reigning system
permitted each state to operate freely
without interference in its internal
affairs and for the American colonies I
was extremely important because they had
two major tasks one was to maintain
slavery and the other was to wipe out
the indigenous population and they
didn't want interference with that so if
they became treaty worthy they would be
permitted to run their own internal
affairs without European interference
and that was not a small point like
Britain and say at the time the major
power was moving towards abolition of
slavery and getting there was moving
there and had also been protecting the
to the Native Americans but once the
United States became treaty worthy it
was free from those external constraints
I'm just a little bit like the current
international system which police in
principle says you know how to interfere
with the affairs of other countries Lex
a South African of South Africa during
the years when it was struggling to
maintain apartheid its claim was you
know just not vacuous was that the UN
Charter guarantees that each state can
run its own affairs internally so what
does the world have to say about
apartheid that was their argument it was
actually accepted by the legal
authorities for a long time
you
saying I mean that's nationalism but has
its positive aspect but it can be very
ugly I don't have to give a historical
examples we have plenty of them
you
well my guess will be that if there is a
move towards autonomy in Scotland
it'll be mild reforms nothing's going to
be smashed
they'll be slow evolutionary changes and
the way Scotland will interact with
England with European Union with the
United States with international
treaties and capitalists sufficiently
internationalized so there's going to be
plenty of links and plenty of power
different won't power won't devolve to
the local level if the international
financial system is just too powerful
for that so until that's dismantled all
states are going to be and meshed in the
webs that it develops I mean in the case
of the European Union's extreme the
windows bunk and the Brussels
bureaucrats are in effect dictating
policy for states that's even the Wall
Street Journal had an article pointing
out that no matter what government wins
an election in Europe you know
communists fascists whatever maybe they
follow the same policies because the
policies are not being determined by the
countries in fact we saw that pretty
dramatically when the George Papandreou
hinted barely that maybe there ought to
be a referendum in Greece for people to
decide if they wanted to accept the EU
policies and there was just a uproar
furor how can you ask the people what do
they have to do it
this stuff is all determined by the
bankers and the bureaucrats in Brussels
so it's in you know without really
substantial changes in the international
order any small state like say
independent Scotland would have to
accommodate itself to that somehow
you
well I read Jim Coleman's comments I
mean if it's simply withdrawing that
doesn't help much if it's withdrawing in
order to concentrate on other things
which I presume he meant like developing
vigorous social movements which will
lead to which will lay the basis for
substantial socio-economic change and if
we throwing means let's put our energy
into that then it could be positive if
withdrawing simply means I'll stay home
on referendum days and it doesn't mean
anything
you
well first of all is it very easy to
imagine because we live in an
alternative to capitalism let me take
say the big banks which have enormous
power where did the wealth and power
come from well actually there was a
study by the International Monetary Fund
a little while ago of the big banks in
the United States you know and it
determined that their profits almost
entirely derived from taxpayers their
profits traced back to thee there's a
government insurance policy it's not
formal but it's tacit it's called too
big to fail it means that if you get in
any trouble the taxpayer bail you out
that provides the big banks with
enormous profits it's not just the
bailouts the visible bailouts it means
that they get access to cheap credit
they get inflate inflated credit ratings
all sorts of mechanisms which are highly
profitable to them it also means that
they can engage in risky transactions
which tend to be profitable and they'll
have to worry too much because if it
goes wrong you run cap and hand to the
state and they bail you out is that
capitalism very remote from capitalism
in fact almost everything you do say you
have a computer I'm sure you use the
Internet is that a capitalist
development I was developed places like
this in fact right where we're sitting
under Pentagon contracts for decades
before it was handed over to a private
enterprise to market Bill Gates is the
richest man in the world basically - he
introduced some marketing innovations
undoubtedly but the basic technology and
hardware and the software the big ideas
the hard work was mostly done in
in the state sector and one or another
way there directly or indirectly in one
fashion and he also has a monopoly
rights he managed to get in at a time
which grants Microsoft something like
monopoly rights for operating systems
like if you buy a computer you get
Windows no well reliance on the creative
work in the state sector and on monopoly
rights is pretty remote from capitalism
and we have a kind of a mixed state
capitalist system but it's not
capitalism can you imagine alternatives
to that it's very easy actually
capitalism would be an alternative but
they're much better ones so for example
you can easily imagine systems in which
say the big banks do not maintain their
profit and their ability to crash the
system because of taxpayer munificent
easy to imagine and in fact there are
many other forms of organization of
production of distribution and so on
which are in fact being developed so
their work around enterprises in many
places the old Rust Belt their big
cooperative many big cooperative
movements Atlantic region and Canada
many other places these are all
alternatives you know germs of another
society imagining something more free
and justice not only not hard but you
can see bits and pieces of it
development
you
well you do what's possible it
stages of history under particular
circumstances
there's no point there's no master
answer to this at different times there
are different things to do there are
times when it's possible to introduce a
radical change in the society of the
most dramatic case was in 1936 in Spain
when a large part of Spain was taken
over by partially coordinated peasant
and worker movements which created the
germs of a left libertarian society
didn't last long not because it failed
but because it was crushed by force I
mean the Communists the fascist liberal
democracies that disagreed on a lot of
things but they agreed on one thing we
have to crush freedom so the first year
of the Spanish Civil War so-called was
basically a year devoted to crushing the
libertarian forces of the left
communists in the lead but fascists and
liberal democracies participate or will
wrote about this not entirely as he said
he didn't entirely understand what was
happening and there's much extensive
work by now but that's essentially what
happened well that was a moment when a
radical that would circumstances were
ripe for a radical change and it wasn't
just out of nothing on this decades of
preparation for the preliminary efforts
trials crushed to rebuild educational
programs people sort of had in their
head what you could do be kind of
because of decades of struggle and
that's how things can happen
it happens in other respects too and it
takes a the American civil rights
movement which was a partial success not
a huge success but a partial significant
success the background had been laid for
decades of work most of which got
nowhere or almost nowhere in 1960 a
couple of black students sat in a lunch
counter arrested the next day more
students pretty soon you had Freedom
Riders formation of snake which was the
forefront of the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee he was kind of
the forefront of the civil rights
movement appreciate you had a mass
movement and things changed the it was a
moment it was it took will and energy
and effort but but kind of you know that
the time was ripe for it because of work
over long periods and I think that's the
weight changes take place
you
I think we comprehended it then and long
before people carrying out a slave
revolution understood the nature of
power very well people struggling for
the rights everywhere have understood
the nature of power and we still
understand it there's nothing I don't
think there's anything deep and
invisible the structures of power those
we have to unravel like because a the
European Union you want to understand
the structure of power in the European
Union you have to understand the way the
bureaucracy works the banks work the
Bundesbank works and so on but the
nature of power I don't think that's
very obscure
you
we're too complex for that lots of
things are happening I mean there's many
general comments you can make about them
so for example you can talk about the
international treaties that are being
created and ask what they are right now
for there's two huge treaties being
negotiated the trans-pacific and
transatlantic partnership and you can
ask what they are actually you can't
really say in detail because they're
negotiated in secret
of course not entirely in secret they're
not secret from the hundreds of
corporate lawyers and lobbyists who are
writing them which tells you what
they're going to be but they're secret
from the general population more or less
but you can study the nature of these
what the doing it's been done good
articles in Lemont diplomatic and Public
Citizen elsewhere and and when you
unravel that you discover a good deal
about the structure of power you read
this morning's newspaper and you find
that the US and Japan have failed to
impose on their populations something
they were trying to do in secret so far
I feel well all of that can be studied
and it but there's no single sort of
phrase you can make up slogans if you
like but there are no illuminating
single phrases that capture the
complexity of human life
