so what's the connection between your
moral consciousness and your obedience
to the law out of the way how do we get
more authoritative the moral
consciousness I'm going to get any idea
I mean somehow we get it through a
combination of experience and intuition
and thinking about the problems of
others and so on in fact there's a
definite broadening of moral
consciousness over the ages the things
that were considered entirely legitimate
you know two hundred years ago are
considered Nazi like today for example
if some third-world country today were
to produce something like the US
Constitution which was a you know terms
of revolutionary document at the time
highly libertarian if say you know some
third-world country today were to
produce what we call it a reversion of
Nazism when after when you take a look
at the US Constitution and there's a
category of people who were kept
described as three-fifths human it's
like if you're a slave owner you get an
extra three-fifths of the vote for every
slave you have well I mean that's beyond
discussion today but it was quite a
keeping with me yeah the attitudes at
the time in fact not on slavery but
genocide was considered perfectly
legitimate where I live and in
Massachusetts was you know no he needs
around because the Puritans just carry
on genocide and they considered that not
only moral but they thought it was what
they're following the Word of God and
basically they were right I mean they
appeal to the Old Testament which is
probably the most genocide 'old book in
the whole literary canon and said look
we're doing what the Hebrews did to
analyze and when we wipe out the Pequots
down to the last child you know disperse
them to make sure that they don't
reproduce and swords and so that that
was considered highly moral no genocide
is considered highly moral not just
palatable and it would be you have to go
pretty far to the limits to find
somebody saying that today all those you
call that for but the pretty for the and
then the same comes right after the
present I mean questions about women's
rights for example we're not taking a
year seriously thirty years ago as they
are today that's an expansion of
consciousness questions about animal
rights were unimaginable twenty years
ago
but they're taking fairly seriously
today so for example there are now even
laws for treatment of laboratory animals
which were unheard of twenty years ago
and there are many people who think that
you shouldn't even at I mean
vegetarianism is an expansion of moral
consciousness you know what are the
right expansions when can debate but but
the moral sphere has been expanded is
undoubted undoubtable and that's
beautiful and that means that we might
have a reasonable interpretation of that
is that over time that this is over
historical period so it's not our
personal experience but over historical
experience and accumulated historical
experience and lots of struggle and
conflict the more the era we get a kind
of access to our moral consciousness
that one didn't have in an earlier fury
and there's no reason to think that that
process it's not all the process of
linear marching forward by any means so
if you go back a hundred years ago
somebody like say Andrew Carnegie the
founder of the world's first
billion-dollar corporation really
publicly stated that he believed that
things like wage labor early human that
season regarded socialism does the such
an obviously true ideal that if we ever
reach it will achieve the Millennium
well you know his counterpart wouldn't
say that today the idea that wage
slavery is and it was quite common among
working people that many people who
fought in the Civil War
ordinary working people thought that
they were fighting to eliminate slavery
then became industrial workers in the
growing industrial system of the
post-civil war period it's quite common
that time to say look we fought to
eliminate slavery we're just being made
slaves again by being becoming tools of
production in the new industrial system
in which we have to follow the orders of
the Masters that's what we fought
against in the Civil War
well that's I should go here made
different interpretation but in my
opinion that was a level of insight into
our moral nature that's been largely
lost the idea that renting yourself to
others in order to survive as an
infringement on your nature is something
that was commonly understood a century
ago and is barely in the sphere of
culture awareness today
