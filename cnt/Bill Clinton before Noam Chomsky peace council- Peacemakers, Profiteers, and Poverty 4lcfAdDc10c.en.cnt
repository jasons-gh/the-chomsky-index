two Canadian provinces and the District
of Columbia now what makes him
interesting and deserving that's perhaps
the not the right term to use in this
context but why I thought he should be

done but because he loved them into

mr. president it's a great honor for all
of us to have you be with us this
evening
you were properly introduced today by a
friend whose ID I want you to know
compared to his characterization of your
chief rivals you came out remarkably
well ladies and gentlemen the president
United States thank you very much
thank you very much thank you very much
the last time I was with the woods we
were in Jackson Hole Wyoming in the
Grand Tetons and this outfit would have
been highly inappropriate there I felt
more at home but I saw it tonight I kind
of I'm jealous of that beautiful shirt I
don't know where you got it I'm so glad
to see all of you I know some of our
administration members have been here
secretary Rubin who feels right at home
I still can't believe Bob Rubin is a
Democrat he told me not very long ago we
were going to have to change the
currency to avoid counterfeiting and I
said well alright and he said but I want
to start with hundred-dollar bills so
that's where we started I have reviewed
a little bit about who spoke here today
and what they said and yet if Hugh
sighed he really said that he must have
been awful tough on the people who are
running against me I want to talk to you
tonight about obviously about the major
controversy presently raging in
Washington about the balanced budget but
I want to try to set the stage for what
this is really means and what's really
going on and I'd like to begin with what
I think is the most important thing
which is what kind of country we live in
and what kind of country we wish to live
in and what kind of country we wish to
live our leave for our children and our
grandchildren that after all is the most
important thing of all when I had sought
this job in 1992 I did it because I
wanted to restore the American dream for
all of our people and because I wanted
this country to go into the next century
still as the world's leader for freedom
and peace and prosperity and democracy
because I really believe that we're all
better off in a country where people
have opportunity but exercise
responsibility where we strengthen work
but we also strengthen our families and
where we recognize that the real power
in America should be at the community
level where people work together and
where they deal with each other directly
instead of through the filters that
exists between me and Washington and you
where you live this is a remarkable
period of success for America's economy
all of you are doing a remarkable job
we've had a great two-and-a-half years
and I believe there are better times
ahead if we make the right decisions
it's a time of profound change we're
moving from the industrial to the
Information and Technology age we moved
out of the Cold War into a global
marketplace we have problems to be sure
but they're nowhere near as great as the
opportunities we have when I sought the
presidency I said that I wanted to do
three things I wanted to restore
pro-growth economics I wanted to put
mainstream values back at the heart of
our social policy and I wanted to give
America a modern government that was
more entrepreneurial and smaller and
gave more authority to the state and
local governments to the private sector
and operated more as a partner with
others to build a better America I said
then and I believe I have been true to
this that I wanted to see new ideas
injected into our political life
everything from welfare reform the
national service to empowerment zones
for our inner cities to the reinventing
government program that the vice
president has done such a good job with
I said I would make a good-faith effort
to move beyond the partisan labels that
had divided people so much in the past
and believe it or not I have done my
best to do that it's a lot harder in
Washington than it is in the state
capitals in the cities of the country
but it can be done and it will be done
again I believe in the next few weeks I
also believe then and I believe more
strongly now
then at a time of change it's important
that the president make decisions based
on their long-term impact as opposed to
their short-term benefits or burdens now
if you look at the last two and a half
years you must all be very proud our
country has produced seven and a half
million jobs two and a half million new
home owners about two million new small
business owners the largest number of
new small businesses and at such a time
period in the history of the United
States a record number of new self-made
millionaires trade has increased in the
last three years from 4% in 93 10% in 94
and it's going up 16 percent this year
our exports the deficit has come from
290 a year down to 160 billion dollars a
year of course there are still problems
in any period of profound change there
tends to be a big disruption and a
significant problem of income inequality
we have that in America we need to get
more energy and growth back in the
middle class families incomes we have
still some isolated areas in our country
that have not felt that benefits of this
recovery and I believe that the budget
proposal now in Congress would undermine
our economic growth in the future unless
it's modified significantly and I'll say
more about that in a moment
I think the policies of this
administration have made a contribution
to that economic record by reducing the
deficit by expanding trade through NAFTA
and GATT and taking all those outdated
Cold War controls off of our
high-technology exports by concluding
over 80 trade agreements through the
efforts of ambassador cantor including
15 with Japan alone by investing in
technology research and development and
defense conversion and by working with
so many of you to manifest a real
commitment to the education of all
Americans more money but also higher
standards higher expectation and more
accountability in education if you look
at the question of our social problems
and whether we've been successful in
putting middle-class values into our
approach you can all be somewhat hopeful
there the crime rate is down in almost
every place in America the murder rate
is down the welfare rolls are down the
Food Stamp rolls are down the poverty
rate is down the teen pregnancy rate has
gone down for two years in a row
Americans are reasserting their belief
in old-fashioned personal family and
community responsibilities and it is
beginning to work yes we have some
problems we still need to pass a
national welfare reform plan I believe
we still need to avoid the Tennessee
that's now alive in Congress to believe
that all you need to do on crime problem
is to put people in jail and we don't
need anything to do with prevention and
giving our young people something to say
yes to but basically we are moving in
the right direction to reassert and re
insert into American life mainstream
values and I believe the initiatives of
our administration have played a role in
that the crime bill which is putting a
hundred thousand more police on the
street
keeping repeat offenders off the street
passing the Brady Bill passing the
assault weapons ban doing things that
enable our local communities to help
prevent crimes I think it's making a
difference I believe the work we've done
and what the New York Times called a
quiet revolution in welfare our
administration has given thirty five
states over 40 separate approvals to get
around federal rules and regulations to
move people from welfare to work when
the Congress wouldn't pass the bill we
just decided to reform welfare state by
state community by community we have
offered all 50 states within an any
30-day period a complete relief from any
number of federal rules and regulations
that they will present a comprehensive
plan to move people from welfare to work
without hurting their children I think
when we almost doubled the family tax
credit that President Reagan said was
the best anti-poverty program the
country had ever come up with so that we
can now say that anybody who works 40
hours a week and has children
the home will not live in poverty that
was a major step toward rewarding work
and family and helping us to reward
reformed welfare and get people out of
welfare into the work rules I think the
National Service Program is an important
advance we celebrated its first year
yesterday with a young woman from Kansas
City who's working her way through
college from an inner-city neighborhood
in Kansas City with a project of young
volunteers who have closed 44 crack
houses in Kansas City in the last year
and these are the kind of thing being
done by these young people all over
America whether they're building houses
with Habitat for Humanity tutoring kids
in rural Kentucky where they have
increased the grade level in reading by
3 fold in one year are helping to fight
the crime problem all these things
manifest our values and something I know
that means a lot to all of you we have
tried to give the American people a more
modern government the size of the
federal government tonight when I left
Washington was 163,000 smaller than it
was the day I became president it's the
smallest federal government since John
Kennedy was president we will reduce it
by another hundred and ten thousand in
the next two years no matter what the
Congress does with this budget this
government as a percentage of the
civilian non-farm payroll is the
smallest government the United States
has had in Washington since 1933 now
those are facts we produce sixteen
thousand pages of regulations cut the
regulations the Small Business
Administration by 50% the regulations of
the Education Department by 40% next
year the paperwork time that businesses
spend fooling with the Environmental
Protection Agency will be down by 25%
more important than all that to me I
think our government's working better
the Small Business Administration has
cut its budget by 40% and doubled its
loan output the export-import bank is
helping small businesses that never knew
what it was before to sell their
products all around the world the
Commerce Department and the State
Department have
more good for American businesses
overseas than any commerce department
and state department in modern history
and every one of you who has worked with
them know that that is the absolute
truth we are moving forward to give you
a government that works something the
automobile industry has been working
with us in partnership to produce a
clean car it is a big deal
1995 was the hottest year for the planet
Earth since the present temperature
system was devised China is growing
rapidly if everybody in China winds up
with a car and you don't want the
atmosphere of this earth to burn up we
had better find an efficient way of
moving people around and this is a sort
of thing that we're trying to do let me
tell you this this will probably
surprise you more than anything every
year Business Week hardly an arm of the
Democratic Party or in my administration
recognizes outstanding businesses for
performance in various categories this
year in the category of service to
consumers by telephone the winner was
not LL Bean our Federal Express but the
Social Security Administration of your
federal government so I think that we
have made a contribution to modernizing
the federal government it's smaller it's
less bureaucratic it is more
entrepreneurial it still has dumb things
and the rules and it does dumb things it
drives me crazy that I find out about
about after it's over but it is better
than it was before
by a very very long shot and the most
important thing is we're trying to help
move decisions back where people make
for them the mayor of Chicago is here
Chicago received one of our empowerment
zones a new idea helping to attract
private investment into inner cities to
grow the economy and give people a stake
in America's future
Chicago received more funds for police
not because we know how to prevent crime
but they do if they have the means to do
it and funds for prevention to support
programs like the ones in Chicago that
have lowered the crime rate even though
they make fodder for congressional
speeches like midnight basketball better
a kid on a basketball court then
corner selling drugs our mugging
somebody and winding up in jail we
didn't make the decisions they make the
decisions at the local level we finally
passed a bill to stop mandating cost on
state and local governments that we
don't help them pay for these are the
kinds of things that are going on we are
moving in the right direction your
country is and you ought to be proud of
it and America has been gratified to be
a part of making peace in the Middle
East progress in Northern Ireland the
ceasefire in Bosnia making sure that for
the first time since the dawn of the
nuclear age there aren't any missiles
pointed at Americans are there children
tonight North Korea is moving away from
its nuclear program and by the grace of
God we might get a comprehensive
test-ban treaty on all nuclear testing
next year we seem to be headed in that
direction
what is the future holds first we do
have to balance the budget it's the
right thing to do to take the burden of
debt off our children and free up
capital for private-sector investment
I'm really proud of the fact that way
over 90 percent of the new jobs created
in this recovery were created not by
government but in the private sector
that is exactly what we wanted to happen
so as we reduce the size of government
the private sector is growing more we
have to do it but we have to do it
consistent with our values and with our
interests the second thing we have to do
is to expand trade we have our friends
here from the Americas Mack McLarty
who's here with me worked so hard last
December on the summit of the Americas
and we have worked to follow up on that
we believe that our partners in this
hemisphere are a very very important
part of our future we believe we have to
build on that until we have partnerships
with all these democratic governments to
reward their moves to democracy to
freedom to market economics with a
genuine and respectful partnership with
the United States in that connection I'd
say I was very well pleased with the
remarkable visit I just had with the
President of Mexico and the fact that
they have already paid back 700 million
dollars of the loan they received
through our international financial
package ahead of schedule
being faithful to their commitments to
modernize Mexico politically and
economically we have to continue to
invest in technology and make it our
friend not our foe people cannot afford
to be afraid of the technological
revolution that is sweeping the world we
just have to make sure that everybody
can have access to it and we have to
give people the tools they need to
succeed in that connection let me say I
am very grateful for the support that
we've gotten from the business community
for every education initiative of our
administration from expanding head start
to the goals 2000 program which focuses
on national standards and grassroots
reforms to the expansion of student
loans
and just a couple of days ago I know the
Secretary of Labor said this earlier but
I want to emphasize this because it
achieved almost
public notice largely because there were
only two votes against this bill in the
Senate and when there's no controversy
it is often deemed not important but
with no controversy a couple of days ago
the United States Senate adopted what I
thought was one of the most important
new ideas that I advocated in the State
of the Union message the GI bill for
America's workers consolidating seventy
separate marginally impacting federal
training programs into a big fund and
saying to unemployed people we will just
send you a voucher we will send you a
voucher if you lose your job and you can
immediately take it to the nearest
Community College and begin to start
your life again
now that's very important a lot of you
pay a lot of unemployment tax the
unemployment system today is not
relevant to the city to the times in
which we live when the unemployment
system in America was developed 85% of
the people were called back to the jobs
they were laid off from today 85% of the
people who are laid off are never called
back to those jobs if we want people to
feel secure about the future to have a
stake in the future
we have to increase their sense of
empowerment about it that's what this GI
bill for America's workers will do it's
a very important idea and we ought to
stick with it and support it and
properly fund it now let me say
something in all candor to happen if
we're going to continue to move forward
in a time of change you have to expect
the leadership of the country to do what
you have to do in a time of change and
that's to make decisions that are
unpopular in the short run because
they're right over the long run now I
have found as an elected official that
everybody is far that in general but
they're against it in particular and let
me just give you some examples of the
kind of things I've faced I bet I've
done five things that have made
everybody in this room mad in the last
two-and-a-half years at least five but I
want to give you a few when I became
president I knew based on my
conversations with mr. Greenspan with
people in the private markets with
others that if we could reduce the
deficit at least 500 billion
dollars in five years we get a big drop
in interest rates and a big boom in this
economy I knew that and I knew
conversely if we fail to do it that we
would continue to lengthen the sluggish
economy which I confronted when I took
office so I made up my mind come hell or
high water we were going to reduce the
deficit five hundred billion dollars and
the first week I showed up in Washington
the leaders of the minority in Congress
who are now the majority leader in the
Speaker of the House told me that I
would not get one vote for my budget no
matter what I did not a single solitary
vote the policy was going to be just say
no as a consequence I had to raise your
taxes more and cut spending less than I
wanted to which made a lot of you
furious all I know is we got a huge drop
in interest rates and a big boom in the
economy and most everybody who paid more
made more than they paid and it was the
right thing for the United States it was
wrong for them to refuse to cooperate
with me but they were richly rewarded
for it later on but our country is
better off because we passed a
deficit-reduction plan which over a
seven-year period is about as big as the
one we're debating in the Congress today
and that's what got this country going
again and we did it without cutting
education or investment in technology or
the environment or our future I'll give
you another example that affects the
mayor here when we were debating the
brady bill to require people to wait
five days before they got a handgun and
the assault weapons ban all my political
advisors said don't do this this is
crazy and I said why do you think it's
crazy and they said because everybody
that's against this will vote against
everybody who's for it but all the
people that are for it they'll find some
other reason to oppose you that's why
things don't get done in your country
because organized interests and their
intense opposition always overcome the
generalized feeling of goodwill which is
not manifest in the same intensity of
support
but you know what last year 40,000
people with criminal records did not get
handguns because of the brady law and it
was the right thing to do and i am tired
of picking up the newspaper and seeing
kids that are honor students in school
getting shot down standing at bus stops
by nuts with assault weapons and by
election time next time every hunter in
my state will know that nobody lost
their hunting rifle and it was all a big
canard there was nothing to it but
people are alive today because those
decisions were made the teenage smoking
and it's the same thing same folks came
and said oh don't do this but the time
of tobacco companies get through working
on you they'll convince every tobacco
farmer in North Carolina and Tennessee
that you're going to drive them in the
poorhouse they'll all vote against
everybody with the D behind their name
they will bury you and everybody in
America that agrees with you will find
some other reason not to support you
this is dumb politics well it might be
but we studied that issue for 14 months
we found out two companies knew for
thirty years what they were doing and
kept on doing it and didn't own up to it
we found out that there were still
deliberate attempts to advertise to
young people and most important we found
out that 3,000 kids a day start smoking
and a thousand of them are gonna die
sooner because of it I don't know what
you think a thousand kids a day are
worth but to me that's the kind of
America I want to live in where another
thousand kids a day have longer better
for their lives because somebody doesn't
sucker punch them into doing something
they shouldn't do while they are still
children so it may be unpopular
but I think it was the right thing to do
the same thing something we most of you
agree with me I think the affirmative
action issue everybody said oh you don't
need that you need to be against this we
need to stop this but there is still
racial discrimination in America folks
when five federal law enforcement
officials can't even get served in
denny's there's a problem there and I
could give you a lot of other examples
I don't favor unfair preferences or
quotas or reverse discrimination our
administration has actually joined
lawsuits
against reverse discrimination in States
but everybody has to be considered in
this country the great meal ticket we've
got to the future is that this is the
most diverse big rich country in the
world Los Angeles County has a hundred
and fifty different racial and ethnic
groups in one County in the global
village
it is a manna from heaven but we have to
learn to live together and work together
with common values and a common chance
to succeed so we said let's mend
affirmative action but let's don't end
it and I hope and believe it made it
possible for the people who lead large
companies in our country to follow the
same policy I could give you lots of
other examples but you get the idea when
you're going through a period of change
like this you can't even predict what's
going to be popular
last night we celebrated one year of the
restoration of democracy in Haiti well
when we through the dictators out of
Haiti hardly anybody was for it but it
was the right thing to do you can't let
dictators come to the United States and
stand in the shadow of the Statue of
Liberty and promise they're going to
leave and then go home and keep killing
people in the street and never even
blink an eye the United States couldn't
do that when we helped our friends and
neighbors in Mexico most of you probably
supported that but the day I made the
decision
there was a poll in the paper that said
by 81 215 the American people were
opposed to that half the people in the
country who were for it were in the room
at the time I decided to do it
but it was the right thing to do because
there are neighbors because they want to
do the right thing because they have the
capacity to grow and become our strong
partners and generate opportunities for
you and incomes and jobs for America
because our real future here no matter
what happens to the movement toward free
trade is with our friends here in our
back yard in our neighborhood so I would
ask all of you as people who have to
make difficult decisions to expect
people who lead your governmental
institutions to do the same thing and to
be perfectly willing to be held
accountable for the consequences of them
and that brings me to the budget issue
let me say what this is not about this
squabble in Washington it is not I say
again it is not about balancing the
budget there are two plans to balance
the budget both of which have been
blessed as perfectly credible by every
neutral observer our plan would now we
know would balance the budget in nine
years and continue to increase
investment in education research and
development technology and the
environment it would invest enough in
things like the Commerce Department the
State Department our eight programs to
maintain our world leadership which is
very important you see what happens when
we have a chance to exercise it it would
lengthen the life of the Medicare trust
fund just as much as the Republican
budget it would slow the rate of medical
inflation but not as much as their
budget why because nobody I know in the
health care field believes that we can
take four hundred and fifty billion
dollars out of Medicare and Medicaid
over the next seven years based on what
we now know without causing serious
problems to the medical schools of the
country to the children's hospitals of
the country to the ability of the
elderly poor to get into nursing homes
are their middle class children to have
them there and afford to educate their
children and devastating problems to our
ability to care for the over
20% of America's children who were so
poor they qualify for medical assistance
under the Medicaid program we do have to
slow the rate of medical inflation I've
been working at this for two years
we do have to bail out the Medicare
trust fund but we have to recognize that
we have to listen to the people who do
this for a living and have some sense of
the practical implications of how much
we can cut my budget has a tax cut but
it's smaller than the Congressional one
the Congressional budget balances the
budget in seven years
it cuts education research and
development technology investment in the
environment it drastically cuts back on
our ability to exercise world leadership
through the Commerce Department the
State Department and the aid programs
the tax cut they offer is bigger and
there's a big tax increase on the lower
income working poor a big one I think
one of our values ought to be to grow
the middle class and shrink the
underclass I think it's not a very good
idea on the edge of the 21st century to
grow the underclass and shrink the
middle class that is not my idea of what
kind of country I want my child and her
children to grow up in so can we resolve
this you bet we can
here's the practical thing this is what
I want to ask you to do there are four
or five big issues where there's a lot
of money involved one is we differ on
how much we estimate will grow I picked
a conservative figure two and a half
percent because that's what the economy
has grown for the last 25 years they
said oh no we're not going to grow that
fast well why are we balancing the
budget and given a capital gains tax cut
and doing all this stuff if we think
we're going to get lower growth than
we've had for the last 25 years I don't
want to argue it either way but I mean I
think my growth estimate is not a rosy
scenario it is lower than what a lot of
you pay for the blue-chip forecast is
for a higher economic growth and
therefore more revenues than I estimate
then we are arguing about the rate of
medical inflation then there's the
question of whether we should reassign
or redesign and recalculate the amount
of inflation and the consumer price
index which determines how much we
increase Social Security and retire
and we're talking about the size of the
tax cut I we can work this out folks the
only thing I won't do I will not do this
I will not let balancing the budgets
serve as a cover for destroying the
social compact for cutting back on
education wrecking the environment are
undermining our obligations to help
protect our children and treat our
elderly people decently because it is
not necessary to balance the budget now
I don't want you to take my side or
theirs on any of these big questions
here's what I'm asking you to do what I
want is to get together with the
Congress and get a budget out that is a
honorable compromise that is better than
theirs and better than mine that's the
best kind of get-together where
everybody puts their ideas together and
you come out with something that's
better than what anybody had I don't
have that I'm not the source of all
wisdom but I know this there not a
single one of you looking at the 21st
century and the position of your company
that would knowingly cut back on
research and development or investment
in technology or education and training
you wouldn't do it not if you didn't
have to and we don't have to
so all I'm asking you to do is to say
just get together come up with something
if you do it in good faith it'll be
better than the President's budget and
it'll be better than the Congress's
budget because when people get together
that's what they do I am prepared to
make some decisions that I think are
right over the long run and I believe
they are there is no earthly reason why
we shouldn't do this
America needs and deserves a balanced
budget America needs and deserves a
balanced budget consistent with our
values that will give us the kind of
world that we would be proud to have our
children and our grandchildren and their
children grow up in this country is
doing well and it's going to do better
and a lot of it is because of what you
are doing and a lot of us because of
what mayors
doing all over the country and a lot of
us because of what plain old American
citizens are doing we are moving in the
right direction and there is no country
on earth better positioned to do well in
the 21st century than the United States
of America and ironically all we have to
do to get there I believe is to be
faithful to our basic values and what we
know is right
that's the commitment I make to you and
I'm asking you tonight to do what you
can because you have more influence than
those of those folks than I do to make
sure that we get together and do this do
it right do it for America and do it for
the future thank you very much good part

Thanks thanks for your patience as well
well I don't know if the title that was
sent to me was also announced but if it
was you'll have noticed but it covers
about every imaginable base about
anything what I'd like to do is to say a
few words about where the you know where
I think the United States is going or to
be more accurate where it's being driven
by quite deliberate and conscious social
policy taking advantage of significant
changes that have occurred in the
International economy and the global
system during the past 20 25 years I'm
going to keep to the United States but
the comments that I want to make extend
in various degrees to other rich
societies the societies that commonly
indulge in the self agile ation that's
one of the prerogatives of power but
occasionally are described accurately
very occasionally for example once by
Winston Churchill at the height of
British imperial power right before the
First World War when he background he
was speaking to the British Cabinet and
he pointed out calling for rearmament
and he said we have got all we want in
territory and wish only to be left alone
in unmolested enjoyment of vast and
splendid possessions mainly acquired by
violence largely maintained by force and
then he says this often seems less
reasonable than to others than it does
to us for some reason which means that
various measures have to be taken to
teach reasonableness
well Churchill was alert enough to
realize that that's not for the public
ears that was
a secret cabinet meeting and when parts
of it did reach the public about 20
years later it was carefully sanitized
but has emerged 75 years later and
release documents and maybe if one were
to explore documents more carefully you
might even find some accurate
descriptions in our internal record
well what seemed unreasonable to others
also seemed quite unreasonable to more
humane people in Imperial England some
of them quite well known for example
Adam Smith 200 years ago 1776 who
denounced what he called the savage and
justice of the Europeans who were then
devastating much of the world and in
fact creating the first world third
world division that exists today and
doing it with ample savagery is Adam
Smith
understood and as he condemned and he
also understood something else that
Churchill didn't mention in these
remarks namely that there's a domestic
analogue that is the we who want to
enjoy their vast and splendid
possessions we're not the people of
England or the people of France or
America or others but rather a sector
among among them those who Smith
described as the principal architects of
policy who used their power their
control over the economy to design
policy so that it would be so that their
own interests would be as he put it most
peculiarly attended to no matter how
Grievous the impact on others including
the people of England he spoke
particularly of the manufacturers and
merchants of England who were designing
using power to design state policy in
this fashion following what he called
the vile maxim of the Masters of mankind
all for ourselves and nothing for anyone
else
recall that Adam Smith there's a
mythical Adam Smith
so your thought about and there's a real
one who was saying things like this he
was a pre capitalist thinker with roots
and the Enlightenment and he regarded
all of this is outrageous and he also
insisted on relative equality of
condition as an elementary principle of
justice and morality a position in which
he was joined by Benjamin Franklin and
James Madison and Thomas Jefferson and
authentic conservatives like the
Tocqueville years later all of whom also
recognized that it's a prerequisite for
anything remotely like democracy
these were truisms hundreds of years ago
and they remain true today even though
they're regularly denied
well these same issues arose very
prominently at the foundation of this
country among the founding fathers of
American democracy at pretty much the
same time a few years later ten years
later in a 1787 at the Constitutional
Convention James Madison who was
basically the main framer of the
Constitution emphasized to the
convention that the first priority of
government must be as he put it to
protect the minority of the opulent
against the majority and in fact the
system was designed very specifically
and consciously to that end power had to
be placed in the hands of the owners of
property
Madison insisted so that the minority
the opulent could be projected protected
against the majority in a formally
democratic system that's the way it was
designed and that's the way it remained
now Madison had a rather naive belief
that the minority of the opulent would
behave as enlightened civilized
gentlemen like the Republican Romans of
his imagination
and I stress but he soon discovered that
that reality was pretty far from the
reality was quite different and within a
few years seeing what had happened
Madison deplored what he called the
daring depravity of the times as the
wealthy came to use their control of
government exactly as Adam Smith had
described put it in well using Madison's
own words I said the stock jobbers are
becoming the Praetorian band of
government at once it's tool and it's
tyrant bribed by its largesses and over
it by its clamors and combinations
earlier in this century the same thought
was put more simply by America's leading
social philosopher John Dewey who
pointed out that politics is the shadow
cast by big business over society and as
long as the substance isn't changed
attenuation of the shadow changes at the
margins will be useful but limited let
me stress that these are truisms they've
been truisms for 200 years and they're
true isms that are well to bear in mind
well these struggles struggles between
the minority of the opulent
and the majority which were well
understood two hundred years ago by
leading thinkers we're supposed to
review but not read they remain the
leading themes of history and it's worth
I think it's pertinent today to remember
how they've been played out over the
years obviously I can't run through that
but I'll mention a few points which I
think are worth bearing in mind in the
mid 19th century in the United States
there was a lively and vigorous
independent labor press mainly in places
like not too far from here in fact the
Lawrence and Lowell and the
working-class towns of northeastern
United States where the Industrial
Revolution was taking place and indeed
that independent labor pressroom
for a long time as late as the 1950s
there were still about 800 labor
newspapers reaching about 30 million
people later they were that was the tail
end after that they were wiped out by
concentrations of corporate capital and
they're very interesting reading the the
press was run by working people by what
they called Factory girls young women
off the farms who were working in the
Lowell mills or artisans and mechanics
and they denounced what they called the
new spirit of the age gained wealth for
getting all but self you know there were
Smith's bio Maxim which they called a
demeaning and a degrading doctrine that
was destroying the revolutionary
heritage of the United States destroying
democratic rights destroying elementary
human values even destroying their
surprisingly high cultural level of
those days all exactly as Adam Smith and
James Madison and particularly Thomas
Jefferson had warned would happen Thanks
these conflicts the conflict of ordinary
people with the new spirit of the age
continued have continued right up until
the present there have been many
victories for freedom and democracy in
human rights they have been gained by
often quite bitter struggle and there
have been many periods of decline and
defeat and again that cycle is well to
remember about a hundred years ago the
famous art ISM radical artisan William
Morris in England wrote I know that it
is the received opinion that the
competitive devil take the hindmost
system that now prevails is perfection
and therefore finality has been reached
in it but if history is really at an end
in this devil take the hindmost system
this system as he described it then
civilization will die however he went on
to say that despite the opinion of
learned men that history is at an end
all of history says that this is not so
the claim trip claims have been made
before unfortunately were false and he
was right the struggle continued
continued with victories and defeats in
the United States the repression of
working people was unusually violent and
severe by international standards it
scandalized even the right-wing British
and other European press by the 1920s
the opulent minority again believed that
history was at an end that perfection
was in sight in the United States and
that the vile Maxim that Smith condemned
could rule unchallenged Woodrow Wilson's
Red Scare the end of World War one had
pretty much demolished and destroyed the
union movement the labor movement had
undermined independent thought and it
had established an era of business
dominance that was expected at that time
to be permanent working people had no
power and very little hope at the peak
of the automobile boom of the 1920 any
rights that they had were at the
tolerance of employers one foreign
visitor observed with some amazement
comparing the United States with
comparable countries the leading labor
historian in the United States
University professor David Montgomery
comments correctly that modern America
was created over the protests of its
working people vigorous and outspoken
protests and fierce struggles as he puts
it with hard-won victories but also
periods of forced accommodation to a
most undemocratic America notably in the
1920s
well again the predictions of the end of
history were proven wrong within a few
years
popular struggles had considerably
extended human rights and democracy even
gaining for working people in the United
States the rights that they had achieved
decades earlier throughout most of the
industrial world
Europe Australia and elsewhere well the
achievement of those rights during the
30s and the struggles of the 30s that
gave rise very quickly to new conflicts
as the minority of the opulent sought to
contain these achievements in fact the
achievement of ordinary what had long
been regarded as ordinary rights for
working people in the 1930s the
achievement of that in the United States
set off real fury and the organized
business community the National
Association of Manufacturers reacted by
warning of what it called the hazard
facing industrialists in the rising
political power of the masses
incidentally that terminology surprises
you and sounds like a Maoist text you
have to remember that the business
community is vulgar Marxist as is the
government and that kind of terminology
about the rising political power of the
masses perfectly standard government
documents and business press there they
see themselves as fighting a vicious
class war and always have well they were
were they warned that unless the
thinking of the masses is redirected we
will be facing a disaster
and in fact a serious counter-attack was
launched right at in the late 1930s it
was put on hold during war but picked up
with great vigor after World War two
there was a quite spectacular campaign
propaganda and everything else to try to
overcome the rising political power of
the masses and to save our preferred way
of life as business leaders put it
they described the task as continuing
with the everlasting battle for the
minds of men
indoctrinate people with the capitalist
story we have three to five years it was
claimed to save our American what they
called our American Way of life against
this rising political power of the
masses and a huge campaign was
undertaken the scale of it is pretty
spectacular by the early 1950s about one
third of the materials in schools around
the country were being provided by
business as straight business propaganda
about twenty million people a week we're
watching propaganda films the resources
of the entertainment industry were
mobilized to try to portray there were
several major goals one was to portray
unions as the enemy of the working
people on the waterfront Marlon Brando's
famous example you know honest working
man stands up against tough union bosses
and everyone ends up happy to create a
picture of harmony and Americanism
meaning the hard-working executive and
the sober workman the housewife taking
care of the kids all together against
these Outsiders who are trying to cause
disruption by organizing people and
getting them to try to fight for their
rights and so on and so forth the
campaign was extraordinary in scale it
attacked it targeted the churches the
schools the universities even
recreational programs to win the
everlasting battle for the minds of men
and
indoctrinate people with the capitalist
story and to try to get one crucial part
of it which has a lot of resonance today
is to try to get people to hate the
government there's a good reason for
that
the government whatever you think of
even though the business knew as well as
anybody that government is the shadow
cast by big business over Society
nevertheless government has a fatal flaw
that corporate power doesn't have in
principle it's possible for people to
participate in it and to influence in
contrast corporations are private
tyrannies they are totalitarian and
structure they're unaccountable and
there's no way for the population to
become involved in their decisions or
even to know what they are government
however well controlled by the substance
behind the shadow has the flaw that it
is potentially democratic and therefore
it makes good sense to try to direct
people's hatred and anger and fear and
so on against government and to keep the
shadow the substance behind it very well
hidden
that is the main theme the massive
propaganda to which people are subjected
from every point of view and the end
result is the mood that's called anti
politics if you're angry and you have
good reasons to be angry for most of the
population directed against the
government not against the fortune 500
just pay attention to the shadow not the
substance that and the attack on efforts
of people to organize and to realize the
rising the potential rising political
power of the masses those are the major
themes of very spectacular propaganda
campaigns there's actually some pretty
good scholarly work that's just coming
out in the last couple of years on these
topics and I thought I knew something
about it but it's pretty remarkable to
see what the scale was and the
consciousness well that had its effect
we're again now in one of those periods
when the end of history
[Music]
again we're in the midst of an area
you're of a kind of roll back a very
vigorous attack on freedom and human
rights and democratic values and even an
attack on markets contrary to what's
being claimed and it's well to bear in
mind the lessons of history which are
rich and valuable the Utopia of the
Masters guided by the vile Maxim that's
been proclaimed over and over again
always wrongly because people have
always found ways to get together and to
struggle for decent human values and
there's no reason to believe today that
the civilization will die and that what
Madison called the depravity at the
times will be permanent
again a good look at history shows that
things aren't all that different than
they've been before and the hopes that
were realized before can be again well
another accurate description of the rich
countries this so-called developed world
can be read alongside of Churchill's was
given a couple of weeks ago by Carol
Bellamy she's the new director of UNICEF
an American of course appointed as usual
under quite considerable strong US
pressure but she released the latest
UNICEF annual report on state of the
world's children in which she concluded
the report concluded that 13 million
children die every year from
malnutrition and easily treatable
diseases that's up from about 11 million
a few years ago these are lives that
could be saved with pennies of aid the
report went on to say that tens of
millions of children could be saved from
mental retardation and physical disaster
at a cost that they estimate at five
cents per person per year
in the rich countries well that wasn't
reported in the National
however the press did report that on the
same day Congress had called for a cut
of 1/3 in the u.s. funds for UN agencies
including UNICEF so maybe if we're lucky
this that can go up to maybe 20 million
a year and another year or two and also
call it for terminating mostly
eliminating foreign aid the United
States already has the most miserly
record in the developed world and long
has and if you put aside the aid the
biggest component of aid which happens
to go to a very rich country namely
Israel if you eliminate that then we're
just off the spectrum completely off the
spectrum of developed societies that
timing was fortuitous but you wouldn't
have known it unless you somehow found
out that UNICEF had a press conference
that day well this is by no means a
response to public opinion quite the
contrary
public opinion continues to show what
the pollsters point out our strong
majorities not only in favour of foreign
aid if it reaches the poor but of even
for increased strong majorities in
favour of increased taxes for foreign
for more foreign aid that reaches the
port this is only one example of a very
consistent pattern in the last couple of
months that the allegedly poll driven
policies that are being undertaken are
radically opposed to the opinions of the
general population but they are favored
by the minority of the opulent and
therefore they are being put through and
if you look just at the headlines you'll
think that the public supports them
that's true in case after case in fact
almost without exception take the
biggest case the balanced budget
efforts you know headlines repeatedly
tell you yeah people strongly in favor
of a balanced budget we have to push
that through well there's a sense in
that in which that's true if you ask
people would you like to have a balanced
budget people would say sure you know me
too so you get very high numbers in
support of a balanced
if you ask people would you like to have
all your household debts cancelled by
magic they'd say yeah terrific
people are in favor of canceling
household debt on the other hand if you
go down below the headline and you look
at the data and you ask a sensible
question which is down there maybe
somewhere at the end of the column or
maybe not if you ask people would you
want a balanced budget if it's going to
mean cuts in education or health or
environmental protection and so on then
the figures go down to like 20 percent
in favor or maybe 25 percent in favor so
in other words there's overwhelming
opposition to the only serious question
but that you're not supposed to notice
and since the minority the opulent are
in favor of it as a technique of
destroying even the quite limited by
comparative standards quite limited
welfare systems in the United States
it's being rammed through and the same
in case after case after case if you
look carefully well again there's a
domestic analogue to what unicef
reported about the suffering of children
throughout the world because of lack of
pennies of aid the domestic analog is
right here it's one aspect of the
project that's now underway to try to
turn the United States itself into a
kind of a third world Society it's not
it's a rich very super rich country so
it's not gonna look like Brazil or
Mexico but to impose the structure of a
third world society that is a sector of
great opulence a large number of people
who are suffering or maybe miserable and
then a huge mass of people who are just
a purpose who people who contribute
nothing to profit-making which is the
only human value and therefore have no
human rights well if it's one of our say
dependencies like say Colombia or
someplace like that you just kill them
where you send out the death squads you
carry out social cleansing or something
like that sort in a more civilized
country like ours what you do is coop
him up into urban slums which
increasingly resemble concentration
camps in which they can prey on one
another or just throw him in jail
the prison population is through the
nineteen eighty used to be about about
nineteen eighty it was worth less at the
level of other countries it's more than
tripled during the 1980s it's still
going up there isn't any other country
in the developed world anywhere in the
world it's even close to it in per
capita imprisonment except for one
Russia just caught up with us after but
aside from that example we're way ahead
of everyone else well that's the sort of
civilized equivalent of death squads and
social cleansing and in fact it's not
that crime has gone up crime is pretty
stable it's been stable for about twenty
years
serious but hasn't changed declining but
there is a superfluous population they
got to be controlled and plenty of
people gain by this remember this has
become a big industry private prison
systems are now pretty wealthy
operations they're privatized of
coarsely everything else you meaning
more profit can be made in fact there
was a big article in The Wall Street
Journal about it him that a year ago
pointing out that the big investment
firms are making lots of money floating
bonds for new prisons Merrill Lynch and
the rest of them and furthermore that
high tech industry the military industry
what's mislabeled defense industry has
realized that they can get in the act
here's another cash cow you know another
form of public subsidy to high-tech
industry alongside that smaller than the
Pentagon but still substantial and
growing which they can get into by
selling high-tech surveillance
techniques you know sticking electrodes
and people and monitoring them with
supercomputers and so on and so forth
other kinds of scams of the sort that
have kept high tech industry going at
the public expense so it's another form
of Keynesian stimulation of the economy
public subsidy of private profit and can
be expected to grow because
various contributions to social welfare
well as part of this process of trying
to create a sort of a model of the third
world in a super-rich Society which you
can't miss walking through any American
city now begins to look more and more
like third world cities one part of the
process is the domestic analogue of the
attack on children throughout the world
and or simply the domestic analog of
malnutrition and starvation throughout
the world the United States is without
parallel in the developed world in the
level of malnutrition and often
starvation it reached about 30 million
people by 1990 including 12 million
children and one out of six of the
elderly many of whom are literally
starving we remember this is the richest
country in the world with absolutely
unparalleled bandages but the levels are
way beyond anyone that's before the bush
recession which made things even worse
and the Clinton recovery which was
historically unique in that its first
time that median wages real wages
continued to decline that's a decline
that's been going on since 1980 they
continued to decline right through the
recovery they're still declining right
now maybe even faster in the poverty
level in the United States is about
double that of comparably rich societies
children poverty among children's about
triple the level of other societies the
benefit the welfare system is extremely
limited as compared with other
comparable societies and one effect of
that is that the effect of government
spending reduces child poverty much less
than it does in other societies far less
and then during the Reagan years went
way below it it had been it take New
York City the richest city in the world
40% of children are now below the
poverty line that means lacking
sufficient food to maintain growth and
development in many cases inequality in
Manhattan is now greater than Guatemala
you know what Central America is like
well know what that means in Boston
which is another rich City the city
hospital the one that's deals that's
offer services to the poor people or so
it probably won't pretty soon because
they're being eliminated it had to
establish a malnutrition clinic a couple
of years ago for the first time ever
because it was dealing with third-world
levels of malnutrition among children
which got much worse over the winter not
surprisingly when parents had to make
the agonizing decision as to whether to
feed the children or heat their houses
that's unheard of in developed societies
the there are now tens of millions of
people who lack health insurance that's
increasing as I mentioned the crime rate
has been stable or even declining for
about twenty years but the prison
population is booming support systems
for the poor have declined very sharply
since the last since the 1970s if he
takes a afdc the one everyone talks
about age for families with dependent
children that's been cut by about half
since nineteen seventies it was already
very low by international standards to
begin with it's now being cut very
sharply maybe another five or seven
million children will be knocked off the
rolls kids aged about average age about
seven who have to learn responsibility
we're told the 1980s were a period of
relative there was some economic growth
relatively
by post-war standards but there was some
about 60% of the new wealth that was
created went to the top 1% of the
population and about 40% of families
declined in absolute terms during this
period median real wages have declined
steadily since 1980 right until today
the for the majority of workers that
means men with only without college
education real income has declined over
20 percent since 1980 that's the source
of the famous angry white male syndrome
that you hear about since 1987 took a
couple of years for the Reagan reforms
to come in but the 1987 they were
hitting even college-educated people and
their college-educated wages started
going down in 1987 most striking has
been the decline in entry-level wages
the wages that you get when you first
get a job that's declined 30% for males
18% for females since 1980
that's a portent of the future meanwhile
working hours are going up there's
people are working an average of about
two weeks per year over what they were
in 1980 the effect of these changes has
been to drive lots of women into the
workforce daycare or any other kind of
childcare is impossibly expensive the
United States does not have the support
systems for parents that other countries
have so for example parental leave for
childbirth is way lower than other
countries in fact it's lower just to
give you an example it's lower than the
standards for plantation workers in
Uganda at the moment and remember this
is the richest country in the world the
effect of all of this is people are
doing it simply because there's no other
way to provide food for their kids you
want to provide food you work 50-hour
weeks to parents otherwise no way with
wages going down and benefits going down
and working hours going up and you have
no choices because there's no unions
they've been destroyed so there's no
chance of organizing to react to this
the and since there's no very limited
daycare and other support system kids
are just left alone one effect is that
contact time between parents and
children has declined about 40% in the
last generation that's substantial high
quality the kids kids are left alone you
get latchkey children so-called
television and supervision with the
obvious effects violence by children
against children drug abuse it's no
secret all of this has been studied in
detail for example by in a recent UNICEF
report written by a well-known American
economist who compared the way in which
the rich societies school child neglect
in rich societies in which the rich
societies were developing and dealing
with the problems that all faced since
the 1970s she found two quite different
models as an anglo-american what she
called model which has been a disaster
for children and families and a European
Japanese model which facing the same
conditions improved their already better
circumstances considerably during the
same period this is a deliberate war
deliberate war against families and
children which has been amazingly enough
carried out under the banner of Family
Values and conservatism that's a real
tribute to the educated classes to be
able to pull that one off as is the fact
that the studies of the topic like the
UNICEF study and others like it are
unreviewed unmentionable try to find a
mention of them they only mentioned
when UNICEF said he came out they're
just not part of the debate because this
is not the right thing to think about if
you want to fight the everlasting battle
to control the minds of men well that's
a tribute to the educated classes
classes that we're part of the official
story which you hear over and over again
is that these are lean and mean times
and we all have to tighten our belts
that is total hogwash the country is
absolutely awash in capital the while
median wages have been going down in the
manner that I described corporate
salaries for example executive pay has
has risen 66 percent during the same
period capital gains 66 percent they now
form about half the income of the top 1%
of the population incidentally if these
new tax proposals that are being tossed
about go through that won't even be
taxable which means half of the income
for the top 1% will be tax free this is
the ratio of corporate pay executive pay
to manufacturing workers pay is far
higher in the United States than any
other developed country and the enormous
increase in the last year's is
essentially the business press of course
is totally phoric about this you don't
read about lean mean times in Business
Week and fortune and so on Financial
Times quite the contrary there are
euphoric they have headlines like
Fortune a couple of weeks ago on why
profits will keep booming an article
lead article which points out that in
1993 profits were dazzling despite
supporting it stagnant virtually
stagnant sales and continuing decline of
wages 1980 94 they say it was even worse
blended it was the fourth straight year
of double-digit profit growth and
expect to continue at least until 1996
meanwhile there's an there's an annual
study called the state of working
America the main scholarly study of
working people in the country and it
predicts Michelle and Bernstein that
wages will continue their decline while
profits continue this completely
unprecedented growth our earnings per
share have doubled since 1991 return on
capital has more than doubled since 1980
it's not that business was without
problems so you can read a headline in
Business Week saying the problem now
what to do with all that cash as surging
profits are overflowing the coffers of
corporate America and dividends are
booming thanks in large measure to
profits from overseas operations that's
what's called working for jobs for
Americans there's a well-oiled profit
machine another article says that
reporting the first quarter of 1995
which had a 30% leap in profits which is
pretty spectacular although they say
less than the phenomenal 74 percent
advance of the last quarter of 1994 the
fortune 500 which comes out every year
with a big study at the top 500
corporations this year May 15 was
absolutely ecstatic profits they said
were up a stunning quoting at stunning
54% on a sales growth of 8% an
employment growth of 2.6 percent and
declining wages the it's one of the most
profitable years ever for American
business and this series of increasing
profit is unprecedented the revenues of
the fortune 500 they say now constitute
63 percent of total gross domestic
product in the United States
that's more than Germany more than the
United Kingdom in addition to that this
huge control over the International
economy and so there's a degree of power
over the international and domestic
society in the hands of real
totalitarian institutions because
remember these are
unaccountable tyrannies that's I think
without president hard to find the
president for that and it's going up
it's interesting to look at the
particular cases if you look at the
fortune 500 list you'll find that some
of the biggest increases are one of the
biggest increases and what they call
sales is manpower incorporated by sales
they mean selling people to as temporary
workers they provide temporary
replacement workers they their sales
increased thirty five percent Kelly the
next biggest one employers now the point
of that is to make labor markets what
are called flexible study economics you
learned that it's good for labor markets
to be flexible and to avoid market
rigidities those are fancy words which
mean that it's bad for the economy if
people can go to sleep at night and with
any confidence that they're gonna have a
job the next day that is bad for
something that's called economic health
that's another technical term which has
nothing to do with the health of the
economy but has a lot to do with the
health so labor markets are getting a
lot more flexible and they're
eliminating rigidities like contracts
and expectation of a job add another one
that another corporation an interesting
one that shot way up
last year was caterpillar profits up 46
percent about the same amount that's
extremely important because right now in
Decatur Illinois one of the most
important labor actions of modern maybe
all of American history certainly modern
American history is going on a major
effort by three major corporations
caterpillar one British owned
multinational on a Japanese owned
multinational to destroy really destroy
the last what there is left of American
industrial unions and the caterpillar
corporation has explained kind enough to
explain its strategy to the
which the business press reports namely
they want to you they have been using
their enormous profits to develop excess
capacity overseas not for reasons of
economic efficiency but for reasons of
class warfare because if you develop
excessive excess capacity in Brazil or
Japan or Europe and then there's a
strike in Decatur Illinois you can fill
your market orders from those from the
excess capacity and therefore undermine
and destroy the workers and Decatur
Illinois well that's a good way to drive
the third to turn the country into a
third world country in the in 1985 labor
costs which means essentially wages and
benefits in the United States were the
highest in the developed world exactly
as you would expect in their richest and
most privileged country in the world by
1990 thanks to the Reaganite measures
including the really criminal
destruction of unions in which they
simply the government simply told
employers they're not going to enforce
the law so do anything you feel like the
by 1990 the United States had reached
the lowest level in the developed world
it was then passed by England in the
competition to see who can crush working
people most and by 1992 it was second
lowest in the developed world one of the
reasons that mired here The Wall Street
Journal had an article on that
describing it as a welcome development
of transcendent importance which indeed
it is for the minority the International
Business press has pointed out that
international conditions make it offer
new ways to do to achieve this not only
can say General Motors either sinned or
threatened to send production down to
Mexico and Brazil and so on but now
they've got a new third world or rather
an old third world that has been
returned to Western control namely
Eastern Europe good bit of what the Cold
War was about and now of course things
in Eastern Europe were terrible the
press points out but it was a article in
financial times which is the major
international business press called
green shoots and communism ruined
it's saying well you know it's pretty
rotten but there's some green shoots
there's some good things the green
shoots turn out to be as they put it
that the that with the economic reforms
so called the pauperization and of
workers and the unemployment has reached
such high levels that Western
corporations can now get workers in
Eastern Europe at 10% the wages of the
pampered Western workers who will have
to give up their luxurious lifestyles as
Businessweek what the Cold War was about
well this is a picture of what's going
on there are no lean and mean times
there's plenty of capital it's just
being very highly concentrated in the
right hand well what should we do in the
face of these catastrophic consequences
of contemporary state capitalism the
press has told us so the New York Times
a while back first paid front-page story
with a headline that read New York is
simply not wealthy enough to afford
services to the general public
read on the source for this insight was
an expert opinion namely a report to
investors by the JPMorgan Corporation
which is fifth among the banks in the
fortune 500 suffering from a mere 1.2
billion dollars in profits last year
which incidentally is actually rather
low as compared with its competitors who
did far better so some tears for them so
the report to investors to of JP Morgan
which made it to the headline of the
front page at the time says New York is
simply not wealthy enough to afford
services to the general public so what's
the solution
well the solution is to cut taxes on the
rich again the small print and the back
pages pointed out that all the tax cuts
benefit business so you cut taxes on the
rich but you increase taxes on the poor
except you don't call them on everyone
that's not the poor that's the great
majority increased taxes on everybody
else but you don't call them taxes
that's very important for those of you
looking for you know employment in
serious places you raise taxes but you
don't call them taxes what you call them
is I'm quoting multi-million dollar
reductions in subsidies for cities mac
mass transit and aid to education and
higher education to education and higher
education instantly the word subsidies
is kind of interesting if the population
of New York City decides to use their
money to improve their public
transportation system that's a subsidy
but let's put that aside by the
multi-million dollar reductions in the
subsidies to mass transit and education
you simply increase the costs for the
people who use mass transit and
education obviously the already
astronomical subway costs go up as they
are the costs of getting an education go
up and somebody pays those costs and
they pay them to the city so their taxes
or rather their equivalent of taxes but
they're highly regressive taxes the
subway costs are not paid by the guys in
the limousines up on the street they're
paid by the people that are trying to
get to work or the schoolchildren are
trying to get to school so it's a highly
regressive tax which is designed
essentially to redistribute income like
social policy generally cut taxes for
the rich increase taxes on a poorer but
don't call them taxes and poor means
most everybody remember another aspect
of it as this that you've read is that
it's necessary to compel welfare
recipients to work now there's some
interesting assumptions there one
assumption is that a woman who's raising
children isn't working that comes free
as anybody knows who's ever done it
remember and in fact notice that that's
true of women's wear it generally comes
free so it's not work and we even have a
proof of that because says you're all
taught in school we live in a
meritocracy and you can determine the
value of work by the amount of income
that accrues to it
well mothers who are raising children
don't get any income so that's not work
at all on the other hand a really
meritorious work is say a speculation in
financial markets to try to against
currencies to try to drive down
international growth rates so the people
all around the world get queer that gets
a lot of money in fact that's one of the
highest-paid occupations as is being an
accountant for a corporation and so on
so in other words those are the really
meritorious are employing the most
meritorious work real work as compared
with just raising children which isn't
work at all so therefore mothers who are
raising children have to be driven into
the workforce to do some real work
there's a side benefit of that the side
benefit is that since there are any jobs
they're gonna have to get low paid
publicly subsidized jobs and since
they're very low paid it'll have the
side benefit of competing with union
wages and driving down wages for
everybody so by driving down these
non-working mothers into the workforce
by driving them into the workforce at
low wages you can drive down everybody's
wages well business is worrying about
the problem of corporate coppers
overflowing the studying economics maybe
you know is it a kind of odd
contradiction internal to all of this
which somehow doesn't seem to bother
anyone we have to drive these women who
are just raising children are not
working we have to drive them into the
workforce because obviously it's unfair
for them to you know get paid for doing
nothing on the other hand we have to
keep the unemployment level high that's
a principle which is advocated by the
very same people this is what's called a
natural rate of unemployment it has to
be kept around 6% according to the
current theology
because if you don't keep it at 6% you
know maybe workers will be able ask for
higher wages and all sorts of tragedies
like that so in the one hand you have to
keep unemployment high on the other hand
you have to drive women who are just
raising children not working into the
workforce exactly how you resolve that
contradiction hasn't been explained yet
but the mayor of New York did have an
answer he finally came clean couple of
weeks ago he came out and said look
policies that are being carried out as
was obvious from looking at them are
designed to drive for people out of the
city there's no place for them in New
York in New York the only place is for
the meritocracy the people like the
JPMorgan executives and the ones are
speculating against currencies and so on
only the meritocracy as a place in New
York and that of course will follow from
depriving the rest of them the
nonmeritorious ability to pay their rent
or to or to have food or to heat their
homes or eliminating health health care
for the elderly that leaves just the
right people the minority the opulent
the rest will presumably live around the
border somewhere and what they call Rio
de Janiero they can't be too far away
because they have to somehow be able to
drift into the city to do all the dirty
work but they should be out on the
outside and the typical third-world
model and the time New York Times
reported that another front-page story
which explained that I have to quote
this explained that these measures will
enable the poor to move freely around
the country the measures that we're
talking about are deprivation of rent
heat food transit and so on that's going
to enable the poor to travel to move
freely around the country the headline
read welfare cuts
provide a chance to move in other words
the point as all these people were
trapped by this dependency you know and
now they're finally liberated and
they're free to move around the country
but not too far away because somebody's
gotta clean our laundry so they're now
free liberated I mean you know the
compassion brings tears to the eyes it's
impossible to be a satirist anymore as a
number of people have pointed out who
used to try the world is just satirizing
itself well there's a name for all of
this it's called tough love and it's not
a bad phrase what it means is love for
the minority the opulence everybody else
and there has to be tough love for the
majority the people in New York because
JPMorgan has explained the city there's
no other hand force a Cobb County
Georgia to pick an example at random not
quite because it's the district of Cobb
County Georgia is a very rich suburb of
Atlanta carefully insulated from any
urban infection very rich
it says Gingrich describes it a Norman
Rockwell world of jet planes and fiber
optics accurate if you know anything
about jet planes and fiber optics you
will instantly discover why Cobb County
is rich jet planes and fiber optics are
two of the many examples of the public
subsidy of big corporations that's
called free enterprise free enterprise
means public subsidy and private profit
and jet planes and fiber optics like
computers and electronics and just about
everything else in the high-tech economy
is exactly an example of that public
pays the costs private enterprise gets
the profit so in fact Cobb County
happens to get more federal subsidies
than any suburban county in the country
with two interesting exceptions one is
Arlington Virginia which is part of the
part of Washington DC so that's like
where the Pentagon is and so on and the
other is these Brevard County Florida
which is the home of the Kennedy Space
Center
that's another scam by which the public
pays the costs of high-tech industry you
know pretending they're putting men on
the moon and that sort of business the
so aside from the federal system itself
Cobb County happens to get more federal
subsidies than anyone else
in other words Newt Gingrich is the
biggest in the country well he's and
that's and here there is no furthermore
if you look at the details of how it
goes it's very enlightening the biggest
employer in Cobb County which remember
is the home of entrepreneurial values
where people despise the nanny state and
want to get it out of their hair so that
you know their individual
entrepreneurial commitments can flourish
the biggest employer there is Lockheed
now Lockheed Martin corporation Lockheed
Martin which just merged two big
military industries which just merged
and have their corporate headquarters
there they are a typical prototypical
example of publicly subsidized private
profit corporations to call Lockheed
Martin a case of individual
entrepreneurial values that's what it's
called when they merged as payment for
their merger they requested the Clinton
administration which will probably do it
to pay them over a billion dollars
meanwhile the executives paid themselves
about ninety million dollars about large
part of it maybe thirty million or so
from public funds more entrepreneurial
values right now they're in line for a
seventy two billion dollar subsidy for
f-22 jet planes and we need f-22s and
Lockheed Marietta explains why if you
read their statements they say we need
f-22s because I'm quoting it's a
dangerous world in which sophisticated
fighter planes are being sold well by
whom are sophisticated fighter planes
being sold well it turns out by lucky so
I'm continuing we've sold f-16s the
current top-of-the-line plane we've sold
f-16s all over the world what if a
friend or ally turns against us so
therefore we need F twenty-twos to
defend ourselves against the danger that
the f-16s that we're saying we're
sending to various dictatorships might
turn against us actually the US has
about three-quarters of that market
going to public opinion here public
opinion is only ninety six percent
opposed to the policy so I guess you
could say it's pretty popular but we got
to keep doing this because in fact
they're upgraded f-16 so the taxpayer is
paying multiple e they're paying
Lockheed to upgrade the f-16 so they can
sell them the third world dictatorships
with the support of four percent of the
population so that then maybe they can
turn against us so we'll need F
twenty-twos which you guys will pay for
to defend ourselves against this threat
well that's the way it works if you go
looking on at the military journals like
Jane's Defence weekly the major British
military journal you get a little more
insight into it you can discover that
the Air Force director of Science and
Technology General Richard Paul
explained that this is going this he put
it enhance our economic security how by
spinning off dual use technology that's
a fancy term that means welfare for
high-tech industry dual use technology
means you pretend it's for jet planes to
defend yourself against somebody but in
fact you use it for commercial
production so then you can you know
appraise your entrepreneurial values and
denounce the nanny state which is paying
for all its welfare for corporate
America in other
which is general put it will transition
our work in other words which will pick
up the money that we're giving them
thanks to the public pay off well that's
this is not a subsidy incidentally this
is not like money that goes to mass
transit or education so there's not a
subsidy and in fact that it is not a
subsidy was pointed out right at the end
of the Second World War when the whole
system was instituted by the Secretary
of the Air Force Stuart Symington good
liberal Democrat incidentally who
pointed out that he was often called the
senator from the Secretary of the Air
Force recognized as did the business
community generally that well as Fortune
magazine put it high-tech industry could
not survive and an unsubsidized
competitive free enterprise economy and
therefore the government has to step in
to be the savior but we must not find
anything went on to say we should not
call it subsidy we should call it
security there are supposed to be
thinking you're paying for your security
against somebody you know Martians or
maybe people in the third world who were
selling f-16s to or something but we
know it's subsidy and in fact it is the
entire virtually the entire functioning
part of the advanced sector of the
economy lives off that public subsidy
that's well known in the business
community it's not fair now and then but
they rarely ever talk about the most
serious part of it which is this part by
far so that's not subsidy that's
security and in fact that's exactly what
that's the main reason in my opinion why
the Pentagon spending is staying very
high it's now not very far from average
Cold War levels 15% below it's actually
higher in real terms than it was under
Nixon the Heritage Foundation which is
right wing think-tank
proposes the plans that the Gingrich
army implements they recently came out
with their new budget proposal which is
to cut everything that might help
ordinary people but to increase Pentagon
spending because they know perfectly
well that the state sector of the
economy is critically important as to
put money into the pockets of the folks
in Cobb County and others like them so
they can rail against the nanny state
well how about the public opinion on
that the same of all public spending
Pentagon spending has the lowest support
that is the greatest opposition so
therefore that's the one that we got to
increase consistent with the rest of the
relation between well tough love in this
sense is kind of like free markets free
markets have always meant pretty much
what they mean now it's always been it
you look through history it's been a
double-edged Doctrine what it means is
market discipline for some people poor
people for example but plenty of
protection for us for the rich people we
get state protection we get subsidy that
has always been the case it's the case
now that's one of the reasons why the
third world and the first world are so
different incidentally they were pretty
similar back in the 18th century and now
it's being brought home so yeah market
discipline for you know mothers with
children whose seven-year-old kids have
to learn responsibility but no market
discipline for the corporate executives
who have to have public funds poured
into their pocket by the Arias measures
the Pentagon system being the biggest
well there are plenty and they're
interesting but just to give an
indication of how far it's gone and why
the art of satire is unfortunately
collapsing let me just end by quoting a
recent article in The Wall Street
Journal
like the business press generally they
had an article with the headline
congressional Republicans call for
defunding the left public funds going
into the pockets of radicals
well the story went on to say
Republicans take aim at left-leaning
groups that get federal grants for
assistance programs bad stuff well who
are the left-leaning groups the top one
by far in the list was Catholic
Charities and if you look down at the
explanation the reason is that nuns and
priests many of whom work without pay
run programs to try to bring low in to
help low-income heating and to run Head
Start courses for Head Start programs
for poor people so that's Alessa
Catholic Charities for that reason is a
left-leaning group and we got a defund
this radical agenda the next on the list
is the AARP retired people and the
reason why that radical group has to be
defunded they explain is that it has
programs sinks even this low it has
programs to help elderly Americans get
jobs remember that there's another Wall
Street Journal story which said one out
of six of those elderly Americans is
suffering from malnutrition and many of
them are in their words literally
starving but if somebody wants to try to
help them get jobs we've got to fund
these dangerous radicals and it goes on
like that in fact you get a pretty clear
sense of who the left is the left
anybody who has any interest in helping
human beings belongs to the left and has
to be stopped being on the left that's
not only pretty flattering but also kind
of encouraging because it means that the
left is a vast array of people in fact
which is not totally untrue if you look
at public attitudes it's virtually
everybody anyone who cares about human
beings has to be stopped because the
goal is to turn the country into
something that looks like the third
with the minority the opulent well
protected plenty of state subsidies
Heritage Foundation's want to make sure
that so they can be you know big
entrepreneurs like the CEOs of Lockheed
Martin and the rest of Cobb County but
the rest of the population gets well
these things are not laws of nature
plainly they are human decisions they're
being made within human institutions
been done before it's been combated
before it's been successfully combated
before before and there are many others
it's never been easy to try to defend
and struggle for human rights and
freedom and democracy and justice it's
never been impossible it's not easy now
and it's not impossible now and I think
there has rarely been a moment in
history when that choice has carried
such enormous human consequences

[Applause]
my thanks to Lauren Dennis for that
introduction
but you was so intimidated by him
intimidated then the best possible kind
of way because he was a big man and he
was tall he was imposing his voice
his carriage
everything about him and I remember her
and he would come to Mississippi at
Medgar Evers request and sometimes they
would sit around
business had been taken care of and I
was young
I'm and still had letter of the shelter
of life and that
times when he would let out the robust
laugh often would use a few words that
would make me shrink at that time but
that's who he was it was what he he was
a man who devoted his life to justice
and equality for all people some
unhhhh who would come to Mississippi and
got off the plane and policemen
always
they're taking down car tag numbers
being intimidating and a very negative
sense
Thurgood Marshall walked as though they
did not even exist as though he had no
fear and in his own own mana intimidate
he did the intimidate ours because it
was no way that they could get to him he
was sure of him
