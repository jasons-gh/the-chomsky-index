Noam Chomsky is a world-renowned
political activist writer and professor
of linguistics at MIT the New York Times
Book Review set of him judged in terms
of the power range novelty and influence
of his thought Noam Chomsky is arguably
the most important intellectual alive to
which he adds yeah nobody ever quotes
the next sentence how can he write such
terrible things about the u.s. foreign
policy or something like that that that
edition kind of made your day didn't oh
yeah it made me feel it wasn't doing
something wrong tell me a little bit
about your background you grew up in
Philadelphia your parents were Hebrew
teachers I believe it was a basically
first-generation immigrant family they
were very much immersed in the local
Jewish community he bridge occasion this
is 1930s so it's early Zionism pre-state
Zionism that was the media my own life
was soon became my own life but that was
the background that he came out of and
you went to camp as I recall you later
on when I was a young teenager 11 12 we
went to Hebrew speaking camps and then I
first as a camper and laters counselor
helped you were proficient in Hebrew
very early reasonably proficient but
it's a matter of measuring but yes I
could get by and I read read very easily
had read a lot of the I grew up immersed
in Hebrew literature Bible and so on in
Hebrew you got part of I guess your
political education on a street corner
in New York in a sense you had an uncle
who this is again the 1930s and early
40s so la whole family
mostly unemployed unemployed
seamstresses working people and so on
but there are a few who had jobs and one
uncle had a severe disability and he was
able to get a new stand under one of the
New Deal type programs that were around
in those days so the newsstand was the
place which supported half the family
but he was also very he himself had
never gone through school but he was
very well educated more so than almost
anybody I met and the newsstand became a
center for a lot of emigres
intellectuals from Europe who would hang
around there on evenings and have
fascinating discussions and a lot of fun
to just be serving newspapers and
listening so you would what jump on the
train from Phil as soon as I was old
enough to take the train by myself at 12
or so I head off to New York soon as I
had a chance stay with my relatives who
were a very lively bunch of Jewish
working-class left all involved in
intellectual culture so a mixture of
strange Marxist groups and the Budapest
string quartet and so on and so forth
and all the very few of them had had
anything in the way of formal education
except very elementary but didn't matter
and then I spend my time wandering up
and down something that's long since
disappeared but the fourth Avenue below
union square used to be full of little
secondhand bookstores again a lot of
European exiles would have their own
particular slant you know spanish
anarchism or some other things that was
fascinating to their very eager to talk
to some young person coming in was that
usual so got special treatment and
picked up a lot a lot of literature to
fact when I started writing about these
things years later used a lot of primary
documentation that i picked up around
that time which wasn't available
elsewhere what kind of stuff they talk
about the newsstand there was a lot of
many of the anti grades were happened to
be a psychiatrist slip german-jewish
psychiatrist so there's a lot of fried
dish tackle that sort of thing and then
every variety of left-wing politics you
can think of these were very lively days
and political discussion was common and
just part of everybody's life and how
did you discover linguistics as you were
filled through politics actually a this
is back in Philadelphia met tzelek
Harris I was about I guess 16 or 17 and
pretty bored with college I was thinking
of dropping out but I happened to meet
him through political contacts he
himself was was a very influential
figure among young intellectuals mostly
Jewish but not completely much more so
than is known in right much but many
people passed through his influence of
many of them well known and I was one of
the younger ones and he was his
interests were sort of a rib independent
left sort of anti-bolshevik left and
what was then called Zionism now it
would be called anti-zionism commitment
to a future by national jewish-arab
working class based community in what
was in palestine which was part of the
lioness movement at the time
now it would be considered different and
I was already interested in that so
meeting him was a exciting game an
influence I later discovered he was
professor of linguistics at at Penn and
in fact one of the leading figures in
the world got drawn into his courses and
back into college thank you have come to
change your views about israel israeli
politics over the years not that much
still believe pretty much what I of
course it's different now than when I
was 12 years old but I basically the
same point of view I'm in these
circumstances have changed but the my
own position hasn't changed very much
what is your position and how the
circumstance has changed well remember
that was pre state right and so of
course everything changed when the state
was established although I maintain my
involvement and interest and if I came
pretty close to living there my wife and
I spent some time on a kibbutz we might
have gone back it was question but I was
opposed to the establishment of a Jewish
state which again was part of the dynast
movement at the time not a huge part but
there was a element of it the thought of
Jewish state is a bad at stake I thought
so then still think so a Jewish state as
opposed to a democratic state it the two
are inconsistent I mean people can try
whatever manipulation they like but if
the United States were a Christian state
in anything but symbolism it wouldn't be
a democratic state I mean taking Sunday
office okay but if there's real
discriminatory legislation and practice
that distinguished Christians from
non-christians or whites from non-white
to that extent it would be a flawed
democracy almost by definition and
that's intrinsic in in the forum of the
Jewish state that was established I mean
hi cord and Israel actually declared it
to be the state of the Jewish people in
Israel in the Diaspora so my state but
not the state of a Palestinian Arab
citizen of Israel and this shows itself
in all kinds of ways but it became much
more all of these problems became far
more exacerbated after 1967 when the
military occupation began it's now in
its 36th year and then all sorts of
things happen I mean in 1971 Israel
really had to make a what turned out to
be a fateful decision they received an
offer from Egypt through the UN mediator
guna re to have offered full peace
treaty if Israel would withdraw just
from Egyptian territory not nothing
about the Palestinians no West Bank it
was discussed internally in Israel in
the now we know it from released cabinet
records but then in the Hebrew press
they knew that it was a possibility of
peace and integration into the region
the choice was that or expansion which
means permanent confrontation dependents
crucial dependence on the United States
and they chose the latter course and a
lot of things have followed from that
which are in my view very harmful to the
society and extremely dangerous and
leading to a constant threat of very
serious war plus 35 years of persecution
of an of an oppressed population that
has changed things enormously do you see
any end to that yeah very simple and in
fact everyone in the world knows what it
is and has known for years the end is a
diplomatic set honey it gets more remote
the longer you delay it but the end has
been for since the 1970s a political
settlement on the internationally
recognized border
pre pre war border preacher in 67 with
mutual and minor territorial adjustments
and other arrangements about other
matters the crucial matters territorial
that's been the international consensus
since the mid-1970s the US has
unilaterally blocked it and still does
and as long as that continues there
won't be a political zone what about
Jerusalem Jerusalem you can finesse one
way or another I mean theoretically it's
suppose under the original UN
resolutions is supposed to be
internationalized city okay that's not
going to happen but Jewish and Arab
neighborhoods could be except mostly
Jewish Muslim Arab neighborhoods could
be separated two capitals could be set
up side by side but the Palestinian one
would have to have access to the
Palestinian state that's the crucial
issue and many people have pointed out I
think correctly that the Jerusalem is a
problem you could probably settle in 15
minutes the main problems are the
territorial boundaries as we speak the
White House has announced that it will
declare an end to the war in iraq
tomorrow in your opinion what was that
war all about well we can be certain
about one thing the White House made it
very clear that nothing it said could be
taken seriously so we know that the
reasons they gave can't be the reasons
the way we know that is because they
were contradicted every day I mean one
day the single question as they put it
is Iraq's weapons of mass destruction if
they get rid of the weapons of mass
destruction it's all over the next day
it turned out they didn't make any
difference what they did about their
weapons we were going to
we had to impose it run regime what's
called regime regime change and the
third day it was some other stories so
we can put aside the official
explanations they made it clear to us
that they're not to be taken seriously
so then we have to speculate what was it
about and I think it's some pretty clear
plausible explanations I mean first of
all there's a background issue which
doesn't account for the timing of the
war but it's always in the background
and that is that Iraq has the second
largest oil reserves in the world has
always been clear that one way or
another the US would regain control over
them or seek to do so it does dominate
the u.s. does dominate the Gulf energy
producing region which is by far the
largest and richest in the world will be
for another couple of generations that's
been policy since the Second World War
the Iraq was kind of an anomaly and that
it broke out of it and it would be an
effort to get it back in that was
certain what about the timing well the
timing is kind of striking if you look
at the propaganda about invasion of Iraq
it really begins last September I mean
it was sort of simmering in the
background but in September that's when
Condoleezza Rice told us about the you
know the mushroom cloud and massive
government propaganda disseminated
uncritically by the media was produced
about Iraq being a threat to our
survival and intimations that Iraq was
behind September 11th attacks and was
planning new ones and that showed up
very quickly in the polls by the end of
September of majority of the population
actually believed that Iraq was a
serious threat to us security and over
the months the number of people who
believed that Iraq was involved in the
September 11th attacks has reached
something like
% probably the others nobody in the
world believes anything like this
including CIA but it did come to be
public opinion and those opinions are
very strongly correlated with support
for the war not surprisingly but why
September well other things happened in
September one thing that happened was it
was the opening of the midterm election
campaign and as Karl Rove campaign
manager had already informed Republican
activists they cannot go into the
campaign with social and economic issues
being prominent or they'll get smashed
they have to be security issues which
will lead people to they hope correctly
to suppress their concerns about the
jobs pensions at an Enron and so on in
favor of safety which will flock to
power and it worked barely the Rove has
already said they're going to do the
next the same for the presidential
campaign and in fact that ran right
through the 80s when the same people
were running Washington pushing the
panic button every year or something or
other the other thing that happened
which i think is even more significant
is that they announced the national
security strategy in September which
calls for it sent clinic shutters around
the world including the US foreign
policy elite this was a substantial
change in official policy there are
precedents but it's never been official
policy before it was a policy of openly
announced intention to rule the world by
force and to prevent any potential
challenge to that domination it's called
preemptive war but it's not pre-emptive
it's preventive and even that's an
exaggeration we'll just tack anyone is
in the way well when you announce a
doctrine you have to illustrate
otherwise nobody takes it seriously to
illustrate the doctrine of preventive
war you have to pick the appropriate
target first of all it has to be weak
and defenseless there's no point
attacking anybody who can fight back
that's ridiculous so has to be weak and
defenseless on the other hand that can't
be say you know burundi because that's
worthless who wants it has to be weak
defenseless and important okay that
spells a track and that was a perfect
petre dish is the New York Times called
a test case for to illustrate the new
norm of preventive war to get the world
understand we mean and I think those
factors probably account for the time in
the background is the long term interest
but as I say you can't these have to be
speculations because there's no official
information that means anything it's all
self contradictory what do you expect
will follow in Iraq do you expect
democracy to blossom their special kind
of democracy we have a hundred years of
experience in our backyard to go by the
US has dominated Central America and the
Caribbean for a century it's had plenty
of influence and other places and it has
tolerated even foster democracy but on a
condition the Democratic decision has to
conform to US policy if country's
democratic choices ago in opposition to
US policy the government's overthrown
either by coup or invasion or economic
strangulation or something about it and
in fact this is extremely explicit in
policy formation it takes discipline not
to see it so for example in the case of
Cuba the US international terrorist
attack on Cuba and that's what it is
that began within months after Castro's
take over
was very sharply escalated by the
Kennedy administration we now have the
internal documents that discuss describe
what they had in mind then it's the same
as everywhere else Guatemala I ran
everywhere what state is that the very
existence of the Castro regime is
successful defiance of US policies going
back 150 years policies are that the
region has to be subordinated the US
power and this is successful defiance of
that doesn't matter what they do they've
got to conform the words in Central
America in the 1980s were to impose a
form of democracy which would be quote a
leading specialist top-down forms of
democracy in which traditional elites
mean who have been associated with the
United States retain power Jim quoting
Thomas Carruthers it's a leading
historian but also writes from the
inside he was part of Reagan's so-called
democracy enhancement programs in the
state department and that's a correct
characterization and that's what will
happen in Iraq I mean if the majority
the population happens to be sheeit
suppose they call for a you know Islamic
state to link to Iran United States
never tolerate that fact has already
said to you can have a democracy as long
as you do what we say youth have felt
that politics are driven by the economic
interests of what you call the
privileged elite you tell me about that
and who these people are if I so that's
not my opinion that's the opinion of a
hundred percent of people that work on
Foreign Affairs it's an opinion with
which you agree I'm it's almost a truism
it's true of every country not just the
United States I mean there's an internal
distribution of power in every country
you know it's not that everybody's
and the internal distribution of power
reflect itself in decision making in the
state system in different ways I mean if
a country has a powerful union movement
for example there will be a labor
contribution to policy you know it
doesn't have that we have basically
business parties and there's a there's a
concentrated sector of economic power
corporate sector linked to linked
closely to government and they tend to
set the basic framework for policy
choices it's not mechanical can deduce
that this or that policy is going to
come out but it's a very powerful
framework from which there's very little
deviation actually the media don't
tolerate any discussion of anything
beyond it except very much of the
margins even if the population happens I
mean there are many striking cases where
the population is pretty strongly
opposed to policy but if there's a split
between a lead opinion and popular
opinion the these issues just don't even
show up in elections I mean
international economic arrangements are
striking example populations almost but
by substantial majorities opposed the
most of the arrangements there's near a
leak consensus as a result they just
don't show up except very marginally in
political debate and political campaigns
and other things actually what I said
about the Middle East is another example
roughly I think about two-thirds of the
population has it supports the general
international consensus that I mentioned
but the USA lead opinion does not as a
result the issue just doesn't come up
the writer Tom Wolfe calls this the old
Cabal theory and implies that it's kind
of nut
I guess does that sort of criticism if
you think it's nutty for people with
wealth and power to use their influence
it's about as nutty is the fact that the
Sun rises every morning couple of years
statements i will quote now the japanese
bombing of Pearl Harbor save tens of
millions of lives how did that happen
it's not supportive it it's just saying
you cannot evaluate an action by looking
at the range of consequences actually
probably in India alone it saved tens of
millions of lives how so kicking the
British yeah one of the results of the
jet wasn't the intention of the bombing
of Pearl Harbor but if you look at the
events that unfolded one of the things
that happened is that the Europeans
mostly left Asia not easily but so the
French fraught a brutal war the Dutch
Florida war they finally left and the
effect of that in Asia was dramatic if
you look at the demographic patterns and
say India there haven't been any major
famine since the British left there were
terrible famines before in fact India
you know they barely developed during
the British period hundreds of year it
had been the commercial and one of the
commercial and industrial centers of the
world when the British took it over the
British turned it into an impoverished
agricultural society with a wealthy
elite and some infrastructure you know
based on their dominance but as a
miserable situation people like neighbor
who is an Anglophile described the
British is like the Nazis after
independence it's not a wonderful place
by any means but at least the massive
famine stuff and some development picked
up and it's much the same throughout
Asia I said so an indirect consequence
of the Japanese aggression and violence
happened to be the liberation of a good
deal of
that's incidentally why plenty of Asian
nationalist supported the Japanese for
examples carnival and Indonesia
supported the Japanese all the way
through is anti-fascist but supported
the Japanese because they were going to
kick the betcha and it's the same
throughout so you know actions have all
kinds of consequences but you cannot
justify japanese atrocities an
aggression on the basis of the fact that
inadvertent consequences happen to lead
the deliberation of a page that was the
context in which that come in was me and
it's a i don't think there's any doubt
of the historical accuracy of the
comment the u.s. bombing in afghanistan
was silent genocide know what i said is
that if they that the assumptions they
were making were that that could well be
a consequence remember the bombing of
afghanistan was taken on the assumption
that it might well lead put millions of
people at risk of starvation that
assumption was very widespread you can
read it and Harvard's a major
international journal international
security the New York Times were example
estimated after a month that the number
of people at risk of starvation had
risen by fifty percent from five million
to seven and a half million and in fact
right after September eleventh even
before the bombing of the US ordered
Pakistan to terminate food supplies that
we're keeping a good part of the
population at the edge of survival so
that policy under the assumptions in
which the policy was being conducted
could well have led to silent genocide
that's one of the reasons why rational
people should oppose policies like that
you said that if the Nuremberg
principles were applied every post World
War two president would be
indictable probably true can we run run
down them real fast what Eisenhower do
it you would indict him for Eisenhower
overthrew the conservative nationalist
government of Iran with the military
coup he overthrew the first and last
democratic government in guatemala by a
military coup an invasion leading two
years of in iran it led to 25 years of
brutal dictatorship finally overthrown
in 79 in guatemala led to massive
atrocities which are still continuing
that's after almost 50 years in
Indonesia this was known until recently
but he conducted the major clandestine
terror operation of the post-war period
up until Cuban Nicaragua in an effort to
break up Indonesia strip off the outer
islands where most of the resources are
and undermine the what was then
considered as a threat of Indonesian
democracy Indonesia was to free and open
it was allowing a political party of the
poor to participate they were gaining a
lot of ground so that the Eisenhower
supported and helped instigate a
military rebellion in the outer islands
this is just for starters these are all
indictable offences on by Kennedy
Kennedy was one of the worst Kennedy
first of all invaded South Vietnam
during the Eisenhower administration
they had blocked a political settlement
in 1954 and instituted a kind of a Latin
American style terror state which had
killed maybe 60 or 70,000 people by at
the end of the Eisenhower period and had
instigated a response reaction Kennedy
recognized that it couldn't be
controlled internally so he simply
invaded in 1962
about a third of the bombing missions
that were carried out by the US air
force it in South us planes with South
Vietnamese insignia the u.s. pilot are
they author he authorized napalm he
began the use of chemical weapons to
destroy food crops they began programs
which drove millions of people into what
amount of the concentration camps that's
aggression in the case of Cuba it was
just a massive campaign of international
terrorism which almost led to the
destruction of the world led to the
missile crisis and we can continue again
these are all indictable offences
Johnson well Johnson expanded the war
and in the China to the point where
ended up probably leaving three or four
million people dead he invaded the
Dominican Republic to block what looked
like a potential democratic revolution
they're supported the Israeli occupation
in its early stages again we can go
around the world make your take them
takes a quarter no I'll get their
deductions next the next thing we don't
even have to talk about we can skip that
one okay affords Ben Ford well for it
was only there for a shuttle time but
long enough to endorse the Indonesian
invasion of east teamwork which became
about as close to genocide is anything
in the modern period they pretended to
oppose it but secretly supported effect
not so secretly the US immediately after
the invasion the US did join the rest of
the world informally condemning it at
the Security Council but ambassador
Moynihan was kind enough to explain to
us in his words that his instructions
were to render the United Nations
utterly in effect
in any actions it might take to counter
the Indonesian and great invasion and he
says proudly that he did this with
considerable success his next sentence
says in the next few months it seems
that about 60,000 people were killed and
then he goes off to the next topic
that's the first few months went on to
probably hundreds of thousands sick de
formerly the u.s. announced the boycott
of weapons but secretly it increased the
supply of weapons including
counterinsurgency equipment so that the
Indonesians could consummate the
invasion that's just a short period in
office but that's indictable seriously
in fact that's a major war crime Carter
Carter increased as the Indonesian
atrocities were increasing they peaked
in 1978 Carter's flow of weapons to
Indonesia increased when Congress
imposed a human rights restrictions but
then was a human rights movement in
Congress to block the flow of advanced
weaponry to Indonesia Carter arranged
through Mondale vice president to get
Israel to send us skyhawks to Indonesia
to enable Indonesia to complete what
turned out to be near genocide killing
maybe quarter of the population or
something in the in the Middle East
Carter just won the Nobel Prize his
great achievement was the Camp David
agreements the Camp David agreements are
presented as a diplomatic triumph for
the United States in fact they were
diplomatic catastrophe at Camp David the
United States and Israel accepted
finally Egypt 1971 offer which they had
then R Us it rejected at the time except
that now it was worse from the
us-israeli point of view because it
included the palace
minions in order to accept get Israel to
accept Egypt 1971 offered after a major
war in atrocities and so on Carter
raised aid military and other aid Israel
to more than fifty percent of total aid
worldwide is really used it it once in
exactly the way they said they were
going to do as every sane person knew as
an opportunity to attack their northern
neighbor first in 1978 then in 1982 and
to increase integration of the occupied
territories and that's for starters we
can continue Reagan I don't think we
have to talk about that one either I
mean Reagan is the first president to
have been condemned by the international
court of justice for what they called
the unlawful use of force meaning
international terrorism in the war
against Nicaragua again that's just for
starters they also the security council
endorsed it in two resolutions both of
which were vetoed by the United States
Bush was well we can begin with the
invasion of Panama the invasion of
Panama which according to the
Panamanians killed about 3,000 people
since it's never investigated know if
that's true or not this was done in
order to kidnap a disobedient thug who
had been supported by the United States
right through his worst atrocities
Noriega Noriega who was brought to
Florida and tried for crimes that he
committed mostly on the CIA payroll okay
that's aggression we could go into the
details of the war in Iraq but there
were plainly opportunities for they
might not have worked we don't know but
there were opportunities for diplomatic
settlement which the Bush administration
refused to consider and incidentally the
press would not report with a single
exception and Long Island Newsday which
did report the hold
story throughout accurately and is the
only newspaper in the country who have
done so the Bush administration then did
it to act and the attack was carried out
and in a manner which is criminal under
the laws of war they attacked
infrastructure and if you attack New
York City and you destroy the electrical
system our system the sewage systems and
so on that amounts to biological warfare
and that's the nature of the attack then
came a sanctions regime which is mostly
Clinton that began with Bush which is by
conservative estimates killed hundreds
of thousands of people while
strengthening Saddam Hussein that takes
us off to Clinton which that's the
beginning that's by no means the end to
clem through it well we can run through
that one case of Isis all right but
they're plenty of others bush too let's
take gone with Clinton okay I'm one of
Clinton's minor ask mine iress Capades
very minor was sending a couple of
cruise missiles to the Sudan to destroy
what they knew to be a pharmaceutical
plant there was no intelligence failure
according to the only estimates we have
from the German ambassador and the
director of regional director of Near
East foundation does field work and
Sudan both of them estimates several
tens of thousands of deaths from one
cruise instead a pretty serious somebody
did that to us we'd regarded as bad news
and again we can continue during in the
Middle East for example the Clinton
began by declaring past UN resolutions
the words of his administration obsolete
and anachronistic ok so we're finished
with that no more international law then
comes Apollo a period called a peace
process except that during the peace
process
Israeli us at Israeli settlement which
means settlement paid for by the US
taxpayer and sported by US military aid
and diplomacy continually increased the
most extreme year was clinton's last
year the highest level of settlement the
highest since 1992 meanwhile the
territories were canonized broken up
into small regions with infrastructure
projects a new settlement I don't know
what you call that but it's under
military occupation and if anyone else
was doing it we call it a worker and
again we can continue I wish to I don't
think we have to discuss your call okay
how does well I want to get back to one
thing he said Newsday apparently got off
the reservation is somehow what happened
there having no idea but one
particularly one reporter new Troy's
kept reporting everything that was
happening I have a guess I mean what was
going on was that he was reporting leaks
from the government the government the
US State Department was leaking reports
from August August 90 right up to
through December planning for the war
leaking report saying that Iraq was
making offers that the State Department
regarded as serious and negotiable maybe
not acceptable but negotiable now you
know no one in a state department leaks
reports to a suburban newspaper what I
assume was happening was that they were
leaking him to the New York Times which
was refusing to print them and then they
leaked them the news day which appears
on every newsstand in New York City with
a big full front page headline saying
you know Iraq offers this and that I
mean can you think of any other
explanation if you were in the State
Department would you leaked documents to
Newsday but it's a it's a part of an
immense cooperation
x me relation right and somehow that
newspaper alone and this one reporter in
fact who I don't know that he was doing
very good job that kept reporting but
and what typically happened is that
Newsday would report it big front-page
story and a couple of days later in the
times and the sort of back pages you'd
see a phrase saying well reports claim
that the Iraq made an offer but the
White House denies it it's a very few
people in the country knew about this
we've got a few minutes left before
we're going to open this for questions
from me from the people here in the
studio you've said either the general
population will take control of our
destiny or there will be no destiny for
anyone to control why is that so I think
we we are in a situation with the human
species has developed the capacity to
destroy itself and everything else
that's been true since the Second World
War and we are edging very close to the
possibility of that happening it's come
very close in the past I mean during the
Cuban Missile Crisis which Arthur
Schlesinger described as the most
dangerous moment in human history we
just learned last October how dangerous
was last October it was revealed at the
retrospective conference of participants
and that American Russian and Cuban that
the world was literally one word away
from terminal nuclear war Russian
submarine commanders turns out had
nuclear-tipped missiles and they were
under attack by American destroyers at
the edge of Kennedy's quarantine zone
they assumed the nuclear war was going
on two of the commanders ordered the
missiles sent that would have led to a
devastating response they got Moscow
incomes New York and were over one
commander countermanded that was a
consequence of a international terrorist
war aimed at regime change those notions
are right in headlines and that's we're
coming very close to that now I'm in the
preventive war doctrine last September
it's just a instructing people in the
world that you better develop weapons of
mass destruction or a means of terrorism
in order to deter the United States or
secondly or take another domain nobody
really understands in any detail what's
going on with a climate that's
complicated issue but there's a near
consensus among scientists that were
playing with fire could be it's kind of
like Afghanistan you you're risking the
possibility of very severe destruction
if anything goes wrong these are sort of
nonlinear processes I mean a slight
change could have a big effect and you
don't know what's going to happen you
know maybe in ice age and Europe
personal other thing well you know we're
very near the edge in nuclear weapons
development and other weapons of mass
destruction and policies that are
creating international chaos in
destroying possibly destroying an
environment in which decent survival is
possible nobody you can't none of this
is predictable it's just all too close
for comfort and it things are tending in
that direction I mean and it's been it's
it's not particularly new it takes a the
history of Europe now for hundreds of
years the Europe was most savage place
in the world the main activity of
Europeans was slaughtering each other
meanwhile
on the side conquering most of the world
in 1945 they called it off why well very
straightforward reason it was understood
by French and Germans and British that
the next time they played the
centuries-old game of slaughtering each
other it's gonna be the end of the world
because they had developed means of
destruction so enormous that you just
can't do it anymore so now Europe is a
peaceful region but unless that extends
to the world same problems arise what's
the good news the good news is that
there's lots of good moves part of it is
that as a result of the activism of the
last 40 years which has been extensive
the United States is a much more
civilized country than it was in the
past and the same has happened all over
good parts of the world there's now
extensive under there are all kinds of
things that we didn't exist before
women's rights minority rights an
environmental movement anti-nuclear
movement international solidarity
movements global justice movements none
of us existed 40 to 45 years of you most
of it is post 1960s that started at all
that kind of took off it's changed
hasn't changed institutions but it has
changed consciousness of awareness and
it's true of a large part of the world
actually much of the initiative for
these developments is coming from the
south I'm as a good reason why the world
Social Forum meets in Brazil not in
Paris or New York that's because that's
where the leading edge of the activism
is for significant social change
throughout much of the self the north is
joined to an extent and these are
hopeful possibilities for popular
movements reversing a course that's a
very dangerous one on that note of
optimism we'll take questions now from
people here in the audience I know he's
into you mention that when US government
tries to pick up a target to attack they
usually pick up a weak defenseless and
important target so since the Iraqi
issue has now has been rina announced to
be officially a end and also it is also
said as there are several possible
targets at US government my pick up so
one example might be and the the North
Korea but it is recently it recently it
has been said that the US Army stationed
in North Korea have retreated to to to
Japan sorry excuse fish in South Korea I
also sorry in South Korea sorry has has
retreated to Japan but it seems that not
it seems that the war will break out I
mean according to some people's belief
but it seems that North Korea is a
country with almost no resources but
it's also a quite defensive and it has
it is said that has nuclear weapons so I
wonder whether you have any opinion on
this issue and what kind of benefits
will be brought to America if you know
the war breaks well first of all they
visit about attacking defenseless
enemies I actually happen to be
paraphrasing a leaked intelligence
document from the bush one
administration when they came into
office like every administration they
call for an intelligent survey of the
world usually we don't find out about it
for 30 40 years until it gets
Declassified but in this case someone
leaked a paragraph from it and it was
published by Maureen Dowd in the New
York Times her column is considered a
kind of gossip column so people don't
read it very carefully but she actually
did publish in nineteen ninety or so the
paragraph that was leaked from that
document and what it said is that in the
case of confrontation with much weaker
enemy
which it's passively assumed that the
only ones you're going to attack in the
case of confrontations with much weaker
enemies of the United States must defeat
them decisively and rapidly because
otherwise political support will erode
it's not the 1960s when Kennedy could
carry out a war for years and Johnson
could escalate it with no protest now
you gotta build up the enemy to look
like a massive force and then destroy
him decisively and rapidly and you got
to pick a much weaker one and that's a
sensible you may not like it but it's a
rational doctrine and if you look at the
Wars of the 90s that's what they are the
North Korea case is a complicated one
the what the United States has been
telling the world loud and clear for the
last couple of months is that if you
want to prevent us from attacking you
you'd better have a deterrent I'm an
Iraq had no deterrent so there we can
smash it and North Korea had a deterrent
not nuclear weapons incidentally massed
artillery they have massed artillery
aimed that soul and that the American
forces there and unless the Pentagon can
figure out a way to take them out with
precision guided munitions before
they're used it could just be
devastating actually the predictions in
the Clinton years from the Pentagon were
that if the US was to go to worthy as
one general put it they better have a
hundred thousand body bags ready so
north Korea has a deterrent which is
conventional nuclear weapons they may
have a couple of years from now but
that's not the issue now and that held
off an attack well why is not very
important you're completely right as no
resources it's one of the poorest most
most horrifying countries in the world
but it's right in the middle of a
crucial area this whole region is a
rapidly developing economic region it
has tremendous resources in Siberia
you know lots of gas and oil and other
resources has huge countries that are
industrialized and need the resources
particularly Japan and South Korea but
now China to which is now a resource
importer and there's a good reason to
expect that that whole region is going
to go off in its own independent
direction the United States does not
want that is it's it wants that region
to be subordinated the US power and
North Koreans are right in the middle of
if there's going to be pipelines from
you know Siberia to South Korea and off
to japan until they're going to go so it
itself has no material significance but
its position in one of the most rapidly
developing regions of the world
definitely does I appreciate your
emphasis is on hope as her eyes activism
is being a source of hope and as a
academic and training and a political
organizer in the last two years I've
I've experienced an inertia in the
academic class so to speak that I've
never experienced before and I've been
organizing for a number of years
including the first Gulf War and so the
first part of the question is why do you
think it is that at absolutely the most
critical time the most you know the mask
has been removed in a lot of sense of
this of this push an expansion of empire
so to speak that that's the time that
the such extreme inertia has set in and
that people feel so impotent and then
the second part of the question is how
do you recommend breaking through that
particularly in an academic class
because they have such resources and I'm
wondering if something like the
french-based attack organization may be
somewhat of a model and I just want to
get your opinion on that who if first of
all your age is significant the academic
world has never been a source of a
rarely been a source of activism it
usually comes from somewhere else
there's a brief period in which it was
true in the late 60s late 60s not in the
earlier period when parts of the
academic world
these students incidentally very few
faculty did become actively engaged in
elite universities and elsewhere then it
kind of died down in the 1980s happening
an extremely activist period but it was
not coming from the academic world it
was coming more from churches in the
Midwest and places like that the Central
America solidarity movement was
extremely significant didn't get a lot
of attention because it was not coming
from a lead centers but this is the
first time in the history of imperialism
hundreds of years that people from the
Imperial country actually went to live
with the victims to try to help them and
protect them I mean nobody in France
went to live in Algeria during the
Algerian word living in Algerian village
or ever the Vietnam War was never even
thought about and the whole history of
European and US imperialism never
happened that happened on a very
substantial scale in the 1980s that's
the reason why you now have volunteers
in many parts of the world including
these really occupied their authorities
so all an outgrowth of this but the
academic world is almost completely not
involved same is true in the 1990s
hasn't been the academic world I like
the global justice movements which are
the biggest ones though they didn't kind
of I mean there's students involved you
know couple of faculty here and there
but it's mostly coming from elsewhere I
didn't mean to imply that actually I
didn't apply to the academic and we
haven't be in the academic world so
rightly we should be concerned about
what goes on there you know you and I
aren't going to organize steelworkers
but we can do things where we live so
that's just the right question and what
can change it is what's always done in
the past you know people working hard to
educate to organize to raise issues and
we have tremendous privileges and on
most parts of the world people try to do
things like this a face torture
assassination
something or other we don't face
anything you know we're completely free
we have a legacy of freedom that's
unparalleled we have enormous resources
and privileges get every opportunity we
can think of what's lacking is will I
said one of the things that's common in
a kind of a youth culture student
culture like the academic world is a
very short attention span you know you
figure things have to be done soon and
if they don't work in a week you know we
quit like I went to a demonstration
nothing happened okay now I'm going to
quit if you want anything to change its
gotta it means work over a long time
lots of defeats occasional victories
ultimately you get somewhere you think
of any popular movement has ever done
anything yeah abolitionism women's
rights anything you think of that's why
it works that was what was different in
the working class culture that I grew up
in as a kid these came from movements
that thought you're gonna have to work
hard for a long time to try to achieve
something and that's yes that's what
happens it's not going to be any quick
victories but there are plenty of
opportunities and just have to keep
attack oh yeah well attack is an
interesting group and it's done
important things it's fairly elite
outfit but it's one of the groups that
was instrumental in setting up the world
Social Forum and they're pretty narrowly
focused on a few crucial issues like one
of their big issues is Tobin tax you
know tax on financial interactions which
is probably a good idea there's other
possibilities like it and it's it's been
a very influential and important group
and it's starting in the United States
incidentally so their subgroups here its
international based in print and it's
the kind of thing that could be part of
a serious us organizing effort but only
court I think
yes sir given human rights violations by
corporations I was wondering how you
make your purchasing decisions and if
there are any products that you don't
purchase well plenty of things they
don't purchase but not really for that
reason I mean these are questions of
tactics I mean do you affect human
rights but let's take coca-cola which is
a big thing around here Anderson
coca-cola is has just been it's narrowly
scraped by a district court case in
Florida that was brought by the steel
workers in support of Colombian workers
in a subsidiary of a coca-cola plant
which is one of those vicious anti-union
plants almost anywhere and the
particular case was a union activist who
was murdered by paramilitaries in the
plant and the steel workers who are
pressing these human rights cases for
Colombians they can't do it themselves
are using provisions of American law
which do exist and have sometimes been
applied and they've brought a case in
Florida which got to the district court
and they sort of have a half victory the
district court severed coca-cola from
the case but kept the subsidiary well
you know severine coca-cola was a
technicality so does that mean you
should stop buying coca-cola well if you
stop buying coca-cola is that going to
help union activists in Colombia that's
the question you have to ask these are
and you know I don't think there's a
simple answer like if you stop by Coco
let's not have any effect if there was a
massive boycott of it they'd notice it
in the corporate headquarters and and
might do something like for example nike
and reap sealant reebok or something the
guys who make sneakers and things like
that have modified somewhat there
horrendous human rights practices in
plants and age as a result of pressure
must be coming from
and that yeah that had an effect but
these are questions you just have to
answer in terms of their likely
consequences for people who are
suffering there's no point making
gestures professor Noam Chomsky thank
you very much okay
