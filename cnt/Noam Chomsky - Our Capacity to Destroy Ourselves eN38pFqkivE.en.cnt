you've said either the general
population will take control of our
destiny or there will be no destiny for
anyone to control why is that so I think
we think we are in a situation with I
mean the human species has developed the
capacity to destroy itself and
everything else that's been true since
the Second World War and we are edging
very close to the possibility of that
happening it's come very close in the
past I mean during the Cuban Missile
Crisis which Arthur Schlesinger
described as the most dangerous moment
in human history we just learned last
October how dangerous it was last
October it was revealed at the at
retrospective conference of participants
and Havana American Russian and Cuban
that the world was literally one word
away from terminal nuclear war Russian
submarine commanders turns out had
nuclear-tipped missiles and they were
under attack by American destroyers at
the edge of Kennedy's quarantine zone
they assumed the nuclear war was going
on two of the commanders ordered the
missiles sent that would have led to a
devastating response they got Moscow in
comes New York and then we're over one
commander countermanded that was a
consequence of a international terrorist
war aimed at regime change those notions
are right in the headlines and that's
we're trying very close to that now I'm
at the preventive war doctrine last
September
it's just instructing people in the
world that you better develop weapons of
mass destruction or a means of terrorism
heathyr the united states where's that
gonna lead or take another domain nobody
really understands in any detail what's
going on with a climate that's a
complicated issue but there's a near
consensus among scientists that we're
playing with fire could be it's kind of
like Afghanistan you you're risking the
possibility of very severe destruction
if anything goes wrong these are sort of
nonlinear processes I mean a slight
change could have a big effect and you
don't know what's going to happen you
know maybe an ice age and Europe for
some other thing well you know we're
very near the edge in nuclear weapons
development and other weapons of mass
destruction and policies that are
creating international chaos in
destroying possibly destroying an
environment than which decent survival
is possible nobody you can't none of
this is predictable it's just all too
close for comfort
and things are tending in that direction
I mean and it's been it's it's not
particularly new I'm gonna take say the
history of Europe now for hundreds of
years the Europe was the most savage
place in the world the main activity of
Europeans was slaughtering each other
meanwhile on the side conquering most of
the world in 1945 they called it off why
well very straightforward reason it was
understood by French and Germans and
British that the next time they played
the centuries-old game of slaughtering
each other it's gonna be the end of the
world because they had developed means
of destruction so enormous that you just
can't do it anymore
so now Europe is a peaceful region but
unless that extends to the world same
problems arise
