this is the United States of America a
leading terrorist state using war in
Afghanistan an American support of
Israel proved that George Bush qualifies
as a war criminal well according to Noam
Chomsky America's most famous dissident
the answer is yes we need him in
Cambridge to talk about many things
including his new book 9/11 in the
hysterical days following the September
11th attacks when George Bush reduced
the world to two camps or either with us
or you're against us two voices of
dissent distinguished themselves first
Susan Sontag and then Noam Chomsky both
refused to buy into George Bush's
reductive worldview and they reminded
Americans of their own government's
criminal actions around the world now
Noam Chomsky is of course the MIT
linguistics professor who famously
popularized the concept of manufacturing
consent for years he's written about how
the West uses a propagandistic press to
coerce its own citizens and how it uses
covert forms of violence to maintain
power around the world Chomsky was
overwhelmed with media requests about
September 11th so his new book 9/11 is a
collection of interviews that he gave in
the following months now interestingly
9/11 has been a best-seller despite the
fact that it's had a total lack of
publicity I met Noam Chomsky in
Cambridge to talk about the post 9/11
world and how things have changed since
then but I began by asking him to
explain how the war in Afghanistan is an
example of how the US is in his mind a
leading terrorist State October 12th I
guess a couple of days after the bombing
started Bush publicly announced to the
Afghan people that we will continue to
mom you unless your leadership turns
over to us people who we suspect of
carrying out crimes although we refuse
to give you any evidence probably
because they don't have any and we
dismiss without comment the offers of
your leadership for a negotiation to
that extradition and notice that that's
a textbook illustration of international
that is the you by the US official
definition that is the use of the
threats of force or violence in this
case extreme violence to attain
political ends through intimidation and
fear and so on that's the official
definition this is a textbook
illustration of it three weeks later and
by the end of October the war aims had
changed
they were first announced as far as I
can find out by the British defence
minister sir Admiral Boyce Admiral voice
the British defense minister he informed
the Afghan population that we will
continue to bomb you until you change
your leadership well that's an even more
dramatic illustration of international
terrorism if not an aggression and that
was the and that was the goal that was
followed this had nothing to do with
finding the criminals and bringing them
to justice
it's a totally different issue if the
United States is a leading terrorist
state if as you say Britain is another
example of a terrorist State how do you
distinguish between that kind of what
you describe as terrorism and what they
are saying Osama bin Laden who's a
terrorist make the distinction that's
very simple if they do it it's terrorism
if we do it it's counterterrorism that's
a historical Universal go back to Nazi
propaganda see most extreme mass
murderers ever if you look at Nazi
propaganda that's exactly what they said
they said they're defending the
populations and the legitimate
governments of Europe like Vichy from
the terrorists terrorists partisans who
were directed from London that's the
basic propaganda line and like all
propaganda no matter how vulgar it has
an element of truth the partisans did
carry out terror they were directed from
London the Vichy government is about as
legitimate as half the governments the
US has installed around the world and
support so yes there was a minor element
of truth to it and that's the way it
works if somebody else carries it out
it's terror if we carry it out it's
counter terror I think perhaps one of
the most dramatic
examples right at this moment as a place
where it just was a couple of weeks ago
southeastern Turkey southeastern turkey
is the site of one of the some of the
worst terrorist atrocities of the 1990s
this is the Curtis hacks are the Kurds
attacks on the Kurds left a couple of
million refugees much of the countryside
devastated and tens of thousands of
people killed every imaginable barbaric
form of torture you can dream I was all
well documented and Human Rights Watch
reports and so on how did they do it
well they did it with a huge flow of us
arms which ended up it's peaked in 1997
in a single year 1997 and that one year
the arms transfers to turkey from the
United States were higher than the
entire Cold War period you know up until
the insurgency storm the counter
insurgency started but look at the way
it's treated look at the way it's
treated this massive international
terrorism run unsupported by the United
States is considered a great triumph of
counterterrorism so if you read the
State Department reports on terror they
praised Turkey for its success in
showing how to counter terror you read a
front-page article in The New York Times
praises turkey for showing how to deal
with terror turkey was selected as the
country to provide the international of
the forces for what they call the
international force for Afghanistan
actually it's for Kabul alone it's
Turkey that's being offered is being
paid by the United States extensively to
carry out the repression of terror
thanks to their achievements in
countering terror namely by carrying out
some of the worst terror of the 1990s
massive of ethnic cleansing and
atrocities with us support and now you
know this takes and this is a real
achievement of the intellectual culture
to be able to do this but it illustrates
very well the answer your question
terror and counter terror if some enemy
state did this and I will be
you know that's just outrage we'd be
bombing all right when we come back Noam
Chomsky says that nations such as the
United States and Israel should
acknowledge their own crimes before
talking about right and wrong and he
says a lot more than that so stick
around for more Noam Chomsky
[Music]
let's talk about in the Middle East for
example where Sharon says we are
experiencing terrorist bombings and
therefore we have to have a big
operation in the in the West Bank and
and root out terrorism and and people
say hey you're violating human rights
and the Israelis say there's no
equivalency between suicide bombings and
protecting our security and the
Palestinians say there's no equivalence
between suicide bombings and the
occupation this is the 35th year of a
harsh brutal and vicious occupation
supported unilaterally by the United
States constant terror and atrocities
the supposed Palestinians say well we're
under terrorist attack for 35 years
therefore we have a right to carry out
suicide they say do you accept this does
anybody except nobody accepts all right
then how come everyone accepts the
Israeli claim to be doing it which is
much weaker claim because after all
there's no symmetry in this situation
they are the military occupiers
Palestine isn't occupying Israel and
this isn't just started now it's going
on years ago I mean what is that in your
mind justify no it's not Christmas that
doesn't in anybody's know invalidates
both sides those who defend suicide
bombing and there very few have not a
leg to stand on those who defend the
Israeli atrocities including the US
government most intellectual opinion a
good bit of the West generally yeah they
don't have a leg to stand on either and
have a much weaker position we're back
to Turkey again all right such take the
Powell mission Powell is praised because
he's such a wonderful diplomat he
succeeded in he went to Yasser Arafat
who's imprisoned in a dungeon we're
getting flushed the toilet and he
extracted from him a statement
condemning terror
did anybody request suggests that Powell
should have asked Sharon to condemn the
Israeli atrocities did anyone suggest
that Powell asked George Bush
to condemn the fact that he's been
sending Israel the Apache attack
helicopters which have been devastating
today he has been killing very own oh no
did anybody not know my point
did anybody suggest can you find a word
in the press anywhere or anyone anywhere
this just at powell should have
requested a condemnation of israeli
terror from sharon and of us backing of
that terror from bush i mean that's a
thought that couldn't enter anyone's
mind and the reason is because their
profound commitment to terror and
violence when it's committed by our
clients and by ourselves that is so deep
that we can't even think of the question
you asked us after september 11 one of
your points we ought to look in the
mirror we being America or the West and
a look in the mirror at our own was that
a way of saying look people like bin
Laden are angry at us for good reason in
other words is there a way to justify
what I was saying the statement of mine
that you just quoted is a very
conservative statement in fact it was
articulated by George Bush's favorite
philosopher Jesus Christ who pointed out
famously defined the notion hypocrite a
hypocrite
is a person who focuses on the other
fellas crimes and refuses to look at his
own that's the definition of hypocrite
by George Bush's favorite philosopher
when I repeat that I'm not taking a
radical position I'm taking position
which is just elementary morality but
even if he is a hypocrite and they not
hate everyone okay even and you let me
ask another question
see if just here's an experiment try to
find a phrase in the massive commentary
on September 11th which is not
hypocritical in the sense of George
Bush's favorite philosopher fine one
phrase alright but I don't think you can
do it okay but before I don't want to
get Gnostic here and religious on it but
I do what this is not religion this is
elementary morality if people cannot
rise to the level of applying to
ourselves the same standards we apply to
other
they have no right to talk about right
and wrong they're good but let's talk
about even in right and look there's
nobody pure but an argument has been
made I know that the US has committed
atrocities however they did out a more
brutal regime the Taliban there wasn't
there wasn't even a war in but is that a
moral thing to do they did get rid of a
brutal regime there was celebration in
k2 final atom bomb Israel and get rid of
the brutal regime there let them bomb
was Becca stun and get rid of the brutal
regime they say the Taliban know they're
not the same they're brutal regimes but
let's go back a stage the goal was not
to oust the Taliban that was not a
warring that was a war aim that was
picked up several weeks after the
bombing started okay
all right and let's go back to suppose
that we and their dozens of like list a
long list of brutal regimes around the
world which ought to be overthrown but
not by somebody bombing them however
let's go back to the late late October
when the after three weeks of bombing
when the US and its British client
decided to shift the war aims to
overthrowing the Taliban regime there
was a meeting sponsored by the United
States in Peshawar Pakistan of a
thousand Afghan leaders they unanimously
condemned the bombing and said it was
undermining their efforts which they
thought could succeed to overthrow the
Taliban regime from within he was doing
it just to show off their muscle I know
you want to so the question of whether
it over the overthrow a regime eeeh that
arises and I think the Afghans are right
regimes should be overthrown from within
and in this case it was probably very
likely that that would succeed it was a
small brutal group highly unpopular
plenty of opposition to it which could
have been organized from within and
that's the way to overthrow regime if we
want to overthrow the regime of
Uzbekistan now a great favorite but it
happens to be not very different from
the Taliban the way to do it would not
be the bomb was Becca Stein but to
support internal democratic forces and
let them do it
and that that generalizes around the
world now Robert Kaplan who writes about
foreign policy I spoke to him recently
about his book or your politics and I
put some of your points to him he said
about the distinction between the
terrorist States you call Israel you
know America and the terrorist States
that America calls the Taliban he said I
wish Noam Chomsky had been with me in
Romania in the 70s or the 80s just one
of the seven or eight warsaw states with
just one of the separate prison systems
with 700,000 political prisoners adult
choice a foreign policy is made on
distinctions the argument that Chomsky
makes has no distinctions because
there's a difference between the
quantity and the kind of dictators that
America supported and the quantity and
the kind of things we went in in Kanye's
world for 44 years so let's take his
example I am Ceausescu hideous regime
which he forgot to tell you the United
States supported I supported right till
the end as did Britain so the example
that he gave is a perfect example and
it's a small example because we support
much more brutal regimes I gave an
example in southeastern Turkey several
million refugees tens of thousands of
people killed a country devastated
that's rather serious
it's a nobody accused the militia which
of that in Kosovo but East Timor we
supported affricate he's Indonesia it
was one of the Suharto who was one of
the worst killers and torturers of the
late 20th century the United States and
Britain supported him throughout he is
our kind of guy as the Clinton
administration said in 1995 a horrible
atrocity is in fact you know when he
came into office in 1965 with a coup
the CIA compared it to Hitler Stalin and
now it led to total euphoria in the
United States and Britain massive
support when he carried out even worse
atrocity comparable atrocities elsewhere
the couple you know 100,000 people
killed then hundreds of thousands later
full support continued right through the
end of his rule in fact continued past
his rule in late 1999 when they were
rampaging and destroying what was left
of East Timor the US and Britain
continued to support him and I can
continue through the world like this I
mean what Catalans Kaplan says that that
there is a distinction that everyone's
got some blood on their hands but he
says ah we have significantly less blood
because what we are soft imperialist
really state terrorists so like when we
supported his example Ceausescu in
romania right to the end that's good how
about killing several million people in
Vietnam how about killing hundreds of
thousands of people in Central America
in the 80s leaving four countries
devastated beyond you know beyond maybe
beyond recovery look
nor does it disqualify been that the
fact that this quality that bin Laden is
a terrorist or that say the Taliban are
a terrorist state that fact doesn't
disqualify them from bombing Washington
what disqualifies from doing that is
even is even they were Matt McGann D
they shouldn't do it Kaplan's can't
understand trivialities the triviality
here is that nobody's comparing the
ultra right-wing jingoist slike kaplan
is comparing atrocities by various
countries what honest people are saying
this seems to be incomprehensible is
that we should keep to the elementary
moral level of the Gospels we should pay
attention to our own crimes and stop
committing them this would be true even
if we were killing one person okay and
it's even more true when we're killing
millions of people let's bring it to the
bigger picture than just because it the
question he says we all agree with the
Gospels this is nasty
if you leave people alone they'll kill
each other yeah and that's why what you
need was he cause is an organizing
hegemon an overwhelming power which is
always does yeah which is always as he's
right because we and why is it us
because we have the
and we have a massively subservient
intellectual class of which is an
illustration which will support us
atrocities no matter how awful they are
but is realpolitik that children he's
off in another land with his gospel that
he says we look not sweet forget gospel
I'm talking about the most elementary
morality if a person doesn't understand
that they have a right to talk okay if
you don't understand that you pay
attention to your own crimes you have no
right to talk he talks about
Machiavellian virtues sometimes we do a
bad thing to protect our democratic and
our good institutions and a justices and
how are we protecting our democratic
institutions by supporting mass
slaughter in southeastern Turkey in the
last few years without supporting our
democratic institutions was it
supporting our democratic institutions
not ours but anybody would Kaplan argue
that the nation state has a right to use
any means necessary to protect its
sovereignty no then then he's justifying
the lustre of it she's saying mulashi
which had any hesitate to anything he
wanted to repress the Kosovars and
Albanians that reasoning do we need a
Constabulary a force a central force in
this case it's America America because
it's a superpower
to sometimes use unjust means in the
service of just causes what are the just
causes what was the Just Cause in for
example slaughtering Kurds in
southeastern Turkey what was it just
cause I can what was the Just Cause in
supporting Suharto when he wiped when he
killed a couple hundred thousand
landless peasants in Indonesia went on
to become one of the biggest torturers
in the world and then destroyed
slaughtered a third of the population of
East Timor what was it just cause what
was it just cause when we invaded South
Vietnam forty years ago this is the 40th
anniversary of the public announcement
of the u.s. attack on South Vietnam
ending up killing millions of people
leaving the country devastated is still
dying from chemical warfare what was the
Just Cause what was the Just Cause when
we fought a war to a large extent
against the Catholic Church in Central
America in the 1980s killing hundreds of
thousands of people every imaginable
kind of torture and devastation what was
the Just Cause can I continue yeah we
were the
Just Cause for people like Kaplan is we
did it therefore it's a just cause you
can read that in the Nazi archives - all
right when we come back Noam Chomsky's
always controversial views on Israel and
his idea for solving problems using
international law so stick around once
again for more Noam Chomsky
[Music]
Hitchens says we've seen the enemy and
the enemy isn't us it's the Islamic
fascists
there's into fascists there and I don't
want to live with them we don't want to
negotiate them we must destroy them ergo
the war against the Taliban justified
the war against the al-aqsa brigades
justified I mean he has a different
distinction but we see the face of the
enemy and we should do anything to root
them out how do you respond to that
argument I respond to that by saying
that there are many evil forces in the
world if we want to stop atrocities I
think it's a great idea to reduce the
level of atrocities and violence around
the world the easiest way to do it
simplest is to stop participating in it
if we stop participating in it we will
already reduce the level of a trial
atrocities and violence enormous Lee and
if we can ever reach the moral level
minimum moral level of terminating our
own massive participation and atrocities
then we can move to another question of
what we do about the atrocities of
others and I think there I think that
it's right to deal with them yes there
is an enemy there are people who carried
out kryder's against humanity and there
are ways to deal with crimes not by a
bombing another country and putting
millions of people at the risk of
starvation that's not a way to deal with
crimes when the US was condemned for
international terrorism in Nicaragua and
then vetoed a security hadn't dismissed
the condemnation by the World Court of
course and escalated the crimes and
vetoed a Security Council resolution
calling up on it to observe
international law the right reaction for
Nicaragua was not to say we have seen
the enemy and we must destroy them so
therefore let's set off bombs in
Washington but if it's wrong for them
it's wrong for us again by elementary
moral standards so we should ask well
what was right for them and what's right
for which would be right for us and I
think they couldn't do what was right
for them because we blocked it we're too
powerful but we could do
was right for them and we never even
considered it because we don't rise to
that minimal moral level let's take a
look at the Middle East but let's take a
look at the fact the facts are 435 I
repeat for 35 years there has been a
harsh brutal miserable military
occupation there has not been a
political settlement the reason why
there has not been a political
settlement is that the United States
unilaterally has blocked it for 25 years
is it supported by the entire world
including the majority of the American
people the answer to that question is
yes there is a political settlement that
has been supported by virtually the
entire world including the Arab states
the PLO Europe Eastern Europe Canada
Barack put that on the - no he did not
he did not what this bed is also
supported by the majority of the
American people it has just been
reiterated by Saudi Arabia
the US has unilaterally blocked it for
25 years what Barack put on the table
the the population doesn't know this
because people like the Western media
the media in Canada in the United States
don't tell them like you can check and
see how often you you for example or
others have reported what I just said I
don't don't bother checking the answer
zero the Barack proposal in Camp David
in the Barack Clinton proposal in the
United Stated in the United States you
cannot find a map which is the most
important thing of course check in
Canada and see if you can find a map you
go to Israel you can find a map you can
go to scholarly sources you can find a
map here's what you find when you look
at a map you find that this generous
magnanimous proposal guaranteed provided
Israel with a salient east of Jerusalem
including the city of mahalo Adumim
which was established primarily by the
Labour government in Clinton in order to
bisect the West Bank that setting goes
almost to Jericho bricks the West Bank
into two Canton's then there's a second
set into the
North going to the Israeli settlement of
arielle which bisects the northern part
into two Canton's so we've got three
Canton's in the West Bank virtually
separated all three of them are
separated from a small area of East
Jerusalem which is the center of
Palestinian commercial and cultural life
and of communications they've got four
Canton's all separated from the West
from Gaza so that's five Canton's all
surrounded by Israeli settlements
infrastructure development and so on
which also instantly guarantee is real
control over the water resources the
reason less common this does not rise to
the level of South Africa forty years
ago when South Africa established the
Bathurst and that's the generous
magnanimous offer okay and there's a
good reason why maps weren't shown
because as soon as you look at the map
you see it all right
however that's the characterization of
it but let me just say Arafat didn't
even bother putting a counter proposal
on the table that's not true they
negotiated that table afterwards that's
not right I guess my question is that's
not they don't continue to the English
that accept that's totally false no no
no is it false but not a single
participant in the meetings says it
that's a media fabrication so that air
if I didn't put together had opposed
they had a proposal they proposed the
international consensus which has been
accepted by the entire world the Arab
states the PLO the majority's argument
sorry they proposed a settlement which
is an accord with an overwhelming
international question and it's blocked
by the United States all right when we
come back after this break Noam Chomsky
says that the United States is not only
blocking Middle East peace it's actually
escalating the violence there and who's
guilty of these kinds of crimes George
Bush Bill Clinton JFK Eisenhower all
American presidents and a lot more so
come on back once again for Noam Chomsky
[Music]
hello
[Music]
the problem that people look at now the
Middle East is they say it's spun out of
control how do you get back to first way
we get to get back first way we get back
is by trying the experiment of minimal
honesty okay let's try that experiment
if we try the experiment of minimal
honesty we look at our own position and
we discover what I just described that
for 25 years the United States has
blocked the political settlement which
is supported by the majority of the
American population and by the entire
world except for Israel virtually I mean
there's some marginal exceptions so for
the first thing we do is accept the
honesty to look at that we take a look
at Camp David and we say yeah was the
same the United States was still for
proposing it's a demanding a bantu
stance at the style settlement and
rejecting the overwhelming international
consensus and the position of the
American people we then discover that
the United States immediately moved to
enhance terror in the region so let's
continue on September 29th a hoot Barack
put a massive military presence outside
the Alexa mosque and very provocative
when people came out of the mosque young
people started throwing stones these
early army started shooting half of them
people were killed and it escalated the
next couple of days there was no
Palestinian fire at this time and it's
all in occupied territories in the next
couple of days Israel used us
helicopters Israel produces no
helicopters use us helicopters to attack
civilian complexes killing about a dozen
people and wounding several dozen
Clinton reacted to that on October 3rd
by making the biggest deal in a decade
to send Israel new military helicopters
which had just been used for the purpose
I described and of course we continue to
be the US press cooperated with that by
refusing to publish the story to this
day they have not published the fact it
continued when Bush
one of his first acts was to send Israel
a new shipment of the most advanced
military helicopters in the arsenal that
continues right up to a couple of weeks
ago with new shipments you take a look
at the reports from say Jeanine by
British correspondents like Peter
Beaumont and the London observer he says
the worst atrocity there was the Apache
helicopters buzzing around destroying
and demolishing everything now this is
enhancing terror and we may easily
continue we can take all so let me
continue on December 15th 14th the
Security Council tried to pass a
resolution calling for what everyone
recognizes to be the obvious means for
reducing terror namely sending
international monitors that's a way of
reducing terror this happened to be in
the middle of a quiet period which
lasted for about three weeks the u.s.
vetoed ten days before that there was a
meeting at Geneva of the High
Contracting Parties of the Fourth Geneva
Convention which has unanimously held
for 35 years that it applies to Israel
it the meeting condemned the Israeli
settlements as illegal condemned the
list of atrocities willful destruction
of property murder trials torture and so
on and so forth
it's not okay what happened to that
meeting I'll tell you what happened to
that meeting the u.s. boycotted it
therefore the media refused to publish
it therefore no one here knows that the
United States once again enhanced terror
by refusing to recognize the
applicability of conventions which make
virtually everything the United States
and the Israel are doing their a a grave
breach of the Geneva Conventions it
retains a war crime just a minute
these conventions were established in
1949 in order to criminalize the
atrocities of the Nazis in occupied
territory they are customary
international law the United States is
obligated as a High Contracting party to
prosecute violate
of those conventions that means to
prosecute its own leadership for the
last 25 years if we had if we were
functioning by the Geneva Convention who
would we then prosecute as a war
criminal with George Bush be a war
criminal course she's gonna be a workers
they're all acting it would use her
Arafat be a war criminal he's a criminal
but not a workroom what's the difference
the difference is work run has a
technical definition its crime carried
out by state would he be guilty of
crimes against humanity probably he
would minor crimes is compared with us
but Tony Blair obvious obviously most
leaders in the Arab states they're
criminals but not work for a miles
they're horrible criminals including the
ones we support like all the states we
every state we support is a practically
as a brutal terrorist state which
carries out crimes against their own
society an internal of their own society
but technically those are not war crimes
they just crimes very popular phrase now
Samuel Huntington's clash of
civilizations writers like Bernard Lewis
say what went wrong that in fact there
might be a clash of civilizations
between an Islamic culture and a Western
judeo-christian culture they resent us
there's enormous amounts of hatred that
goes back in history but because of
resentment you want to know the answer
to the question which they Bernhard
Lewis certainly knows it he's not
telling you first words not telling you
what happened in the 19th century he
didn't talk about what Lord Palmerston
and the British did the Egypt for
example but let's be more recent yes
there's hatred against us why it's easy
to find out the u.s. is a very free
country we have enormous internal
declassified record so let's look at him
in 1958 the US government faced we know
from internal records three major crises
in the world North Africa Middle East
and Indonesia all with oil-producing
states all Islamic States President
Eisenhower in internal discussion
observed to his staff that I'm quoting
it now there's a campaign of hatred
against us in the Middle East not by
governments but by the people the
National Security Council discussed that
question and said yes and the reason is
there's a perception in that region that
the United States
kourt's status quo governments which
prevent democracy and development and
that we do it because of our interest in
Near East oil furthermore it's difficult
to counter that perception because it's
correct and furthermore it ought to be
correct we ought to be supporting brutal
and corrupt governments which prevent
democracy and development because we
want to control Middle East oil and it's
true that leads to a campaign of hatred
against us now until Bernhard Lewis
tells us that and that's only one piece
of a long story we know that he's just
evolved for propagandists not a scholar
so yes as long as we are supporting
harsh brutal governments blocking
democracy and development because they
are interested in controlling the oil
resources of the region there will be a
campaign of hatred against us what state
does function according to what you call
the minimal levels of honesty is there a
stand no it's our power centers the only
thing that imposes constraints on them
is either outside force or their own
populations so the United States
esthetical dialogue that's exactly why
the intellectuals who were talking about
are so adamant at preventing people in
the United States and Britain from
learning the most elementary facts about
is it possible that if you say no state
functions not honorable it happens the
United States for example is far more
civilized than it was 40 years ago
let's just take that March 9th this
March happened to be the 40th
anniversary of the public announcement
by the Kennedy administration that the
US Air Force is bombing South Vietnam it
also initiated chemical warfare to
destroy crops initiated napalm started
driving millions of people into
concentration camps to separate them
from the guerrillas or they knew what
they were supporting this was all public
did we commemorate the 40th anniversary
no why
because 40 years ago nobody cared if the
government announces okay we're gonna
start bombing another country and use
chemical warfare to wipe out their crops
and driving the concentration camps fine
our problem so there was no protest in
no discussion now there's more Proctor
yes because the country has gotten more
alized no US president today or for the
last 20 years could conceivably do what
Kennedy could do with total impunity 40
years ago and the reason is because
there was massive popular protest
opposed by the intellectual classes of
course who hated but it did it led to
all sorts of things including opposition
to aggression and violence it also
spawned the contemporary civil rights
movement the feminist movement the
environmental movements and all sorts of
other things and it imposed important
constraints on street violence so that's
how we got rid of slavery that's how we
got rid of feudalism that's how it's now
moving towards an emancipation from
these slowly there's over yes over over
time there has been agonizing Glee slow
progress but very real always opposed by
the states by the intellectuals who
support violence and atrocities and try
to justify them and try to prevent the
population from knowing about them but
fortunately their control is limited and
therefore what will the state look like
at the end at the end and is a long time
look like at the end I think state sort
of dissolve because I think there are
legitimate structures but that's a long
time that's it but but it is the end of
the nation state that you foresee in the
vision I don't foresee anything what I'm
saying is that as long as people
ordinary people are able to free
themselves from the doctrinal controls
imposed on them by their self-appointed
betters and mentors I as long as they're
able to do this they'll continue to be
able to struggle for peace and justice
and freedom and limitations on violence
and constraints on power as they've been
doing for hundreds of years and I don't
see any end to that where it'll end up
in the long run I can tell you where I'd
like it to but I wouldn't even dream
about that the immediate problem is to
free ourselves from the shackles imposed
very consciously by the kind of people
you're talking about we don't want the
facts to be known and for very good
reasons because if people know the facts
they're not going to tolerate
so therefore if to prevent them from
knowing you have to indoctrinate them
you have to tell them stories about how
we're really good guys and if we use
violence must be for the general good
because we represent the course of
history
yeah that's the job of propagandists for
power and violence and it's the task of
populations to free themselves from
those kinds of controls and domination

in the post September eleventh days few
people were as courageous as noam
chomsky and asking the hard questions
about American involvement with
terrorism and then marshalling evidence
to support his views but to say that his
ideas are controversial is obviously an
understatement witness what he said
about the nation-state being an inherent
terrorist state or his views on the
Middle East a lot of its controversial
now his slim book 9/11 is only a primer
on his views and it doesn't include his
usual array of footnotes which are
always essential reading Noam Chomsky's
9/11 is published by seven stories press
now for a transcript of the entire
interview and for a list of other
Chomsky's books or to add your comments
to the discussion board check out our
website that's news world that's cbc.ca
slash hot type
now our next hot type hour-long summer
special will feature two writers who
challenge Chomsky's views on
international politics the US and on the
Middle East first Robert Kaplan and will
talk about his book warrior politics and
then the Islamic historian Bernard Lewis
and will talk about his book what went
wrong it's a real academic fight between
all those three you'll want to watch out
for that that's it for this week I'm
Evan Solomon
I'll see you next time one heart
