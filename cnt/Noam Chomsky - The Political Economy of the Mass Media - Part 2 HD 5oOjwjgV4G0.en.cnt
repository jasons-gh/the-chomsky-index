you
I've been asked to make an announcement
to there's a rally in March tomorrow
Thursday March 16th the slogan has
stopped the US war in El Salvador
there's a three o'clock rally in the
library mall and a340 March to the
Federal Building which is part of a
national protest sponsored by all sorts
of groups I'm sure there's a leaflet out
there to demand an end to the u.s.
support for the at for El Salvador's
death squad democracy and the support of
political negotiated solution to the war
through the FMLN peace proposal so
that's tomorrow three o'clock
I is there somebody standing at the mic
why don't we let's just make it
mechanicals start over there then go
over there and then go up there okay and
then we'll go around okay so I can't see
ya systems and ideologies behind them
however a number of statements which you
have made in the past are a great
concern to me first and foremost among
them is your claim that the Soviet Union
is in fact a dungeon and to my way of
thinking such a blanket condemnation of
an entire society can only be regarded
to say the least is inappropriate and
moreover I believe that these kinds of
statements can become quite destructive
in serving to propagate inadequate and
outdated notions of the communist enemy
and I I just wonder if your if these
ideas I've been waiting three years to
respond to that statement of yours and I
wondered if in the light of
the the changes that have that have come
about with Glasson austin peay destroyed
openness and restructuring argue it's
arguable with how significant they are
but if you I don't know if you still
maintain that strict view on the subject
yeah well first of all I didn't say that
the society is I said the the state is
the government then the you know maybe
people living in their homes or not but
I said it because I think it's true I
mean I think the thing Soviet Union is a
dungeon and I also don't think is
anything to do with communists or
anything to do with socialism as to the
changes I think you know there one hopes
that they'll work what's happened is
that the jailers have decided to relax
it a little bit notice that those
changes are coming from the top which is
good you know better than having no
changes but in fact Gorbachev has
concentrated more power into his hands
than the leadership had in the past and
he's using that power and something like
the manner of Peter the Great to try to
liberalize the society from above which
means to cut back the restrictions to
open it up a bit and I think that's all
to the good
I mean I have a feeling that those
changes will say they've already set
forth lots of you know they they're when
you when you introduce changes like that
lots of things begin to happen popular
forces do begin to develop and you get
all kind of conflicts and interesting
things happen and it remains to be seen
where it will lead so I'm glad to see
that the what I as I see it if you want
to continue with the metaphor that the
jailers have decided to open the cells a
little bit and to allow a little more
freedom in the society I think that's
very good
and I hope that other forces get them to
continue to do it but as to I mean if we
could just discuss whether this is an
accurate perception of the society or
not I guess you think it isn't I think
it is and I'll explain why if you like
but to get to your to the point you
raised suppose it suppose I think that
it is I think I should say it I don't
see any reason not to say it if I think
it's true I guess my only real question
is there's political repression the
United States to deter the United States
no because the united states a much
freer it's affecting I've what I've said
about the United States and I'll say it
again is in many ways from free society
in the world sure there's repression
here but it's also by comparative
standards a very free society fact I
think that's one of the reasons it has
such sophisticated thought control as I
tried to explain the capacity of the the
capacity of the state to coerce in the
United States is relatively limited
you're quite right that there's plenty
of oppression I mentioned the FBI which
is the national political police which
is dedicated to oppression that's its
job it's been doing it ever since it was
founded well you know that's
inconsistent with the free society but
again by comparative standards remember
I'm talking about comparative standards
the United States is quite a free
society the capacity of the state to
coerce I think is limited probably more
so than any other society I know at
least so I don't think that it would be
correct to call it a dungeon thank you
yeah
if you looked to blocked back from where
you're standing right now you'd come
across a marvelous example of what I've
described in various various occasions
so if some example of above-ground
bunker Neal fashioned other what
above-ground bunker neo-fascist
architecture called by this Hall if
violence fall is the school of
communications the comm Arts Building
the School of Journalism I imagine there
a number of journalism students in the
audience tonight I imagine they're in a
good number of people who well they they
filter in they become middle echelon
apparatchik II for the media empire that
you've discussed they come out imbued
with the ideology of value free
objective reporting it's the major
ideological offensive against the kind
of model that you want to pose as an
alternative I wonder if you could talk
to the audience here about the ideology
of objectivity and value free reporting
within this system well there is such an
ideology and it's interesting to see how
its interpreted objectivity means you
take what people in power say and you
reported accurately with
distorting their quotes and then sort of
down at the bottom of the column you
know down at the bottom of the column
you may say things like what I quoted if
you're really an intrepid reporter you
say well this may seem to be
inconsistent with the spirit of the
peace agreement that's you know that's
objective reporting if the State
Department announces that Nicaragua has
called for revolution Without Borders
then even if you know it happens to be a
lie
an objective reporter just reports it
because they said it after all it's true
that they said it and wouldn't be
objected be introducing opinions to say
it's a lie
I suppose so there is an object ideology
of objectivity and I wouldn't just scoff
at it incidentally the fact of the
matter is that by and large American
reporters if you had to you know a bunch
of reporters describing something they
saw I would tend by and large to trust
the American reporter at least as much
maybe more than those who come out of
other traditions because this treated
this business of objectivity is not
completely to be scoffed at the effort
to try to keep your reporting to the
facts and not the introduced opinion is
a worthy effort and sometimes it shows
up in accurate description and there are
some reporters I should say who do it
extremely well and have a very good
record of it and in fact this even
includes reporters who work for the
journals that in my view are right at
the core of the propaganda system so
take say John Kipner of the New York
Times I think he can tell when the New
York Times when the editors want some
story to be reported accurately for
their own purposes that's when they send
John Kipner to report it because he's
been reported accurately and when they
don't want it reported accurately
anymore they take him off and put him
back at the Metro at this that's one
test as to what the editors have in mind
and they're there and there are times
when they want report as stories
reported accurately and there are some
journalists who really do it on the
other hand when they send Tom Friedman
out their current chief diplomatic
correspondent you know what they want
his propaganda you want somebody who's
going to say as he just said after he
was
advance to this August Post that the
United States is now you know sort of
under the Bush administration planning
to support the Central American Peace
Accords which were introduced and
proposed and advanced by Costa Rica
Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador
mission there but that's part of the
game that's what happens when you send
Thomas Friedman to record a story and I
presume that the editors understand
these things
that's incidentally I presume why Thomas
Friedman's chief of diplomatic
correspondent and John Keefe no reason
but you'd have to ask the editors about
that the so the the the get back to your
point the objectivity it's a good thing
it's a good value to be objective in
recording and the people who do it
honestly do very good journalism but as
you're implying that ideology can be
used to be a distorting mechanism and
quite commonly is
is George Bush's hands-off policy just a
cover and all the action of the
executive branch will be handled
covertly or is it an opportunity for the
legislative branch and the American
people to take back at the reins of
power oh I don't
well first of all what makes you think
George Bush has a hands-off policy okay
that's not very good evidence in fact
the fact of the matter is Ronald Reagan
had a hands-off policy and in fact
Ronald Reagan didn't presume probably
didn't know what the policies were this
isn't it's an interesting fact about the
last eight years which again should not
be laughed at the fact of the matter is
for the last I mean they media had to
put on a big pretense about this but
everybody knew you know everybody with
their eyes open knew and most of the
population knew that for the last eight
years the country hasn't had a chief
executive now that's an important fact
and in fact I think that's a step
forward in manufacturers consent and in
fact it's maybe a sign of the future of
political democracy I think the United
States made a leap into the future in
the last eight years if you sort of
retract a little but I think they'll go
on and I think other industrial
democracies will follow us if you could
get to the point where voting is simply
the matter a matter of selecting purely
symbolic figures then you would have
gone a long way towards marginalizing
the public and that pretty well happened
in the last eight years you know you had
somebody who probably didn't know what
the policies were his job was to read
the lines rich written for him by the
rich folk what he's been doing for the
last 30 or 40 years he seems to enjoy it
and he gets well paid for it and
everybody seems happy but to vote for
Ronald Reagan is like voting for the
Queen of England and that's an advance
I don't really mean this as a joke I
think that's an advance you know it's
progress in marginalizing the public
part of marginalizing the public is
taking the formal mechanisms of
participation which exist and ensuring
that they don't lead to a crisis of
democracy by being substantive and what
better method can you think of than
simply reducing them to the selection of
symbolic figures I think that happened I
think the press has covered it though
they doubtless know it but as for George
Bush I think you got a return to you
know to a sort of more normal situation
I don't have any reason to believe that
there's any hands-off policy if there
will be the same kind of resort to
covered activities that there's been in
the past when does the government resort
to covered activities well typically
when the domestic enemy doesn't allow it
to carry out the activities in public
that's when a government resorts to
clandestine activities clandestine
activities are difficult complex
expensive they carry the danger of being
exposed it's much easier and more
efficient to carry out violent
activities overtly and a government
typically our government in particular
when it resorts to clandestine
activities it's usually because it's
afraid of the public those activities
are not much of a secret from anybody
else there's certainly not a secret from
the victims they're not a secret from
other from the various mercenary states
that we have involved in it like the
whole stuff in the iran-contra hearings
that wasn't a secret to Nicaragua wasn't
a secret to Israel it wasn't a secret to
Taiwan or Saudi Arabia Brunei nobody
wasn't a secret to anybody out there it
wasn't a secret to the whole array of
shady businessmen who were in it to make
a buck like Richard Secord word hacking
and so on fact of the matter is it
wasn't even a secret to Congress in the
media as I said they knew about the
Contra flights they just weren't
reporting it they also knew about the
arms sales to Iran through Israel and
they weren't reporting it they couldn't
suppress any of that any longer after a
plane was shot down with an American
Neri and after the Iranian government
revealed the fact that the National
Security Adviser was wandering around
Tehran giving out Bibles and chocolate
cakes at that point
you couldn't suppress it any longer so
it became public and then comes a
cover-up operation but the point is it
wasn't really secret to anybody much and
I think you can easily document that I
mean I was for example writing about it
from public sources throughout this
whole period but the point is you could
keep it secret from the public it was a
low enough level so you could keep it
secret from the public and that means
the domestic enemy didn't get to outrage
over it remember that you've got a
control enemy territory and that's what
covered operations are for if the
government happens to be committed to
activities too violent or terroristic or
subversive or other activities that the
domestic public the domestic enemy will
not tolerate it'll move to covered
actions that's what they're for and
there's no reason to believe that the
Bush administration will be any
different from others in this respect
especially you know in fact less reason
after all what's Bush's background
dr. Chomsky you statement and the reason
it's searched an interview regarding the
feminist movement that it has had been
the most important the actual effects
has had on social life the cultural
patterns he quoted accurately it's been
a lasting important when the impact on
everything why is it that not only the
left he has trouble with you know in
some ways working with the feminist
movement but perhaps tolerates to what I
feel is an unacceptable degree
anti-feminists individuals perspectives
within its mix that's one question and
the second could you be more specific
about what you had in mind well I I
don't know it's that's a tough thing
because I'd rather not okay but another
one I'd like to throw out for you is
that you are a world-class linguist and
I'm wondering how this kind of blends in
or interfaces with your political work
yeah well I mean the actually the issues
of feminism other at the context of that
remark was my expression if I recall
correctly was my it was an answer to a
question of what happened to the
movements of the sixties and there is a
propaganda story about this the story is
that the movements of the 60s had all
this idealism and so on and so forth and
all faded and after that anybody
everybody's just interested in
themselves and all disappeared and I
think that's nonsense
I think that's propaganda and it's in
fact an attempt to make people feel that
they ought to give up but the fact of
the matter if you look objectively at
least as I look it seems to me that the
movements of the 60s just expanded and
grew in the nineteen seventies and
expanded and grew even more in the 80s
and they now reach into much wider areas
of the society than any ever before
groups like this for example would not
have been around and certainly wouldn't
have listened to a talk like this twenty
years ago but now they do all over the
country and not just in universities
also in you know small towns and
churches and so on and so forth I think
the movements just expanded that's why
the Reagan administration was forced
into clandestine activities in fact
enemy territory was
control but as for defense the reason I
mentioned the feminist movement
specifically is because that's a product
of the 70s and in my view as I said as
you quoted accurate I think in terms of
its overall impact it's probably the one
that had the greatest impact on cultural
patterns and relations and structures of
authority and so on and so forth
of any of any of them and that's the 70s
now to get back to your point about the
left a large part of the origins of the
contemporary feminist movement were in
the left and they were in reaction to
the sexism inside the left that was a
big issue in the late 60s you know big
issue in a very emotional and
complicated issue and that was one of
the roots of the modern feminist
movement of course feminist movements go
way back and it could be that the Left
still tolerates sexism and sexist
individuals I'm sure it does I if to the
extent that it does that's just
something to be overcome not just on the
left everywhere else as well I don't see
it anything special to do with the left
my name is Nancy and I work with the
international socialist organization and
I just want to start by saying I like
I'm sure many many many other people who
are here tonight are deeply indebted to
your work it's been absolutely essential
in helping us cut through the kind of
garbage that we're faced with every day
when we try to figure out what's going
on in the world but I think if I could
continue I think there is also a problem
in the analysis that I've seen in your
works and that you presented tonight in
the sense that I think we can tend to
lose the forest for the trees that you
present so many you know astonishing
details about what is wrong with the
system and about what is wrong with the
media that we can tend to lose sight of
what I think the really key question is
which is why is this control necessary
in the first place and I would submit at
least that I think it's because there's
antagonism I got a minute and a half I
swear to God it's no longer it's because
there's antagonistic interest involved
they didn't talk about milkmaids and
dairy went up whatever was dairymaids
and spinsters and Labor's in the 17th
century for no reason it was because
they were the working class and what we
see today in this country I think it's
quite frankly let's speak bluntly a
ruling class which tries to control a
working class population and that's what
it's about is holding on to that power
if that's the case then it seems like to
me the question that we face is how to
organize to change that system to
challenge capitalism and I think in that
effort you do it to service to your
listeners and to the people who respect
your work when you equate Lenin with
Stalinism as blithely as you did tonight
I say that and I think it's also
important to point out that that is an
unquestioned assumptions and also an
easy applause getter we saw that you
share with the mainstream media and I
think if it were actually that simple
the coat the horrific kinds of measures
that even bourgeois historians described
as a counter-revolution under Stalin
would not have been necessary if they
were all the same to begin with now in
short to sum up the situation that you
have outlined tonight I think is
extremely serious and I think it's
important that we all take it seriously
what we're talking about is literally
the fate of millions of lives around the
world particularly in the international
politics that you describe that being
the case then I think we need a full and
a serious and a fair discussion of
various different alternatives not just
talking about the horrors of capitalism
but actually how to change it to end
this stuff once and for all
well I think you made it ok
I think well there's several questions
there one is about the discussion of the
United States and I think what I said is
approximately what you said except I
didn't use some of that rhetoric the I
you know which I don't particularly
helpful today the truth either
analytically or to understand or
whatever but it's the same picture John
Jay had it straight the people who own
the country out of government and the
people who own the country have
basically now are a network of
corporations and conglomerates and banks
and so on they ought to govern it and
the way they do it is by the methods
we've described now as far as the Soviet
Union is concerned I didn't happen to
talk about it tonight but I've written
about this topic I haven't just made the
charge I've written about it and
explained why I think it's true and it
doesn't bother me if I happen to agree
with the mainstream media on this
Trotsky to pick somebody who you
remember once he was charged in the
1930s with agreeing with the fascists
and his condemnation of the Soviet Union
and he pointed out that his critique was
to be true didn't wasn't gonna abandon
it if somebody else had to happen to say
it for different reasons so the question
is about the Soviet Union and
particularly about Lenin so what was
Leninism well in my here we have to look
at facts now you know you look at the
fact I think here's what you find
Lenin was a right wing deviation of the
socialist movement and he was so
regarded he was regarded as that by the
Marxists by the mainstream Marxists
we've forgotten who the mainstream
Marxist were because they lost and you
only remember the guys who won but if
you go back to the to that period the
mainstream Marxist were people like for
example Anton punycode who was head of
education for the for the Marxist
movement and a serious he's the one one
of the people who Lenin later denounced
as an infantile leftist but he was one
of the leading intellectuals of the
actual Marxist movement rosa luxemburg
was another mainstream Marxist and there
were others and they were very critical
in fact Trotsky was one up until 1917
they were all very critical of Leninism
because of this what they regarded as
this
- mystic vanguard ISM the idea that the
radical intelligentsia were going to
exploit popular movements to seize state
power and then to use that state power
to whip the population into the society
that they chose now that was quite
inconsistent with Marxism as this as
understood by the mainstream sort of I'd
say left Marxists from this point of
view Bolshevism was a right wing
deviation Trotsky made the same points
up till 1917
now when Lenin came back to Russia in
April 1917 he took a different line
quite a different line than the one he'd
had in the past you take a look at
Lenin's work it shifted character in
April 17th in April 1917 it became kind
of libertarian that's when he came out
with the April theses and that's when he
wrote state and democracy came out it
came out a year later but that's when it
was written and these were a state and
revolution these these were basically
libertarian works they were very much
more in the main in the mainstream of
sort of less a libertarian socialism
from sort of you know this range that
goes from anarchism over the left
Marxism of the panic a closer look
Sandburg variety any talk to that
Soviets in the need for you know a
workers organization and so on in fact
came really closer to what the essence
of socialism was always understood to be
after all the core of socialism was
understood to be workers control over
production that was the core that's
where you begin with then you go on to
other things but the beginning is
controlled by the workers over
production that's where it begins
then Lenin took power in October 1917
and what's called a revolution but in my
view ought to be called a coup and the
then the and things followed that coup
or a revolution if you want to call it
that one of the things that followed it
was the immediate moves to destroy the
Soviets and the factory councils those
were some of the first moves of Lenin
and Trotsky after they took the tracks
to be joined at that point after they
took state power in fact if you look at
what Lenin wrote after that period or
did you'll find it's a reversion to the
earlier position
this sort of left deviation is that a
deviation you could ask why in my view
it was just opportunistic he knew that
in order to gain power he was going to
have to go along with the popular
currents that were developing which were
in fact spontaneous and libertarian and
socialist as most popular movements are
have been in fact since the 17th century
and being an astute politician which he
was he sort of went along with that and
talked the line that the people wanted
to hear it's just like when an American
politician goes somewhere and his
pollsters tell him say so-and-so and he
says it I mean he believes and nothing
Lenin was doing the same thing with that
polls in any event whatever your
interpretation is when he took power he
reverted to the former Vanguard ISM and
moved at once to eliminate the organs of
workers control now that meant he was
moving to destroy socialism if socialism
has as its core workers control over
production the Soviets and the factory
councils were instruments of workers
control and same you could say they're
defective instruments never be worked
out better and so on yeah yeah but they
were the instruments that had been
developed in the course of popular
struggle for to implement basically
workers control and those were the first
things to go
by early 1918 this is now it's it's
still really before the Civil War sit in
Lenin's view was pretty clearly
expressed it was the view that both he
and Trotsky took the position that what
you need is with what Trotsky called a
labor army which is submissive to the
control of a single leader is it modern
you know progress and development and
socialism requires that the master the
population subordinate themselves to a
single leader in a disciplined workforce
well that has absolutely nothing to do
with socialism in fact the exact
opposite of it
and it was criticized for that by the in
a sense in a spirit of some solidarity
because the you know the revolutionary
forces were still operative it was
credit he was criticized for that by
people like it was a Luxembourg and by
Pannekoek and Gorter and the other
mainstream sort of left Marxists and
that and I think they were right
it seems to me that
and then it just goes on from there I
mean Lenin reconstructed these are
systems of oppression often more
efficiently check KGB and other
techniques of control and oppression I
think from that point on there was
nothing remotely like socialism in the
Soviet Union I think it was in fact in
my view is a precursor of later forms of
totalitarianism now you know you could
that's what I think happened and I think
that's what you discover if you look at
the facts now why is it called socialism
well I think there see I think that's
complicated we should look at it this to
the Soviet Union calls it socialism and
you know after they took control of the
they did take control pretty soon of
most of the international socialist
movement because primarily the prestige
of having created something sort of
socialism instantly just aside remarked
Lenin remained despite it all as sort of
an orthodox Marxist in many respects and
as an orthodox Marxist he didn't believe
that it was possible to have socialism
in the Soviet Union this was supposed to
be up to his death or you know shortly
before his death when he was still
writing you know speaking lucidly he
took kept the view that the Soviet
revolution was a holding action they
were just gonna hold things in place
until the real revolution took place in
Germany because the revolution according
to Marxist doctrine was going to take
place in the most advanced sector of
modern cap of modern industrial
capitalism you know for all the reasons
that you read about in March that's
where the revolution had to take place
obviously that wasn't the Soviet Union
so they couldn't be socialism there it
was just some kind of holding action and
that presumably gave some sort of
justification for eliminating the
socialist institutions only it's a real
justification but probably that was the
internal justification and again in
taking that you he was in accord with
the mainstream Marxist tradition
well after that that comes the view that
all of this is socialism and why should
the communist parties take that view I
think the reason is because they wanted
to sort of exploit the moral force of
social
which was quite real you know it's kind
of hard to remember that today but at
that time it was very real this was
regarded as a you know as prot as a
progressive moral force and by
associating their own destruction of
socialism with the aura of socialism
they hope to gain credit in the working
classes and other progressive sectors
now the West also identified that with
socialism and they did it for the
opposite reason they wanted to associate
socialism with the brutality of the
Russian state that undermined socialism
so what you had is that the two major
world propaganda agencies for their own
quite different reasons were claiming
that this is socialism that this
destruction of socialism is socialism
and it's very hard to break out of the
control of the world's two major
propaganda agencies when they agree they
agreed for different reasons but they
basically agreed and that's then became
doctor and dogma well I think people
should ask whether that's true take a
look back and see whether the moves that
Lenin took and the Trotsky supported him
in taking and that they both advocated
had anything to do with socialism as it
was understood but say in the Marxist
tradition or in the left libertarian
tradition and I think the answer that
you'll discover when you look at that is
that they didn't in fact this was a
destruction of socialist institutions
well you know this may be true or it may
be false but if it's true and I think
the evidence pretty strongly supports it
then I don't see any reason why we
shouldn't Express that fact and I
certainly don't think that we should be
deterred in expressing this fact if
other people whose you know fascists
whatever happened to condemn the Soviet
Union just for the same reasons that
Trotsky mentioned in the 1930s
getting back to losing the forest for
the trees we have part 2 of the book
pulping story please pardon part 2 of
your book pulping story you promised in
question answers might come up with you
said you had some further oh the
aftermath of that pulping incident yeah
is that what you meant yes yeah well
that that's kind of a more subtle and
complex which is what I didn't talk
about it but here's what actually
happened
we the book was later decided to rewrite
and update it and we did and it came out
from South End press which was then in
existence a small radical press run by
cooperative run by couple young people
and it was published as the political
economy of human rights to volume book
that came out in 1979 well South and
press wasn't going to pulp it so it
exists in fact you can even buy it know
what happened at that point you can't
pulp the book any longer so how do you
react to it well there are two ways of
reacting to it the main way is to ignore
it there were a lot of things in the
book you can read it and see what was
there but for example part there was a
discussion of it was discussion of u.s.
foreign policy in the media basically
that's what it was and the extensive
case studies of both topics and so on
and so forth
mostly it was ignored as you'd predict
but it wasn't entirely ignored there was
one exception and a very interesting
exception let me give you the background
it explains some of the more subtle ways
in which the system works in this one of
the things we did in this in in order to
put the propaganda model to a test we
didn't call it propaganda model then
it's the same thing in order to put it
to a test we tried to compare sort of
paired historical incidents kind of like
I was doing in connection with freedom
of press issued fine I mean history
doesn't create exact controlled
experiments but there are enough cases
that are similar enough so you can test
how the media are going to deal with
them when we looked for such cases we
particular we looked for atrocity
and we divided the atrocities we looked
at into three categories what we called
constructive blood baths meaning ones
that are good for us power and the
corporate class or their constructive
benign blood baths one where us power
and privilege doesn't care very much one
or another it's sort of irrelevant and
nefarious blood baths those are the ones
carried out by official enemies so we
had various types of benign constructive
in the various blood baths and we gave
quite a number of examples of these well
our prediction was that the media would
welcome the constructive blood baths
that they would ignore the benign blood
baths and that they would become
outraged over the nefarious blood bath
and in fact in the case of the nefarious
blood bath it would invent all sorts of
fantasies and so on and so forth to make
them look even worse than they were that
was the prediction and we gave a bunch
of cases and we showed that I think we
tried the show and I think did show that
the predictions were correct now there's
actually another prediction that comes
out of that model which we didn't make
but it's implicit if you think about it
and that has to do with the way that
this exposure will be responded to what
you'd predict if you think it through is
that our discussion of the constructive
blood baths would be ignored because to
reveal the fact that the media welcomed
huge blood baths as they did would not
be very conducive to the interests of
power or to the media it would also
expose the fraud about the the apparent
anger over a nefarious bloodfest it
expect the constructive blood bath to be
ignored as far as the benign blood baths
are concerned you might expect an
occasional statement since it's well I
mean the fact that the media ignored the
benign blood bath doesn't show - you
know such terrible things it doesn't
least they didn't applaud them and as
long as you can exclude the role of the
United States and being involved in them
not terrible maybe a few odd comments
with regard to the nefarious blood best
what you'd expect is fury and venom over
the fact that the media that the
fabrications over bloodbath of the enemy
were exposed
fraud and that's important and that can
be used it can be used in fact to defame
the critics see if you show that people
are lying about the crimes of official
enemies that you can easily distort that
into a defense of those crimes right
like okay now what happened well let me
take two cases which were very close to
cases that we were that we discussed
were the slaughter and timur from 1975
to 1979 and the slaughter in cambodia
from that in the same years 1975 to 79
and we compared those two cases the one
in timor we call the benign blood that
the United States didn't care much one
way or the other so hundreds of
thousands of T Marie's get killed it's
not very interesting the case in
Cambodia was of course in nefarious
bloodbath that was the bad guys doing it
and we gave a very detailed account of
what evidence was available about these
two they're in the same area of the
world the same years the same timeframe
the evidence available was comparable
these the slaughters were apparently
comparable in scale the one in Timor was
considerably greater relative to the
population but probably roughly
comparable in scale the difference was
that in Cambodia it was carried out by
the enemy Paul Pott whereas in Timor it
was carried out by a friend Indonesia
and furthermore it was carried out by
Indonesia with American arms which were
provided by the Carter Administration
which were expand these as the arms flow
was expanded by the Carter
Administration as the atrocities
increased well how did the media deal
with this first fact number one we went
through this in detail the media dealt
with the Timor blood deaths by
suppressing there was considerable
coverage of Timor believe it or not in
1974 and 75 this was all in the context
of the breakup of the Portuguese Empire
in as the as Indonesia attacked teamwork
and the massacre started with us support
coverage began to drop when the massacre
hit its peak in 1978 and it was really
approaching genocide with it with
increasing the u.s. support coverage
dropped to zero literally zero
that's the way they dealt with the team
were massacred what about the Cambodia
massacre
well within weeks after the Khmer Rouge
took power they were already being
accused of genocide by the New York
Times about a year later they were being
accused of carrying out Auto genocide
and of having murdered 2 million people
in fact even if having boasted of having
murdered 2 million people that became
the conventional line there then came a
huge outcry ranging from The Reader's
Digest and TV Guide over to the New York
Review of Books and including just about
everything in between
vast outcry of outrage over the
communist monsters who were carrying out
this horrifying bloodbath and so on and
so forth
interestingly in all of it there was
tremendous amount of fabrication just
plain fabrication of evidence for
example that just give you one example
take this 2 million boast of 2 million
killed you know that that's what
everybody's heard you ask people how
many people had Pol Pot killed by say
1977 they'll say two million here's
where it comes from
in that there was a book published by a
French priest Tom swap on show us his
name who's from Cambodia he wasn't there
then but he knew that Cambodia he
published a book in French the book was
of course not available in English it
was in French it was reviewed by a
French journalist journalist named
Jacques de toros revered in France that
review was immediately picked up and
translated in the United States appear
in the New York Review of Books
it's a fastest translation of a review
of a French book that's ever appeared
but in in the review lecturer said this
he said according to Pancho the Khmer
Rouge boast of having murdered two
million people Auto genocide horrifying
and so on he gave a whole bunch of
quotes from the book about the
horrifying things the Khmer Rouge said
and so on and so forth that was
immediately picked up by the rest of the
media it was all over the place you know
newspaper articles oh my god what
they're doing and so on and so forth
well I was curious at the time because
that didn't you know I didn't hadn't
seen the evidence about that I just want
to know what was going on so I the book
was unavailable so I wrote to friends in
France and asked them to send it to me
and I got the book and I probably was
the only person in the United States who
would read it
although it was being quoted all over
the place on the base of this review and
I quickly discovered that the whole
review was a total fraud whatever was
going on in Cambodia that's not what the
book said the book didn't say anything
about a boast of two million people the
quotes that were given in the review
either didn't appear in the book or they
were you maybe you can sort of figure
out what they were from you know there's
some wording a little bit like them but
they were grossly distorted and some of
them didn't even weren't even close from
the Khmer Rouge they were quotes from
Thai and so on
but in fact every factual statement and
the in the review was just totally false
here's the way the two million figure
came upon show in the book says that
about 800,000 people were killed in the
American war 70 to 75 meaning primarily
by American bombing and the word that
the United States ran from 70 to 75
that's 800,000 people he then said that
according to the American Embassy in
Bangkok
1.2 million had died not being killed
since the war was over
well lectura during the review just
added those two numbers together call
them the Khmer Rouge killings and then
added the boast for a good effect uh
well that's that's where that figure
comes from anyhow after I read the book
I read let her to like come to her and I
said who I know and I told him look I
don't know what the facts are about
Cambodia but the relation between your
review and the book is zilch and I think
you ought to correct it because your
review is being quoted all over the
place well he actually published
Corrections in the New York Review
you know I said yeah it made a couple of
mistakes he said well maybe the number
killed wasn't 2 million maybe it was
just in the thousands he said there's a
slight difference you know a factor of a
thousand difference but he said really
doesn't matter you know it's terrible
anyway and with and so on well after his
Corrections appeared they were dismissed
and people kept repeating the 2 million
figure that he invented almost half of
which was attributed to the American War
notice well that's one example but it's
just typical if you read our chapter on
this you'll see a level of fabrication
which you know is mind-boggling I mean
it's just mind-boggling now this had
nothing to do with the fact of course
there was a massacre in fact as we
pointed out the massacre was probably
comparable to the
in Cambodia which was a huge didn't
teamwork which is a huge massacre we
also pointed out that of all the
evidence available there was one part
that was being suppressed systematically
by the American press interestingly that
part was the information given by State
Department intelligence now the State
Department Cambodia Watchers you know
State Department intelligence they were
the only people with any evidence about
what was going on in Cambodia and they
apparently had pretty good intelligence
they claimed to be able to even pick up
radio transmissions and all sorts of
stuff and they were giving a totally
different story
they said that what was going on that
there was you know big slaughter but
they said it was in the tens or hundreds
of thousands and it was not mass
genocide but it was rather mostly harsh
conditions and you know brutality and so
on that was the position of the only
people who knew anything and that was
systematically excluded it was just the
wrong picture you know it wasn't bloody
enough for the purposes well we went
through all of this stuff the
suppression of the Timor massacre the
vast amount of lying about the Cambodia
massacres and we gave that as an example
of treatment of paired massacres where
they were both treated now here's the
one place where the book was not ignored
what we said about constructive
bloodbath
totally ignored what we said about Timor
almost totally ignore it to the extent
that was mentioned the u.s. role was
excluded what we said about Cambodia
however that elicited a huge new outrage
over the fact that we were defending
Paul Pott well we were defending Pol Pot
by saying that he was carrying out a
slaughter comparable to the major
slaughter that the United States was
backing in Indonesia and pointing out
that in fact that was the picture given
by American intelligence of the only
people knew anything about it
and then talking about the way this was
distorted in the interests of the
propaganda system but that didn't matter
here this said what we were doing was
challenging the right to lie in the
service of the state and that's a very
important right to maintain so therefore
the standard view is and you can read
this all over the place now is that we
argue fits me for some reason or they
decide it's me but we were defending Pol
Pot and you know sort of apologists for
Pol Pot you take
back and you'll see that we started we
described it as a major massacre was it
a lot it's uncertain you know and then
just describe the facts as they were and
compared them with the media
fabrications and you're not allowed to
do that and not allowed to expose media
fabrications and the reason why that was
discussed the one part of the book that
isn't virtually nothing about teamwork
ever is discussed the reason why that
one heart is discussed is because that
can be used by further lies to defame
and undermine critics so therefore
that's done well that's the more subtle
way in which the propaganda system works
I should say incidentally that some of
this stuff is really kind of amusing
those of you read this stuff will have
seen it William Shawcross wrote a book a
little after that in which he claimed
the quality of Mercy it's called very
favorably reviewed all over the press
everybody fell in love with it in the
book he claims that there was silence
over the Pol Pot atrocities and then he
asked a question how could this happen
you know it's called Holocaust in the
modern conscience well first of all was
there silence over the Pol Pot atrocity
no there was a vast uproar over the Pol
Pot atrocities that started a couple of
weeks after it at the time when they
were being accused of genocide they had
probably killed a couple of thousand
people at the most within a year as I
said it was being everywhere from TV
Guide and The Reader's Digest over the
New York Review and then it went on like
that a huge amount of huge chorus of
protests further worth tons of
fabrication but it's it's flattering to
say these if it's it's useful it's
serviceable to say there was silence why
is it serviceable because if he can
claim that there was silence then you
can raise the profound question of why
the West was silent over this Massacre
and that means from now on we must be
even more diligent in exposing the
crimes of official enemies to overcome
the fact that we were silent this time
so immediately Shawcross has quoted all
over the place and every newspaper is
saying oh my god you were silent how
could we have been silent and so on then
Shawcross goes on to explain the silence
you take a look at his book he explains
the silence first this was in The
Washington Post and in his book he says
the reason for the silence is the
primary reason for the silence is this
is the skepticism of the left primarily
me so in other words by
scepticism I silenced all the us all the
Western media and governments it's a lot
of power furthermore this and remember
what that skepticism was it was a
skepticism about documented lies
furthermore he then he then then he
cites an alleged statement in a footnote
he doesn't date it or identify the
source there's two good reasons for that
one is that the citation is fabricated
the other is that the source to the
extent that there's a source it's in a
book it's in exactly this book which
appeared which went to press after the
fall of Paul Pott and came out almost a
year after the fall fall fall of Paul
put's so what he's claiming is that in a
book that appeared the winter press
after Paul Pott was overthrown and that
appeared almost a year after in that
book we succeeded retrospective
retrospectively in silencing the entire
Western media and governments for four
years well that's you know not only were
we powerful enough to scare the entire
West into silence but we even could do
it by magic you know now that was quoted
that was quoted all over the place with
great awe the point is there is no
absurdity so extreme that it won't be
quoted with respect if it's useful and
here it's useful for several purposes
one to protect the right to lie in the
service of the state to to undermine and
defame critics who you can't answer and
three to claim that we didn't look hard
enough we were silent over this atrocity
well there was an atrocity that the West
was silent over it's the one we
documented team work and they were
silent over it because the West was
doing it and therefore you're silent
over it that's the real a you know
question of Holocaust and the modern
conscience but nobody will discuss that
one well these are all examples of more
subtle ways of controlling thought more
subtle and complex that's the aftermath
I had in mind it's a very interesting
story we review it in manufacturing
consent who's next who's next I lost
track
perfect if I can interrupt just
momentarily here
what would you say one or two more
questions why don't we make one more
round okay three more questions I would
like to mention however as you can
imagine a lot of people have handed us
each of us announcements I'm just going
to make it sort of a blanket statement
the point is that there's an enormous
amount of community activism taking
place in Madison various groups have a
lot of activities going on during this
week and beyond ongoing work for
instance just as an example the sister
state project has a book out called
friends indeed Noam Chomsky wrote that
sister city projects are one of the many
ways in which US citizens have opposed a
policy of violence and destruction and
have acted constructively for peace
justice and a better life for the people
of Central America about about this book
friends indeed which is available
incidentally at the two bookstores in
the lobby I do urge everybody here
tonight to to check out the people who
set up displays out in the lobby and to
check out the kind of community action
that's taking place in Madison it is in
fact contrary to a lot of moaning about
the apathy of the student population and
the community at large a very active
solidarity community here in Madison so
three more questions and then I think
we're up there where are we there okay
there there and there and I think people
here probably know that Wisconsin and
Nicaragua and sister states for 25 years
and the Wisconsin Coordinating Council
on Nicaragua has led in transforming
what was originally a symbolic
relationship to vital tool
and we've just published the book as
we'll just mentioned called friends
indeed the story of us Nicaragua Sister
Cities which is about that over 100 u.s.
nicaragua sister cities that have formed
since the revolution one of my question
is has to do with that movement and some
of your insights on it because I think
that recently the popular opposition to
the war in Nicaragua has fallen out of
the major news media it's been
identified I think as a non-issue and
that kind of effect of the of the media
has a very fragmenting effect on
movements for social change and
wonderful I think that Sister Cities is
one way that we can begin to
institutional I think you're you're
quite right the coverage of Nicaragua
altogether has dropped very
significantly and I assume that that's
as usual on command the New York Times
in fact removed its bureau chief Stephen
Kinzer and and if you look at coverage
is in fact dropped very fast well I
think that's connected with US policy
there is a shift in policy after the
Reagan period and here you have to look
back a little bit back as far as back as
1980s there has been a debate over
Nicaragua like over Vietnam the debate
is how you strangle and destroy
Nicaragua now the Hawks say you do it by
terror and violence the Dove say you do
it by what are now called kinder gentler
methods you do it by economic
strangulation you know by maintaining a
low-level terrorist force by mobilizing
on the border so they can't the mobilize
and turn resources to reconstruction
from the destruction and so on that's
that's the other way and by 1986 about
80 percent of those who are identified
as leaders in the polls
that means elites basically you know
managers executives political figures
those guys but 80% of them were opposed
to the Contras they thought that the
terror upper Sioux by the Reagan
administration was just stupid stupid
for a number of reasons one is it was
stirring up protests at home you know
overt violence does have a way of
stirring up protests among these
unwashed masses who don't like you know
murdering children and you know raping
women and cutting people's heads off and
so on there's all these unreconstructed
people and they get annoyed by that kind
of stuff so you stir up disruption at
home when you have when you direct your
terrorist army to attack defenseless
targets soft targets as they were called
as the US terrorists were doing at that
time openly in fact it wasn't a secret
so that stirs up too much protest so a
dome also it makes the United States
look bad internationally I mean the
United States there's no vert file asian
of the World Court decision then you
know it doesn't look good in our
international relations and so on and
finally it's kind of useless I mean
there are much better ways to strangle
and destroy a tiny country which for all
kinds of obvious historical reasons is
totally dependent on its relations with
the United States for survival you can
just do it in smarter quieter ways now
that was the major you know that was the
dominant position among elites
by already by 1986 now the Reagan
administration is not off the spectrum
of American opinion but at an extreme
it's in an extreme position on the
spectrum it's extreme I mean the people
around Reagan were people who were
deeply committed to violence for its own
sake I mean it's as if you kind of like
torture in itself rather than using it
as an end for some you know as a tool
for some other purpose well that's kind
of counterproductive and rational people
don't do that you use torture when you
need it but it's not an end in itself
there's no gain in itself to torture
inflicting pain and terror and so on and
their conclusion sort of a rational
conclusion was it's just not useful it's
bad it's stirring up protests and so on
and so forth so the more rational thing
to do is the policy that the Bush
administration is now turning to I think
that policy is here's what it looks like
to me maintain the economic
strangulation which incidentally is also
unlawful I mean we talked about the or
we should talk about the World Court
having condemned the Contra attack it
also condemned
the economic warfare as illegal illegal
violation of treaties again this is
never recorded but that was the World
Court decision the violation of treaties
involved the embargo is unlawful it's
also a criminal act and the World Court
demanded be terminated but the point is
you can assume that nobody's going to
talk about that so you continue the
strangulation keep the Contras keep the
interesting that the United States was
with all the huge amount of resources
that were poured into maintaining a
mercenary force inside Nicaragua they
were unable to do it that's a pretty
remarkable fact there is no guerrilla
movement in history that had a fraction
of the support that the Contras had it's
just unimaginable I mean they were they
were getting three supply flights a day
just to keep them going they were armed
at a level you know they were better on
than the Santana star me they were
better armed than units of the American
army in fact that's actually true they
had advanced communication equipment in
the field which allowed them to get
information from US surveillance flights
it's always under surveillance the
country right you know high-tech
aircraft which could give them
information on the actual disposition of
the Sandinista forces so that they could
attack defenseless targets with impunity
and carry out terror there in accordance
with them with the orders of the State
Department it's not secret incidentally
now you know that kind of level of
support is just no guerilla army in
history that could dream of anything
like that with all of that stuff they
couldn't keep him in the field
the minute the level of support began to
drop they all broke for the border the
contrast to El Salvador is fantastic if
you bother to look at it you know I'll
solve it or you had an indigenous
guerrilla force no support from outside
as far as anybody knows they were their
arms were mostly gotten from the
Salvadoran army or purchased
internationally so they're using
American arms like you know they're
using m16s and so I just decide remark
for the first time now the guerrillas in
El Salvador are apparently being aided
by Nicaraguans so Elliott Abrams can
finally be happy what's happening is
that as the Contras broke for the border
and went across because you know the
game was over they'd figure
they began to sell their arms to corrupt
Honduran army officials who were selling
them off to the Salvadoran guerrillas so
for the first time the Salvadoran
guerrillas are beginning to show up with
Soviet arms ak-47s and so on and so
forth and the reason is that those are
the arms of the CIA supplied to the
Contras yeah so instead of having just
m16s like they used to have you know
American arms they got from the
Salvadoran army they now got Soviet arms
sent to them by sent by the CIA to the
Contras and now sold off to the
Hondurans are selling them off to
Salvadoran gorillas so there is finally
aid from Nicaragua El Salvador like
they've been claiming all along
instantly this here's another side
remarks I'm sorry but this information
comes from a very good source so good in
fact that the press
totally censored this information comes
from the head of contra intelligence who
defected in Honduras went to Mexico was
widely interviewed in the Mexican press
his name is Horatio RC like most of the
Contras he hasn't normed the gear you
know pseudonym
his pseudonym was mercenary mercenary oh
you know they don't kid around when
they're I mean for the American press
they know who they are
he was the chief of contra intelligence
he was the guy who became chief of
intelligence in 1985 replacing a man
named ricardo lau who was beginning to
be an embarrassment because it was
beginning to be pretty obvious that he
was involved in terrorist activities
throughout Central America including
probably the murder of Archbishop Romero
who's identified by a chief of
Salvadoran intelligence and defected as
having been involved in that this guy
was getting to be an embarrassment so he
disappeared he was probably killed and
they needed a new chief of intelligence
and this guy came in well he's been
chief of intelligence since 1985 he
defected last November it's the most
important defector yet far more
important than you know the defectors
would get huge publicity when they come
from Nicaragua with all kind of
fabricated stories
this guy was ignored he had totally the
wrong stories you know he was telling
about how they were advised you know
they were directed he was told for
example about how he was
illegally in Elgin Air Force Base some
Florida or someplace like that
we was flown in illegally of course
trained in the United States by you know
Green Berets and 82nd airborne and so on
and so forth he talked about he
identified people in the American
Embassy by name in Honduras who were
posing as a deficiency IA and were you
know giving tactical advice and support
to the Contras he mentioned their names
he described the way the Honduran army
the Honduran military is directly
involved in contra military activities
in Nicaragua both by intelligence and
participation and so on he went through
all he described how they were how their
task was to attack defenseless targets
for the purpose of ensuring that
Nicaragua cannot carry out social reform
describes this and all sorts of stuff
which is just useless and he also
describes what I just said how the
Contras now that they've broken for the
borders are selling their arms to the
Salvadoran guerrillas well you know all
of this stuff is news and in fact
important news in fact so and from a
very good source so important that as
far as I know there's no word about it
in the American press you might look and
check and see well that was kind of a
digression
so the Salvadoran coming back the
Salvadoran guerrillas have had no
support from outside as far as anybody
knows they're indigenous to the country
they're facing a military force which on
paper at least is the most powerful in
the region much more powerful on paper
than the army of Nicaragua and they're
somehow any radical in contrast the
Contras who involved all sorts of
mercenaries including Nicaraguans
Hondurans who are bribed Honduran
peasants are bribed with with big bribes
by their standards like $500 that's a
couple of years in come to join all
sorts of things huge amount of support
you know a tremendously high level of
military equipment and so on they just
can't keep him in the country I mean I
think he could keep a guerrilla force in
the United States with that kind of
support I'm not kidding I think you
could probably maintain a guerrilla
force in the mountains of Kentucky with
the kind of force
that was that with the with this support
that was given to the countries they
couldn't keep them there there's a
lesson in all of this there's an obvious
lesson in this comparison so obvious
that nobody in the press is ever going
to draw it because it's the wrong lesson
you can figure it out so I won't draw it
well all right so what is the back to
the Bush administration plans I assume
that they can maintain a low level
terrorist force inside Nicaragua it's
inconceivable that they can't do that
so probably they'll keep you know that
that's why I think it's one of the
reasons I think those reports about the
illegal contra 4 mil Salvador are
probably accurate apart from the fact
that the sources were accurate in the
past presumably the Bush administration
will keep some low level of support for
mercenaries and terrorists inside
Nicaragua they assume that the level
will be so low that the co-operative
press will be silent about it as they've
been so far and that's important because
that means Nicaragua can't be mobilized
and it's important to keep them
mobilized for one thing because when you
mobilize the society is repressive just
like the United States during World War
two which was virtually totalitarian and
if they're repressive you can use that
for propaganda so you can get you know
the Nieman fellows to cry about
repression and so on in the manner that
I described so you want to do that you
want to keep them repressive you want to
keep them mobilized you want to make
sure that they can't divert their
extremely limited resources to
reconstruction from this fantastic
damage second thing the United States
will try to do if Congress and the press
goes along they will do is maintain a
contra force on the Honduran border
that's what all this humanitarian aid
nonsense is about you want to maintain
the force on the border and violation of
everything as I pointed out and the
reason again is you maintain a threat as
long as you maintain a military threat
you can ensure that the government won't
be mobilized okay and that's important
because we want them to suffer but of
course that's less at a lower level than
terror you know the idea is precisely
get back your point yeah also you
continue the economic warfare and the
pressure international lending
institutions you intimidate the allies
so they won't give made and so on all of
this was abetted incidentally by the
hurricane the hurricane was a
devastating blow close to a billion
dollars in damage
the united states of course doesn't give
him a penny in fact they love it you
know they're gloating over it the the
other allies the US allies are giving
them a pittance like Canada and West
Europe are giving them virtually nothing
partly because they're intimidated by
Big Brother and partly because there are
a lot more colonized than they'd like to
believe you know they like to believe
they're all independent and free
thinkers and so on mostly the European
intellectuals believe every bit of
nonsense they read from the American
press the amount of cultural
colonization is very high though they
don't they're not aware of it
so it's so you know they're all upset of
that send initiative repression although
the repression in El Salvador in
Guatemala which is a thousand times
worse that doesn't bother them at all so
they keep giving them aid so there's
that and you know this combination of
operations it is assumed will prevent
Nicaragua from recovering and after all
that's the point
the point is to prevent what Tomas poor
Tomas pork I had it right on that nose
you got to prevent them from
constructing a society that works
because if they do others are going to
emulate it and pretty soon US
combination of the region is gonna you
Road and besides that kind of rot can
spread to other places where people have
similar problems and decide to use their
resources for their own ends and so on
you get real trouble so you got to
prevent it from working and the United
States certainly has the means to do
that
short of the Reaganite absurdity of just
in you know inflicting pain and terror
for its own sake well that's the kinder
gentler methods and one part of that has
got to be to cut back the coverage you
know part of that is the role of the
media stop recording it so people forget
about it and don't notice it and so on
and the idea is the effect will be
you're quiet the domestic dissent you'll
return the public to apathy and
obedience by stopped by not reporting
this stuff anymore so I think your point
is precisely accurate the role of the
media in this system is precisely to
keep quiet about what's going on and I
expect we will find less coverage I mean
you know you'll find coverage when you
can you know you can find something
you'll call sandanista oppression or
when you if there's mass starvation as
there may well be because of the hurry
that'll be covered and it'll be
attributed to sending us the
incompetence nor mismanagement or
something so that kind of thing will be
covered or here's another thing that
will be covered the next big move it's
already been announced is for the
Contras to demand that they've asked for
ten million dollars to establish an
independent television station in
Nicaragua well if if Nicaragua allows
what it was called an independent
television station that means it's
telling the United States you take over
our television there is no way in the
world in which a small country can
compete with the United States and
television IMAX is out of the question
you know I mean if Nicaragua continues
to do what most countries do and have
state television if then of course they
can be noun status totalitarian notice
we don't denounce Israel as being
totalitarian because it has only state
television but that's the usual
dichotomy so the idea is now we demand
that Nicaragua having a television
station run by the United States with a
beginning capital of ten million dollars
which bite how many Nicaraguan standards
is you don't even have discuss it it's
you know it's off the wall I mean the
United States already dominates the
media in much of the country much of the
media the only thing you hear is us
radio from powerful radio transmitters
in Honduras and Costa Rica and even
television if they can if the United
States can put a television station
right in Managua with all the resources
the United States can pour into it and
they just you know that's the propaganda
agency for all of Nicaragua so that's
the next thing and the media will be all
excited about this and that'll be the
test of freedom you know they're only
free if they allow the total
communication system to be run by the
United States otherwise they're
totalitarians that'll be the next line
that comes along and there'll be that
kind of coverage but no coverage about
what's going on that's got a decline
precisely so that the American movement
will decline and people will go back to
the passivity and obedience that becomes
them as I said so I think your point is
quite accurate and the question as usual
is whether the American population is
gonna let them get away with it you know
that's the device we don't forget it
work
oh excuse me I'm sorry I'm gonna have to
play the heavy certainly one more but we
do have we have a time constraint on the
theatres that we have to abide by okay
colleges for that but we're not at least
we're not going to have the third
question in the round sorry I talk too
long
Bravo mr. Chomsky very great this is
about the UN I don't get information
from the New York Times in the ABC NBC
all of the news when I want information
I go to the specialized agencies of the
UN and there you can find no where did
they know that the population of the
world was 5 billion that UN got that
information information on the
radioactivity of the air and so forth
they have a vast amount of information
they also had information about cesium
in milk products which were going to
highly populated areas Boston in New
York for two years the UN had this
information citizens groups badgered the
media to bring this information it is
never there but at the UN we were able
to get that information so what we did
is we wrote a proposal which was
presented to the General Assembly
because we felt that we as parents have
a right to vital information about the
food and the water in the air and the UN
has that information and it just sits
there so we wrote this proposal calling
for a two-way global information service
we presented it to the General Assembly
very well in 87 at the international
conference on the relationship between
disarmament and development it was a
very important conference it received
very good support the year later we try
to present the proposal again this time
we had gained the support of the Swedish
government the Australian Government and
Costa Rica there was a violent violent
opposition to the proposal to the point
where two ambassadors were told that
they would be terminated if they in any
way support in any proposal asking for a
global information service now in
September the UN is meeting again and
we're going to try to push the proposal
we were shocked by the opposition that
this proposal got because after all it's
a very modest proposal we're just asking
for vital information and we tried to
get anyway it's terrible the opposition
so we're going to present the proposal
again in September do you have any ideas
on strategy was that a question or a
statement well it wasn't a question so I
don't have to answer but let me just say
in response to the non question that I
actually have a book coming out I like
these phrases like manufacturer of
consent the necessary illusions and so
on they're too good to let drop so I
have another book coming out called
necessary illusions
thanks to Reinhold Niebuhr and in it one
of the things it's more of this kind of
stuff one of the things that discusses
the coverage of the UN and it's
extremely interesting it's not that the
UN has never covered whenever the UN
passes a resolution denouncing the
Russians for the invasion of Afghanistan
big story you know if the UN condemns
the United States for a violation of
international law there's no story and
the coverage is extremely interesting
when you look closely acts for those of
you were there this afternoon I
mentioned one example the Terrorism
thing which is very important but let me
take one case which is illustrative of
the kind of thing you're talking about
at that same UN session in 1987 there
was a big series of disarmament
resolutions and they were very
interesting because they came out right
at the time that Ronald Reagan was being
hailed in the front pages as a
peacemaker
that was the summit in Washington
December 1987 summit in Washington
Reagan the Peace May
you know very excited and so on well
right at that time the UN passed a
series of disarmament resolutions here's
what they were there was a resolution
opposing militarization of outer space
star wars 154 to 1 no abstentions you
never get a vote like that in the UN you
can guess who the one was a vote against
a vote in favor of a opposed to the
development of new weapons of mass
destruction hyerin i think 135 - to the
united states picked up france on that
one vote for a comprehensive test-ban
which is instantly supported by that 75%
of the American population the vote on
that was like 140 to 3 something like
that France and England we picked up on
that one and that's that's the way the
resolutions were well they were not
reported because that just wouldn't fit
with the idea of the United Way and the
peacemaker
on the only and other things were
reported like for example the resolution
condemning the Russians in Afghanistan
big story on that and there's a lot of
coverage of the UN but this is the way
it was now this has been going on over
the years for many years you go back to
the 1940s in the early 1950s and the UN
was everybody's darling tremendous
coverage of the UN it was marvelous it
was magnificent and the reason was that
our let's say the correlation is I
assume the reason that at that point the
United States had an automatic majority
in the UN
anything the United States proposed the
UN voted that just had to do with the
relations of power at the time the
Russians were obnoxious they kept
vetoing things and there were all you
take a look back at the discussion at
that time leading American scholars you
know anthropologists and so on had all
kind of deep theories about why the
Russians are vetoing everything at the
UN the I was a graduate student at the
time and you know we said make fun of
the three or four of us and who sort of
thought this was idiotic made fun of
this one of the main proposals which
came from people like Margaret Mead and
others was that the reason the Russians
were so negative and obnoxious at the UN
was because they raise their children in
swaddling clothes and that makes them
negative and then when they get up at
the UN they
say no no the diaper ology is what we
called it anyhow that was the big you
know profound theory well over the years
the thing has changed you know by now
the United States is isolated at the UN
the United States vetoes everything we
veto way more resolutions anybody else
these the votes that just reported are
not untypical you know so what happened
well it turns out that the UN has lost
its moral authority you find articles
like New York Times magazine had a big
story about why the world is out of step
literally you know how come the whole
world is against the United States
what's wrong with them I mean it's not
that we raise our babies wrong you know
it's the day the rest of the world is
doing something wrong and then comes
with profound analysis of why the world
is out of step and you know what's the
matter with the world culture and so on
and so forth
and the UN has lost its moral authority
the United States doesn't pay dues
anymore you know report it and now the
UN is a you know as obnoxious because
they're not following orders well you
know that's that's a dramatic example of
how the media fall in line and what
you're talking about is another case of
it and again as you just the way you're
doing the reason you're getting such
outrage reaction is that implicitly at
least you're exposing all of this and
that's no good so therefore the outrage
reaction which is just all the more
reason to keep doing
