I just read .. about two weeks ago .. 
One of the most terrifying books I've read 
Written by Douglas Blackman 
Entitled: Slavery under another name 
It is the first detailed discussion 
It is not the general story, but rather the first truly detailed discussion of what happened after the age of reconstruction in America 
There is a short period after the Civil War when blacks were allowed to vote to choose their representatives 
Things seemed to be going for the better. 
But the reconstruction ended in 1877 
and then.. 
In the south ... and in cooperation with the north ... 
They re-imposed a new order 
It was much worse than slavery 
Basically it was 
Black prison system 
A legal system that criminalizes life for blacks 
Prevent loitering .. talking out loud .. looking at a white woman .. 
They were arresting people 
They take them to prison .. and stay there for life 
This is what generated the Industrial Revolution 
Steel factories .. And so on .. 
In terrible conditions ... much worse than slavery 
And for good reasons..for the slave masters they are the capital and they have to take care of them .. 
But here it is different, they are nothing .. just shopping them to prisons 
The description is terrible ... and it continued until World War II 
During WWII and beyond, a short change occurred 
Economic growth ... and the need for skilled workers 
So there was some kind of space for the black man to go out and work 
And maybe get home 
Although the book does not mention that .. 
But if you think about it 
That period ended in 1970 
When the country headed towards the economy of "money" 
Nothing remains for those like poor immigrants 
For example, my father was an immigrant 
At the beginning of the twentieth century, the economy was growing. She worked in a candy store. 
Then your son enters college ... and so on. 
This case is over .. 
What is happening instead is that the blacks are thrown back to prison 
Prison returned to the scene, and you know what is happening now 
Since the 1980s, the number of black prisoners has increased more than any other country 
It has absolutely nothing to do with crime 
So I looked at all the history 
slavery 
The post-reconstruction phase is worse than slavery 
Then the Second World War 
pickup window.. 
It was not pretty..but at least there was something 
Then back to slavery again and hard work in prison 
This is the history of blacks in America for centuries 
In any case, unfortunately, Professor Harvard was arrested 
But .. you have to compare the two cases ... 
The book .. by a Wall Street editor 
It is not .. 
But the whole picture and what it means .. disappeared 
Now the picture is different 
Today a beer party .. 
There is a black head 
Everything is over 
And we moved to a post-ethnic society 
Oh really?! Take a look at the past and the present 
It's closing the car industry ... that's what is happening 
It is basically .. 
Driving upside down .. closing a small window 
There is a vacancy .. for .. 
Condoleezza Rice 
Barack Obama.. 
Black middle class
