I'll turn the camera around instead of
watching my beautiful fat face me just
show you that they're about 500 or more
people in a room and we turned a lot of
people away we're sitting at the
University of Iceland just in a cinema
in the middle of this document is
regardless feature and documentary film
festival and we really want to thank you
for agreeing to appear here for this
next hour or so they just announced that
you will be coming here live to accept I
guess an honorary degree or something
next year so that's going to be a great
opportunity I think to foment some
thought and maybe some action and
resistance simultaneously with this
video conference right now that in the
parliament just down the hill they're
essentially condemning or suggesting
that for ministers of the government the
former ministers be he held accountable
for the connection in action or
disasters action
lost in cyberspace
you
there he is again we can do 10 it's the
mind joke anyway I have about three or
four questions i know i said you an
email earlier i don't know if you got to
consider it much for the next half an
hour or so go through a few of those we
just had a finished of a panel with some
activists and direct action activists
and environmentalists and academics
talking whether to things such as
economy and academic freedom and some
issues and we're going to continue that
after you I've been with us but i don't
know maybe we'll just start with the
general rubric really an inspirational
web writing you've been doing lately I'm
just finished reading the hopes and
prospects and there's some very good
examples that you are citing their come
of it and we will talk under facility
general premise that we want to look for
solutions at hope in the economic
meltdown that was evident here so let me
just get to that quickly and I think all
the technology is working and I just a
few more formal questions and in in
light of the kind of near collapse of
the Western economic system where can
citizens of generally I guess in your
country mine in Canada and here find
hope of what alternatives do you think
we should be building what can I sland
and Icelandic people learn
from what's happened they were here in
force in the streets of sight Parliament
for early part of last year and the
government did resign here it seems like
that story has hasn't been told in any
way a dominant media of North America or
Europe as a kind of good example for
what can happen what lessons going to
take from that were what we do engine
rebuilt hope well I fund was kind of an
extreme case of a pathology that spread
in the United States and much of the
much of the industrial West parts of the
world were fairly immune from it East
Asia of others because they just into
along with the doctrines but there were
there was a the since the 1970s
basically there has been a sharp shift
in the nature of the economy in the
United States and also Western Europe
will concentrate on the United States
but it's not much different elsewhere
there's been a shift towards sharply
increasing the role of finance in the
economy and correspondingly hollowing
out industrial production on Santa
deceases is just that the same
corporations produced abroad Mexico
China now Vietnam so on these are two
parallel processes the share of
corporate of corporate profits by
financial institutions as zoom since the
1970s from few percent
today I mean when a manufacturing
section which support any continent
economy has either stagnated or declined
for American workers in fact for the
majority of the American population 20
rooms are you can come real incomes have
essentially stagnated Freeman stagnated
since the 1970s of working hours so
sharply increase of there now well
beyond Europe like beyond Japan benefits
which were never very great have
declined social indicators general
measure of top of society attract
economic growth as you'd expect up until
about nineteen seventy five after that
two curves separated that of economic
recessions slower but there some and
social indicators incline the back to
the level of maybe fifty years ago in
the middle in the heads of this are
repeated financial crisis so there were
actually no financial crises speaker up
until mid seventies the new do
regulations which had been instituted
under extensive popular pressure in the
1930s pretty much controlled financial
speculation in fact the Bretton Woods
system which prevailed until the mid
seventies provided if first of all it
restricted currencies to a pretty narrow
man so there wasn't much currency for
speculation and it also gave our
authorized governments to control
Catalan flow which they use is that kind
of kept things under control then along
the regulatory apparatus from the late
seventies especially through the Arabian
sizer years all of this was dismantled
dismantle even
or under Clinton all under the mythical
theory that we were called the efficient
market hypothesis basically markets work
perfectly visually if you leave him
alone and the rational expectation
serious UN's that people are mounting
rational and their decisions but I've
essentially infinite information some of
the main theorem son mrs. bass assuming
that an individual has attended gradual
choices on the basis of information
about things that are going to happen
indefinitely for in the future all of
this is complete myth that it repeatedly
collapse there have been since be since
the Reagan years repeated financial
crises and not just in the United States
but elsewhere mounting in intensity so
brave there was a big one in 1987 the
Reagan left office your later leaving a
huge crisis savings and loan crisis that
was patched up the Clinton had a kind of
a first period but the base on sand that
was based on a technology bubble which
first around the year 2000 than we go
into the West decade with a huge bubble
in housing somehow economists and the
Federal Reserve and seem to notice that
housing prices that were departing
radically from trend lines that are
essentially a century old well cause it
collapsed as an eight truth housing
alone is an eight trillion dollars lost
in the United
space and for individuals that meant as
much of their savings were gone people
have been able to keep up in comes
during this period of stagnation 30-year
period by a Sunday bite it
I think the director of the was at the
Madison compact package is probably
running okay there you are how's it
going Peggy how much it for back on back
here okay i was just saying probably one
of the board of directors of the local
one of the local banks yours in control
of this information flow or lack of it
but we'll march on okay well whatever
saying is that during this period is
actually neoliberal period of
financialization relying on markets
mythical ideas about market efficiency
and rational rational expectation it
ranks very different heated crises
there's an insight nation of real
incomes for most population and people
have kept going by increasing dead and
by as an inflation that is relying on
bubbles almost reasons is the housing
bowl a trillion dollars of faith wealth
and that's where people put their mind
for safer retirement for college
education to children and so on that's
all gone and as far as the productive
system is concerned in manufacturing in
the United States unemployment is at the
level of the Great Depression 1930s and
the job and are coming back I mean not
under current conditions they're being
shipped abroad and where it's cheaper
you have to worry about environment and
working conditions of so on well for the
population that said that's pretty much
a disaster I mean sun-thurs world little
poverty but it's very severe and the
population is reacting with a lot of
anger and fear and lashing out and
seeking somebody to blame they don't
blame the illegal immigrants
or whatever long with that there's also
a riot of the kind of demagogic extreme
right propaganda which is some pretty
frightening and its character and you
can see why it appeals to people they
want an answer to what's happened to
them and I'm getting any like the
emma-crats are not going to say yeah we
understand your place is because of our
initiatives to financial eyes the
economy and their lunatic commitment to
economic doctrines that have no basis
and that blew up in your face never say
that so they're latching on trees
looking for someone else a little bit
reminiscent of late buy more Germany
when people lost faith in institutions
and the parties of the Parliament and
sought some sort of an explanation and
somebody came along gave it to them and
Hitler the problem is the Jews in the
Bolsheviks and the we can overcome that
and recover our national glory and so on
and well we know what happened then I
don't want to throw it to close an
analogy but there are some similarities
as well all of this is you go back a
little psychotic little bit further that
I don't like to do with just the
existence of markets now the United
States is not a market societies a quasi
market society throughout his whole
history like every other developed
society there's been very substantial
state intervention and state initiative
to sustain and enable the economy to
grow the last half century for example
the IP revolution everyone agrees is an
important
internet satellites and micro
electronics and so on most of that was
done under a government within the state
sector dynamic state sector thyroid
laudatory worm city of MIT which was
right at the center of a pentagon
funding NASA funding and so on in fact
until the mid-1970s the government was
the sole procure of the computers
because they're too expensive for
business to buy that's after first
computers came along the early fifties
that's about no generation of state
support for initiatives to the
development internet was about the
sayings but 35 years before was
privatized well that's always happen but
there is an element of markets in
society in the socio-economic system at
most particularly in the financial
sector the financial sector approximates
a market system more than others
particularly after the deregulation the
elimination of the controls that trace
back to the New Deal look we're slowly
dismantled under Reagan and we're
extremely under the Clinton and in
Hollywood so you get a kind of quasi
market something approximating a market
system and in markets there are some
well-known so-called inefficiencies of
markets in human ones that one of them
is that the participants and transaction
disregard what are called externalities
that is the effects on others so you
sell me a car let's say we may make a
good deal for it for ourselves but we
don't count in the cost to others and
it's real collusion congestion
since all sorts of things and spread
over a lot of people those externalities
can be quite large but you and I don't
take them into account when we exchange
make that exchange well in the financial
system the lack of attention to it to
the extra knowledge ease the cursor one
is what's called systemic risk sort of
suppose goldman sachs make some
transaction it looks out for itself but
it doesn't take into account the
possibility that the transaction that is
making me for example bring the whole
system down it may have a systemic
effect and that's inherent to market
systems and and of course so once you
move more and more towards them you're
going to get more martyrs now there's
only novel is that nothing unknown about
this affected you learn in an elementary
economics courses there were few
economist like Sid Felix junge twill
lands Taylor well-known economist who
kept pointing out that the current
system is they built on sand because
he's ignoring systemic risk which is
going to crash it I which has happened
over and over and just happened recently
in a massive fashion that lies behind
the core vector lies behind the current
crisis that it's now recognized so you
can read in the economics literature
where we have to do something to build
controls over systemic lupus systemic
risks if nothing's be done that those
effects are magnified by perverse
incentives which have to do with the
political power of concentrated
concentrated economic was the financial
power that has led to many government
programs which exacerbates the problem
the one of the main ones now discussed
quite a lot because became so obvious is
the government insurance policy the
corporation financial corporations which
is called too big to fail so for example
as the goldman sachs citigroup or bank
of america that take may take very risky
to make very risky loans investing and
hence make a lot of profit as they can
pretty much ignore the fact that it only
crash house of cards in a crash because
it does the governmental stepped in
because they're too big fail arresting
them that's what happened in fact with
the goldman sachs with the edgy
citigroup and others and it's not for
the first time well that encourages
executives to take risk short-term
profit and not worry too much about the
long-term outcome in effect it's a
system of socialization of costs and
privatization of profit it was the way a
lot of the economy works and say their
other commercial centers like rules that
permit corporate executives to pick the
panels that give them their salaries
that one of the record managerial
salaries in the united states are way
beyond comparable societies like you
Japan's not the thief CEOs or the
managers are any more efficient as that
techniques to raise their own salaries
and that's not small that a managerial
compensation is a large component of
Providence financial organs within other
organizations well over the on top of
that is the fact that built into markets
is the property that you have to pay
attention to short-term gain and this
regard and long-term consequences if you
don't do that your competitor will drive
you out of business so either you pay
attention to short-term gain or you're
out somebody else is in not personal
matter its institutional matter and the
short-term gain means ignoring
longer-term consequences like and also
ignoring externalities and that pays off
in the short-term projects in the highly
payment in the stock options and so on
so all of these factors drive the
economy towards crisis no you know their
ways around critical reintroducing a
regulatory system of the kind that is
limit the attack eliminates the serious
financial crisis for 30 years well okay
that's a not the utopian stab from empty
look different now what it was 70 years
ago but basically similar things
eliminating the government insurance
policy too big to fail that certainly
feasible the big banks which a way to be
could be broken up
government practically honed them at one
point could have instituted changes but
at this point comes the political clout
of concentrated capital Obama for
example is pretty much a creature of the
financial institutions tickle his
hunting in the 2008 election it was
highly concentrated in financial
institutions and the way our politics
works same elsewhere those who
essentially by the hand to divide the
election they expect to be paid off and
they were so Obama's propel steps when
he came into office were firstly he did
was selected as economic advisors of the
people were primarily primary
responsibility for the crisis where I
would Ruben gang Larry Summers Geithner
and others he left out the highly
qualified economist including Nobel
laureates who are critical to this and
they put band-aids on the system in such
a way as to realize guaranteed the next
crisis and nothing fundamental has
changed a few little filling here and
there with the basic problems remain
untouched which said okay let's wait
till the next crisis comes along so the
money was court into that but not into a
little was put into the problem with the
serious problem of the crisis of the
main economy the actual productive
economies or the stimulus had some
effect it was hard too small and the
perverse incentives remain and so on
that's the effect of the take over the
political system by concentrated
economic power type one well-known
economist Simon Johnson who was the
former chief economist of the
International Monetary Fund
having to teach at MIT where I am now
he's simply said the United States
becoming banana republic it's in the
hands of concentration of huge financial
institutions and the political system
essentially has the batter there will
but not as a matter that's a natural law
which is the way the political system
functions in our society so yes another
disaster will come along enough there
are short-term there are narrow remedies
that is imaginable like restoring a
reasonable regulatory system eliminating
the insurance policy insisting on
internalizing external costs making a
paper a lot of things like that are kind
of within the general framework of the
socio-economic system but there are much
more far-reaching moves that I don't
think are entirely out of the question I
think they just kind of below the
surface so let's take a concrete example
Obama essentially took over the US auto
industry that's the mail and then the
government pretty much on to do it of
life well one thing they were doing your
mom administration is continuing the
process of closing down plants of
General Motors plants where when you
close down plant of course that puts the
workers out out of a job but it also
destroys the community and these
communities were mostly built outside of
the wages of the auto workers who were
able to get fairly decent wages because
they
have unions unions since pretty much
been destroyed but during the period
when unions were function the workers
get a fairly decent wages and working
conditions so for example in the 1950s
and the 1960s which was the period of
the greatest economic growth in US
economy and history and sustained growth
other words was also egalitarians so the
lowest quintile that about as well as
the highest quintile and in increased
and that's largely the effective the
Solidarity power created by the labor
tonight well that's very sharply
deteriorated eunice been there very
harsh attacked you much dissolved in the
private sector but you know when the
consequence is that the workforce is
extremely vulnerable but let's just go
back to closing down the GM plants and
destroying the community as well as the
workforce at the very same time that the
obama administration is doing that it is
something Obama was sending his
transportation secretary to Europe and
to Spain to use federal stimulus money
to purchase to the to make contracts
with a Spanish companies to build
high-speed rail facilities in the United
States which the country desperately
needs anyone who's taken a train at its
base it thinks they've gone to the 33rd
world no nothing remotely comparable to
Europe or Japan other industrial
countries and that desperately needs
high-speed rail well that high-speed
rail could be built in those General
Motors plants which are being dismantled
they have skilled workers machinery
would take a little some conversion with
more than that like converting the
military for not ginger and Second World
War was far more radical it would mean
the government have stepped in as it
does constantly in the economy usually
for the benefit of the rich and powerful
but that would be an option and if the
government refuses to do it and
corporations refuse to do what the
workers could take over the factories
and do it themselves and eyes come close
in the 1930s the sit-down strikes which
are what really you know cause the real
fear among industrialists and steal
measures the sit-down strikes are
justice technique or take over a factory
and today it would be with enough
popular sport and organization and that
is raising the consciousness that would
be imaginable that workers in the same
closed MGM plans ok we don't agree to
have it closed down we're going to take
it over we're going to produce the high
speed rail that would take support not a
huge amount but it would be possible and
the same is true else would I mean takes
a green technology I mean it's widely
recognized that the big purse industrial
birth sector of the futures not have to
be green technology that we cannot go on
with an economy based on
wasteful use of fossil fuels the way the
US economy has been designed for 50
years and impossible to go on like that
so green technologies going to be very
important and of course that again takes
some form of social initiative through
government or some other way not happen
you US investors are investing more in
green technology in China then in the
United States and Europe combined and in
parts of Europe Germany and Sweden
Denmark and Spain are well ahead of the
United States and this of the United
banquet or disrespects well that's fine
for for the bank's you know find for the
investors and plenty money is terrible
for the workforce with communities and
for the future and not a law of nature
could be changed with you a radical
change but not one that's out of sight
while we go on but there are a range of
opportunities ranging from short-term
fixes which would make it which are
pretty much within the framework of
existing system which could make a big
difference and the much longer term
social reconstruction which will change
the distribution of power inside the
society permitted the court the general
population organized active to
participate directly in creating and
developing economic solutions and
social changes that will work for the
benefit of the society before I stop but
it ought to say that the environmental
crisis which is huge I mean that's
really a problem of financial crisis
badan on speed patch it up the
environment price is quite vividly
doesn't know the way patching it up
either we want to take it seriously and
do something about it or else we're
bequeathing a catastrophe to our
grandchildren not that to the
environmental crisis too to a large
extent traces back to the existence of
market systems to take the Copenhagen
congregate conference which was a better
capacity for the emerging countries like
China and India argue that they should
not pay the cost of industrialization by
the West they should be permitted to do
with the west of them mother's some
merit to that although it's not very
useful to win the argument that loose
award this was actually invited
conditions for viable existence are lost
within the matter that he won the
argument come on the rich countries can
stick to the United States which pretty
much killed the Copenhagen Congress the
United States the argument is different
it's a market problem the chosen run the
economy like the business sector and
their lobbies chambers of commerce
national program and student so on they
are committed to short-term gain and to
ignoring externalities and in this case
the external externalities happened to
be survival in species he's a survival
species for than that it's pretty much
the same logic to systemic risk or you
nine paying attention to the cost of
others if you sell me car except in this
case externalities happen to be much
hugely consequence but nevertheless it's
built into the institutional structure
that they must disregard it and they're
doing they have enough political power
and media power to prevail so the Obama
administration has done essentially
nothing much less than Europe and done
that much it's a holding back any
serious international approach he said
to this problem one good writer on the
environment george huang bo in England
just had a column a couple of days ago
in which he it was called them
environmental enlightenment goodbye
everything's gone now Kyoto Protocol no
new proposals nothing gone and he says
the court bragging can be expressed as
two words and Barack Obama well that's a
little misleading it's not so much
Barack Obama that is the Masters of the
economy for who he who he faces
representing this morning but liberal
program that already of this nose in
which they were compass on the coop
quarters going in and this technique
said and why pay attention
it's just a hoax biggest hoax of all
human effect on global warming well
that's the result of dedicated
propaganda the media contribute to it so
if you take a look at the standard be in
debate in New York Times this is a base
between two sides one is the consensus
of ninety-eight percent of scientists
and the other side is a few scientists
who don't go along and a couple of
senators site is a third component of
the debate which is never mentioned and
that is the very substantial group of
scientists who say that the
international consensus is just not much
understates the risk well they don't
enter at all but the population stays
this debate and what I supposed to think
they say what science is not what
they're doing canning McCreery among
themselves so we'll just go ahead in
their lives and just give me one
instance of the consequences of that I
mean as you're aware the Republicans are
pretty likely to take over the house and
maybe tennis would part of it their son
analysis of this I think there are 48
Republican senators running for office
of those 48 one of them thinks that
humans global warming I guess and he
lies from the primary Tea Party
extremists do you know how I'd off the
spectrum spectrum so that means a
hundred percent of the Republican
candidates are science rejecters well
the consequences of that for legislation
for popular opinion are pretty awful and
the general consequences for the
it was a powerful country nobody was
going to do anything if the United
States doesn't and tracing in fact that
we're back to one crucial component is
that in market systems those with who
make decisions like the business be
finest they disregard externalities it's
built into the system for powerful
reasons not because they're bad people
but because if they were to take account
of them may be out somebody else will be
in that's the way to market system works
another component is the political
socio-political namely the fact that the
political influence and cloud of
concentrated capital is enormous and it
has been far back as you go Adam Smith
talked about it that's a major fact
about third industrial societies I will
you put these together and you get to UM
major environmental crisis which may
zoom the species is eliminate decent
survival those are the circumstances
that we faced they're not they're not a
mobile and they're not laws of nature
and not even laws of society they're
just particular kinds of institutional
arrangements that have developed over
the years and I can be changed just as
the butyl system to be overcome slavers
would be overcome and oppression of
women could be overcome but it's not
going to happen by itself don't take
hard work I guess seen examples of art
work here but I was looking for hope and
now I'm more depressed
other than the prospect of selling you a
car but I don't want to cart our own a
bicycle and then I love to cart commun
actually in Montreal but and we're to
control a place of places and factories
we saw that in another economic crisis
in Argentina in a way as workers started
to reclaim the empty factories there and
there are kind of geothermal
possibilities here at the same time the
former I guess prime minister who was
responsible for a lot of they mess and
believer in milton friedman and over the
last nine years at least it now seems to
be running the major newspaper here's
the chief editor so the oligopoly I've
kind of no elite group here in Iceland
is called that I think the octopus which
is because I earnable more real octopus
in the in the ocean it's often over fish
but so I don't know maybe in the last
little bit we can't find a sign of hope
I know you you cite Bolivia as a kind of
a example kind of radically the
democracy I don't know if you think the
sound for example there might be
applicable in other other places it
seems to be surviving just despite the
kind of pressures to disrupt it whether
legend know there are a lot of good
things happening in the world not just
in Bolivia South America in general is
for the first time in heaven blame is
moving towards kind of Independence
towards integration or facing some of
these horrible internal problems and
holy Nanak
quite worried about it and stirring to
react that's a positive sign not without
setbacks but quite positive but the same
is true in the industrial takes a the
United States again summer there was a
conference in Detroit of the tens of
thousands of people in the regional
Social Forum in the world social forum
BTW in the south typically many people
come from all over the world but there
is formed regional social forms the type
down below bones and talents which have
roughly the same agenda find them to
more local conditions low in detroit
there was a national rita social forum i
think there were 20,000 people there
went on for days had a lot of
constructive proposals a lot of energy a
lot of involvement that's a positive
development and the media are crated so
that there wasn't a word about it in the
national media i'm in the detroit
immediate couldn't overlook it there are
so many people there's a couple acid
editorials but the national media don't
wanting might know about just like they
don't report the world social forum
interestingly at the very same time the
tea party which is small relatively
affluent not typical of the population
very well funded by the corporations at
the same time they had a meeting of 600
people i think and that's a huge
publicity okay that's the role of the
media they're not there to serve the
population they have a commitment to the
their own owners advertisers and so on
and just departed lee educated
intellectual community that
but what took place it wasn't recorded
is a positive development now there's
quite a lot of it it's scattered it's
unorganized but if he can't people it's
a lot and it's quite different from the
past to go back to say 30 years 40 years
there was not environmental and now it's
substantial not enough to make a policy
difference but to this things take time
question is do we have time in fact I
think they're kind of two trajectories
one is a trajectory that is leading
towards disaster and that's built has
deep roots in existing institutions are
the energy the others a trajectory
that's trying to combat it as increasing
it doesn't have the resources and some
of the organization of course in them
has some alternative median on the major
media but it has people and the question
is which trajectory will dominate and I
think the fate of the species depends on
that so it's not a matter of optimism
pessimism point speculating about it
rather it's a question of commitment
make sure that the right trajectory
prevails and you know just if you have
time for one more i'll just get somebody
in the audience might want we did have a
lot of people write in questions but I
think what I'll do is I'll send them to
you and you can respond or not to those
and/or when you're coming here maybe got
an idea to spawn right now we need to
create a kind of Icelandic social forum
around when you're coming in and go
organize for three days or something huh
and maybe become about to them
and they didn't and it's interesting
when I went out to the place where the
first parliamentary democracy was ever
organized in the year 930 off the plane
very beautiful united nations heritage
site here we should take you out there
may be organized the Social Forum up
there see it because if anybody was
allowed to speak there I was kind of
really kind of direct democracy and
there was a keeper of the law he had to
recite the laws every year new with the
laws were and it was the cultural
preservation thing too so I'll just
propose that violently does anybody have
like a question for no man or have a
mass song if you want yes over there you
can shut it out all of through it throw
it through the line yep I wonder if it
might be a good idea to write that into
the caduceus that you should base your
decisions on science
is that interesting question that
they're going to rewrite the
Constitution here it is probably a good
idea for every nation you have done in
height one ya Yin Iceland I don't know
how that's going to happen it's going to
be like a year ago process that was the
way to do it in Afghanistan I'm not sure
or return to the original parliamentary
idea but he was wondering if you could
write this idea of having a place for
respect for science into the
Constitution as somebody who lives in
MIT in the citizens and as an eminent
philosopher and linguist in the whole
scientific half of your brain there but
i guess the science deniers are a
problem not just climate change maybe
for some tires are a problem but i think
p yes where the science denial comes
from it comes from massive propaganda
and forming the issues in such a way if
it looks as though there's no there's no
understanding and though agreement i
mean if a person off the streets reads
say of the press and discovers that
there's two positions that one of which
is a bunch of scientists who are we
going anywhere anyway who would think
that humans are responsible for global
warming and the other
you know playing a couple of scientists
and some perspective senators and plain
thinking people who say it's all
nonsense so you happen to be listening
to once to rush limbaugh main talk show
host interviewing sarah palin and during
softball question stewart and one of
them was what do you think about climate
change and she just led us she said look
I to win did you see any palm trees
problem people with no background and no
way of working their way through these
issues could find that convincing
assignment which it said it's comforting
I mean to really face reality means
making hard choices if you face the fact
that continuing turn use the card levels
of use of that fossil fuel is gonna make
a choice unlivable to your grandchildren
if you face that fact you're going to be
in a situation we have to do something
about it and what used to do about it
may not be easy actually may be good for
you if you think it through but it's not
easy so it's easier to take the position
well it's all a hoax office go ahead
driving my SUV those are giving factors
also the the general hatred and
skepticism and anger about institutions
has extended the science as well these
if you look at the attitudes towards
commerce I'm in third abysmal you know
large part of the population makes
Congress will be thrown out and people
off the streets would do better
attitudes towards government in general
are they're very
squares very low towards political
parties people the sports where the
Democratic Party is quite low and
interestingly sports with Republican
Party in both even though they're
probably going to win the next election
november and saying generalizes to other
institutions the doctors scientists
across the board is just a sense in the
population of anger and fear and that
they those bad people are doing
something to us that what other
explanation could there be for the fact
for the way our lives are falling apart
that's a dangerous mix and science falls
into it why should we believe the
scientists were they just a bunch of the
elitists from you know harder well i
guess so you have to leave you with a
couple of minutes i want to thank you
for challenging us with some food for
thought and mistaken you and Chloe in
the hopes and prospects I think probably
one of your favorite philosophers that
Bertrand Russell I don't know if it
still haven't they photograph of him on
the wall of your office in that new
officer he and I tried to were warning
us that we had a face a future face the
future intimated eskom us stark and
dreadful and inescapable coming but the
escalation but that choice between kind
of ending the human race or shall we put
it into and renounce war I guess not my
extension not just war but those things
which state is down
our path rather than one which is
supposed democratic to enlightenment
connect with your senses of the word you
have some final thoughts you're going to
save them all for when you're here next
year well I'm going to throw that up I
mean if they're good fit enough time it
would have brought up the fact that you
know the many crises that are around and
the many problems there are two that are
overwhelming because they do affect
decent survival of the species one is
likely environmental catastrophe which
we talked about the other is what a
restful and Einstein that talked about
in there and pesto of 1955 and that was
a nuclear war that problem is still with
us and it's growing it's getting worse
there's a lot to say about it but some
other time you'll be much suspended it's
not a suspension of disbelief but a
suspension of the missus I believe it so
we'd like to thank you what's heaven
like a round of applause
