begin by saying something about
liberalism which is a very complicated
concept I think it's correct
surely that liberalism grew up in the
intellectual environment of the
empiricism and the rejection of
authority and Trust in the evidence of
the senses and so on
however liberalism has undergone a very
complex evolution it has a social
philosophy over the years if we go back
to the classic sort was what I regard as
a classic say for example Humboldt
limits of state action which inspired
Mill and as a true libertarian liberal
classic if like the world that Humboldt
was considering which was partially an
imaginary world but the world for which
he was developing this political
philosophy was a post feudal but pre
capitalist world that it was a work it
was a world in which there is no great
divergence among individuals in the kind
of power that they have and what they
command let's say but there was a
tremendous disparity between individuals
on the one hand in the state on the
other consequently it was the task of a
liberalism that was concerned with human
rights and equality of individuals and
so on it was the task of that liberalism
to dissolve the enormous power of the
state which was such a an authoritarian
threat to individual liberties and from
that you develop a classical liberal
theory and say Humboldt or Mill sense
well of course that is pre capitalist he
couldn't conceive of an era in which a
corporation would be regarded as
individual that's it
or in which such an enormous in which
enormous disparities and control over
resources and production would
distinguish between individuals in a
massive fashion now in that kind of
society to take the Humboldt in view is
a very superficial liberalism because
while opposition to state power in an
era of such divergence conforms to
Humboldt conclusions it doesn't do so
for his reasons that is his reasons Lee
the very different conclusions in that
case namely I think his reasons lead to
the conclusion that we must dissolve the
authoritarian control over production
and resources which leads to such divert
against as among individuals in fact I
think one might
draw a direct line between classical
liberalism and the kind of libertarian
socialism which I think can be regarded
as the as a kind of an adapting of the
basic reasoning of classical liberalism
to a very different social Europe now if
we come to the modern period here
liberalism has taken on a very strange
sense if you think of its history now
liberalism is essentially the theory of
state capitalism of state intervention
in a capitalist economy well there's
very little of relation to classical
liberalism in fact classical liberalism
is what's now called conservatism I
suppose but this new view I think really
is it my my my view at least the highly
authoritarian position that is it's one
which accepts a number of centers of
authority and control the state on one
hand agglomerations of private power on
the other hand all interacting with
individuals as malleable cogs in this
highly constrained machine which may be
called democratic but given the that the
the actual distribution of power is very
far from being meaningfully democratic
and cannot be so so my own feeling has
always been that to achieve the
classical liberal ideals for the reasons
that led to them being put forth in a
society so different we must be led in a
very different direction
oh it's superficial and erroneous to
accept the conclusions which were
reached for a different Society and not
to consider the reasoning that led to
those conclusions the reasoning I think
is very substantially I'm a classical
liberal in this sense but I think it
leads me to be a kind of an anarchist
let me get begin by referring something
that I've already discussed that is if
it is correct as I believe it is that a
fundamental element of human nature is
the need for creative work for a
creative inquiry for for free creation
without the arbitrary limiting effects
of course of institutions then of course
it will follow that a decent society
should maximize the possibilities for
this fundamental human characteristic to
be real
that means trying to overcome the
elements of repression and oppression
and destruction and coercion that exist
in any existing society ours for example
as a historical residue now a federated
decentralized system of free
associations incorporating economic as
well as social institutions would be
what I refer to as anarcho-syndicalism
and it seems to me that it is the
appropriate form of social organization
for an advanced technological society in
which human beings do not have to be
forced into position of tools of cogs in
the machine in which the creative urge
the that I think is intrinsic to human
nature will in fact be able to realize
itself in whatever way it will I don't
know all the ways in which it will power
and oppression and terror and
destruction in our own society and that
certainly includes the institution's you
mentioned as well as the central
institutions of any industrial society
namely the the economic commercial and
financial institutions in particular in
the coming period of the great
multinational corporations which are not
very far from us physically tonight
those are the basic institutions of
oppression and coercion and autocratic
rule that appear to be neutral after all
they say well we're subject to the
democracy of the marketplace still I
think it would be a great shame to lose
or to put aside entirely the somewhat
more abstract and philosophical if you
like task of trying to draw the
connections between a concept of human
nature that gives full scope to freedom
and dignity and creativity and other
fundamental human characteristics and
relates that to some notion of social
structure in which
those properties could be realized in
which meaningful human life could take
place and in fact if we are thinking of
social transformation or social
revolution though it would be absurd of
course to try to draw out and detail the
point that we're hoping to reach still
we should know something about where we
think we're going it's a sort of an
absolute basis if you press me too hard
I'll be in trouble because I can't
sketch it out but some sort of an
absolute basis ultimately residing in
fundamental human qualities in terms of
which a real notion of Justice is
grounded and I think that our existing
systems of justice I think it's too
hasty to characterize our existing
systems of justice as merely systems of
class oppression I don't think that they
are that I think that they're that they
embody systems of class oppression and
they embodies elements of other kinds of
oppression but they also embody a kind
of a groping towards the true human
humanly valuable concept of justice and
decency and love and kindness and
sympathy and so on which I think are
real well you see I think that in the
intellectual domain of political action
that is the domain of trying to
construct a vision of a just and free
society on the basis of some notion of
human nature in that domain we face the
very same problem that we face in
immediate political action for example
to be quite concrete a lot of my own
activity really has to do with the
Vietnam War and a good deal of my own
energy goes into civil disobedience
well civil disobedience in the United
States is an action undertaken in the
face of great on sideral uncertainties
about its effects for example it
threatens the social order in ways which
let's say Mike one might argue bring on
fascism that would be very bad for the
for America for Vietnam for Holland and
for everyone else so there's a
that is one danger in undertaking this
concrete act on the other hand is a
great danger and not undertaking it
namely if you don't undertake it the
Society of indochina will be torn to
shreds by American power and in the face
of those uncertainties one has to choose
a course of action well similarly in the
intellectual domain one is faced with
the uncertainties that you correctly
pose our concept of human nature is
certainly limited partial socially
conditioned constrained by our own
character defects and the defects of the
limitations of the intellectual culture
in which we exist yet at the same time
it's of critical importance that we have
some some direction that we know what
impossible goals were trying to achieve
if we hope to achieve some of the
possible goals and that means that we
have to be bold enough to speculate and
create social theories on the basis of
partial knowledge while remaining very
open to the strong possibility and in
fact overwhelming probability that at
least in some respects were very far off
the mark are just the success of
libertarian socialists more and yzma's
whoever really depend on a fundamental
change in the nature of man both in his
motivation his altruism and also in his
knowledge and sophistication I think it
not only depends on it but in fact the
whole purpose of libertarian socialism
is that it will contribute to it it will
contribute to a spiritual transformation
precisely that kind of great
transformation in in the way humans
conceive of themselves and their ability
to act to decide to create to produce to
inquire precisely that spiritual
transformation that social thinkers from
the left Marxist tradition from
Lexington Luxembourg say on overthrew
anarcho-syndicalist have always
emphasized so on the one hand it
requires that spiritual transformation
on the other hand the its purpose is to
create institutions which will
contribute to that transformation
well I have my own idea as to what a
future society should look like I've
written about them I mean I think that
we should the most general level we
should be seeking out forms of authority
and domination and challenging their
legitimacy sometimes they are legitimate
that is that they they needed for
survival so for example I wouldn't
suggest victory the Second World War
the forms of authority
we had a totalitarian society basically
and I thought there was some
justification for that under the wartime
conditions and there other forms of so
so for relations between parents and
children for example involved forms of
coercion which are sometimes justifiable
but any such any any form of coercion
and control requires justification and
most of them are completely
unjustifiable now at various stages of
human civilization it's been possible to
challenge some of them but not others
others are too deep-seated or you don't
see them or whatever and so at any
particular point you try to detect those
forms of Authority and domination which
which are subject to change and which do
not have any legitimacy in fact which
often strike at fundamental human rights
and your understanding of fundamental
human nature and right well what are the
major things say today there are some
that are being addressed in a way the
feminist movement is addressing some the
civil rights movement as dressing others
the one major one that's not being
seriously addressed is the one that's
really the core of the system of
domination that's private control over
over resources and that means an attack
on the fundamental structure of state
capitalism I think that's in order
that's not something far off in the
future you asked the chairman of the
board and he'll always tell you that he
spends his every waking hour laboring so
that people will get the best possible
product at the cheapest possible price
and work in the best possible conditions
and so on and so forth now there's an
it's an institutional
independently of who the chairman of the
board is that he'd better be trying to
maximize profit and market share then if
he doesn't do that he's not gonna be
chairman of the board anymore if he were
ever to succumb to the delusions that he
expresses he'd be out now he can hold
those delusions as long as he performs
his institutional role and the same is
true across the board so for example you
can be take say Walter Lippman
specialized class the experts some of
them are candid enough to tell you the
truth like Henry Kissinger who defined
an expert as a person who is capable of
articulating the consensus of people
with power that's what made him an
expert that's true if you want to be an
expert part of the specialized class you
have to be able to serve the interests
of objective power that's an
institutional role that has to be played
and if you do that you can be in it if
you want to be a journalist let's say
you have to Accord to the needs of the
institutions and the institutions have
very definite needs the point is that no
one would even make it to a high
decision-making position in the media
whether as columnist or managing editor
or whatever unless they had already
internalized the required that you can
terrorize they believe them the number
of things you have to believe to make it
to top managerial positions you have to
believe that the United States is unique
in history and that it acts from
benevolent motives not benevolent
motives are not properties of states
whether it's the United States or any
other one they don't have this is a
meaning that unites given a four I mean
it acts because of the interests of
groups that have power within it's like
any other Society but anyone who
believes this truism is already excluded
you have to believe that whatever the
United States does is defensive if we
bomb South Vietnam we're defending South
Vietnam
if the Russians invade Afghanistan
that's not defense now of course you
know if you I suppose if you go to the
little they'll tell you they're
defending Afghanistan they're defending
it against terrorists supported from the
outside and of course there's a you know
we know that there's though in fact he
can tell you they were invited in and
there's a kind of an element of truth to
all of that but if we naturally dismiss
it as nonsense
on the other hand when we create a
government in South Vietnam to invite us
in and we attack the population of South
Vietnam and weeble to drive them into
concentration camps to separate them
from the guerrillas who we concede
they're supporting and so on we're
defending South Vietnam and anyone who
doesn't agree with this is not part of
the system you're equating the Soviet
Union in the United States and and the
genes of Patricks and others would say
of course that's the fundamental fallacy
of dr. Chomp his approach is that he is
saying there is a moral equivalence in
attaining the kind that's a that's
that's in these notions are in fact
inventions of the gene Kirkpatrick's and
other reactionary gene duysts the Soviet
Union in the United States are at
opposite poles among contemporary
political systems what I'm saying is
that even though they are at opposite
poles in some respects they behave alike
and that's that's for deep-seated
reasons that have to do with the
exercise of power and institutions and
so on and you're just not into it
immoral you do admit that we that we are
our free society that we're admitted I
insist upon it I insist that we are a
free society and that Soviet Union is a
dungeon and therefore we have completely
different methods of population control
on the other hand democratic state can't
use those mechanisms you can't force
anybody you can't force people therefore
you have to control what they think
since since power is still concentrated
but in different hands in our society
largely in private ownership and you
can't control people by force you'd
better care what they think so that's
why you have to have other forms and in
fact more sophisticated forms of
indoctrination
I didn't interview once with Edward
Bernays who was considered the
pioneering figure in American business
public relations and he talked through
there about the engineering of consent
that's his phrase but he thought it's a
wonderful thing in fact he described it
as the essence of democracy he said if
the consider the government but
presupposes that efforts at persuasion
it trying to persuade people to see
things your way out of the picture the
picture is certain people are in a
position to persuade and the essence of
democracy is that they have the freedom
to persuade now who has the freedom to
persuade well who runs the public
relations industry it's not the special
interests they're the targets of the
public relation
industry public relations industry is a
major industry closely linked to other
corporations and those are the people
who have the power to persuade that's
the essence of democracy and they must
engineer the consent of others there
were for example you know people who
really believe in democracy people who
take eighteenth-century value seriously
people who really might merit the term
conservatives that much abused term are
against concentration of power they
remember that the after all the the the
doctrines of the Enlightenment held that
individuals should be free from the
coercion of concentrated power what kind
of concentrated power that they were
thinking about was the church and the
state and the feudal system and so on
and that you could sort of imagine a
collective population of relatively
equal people at least equal white male
property owners who would be not
controlled by those private powers but
in the subsequent period a new form of
power developed namely corporations with
highly concentrated power over decision
making in the in economic life that is
they can control over what's produced
which distributed what's invested and so
on and so forth is very narrowly
concentrated this is why the vice
president of the laura's corporate
leaders say the public mind is the bleep
mine might have funny ideas about
democracy which say that we should not
be forced simply to rent ourselves to
the people who own the country rather
and own its institutions rather we
should play a role in determining what
those institutions do that's democracy
if we were to move towards democracy and
I think democracy even in the 18th
century sense we would say that there
should be no mail distribution of power
in determining what's produced what's
distributed what's invested and so on
rather that should be but that's a
that's a problem for the entire
community but the political system is
also unusual we're the only major
industrial democracy that doesn't have a
political party which is basically
labour based we only have one political
party with two factions it's the
business party we have two factions of
the business party called the Democrats
and the Republicans and that's unusual
in fact these these
this perception is transmuted in an odd
way into political terminology so for
example in the 1980s each election in
the 1980s the Democrats have been
accused of being the party of the
special interests and then they hotly
deny it and they say no they're not the
party of the special interest but who
are the special interests well take a
look behind the rhetoric and you find
that the special interests are women
labor youth the elderly ethnic
minorities the poor farmers in fact it's
the entire population to point-b the
entire population or the special
interests now if you look closely
there's one group that's never
identified as being among the special
interests that's corporations and that's
correct there the national interest and
both parties are basically beholden to
them just a whereas the special
interests have to be marginalized the
population so everyone denies that they
represent the special interest that is
the people and they don't say who they
do represent but there is somebody their
group notably lacking in this list of
special interests and in fact it's the
group with anyone with its head screwed
on nose has inordinate power in
controlling economic decisions and
setting the parameters for political
life and controlling the ideological
system and so on they are not among the
special interests ratification would
mean a system in which there are two
positions presented to me the voter I go
into the polling booth and I push one or
another button depending on which of
those positions I want that's a very
limited form of democracy a real really
meaningful democracy it would mean that
I play a role in forming those decisions
making creating those positions that
those positions reflect my active
creative participation at it not just me
but of course everyone that would be
real democracy has not very far from
that but we're even departing from the
point where there is ratification when
you have stage-managed elections with
the public relations industry
determining what words come out of
people's mouths you in fact they're
going beyond to the point where we are
even then even the element of
ratification is disappearing because you
don't expect the candidate
to stand for anything candidates decide
what to say on the basis of tests that
determine what the effect will be across
the population somehow people don't see
how profoundly contemptuous that is of
democracy contemptuous yeah suppose I'm
working on running for office and I
don't tell people what I think or what
I'm going to do I tell them what the
pollsters have told told me is going to
get me elected that's expressing utter
contempt for the electorate that's
saying okay you people are going to have
the chance to push your buttons but once
you're done I'll do exactly what I
intend which is not what I'm telling you
in a capitalist democracy you have the
problem and it is always perceived as a
problem that the popular general
population has a method of participating
in a decision-making they can
participate in politics the state is not
capable of stopping them you can't shut
them up you can't hook them in jail you
can't keep them away from the polls and
so on and it's striking that that has
always been perceived as a problem to be
overcome it's what's called the crisis
of democracy too many people organizing
themselves to become to practice it to
enter the public arena that's a crisis
we have to overcome boarding to a
certain view but it has always been
understood by I would say even the
mainstream of democratic theorists that
when the voice of the people is heard
you're in trouble because they're always
going to make the wrong decisions the
stupid and ignorant masses as they're
called are going to make the wrong
decisions so therefore what we have to
have what Walter Lippman back in 1920 or
so called manufacture of consent we have
to ensure that actual decision-making
actual power is in the hands of what he
called a specialized class that's smart
guys you know we're going to make the
right decisions and we've got to keep
the general population marginalized
because they're always going to make
mistakes marginalizing meaning reduce
them to apathy and obedience allow them
to participate in the political system
but as consumers not as true participant
that has allowed them a method for
ratifying decisions that are made by
others but eliminate the methods by
which they might first inform themselves
second organize
third act in such a way as to really
control decision-making that is the
ideas our leaders control us not we
control them because well more democracy
is a value in itself so quite apart
because democracy is a value doesn't
have to be defended anywhere in freedom
has to be defended that's just it's it's
part of it's an essential feature of
human nature that is people should be
free that should be able to participate
they should be uncoerced and so on
that's what it is all values in
themselves well why do you think if we
go that route us I think that that's the
only hope that I can see that other
values will come to the fore I mean if
the society is based on controlled by
private wealth it will reflect the
values that in fact does reflect the
value that the highest the only real
human property is the desire for profit
is green and the desire to maximize
personal gain at the expense of others
now any society that made that small
society based on that principle is ugly
but it can survive a global society
based on that principle is headed for
massive destruction and that's what we
are we have to have a mode of social
organization that reflects other values
that I think are inherent in human
nature that people recognize and that
would be able to see exactly I mean what
are human beings I mean in your family
for example it's not the case that in
the family every person tries to
maximize personal gain at the expense of
others if they do it spends pathological
it's not the case that if if you and I
are say walking down the street and we
see a child needing a piece of candy and
we see the nobody's around we don't
spend we happen to be hungry we don't
steal it if we did that would be would
be pathological I mean the idea of care
for others and concern for other
people's needs and concern for a fragile
environment that must sustain future
generations all of these things are part
of human nature these are elements of
human nature that are suppressed in a
social and cultural system which is
designed to maximize personal gain what
I think we must try to overcome
suppression and that's in fact what
democracy could bring about it could
lead to the expression of other human
needs and values which tend to be
suppressed under the institutional
structure of a system of private power
and private profit what do we do about
it I mean I don't want to leave people
on a wholly negative analysis although I
believe in facing reality for ordinary
people it's extremely hard and that's
why you need organization what is if a
real democracy is going to thrive if the
real values that are deeply embedded in
human nature are going to be able to
flourish and I think that's necessary to
save us if nothing else it will be it's
an absolute necessity that that groups
form in which people can join together
can share their concerns can articulate
their ideas can gain a response can
discover what they think can discover
what they believe what their values are
this can't be imposed on you from above
you have to discover it by experiment by
by by effort by trial by application and
so on and this has to be done with
others furthermore surely central to
human nature is a need to be engaged
with others in cooperative efforts of
solidarity and concern that can only
happen homes by definition through group
structures and unless such a little
organization political and other civic
or there's all sorts of trade of
citizens of ways in which people can
associate with one another and I think
what I would like to see is a move
towards a society which is really based
on purl upon proliferating voluntary
organization with eliminating as much as
possible structures of hierarchy and
domination and the basis for them and
and control and becoming the means by
which we govern ourselves by which we
control our lives does this do you
believe that by nature human beings
yearn for freedom or have do we settle
in the interest of safety and security
and conformity do we settle for order
these are really matters of faith rather
than knowledge on the one hand you have
the Grand Inquisitor who tells you that
what people would humans crave is
submission and therefore Christ is a
criminal and we have to vanquish freedom
that's one view you have the other view
of say we're so in some of his moments
that people are born to be free and that
their basic instinct is the desire to
free themselves from coercion Authority
and oppression it's the answer to which
you believe is more or less where you
stake your hopes I'd like to believe
that people are born to be free
but if you ask for a proof they couldn't
give it to him person works on order
let's say a craftsman produces something
on orders or under coercion we may
admire what he does but we despise what
he is because he's a machine
and we want people to be human he found
exactly the same thing in Adam Smith and
every one of the reasons Adam Smith was
very critical of division of labor and
he has certain old the division of labor
at the beginning of wealth and Native
Nations would have ego on it criticizes
at the end and he criticizes because he
says if we let division of labor
continue we will reduce people to
creatures as stupid and as ignorant as
it's possible for a creature to be
because they'll simply be carrying out
mechanical operations under command and
a very limited domain and what you are
you know your intelligence your
understanding your your human
characteristics come from your capacity
or from the options available to you to
carry out independent productive
creative activities work included maybe
in free association with others because
we're social beings but not under
external coercion and
and he said any civilized societies
might have to prevent this from
happening in the 18th century and the
sort of in the Enlightenment and the
period of early modern libertarian
revolutions people like for example
villain from Humboldt and Rousseau
thought about the exactly these
questions they were both they both
understood in some sense it was hard to
formulate it clearly and coherently at
the time but they both grasped the idea
that languages are basically infinite
that they're expressions of human
creativity in fact that's a leading
cartesian idea which came to them right
through the rationalist and romantic
traditions and they were also both
interested deeply interested in human
liberation and they did in fact try to
connect these things pretty much the way
suggests by suggesting that it at some
core level part of human nature is a
which is reflected on the cognitive side
in things like language is the capacity
to produce and understand and articulate
and express new thoughts without limit
and without control so the crucial fact
about language use is that it's not
determined by our situation it's coming
out of us as freely willed action in
some sense and continually novel and so
on and to express thoughts and ideas
that are new to oneself and to other
people but that are intelligible and
appropriate and so on this is a core
aspect of human nature pour in the
nature again
was later called about the point of an
instinct for freedom that is a need to
become involved in free creative
activity free creative work so for sehun
Volta one's work is sort of the core of
one's existence you want to be involved
in creative honest work in association
with others but voluntary Association
and not under external control these
things have mostly been forgotten
so the as the market systems of the 19th
century developed they eliminated all of
this they would have appalled Adam Smith
no doubt you know the market systems
that developed because they when you get
the people I same office and Ricardo and
so on the conception of human beings as
freely creative active people with
intrinsic rights due to their nature
disappears and people become nothing
more they have no values other than
value as and what they can sell in the
market their labor power if you can't
sell your labor power in the market you
have no right to live this way it was
discussed because there's nothing to a
human being other than what can be
attained by sale of labor power within a
market system under what become
basically totalitarian structures
corporate structures and so on so the
modern extensions of classical
liberalism are very anti libertarian and
these I than the ideologies change and
no the intellectuals change and so on so
this tradition has pretty much been well
if not wiped out at least marginalized
but it's there and it certainly can be
revived it stayed alive and for example
in the anarchist tradition and in parts
of the libertarian left in the United
States you find traces of it as late as
real traces as late as people like John
Dewey who probably didn't know any of
these things but just came out of it
from another source and you know
the same point in his conception of
democracy is a value because it opens
the opportunities for people to freely
liberate themselves as they must do it's
their sort of core it isn't in the
contemporary world he'd be hard put to
find much discussion if it's
unfortunately but I think it should be
reviving that he's very significant it's
an interesting question actually I mean
Marx himself was complex figure the
early Marx so you read that
philosophical manuscripts and so on do
you know this is coming straight out of
the French French and German Romanticism
so the kinds of ideas you find expressed
in Humboldt and then the more
libertarian side of Rousseau Brazil
himself was very split but if you take
the libertarian as part of Rousseau V
second discourse on inequality and home
bold and so on all of this was that's
the background that which Marx grew up
and if you read the philosophical and
manuscripts of the early period they're
immersed in this so his theory of
alienation comes out of this work the
coerced labor is alienating and counter
to human nature precisely for these
reasons for the Humboldt Egan reasons
when you get to the later Marx you know
it's not it's it's sort of like a
scholarly debate about whether he
changed his mind or just started talking
about other things but anyway you don't
find it any longer and by that time Marx
Marxism does become exactly as you say
very detrimental to this so you get this
idea with you you do find it Marx but it
couldn't have believed that human nature
is just a historical product and people
are just malleable they're made what
their culture turns them into you get
this even people like Gramsci it was one
of the more libertarian and Marxist but
this idea that humans are simply formed
by the environment and they are nothing
but clay you know passive clay in the
hands of their molders that's an idea
which is very attractive to radical
intellectuals because they think they're
going to be the molders of course and
that leads right to the Leninist version
of Marxism and it does become a kind of
orthodoxy and the earlier views of are
either forgotten or marginalized
although they're certainly there in Marx
and they certainly are in the tradition
that he came from I mean the Marxists
and the behaviorists are right in the
same ballpark
leave these kind of Marx's the in fact
it's and it's a tragedy and a
catastrophe that the left has been has
accepted the idea of humans as
historical products simply reflections
of their environment because what
follows from that of course is that
there's no moral barrier to molding them
any way you like and if humans have no
inner nature if they don't have an inner
instinct for freedom you know if it's
not fundamental that their nature to
have free creative productive work under
their own control if that's not part of
their nature then why you know there's
no event there's no moral reason for
allowing them that space you could just
mold them into being what you think they
ought to be and you can be the Central
Committee or you can be you know the
managers of the corporation or directors
of a fascist state or whatever
intellectuals have mostly moved in one
or the other of those directions
overwhelmingly either they're in fact
this was foretold in one of the maybe
the only
prediction of the Social Sciences that
ever came so dramatically true was the
Coonans
discussion of this in the late not in
the late nineteenth century he was
argument of Marx as well before Leninism
but he predicted very perceptively
that the rising class of intellectuals
were just kind of becoming identified as
a class and modern modern industrial
society he predicted that they were
essentially going to go in one of two
directions there would be some who would
believe that the struggles of the
working class would offer them an
opportunity to rise and take state power
in their own hands
and at that point he said they would
become the red bureaucracy who would
create the worst tyranny that humanity
has ever known of course all any
interests of the workers that's one
direction and he said the others would
recognize that you're never going to get
power that way
and the way to get power is to associate
yourself with what we would nowadays
call state capitalism and just become
the servants of its ruling class and
then you become the managers and the
ideologues and so on for the state
capitalist system and as he put it those
people will beat the people with the
people stick they'll talk about
democracy but they'll really be beating
people with the stick of democracy which
they'll turn into a mechanism of
coercion do you think you can get power
by by exploiting popular struggles and
there are others who see that you don't
get power by just associating yourself
with the people already have economic
power and that's largely domine
and I think there's a very accurate
description of the century that followed
him on the 150 years before the
Bolshevik Revolution but he predicted
its form very precisely and also its
ideological background and he also
predicted quite accurately what happens
in the modern state capitalist
industrial societies and looking at it
now from the retrospective a hundred
years we can see I think we can see this
development very clearly and it also
explains an odd fact about 20th century
intellectual life namely how easy it's
been for people to shift from one
position to another so the same person
who's a Stalinist apologist one year is
a super American patriot you know the
next year supporting every atrocity
working and working in Hoover Institute
and you know associated with most
reactionary institutions that transition
which sometimes is called the God that
failed change which was sort of
authentic in the early years like people
like cilona and others you know there
was something else empathetic about it
it became a joke I mean it's because
when people within the in fact we're
seeing it in Russia right now the the
worst connoisseurs are now the ones who
are most passionate about the you know
the free market and investing and
enriching yourself and so on that
they've made the transition very easily
and that goes way back and I think the
reason is there's no transition it's
just a different estimate as to where
power lies but the same ideology the
ideology is you think the people with
the people stick I mean we're going to
do it in fact if you look at modern
acket democratic theory in the West it's
remarkably similar to this it's
remarkably Leninist in its character
tendencies in modern democratic theory
in the West so in an academic world it
would be the strands of political
science that developed from the thinking
of people like Harold Lasswell and
others one of the founders of modern
contemporary political science and in
the general sphere the Wilsonian
intellectuals the so-called progressive
intellectuals of whom maybe walter
Lippmann was the most striking example
in the United States progressive
intellectual in the 1920s
if who'd of all of these people
developed theories of democracy and
they're quite interesting the very
Leninist and their character the
conception is that in a democracy
there's two classes of citizens there's
the general public who Lippmann calls
ignorant and meddlesome outsiders and
Lasswell says they're too stupid to we
should not be overcome by dogmatism
about the common man who's too stupid to
be able to do anything that's the
standard view so there's these people
the ignorant and meddlesome Outsiders
which is maybe
80% of the population and then there are
the responsible men the wise men you
know the smart people the people with
integrity and honor the intellectual
aristocracy whatever you call them and
they have to rule they're the ones who
make the decisions who do the thinking
and so on and the role of the masses the
ignorant and meddlesome Outsiders is to
show up every couple of years decide
which of the smart guys is going to be
their leader and then go home
they have nothing more to do that's a
democracy and then you have variation
this is the way Lippmann put it the
general public are to be spectators not
participants their only participation is
lending their weight to one or another
representative of the dominant class and
then going home that's an election and
the spectrum extends from about there
that's the liberal side over to the more
reactionary side now where you get
people like say Reaganites people call
themselves conservatives they're
learning authentic conservative would be
appalled by their positions they're
really statist reactionary and their
view rate the Reaganites we're very
striking in this respect their view is
the people shouldn't even be spectators
because it's none of their business what
the state is doing the idea is we have
to the state has to be so powerful and
so private that the ignorant Outsiders
can't even see what's going on now if
you look at the modern world this is
happening a very dramatically so one of
the major things that's happening now is
the transfer of real power away from
parliamentary institutions and towards a
transnational system of private power
transnational corporations and their own
institutions like the IMF and GATT and
the World Trade Organization and the
World Bank and the executive meetings of
the g7 you know big seven rich countries
that's a system of decision making which
is completely separate from public from
the public public has no idea what's
going on there's almost no way of
figuring out what's happening in a guy
council I mean I doubt if there's one
American minion who knows what was
decided in the last and the and was in
the GATT treaty yeah I mean you have to
be a specialist you know who goes and
those how to go to specialize documents
even he had a picture of and a lot of it
you can't even find because it really is
secret well that's the in effect
transnational corporations themselves or
you know almost the you know
unimaginable attack on democracy we're
absolutely appalled someone like Adam
Smith or Thomas Jefferson because they
are totalitarian institutions completely
absolutist absolutely unaccountable
public has nothing to say about them
internally they're completely hierarchic
they're kind of like the economic
equivalent of super fascism and they
kept they're also undermining free trade
it's called trade but it's a joke
