welcome to real news I'm Marc Steiner
great to have you all with us we're
about to have a conversation with Noam
Chomsky who we all know is considered
the founder of modern linguistics but he
and his ideas and his activism have an
inspiration to many across the globe who
seek social economic and racial justice
just a personal anecdote
I've been reading him since 1967 when he
wrote his essay against the Vietnam War
called the responsibility of
intellectuals and I've had the pleasure
of interviewing him a couple of times in
the past
he's written well over 100 books appears
often on my colleague Amy Goodman
Democracy Now his latest book which I
just finished his internationalism or
extinction and as we face the covert 19
pandemic and the failures of neoliberal
capitalism who better to spend some time
with Noam Chomsky and so wrong Tomsky
welcome to real news good to have you
with us
pleased to be with you so let me just
begin I mean you you have written in
your book and other times about the
remembrance of Hitler and the rise of
fascism and here we find ourselves you
know at this moment with the facing the
depth of climate change on you Trump the
Doomsday Clock is getting closer closer
to midnight seconds as you as you said
recently and and so all this coming
together and we have this pandemic this
coronavirus pandemic
exacerbating this march towards kind of
right-wing potentially right-wing
populist authoritarianism looking back
in the history I'm just curious where
you think we are now and I've seen about
a quote that you wrote in your book from
Mark Twain which I love which is history
doesn't repeat but sometimes rhymes and
we're in summing strange rhyming period
talk a bit about what you think we are
well I'm old enough to remember as a
child of listening to Hitler's speeches
over the radio at the Nuremberg rallies
I couldn't understand the words when I
was 6 years old but could easily
understand the mood it was frightening
the adoration of the screaming crowd
they were ranting and also seeing what
was beginning to happen in the 30s as
and began to spread and I seemed
inexorably over the much of the world
with these hideous leaders in charge and
I do these memories do come to mind when
I listened to one of trumps were out
rallies for example there's some
similarity the worship of the crowds the
very effective is very effective use of
techniques of manipulation so for
example the constant flood of Lies and
self-contradictions and so on which is
very well designed to undermine the very
notion of truth
it disappears so you just listen to the
great leader well he's doing very much
the same I presume consciously that with
regard to the coronavirus if you look
over his statements since January they
range all over the map it's just the flu
don't worry about it it's a terrible
pandemic and I was the first person ever
to notice it than anything else that's a
great technique it assures that he'll be
vindicated whatever happens you'll find
some statement he made that was accurate
when you should arrows at random that
something's going to hit the target and
when you have adoring crowds through the
grasp any word of the leader when you
have an echo chamber cold fox news where
they loyally repeat every bit of
nonsense and saying then it's a terrific
technique of domination control also but
before there are people including good
scholars of fascism like Robert Paxton
who argued that we may be in danger of
coming to something like fascism but
well there's something to that I think
we should be reserved about it
was an ideology it wasn't just screaming
and ranting at adoring crowds it was an
ideology of state takeover and
domination and control of everything
of course labor unions and so on but
also business state control of business
collection of done that was called
that's almost the opposite of what we
have now we have business controlled of
the state under Trump deepening his
primary constituency is wealth and
corporate power and he lavishes gift for
them is very striking at the Davos
meetings in January into the meetings of
the masters in the universe he gave a
very much dislike him the corporate
executives in lucky style anything else
about him he gave the leading speech
they liked it because he talked about
his tax cut a huge gift to the wealthy
and the corporate sector stabbing
everyone else in the back they thought
that was great you know so he
understands how to serve his primary
masters how to keep the adoring crowds
under control but there's no ideology
the ideology is simply me I'm a
megalomaniac psychopath and I just want
what's good for me that's not fascism
it's something pretty awful but not
fascism with the coronavirus very
important I mean it's a terrible crisis
we'll recover from it at maybe horrible
cost but we will recover and there are
two things that is important to keep in
mind one is there's going to be more of
these crises now this particular one has
been predicted for 10 or 15 years ever
since the SARS epidemic
since similar coronavirus so it was
predicted it was understood that
something would come steps weren't taken
for interesting to look at how that
works
time I could talk about it but it was
understood that something was underway
if we don't look at the roots of this
crisis and deal with them though we
others and though we worse ones because
they'll be compounded with something
else that's happening this crisis will
recover from we're not going to recover
from the melting of the or the polar ice
caps and the other very significant
impacts of the global warming crisis
which trunk is trying hard to exacerbate
right in the middle of this crisis while
people are worried about you know
getting by is continuing on his
relentless drive to destroyed organized
human life on earth so on February 10th
well the pandemic was spreading over the
u.s. Trump came out of trumpet his
courtiers it's not just him they came
out with their budget proposals for next
year okay a lot of it was predictable
continued increasing cutbacks of every
health-related aspect of the government
he's been doing that for years so let's
continue to wipe wipe out the health
system and response system okay that's
expected huge expenses for the bloated
military and his drink wool yeah we
expect that anything that has anything
of any use to human beings we cut but
what was interesting is that he included
subsidies for the fossil fuel industry
to try to make the major crisis worse
furthermore his new EPA which is
corporate run as you know just a couple
of days ago announced cutbacks in
regulations for auto emissions that'll
have the welcome effect of killing a lot
more to be
from pollution which is a major killer
but more important increasing expanding
the race to the abyss with coming
environmental crises now these are
things we have to pay attention to we
have to think about the words of this
breakage now what can be done with what
can be done to prevent the next one just
very likely will probably be worse and
we have to ask ourselves what we're
gonna do about the truly existential
crisis which is going to destroy human
civilization not just my fee of
incidentally a very interesting memo
from JPMorgan Chase the biggest American
Bank the memo was quite interesting it
said that the survival of humanity there
freeze the survival of humanity is at
risk if we continue on our present
course including the virtually genocidal
commitments of the bank is Bank they are
back the to fund fossil fuels it's
understood the Davos men they understand
that it masters of the world understand
it very well we should understand it we
should not mince words when I say
genocide all it's correct the if we
don't deal with there is time there's
not much but there is time to deal with
the crisis even without a radical change
of institutions there are ways to do it
but not much time every day every year
we waste gets worse every year we allow
Trump and his acolytes to expand the
crisis to accelerate it gets harder to
deal with well if he gets reelected it's
a I won't say it's a death knell for the
species but it's a very severe blow all
of this is should be great in the front
of our minds as we're thinking about
this crisis and we should recognize that
it is in the Front's of the minds of the
criminal
the ones who were taking advantage of
this crisis to ram through their
programs of destruction and devastation
which their and their little sociopathic
minds are evidently dedicated to these
are not exaggerations incidentally if we
look at the Republican Party we even
know why they're doing you go back about
ten years John McCain running for the
president now he had a the climate
change element in his platform the
Republican Congress was beginning to
think about small ways to deal with the
growing climate crisis which of course
they know what's coming what happened
the coke energy machine which had been
working for years to try to keep the
Republican Party on course of supporting
fossil fuels when it's emotion launched
a juggernaut bribing senators
intimidating them with threats to run
alternative candidates huge lobbying
effort astroturf campaigns they all
capitulated in a moment ever since then
they've been deniers okay
that's the world we're living with and
that has an effect that people listen to
Fox News which echoes what's coming from
the wealthy and powerful and they're
spokespersons in Washington end result
is if you take a look at Republicans
whose main source of informations of
cold as Fox News about twenty five
percent of them thinks that it's a
serious problem I say about the same
number who think that humans are
probably involved there's a major crisis
for the world and we're right at heart
of it other things we have to do that
you can learn a lot just by looking at
the details
this crisis arose back in 2003 it was
understood by scientists that another
epidemic and probably a corona virus
pandemic is not unlikely there were
things that could have been done and
some things began to be done so Obama
did contract with a small company in
California to produce high-quality
low-cost ventilators that's the
bottleneck in the system right now the
reason why nurses have to decide who
they want to kill well he did make that
contrary company was quickly brought up
by a large corporation Covidien which
makes I process the high cost
ventilators they sidetracked the project
probably because they didn't want
competition with their high cost
ventilators increasing and they told the
government they want to get out of the
country because it wasn't profitable
enough to produce what it's desperately
needed it's profitable but you can make
more money with fossil fuels same things
going with the fossil fuel companies and
sustainable energy they make profit from
the sustainable energy corporations but
to make much more profit from destroying
the world so they killed those projects
that's called capitalism and it's
particularly savage variant called
neoliberalism what we've been suffering
from since Reagan is a very harmful
consequences so that's so we come up to
the present let's say last October there
was a high-level simulation of a
pandemic around a virus pandemic showing
how awful it would be that was October
in December China
notified the World Health Organization
that they were finding pneumonia like
symptoms with on
niala G on January 7th they informed the
World Health Organization that the
signing scientists had identified the
source as a corona virus had identified
the virus sequenced it provided the
information to the entire world the US
intelligence knew now in January in
February they were pounding on the doors
of the White House trying to get someone
to pay attention that was when my
intelligence official couldn't they
couldn't get Trump seer for him it was
just a minor flu don't worry about it
finally comes you know the recognition
that big problems so of course he's the
first person who ever who was a pandemic
we go into that routine and that's where
we are now the worst it's the epicenter
of the crisis the only major country in
the world the only one that is so
dysfunctional that it cannot even
provide data to the World Health
Organization on the number of possible
cases every other major country can
that's what we're living with now we're
gonna make a decision pretty soon that's
the weather to continue with it or get
rid of it and try to move back to some
level of sanity I should say this is not
the only case for worried
you mentioned the Doomsday Clock it's
been moving towards midnight
ever since Trump was nominated this year
broke all records the analysts abandoned
minutes turned the second hundred
seconds to midnight
one reason is what we've just been
talking about but there's another one
which everyone seems to want to talk
about Trump is tearing to shreds the
last parts of the arms control
agreements which go back to Reagan and
Eisenhower that are
helped maintain the virtual miracle that
there hasn't been a nuclear war yet not
only doing that but doing it very
blatantly virtually appealing to other
countries Russia in particular to find
ways to destroy us
so last August that's wrong as you know
abandoned the Reagan Gorbachev INF
treaty which had significantly reduced
the threat of war abandoned but went
beyond immediately after abandoning it
the u.s. launched the missile violating
the treaty that's virtually pleading
with adversaries okay try to develop
means to destroy us as fast as you can
great for military industry they were
exalting huge new contracts to develop
the new ways to destroy everything and
as they pointed out down the road
there'll be even bigger contracts to try
to find some way some hopeless way to
defend against the destructive systems
that we're now developing so for them
it's wonderful for the rest of this
saying yeah we're toast they want to
kill us all well that's the decisions
that that's the meaning of the decisions
that are being taken about arms control
the Russians have been calling for
continuing the next major treaty the New
START treaty they say let's just
continue it u.s. won't respond don't say
anything the time is getting short
there's little time for negotiations
that one will probably go also facing
the X is the Open Skies treaty which was
suggested by Eisenhower that's under the
ax so anything you can think of that can
harm people and destroy civilization
that's a high priority is that an
exaggeration
unfortunately not is this the most
dangerous administration and party in
human history I'm afraid so it's not an
exaggeration when you think of the
consequences those are the issues that
we should be thinking about just as the
gang of criminals is while we're
sequestered and suffering from the
effects of the corona virus which with
sanity can be dealt with at significant
cost
hopeless so the Asian countries have
been doing a fairly good job of
containing it Taiwan South Korea Hong
Kong in Europe Germany as the lowest
death rate recorded death rate of any
country that has statistics also Norway
the one reason is they did not follow
this lunatic business run a principle of
no fat in the system just on-time
delivery may work for automobiles
doesn't work for health systems that's
the kind of extra beds they can't have
extra diagnostic capacity that wouldn't
be efficient and that means if anything
goes wrong you're sunk
okay Germany had excess capacity
diagnostic capacity beds they were able
to do something to deal with the crisis
in fact it's pretty instructive for
Americans to just listen to Donald
Trump's ratings and then turn to the
uncle a miracle German Chancellor's her
judicious measured factual appeal to the
German people explaining to them what's
coming and has to be done just listening
to those side by side tells us what
Trump
courtiers are doing to this country
they're also making it one of the most
hated countries in the world you can
easily see this just by reading the
Foreign Press especially the third-world
person I can give you an interesting
illustration of that you don't mind an
anecdote now there's a internet
fabrication circulating with some
lunatic claims about how the US has
invented the the biological weapon and
is using it to take over the world and
so on it's attributed to me sometimes
even a accompanied by pictures of me
it's all over the world I get a ton of
letters about it most of the letters are
thank you for finally telling the truth
this is from serious people scholars
friends of mine it's an indication of
the attitude toward the United States
that's engendered by Trump's antics and
actions mature unserious Lee undermining
the country in many ways not just
leading to destruction but in many other
ways it's a real malignancy of an
unprecedented kind you can't say it too
strongly the amazing things you just
said and I and I anticipated most of my
questions let me just let me that's a
couple of things here they come out of
both the book and what you've just said
to us the first when you look at the
coronavirus that we're facing on the
planet this pandemic you you written and
talked about the relationship between
neoliberalism and authoritarianism you
and you can see in this moment that
whether it's Trump or Boston Aero or any
of the other authoritarian leaders that
are on a rise in this world through the
populist movements that they're using
the corona virus as a ways to even
implement greater control currents so I
wonder if we're where that fits into the
danger were facing in terms of when you
these pandemics and this could be the
first of many to come if you when you
read some with some literature telling
us about the unleashing of viruses we
don't know from the melting of
permafrost and the Arctic ice shelves
and the loss of habitat now all these
things fit into that that that this
could this this could be the preface key
to open a door for authoritarianism and
a do you think that's true and B what
would our response be laughter it's very
much the same as the way the Trump
administration is using the opportunity
to increase to intensify the severe
environmental catastrophe in the ways I
described fossil fuels symphonies are
doing exactly the same they're appealing
for a reduced reduction of emissions
during the time of earth controls on
emissions during the time of crisis and
so on yes every part of the they feel
like criminal gang that runs much of the
world is going to be using the
opportunity to intensify their control
and destructive power how do we react by
countering it and overwhelming it with
popular reactions and developments and
those are taking place I mean there's
some very important and instructive
things let's go back to that JP Morgan
memo that I mentioned actually advises
that JP Morgan stop funding fossil fuels
that says the doing it causes
reputational damage what does that mean
that's advice to activists that said you
keep wrecking our reputations we're
gonna have to change policy the banking
on the doors the protests that has an
effect that's one of the reasons for the
main theme at Davis last January was
quite interesting the corporate sectors
can say yeah we were pretty
in the past but now we're changing that
we're going to be socially responsible
not and even beyond socially responsible
we're going to go all out to help
stakeholders the communities workers
were really devoted that to that now
it's the centerpiece of our commitment
why because the peasants are rising with
the pitchforks nothing new about this
incidentally is useful to have a sense
of history
you go back 65 years
leading economist choral kaizen liberal
economists Kennedy administration I
wrote a book in which he extolled what
he called the soulful corporation he
said corporations are changing they used
to just try to make money now they're
soulful they're really committed to the
the mission of helping the world though
65 years ago now had 65 years of
experience with it peasants are coming
with their pitchforks again we better be
soulful again okay that tells activists
you're doing something right
go after them
go after the strangle forced them and
create alternatives might take what the
sunrise movement just did it's a group
of young kids a couple of years ago the
green new deal was if it was mentioned
at all was an object of ridicule now
it's right at the center of things
legislative agenda still gets ridiculed
but it's the center of the agenda in
some form or other
some kind of green New Deal is essential
for survival so that transition is very
significant how did it happen
some young kids agitated is sat in and
senatorial offices and were supported by
congressional offices they were
supported by Acacio Cortes couple of
other young representatives who came in
on the Sanders wave which was very
important in changing the mentality in
the country and opening up new
directions
all of this offers opportunities similar
things are happening in Europe
okay that's the way to counter what
you're describing the only way it's the
only way throughout history it's the
only way now that it can be done so I
just I don't wanna keep it too long but
I did this this what you just raised
here I'm you know when I was younger and
the throes of the movements of the 60s
and early 70s we actually thought we
would get rid of capitalism and it's
still very much whether it may be
stronger than ever
so when you look at what we're facing
whether this pandemic unleashed I think
in large part because of environmental
reasons when you look at when you look
at the danger the Doomsday Clock being
so close to the to the top seconds away
as you wrote the threat toward democracy
across the world and in this country the
climate changed the climate disaster
we're facing
so we annum were faced in this 2020
election
with Trump clearly with a great deal of
chance to win I when you see a lot of
young people who are just so
dissatisfied many people with the
neoliberal control of the Democratic
Party but that's the only face simply
opposes Trump at the moment what is your
analysis and feeling about what we
should do
I mean you've lived through as a young
child from Hitler to now and seen so
much through all your time and I've been
writing about this and your ideas have
morphed and changed over the years as
I've been reading them so where do you
think we are now with this I mean what
would you say to activists other people
in American public about what should
happen in 2020 what should happen in
2020 is obvious we have to get priority
number one get rid of the malignancy
if Trump manages to win and there's
another possibility he may lose and
refuse to leave the White House
I wouldn't exclude that but if any of
those happens we're pretty much toast
okay so that's priority number one I get
a flood of letters from also from young
people who are so in such despair that
they don't see any point in living
because everything we lose everything
everything goes wrong there's no
possibility of doing anything well you
know if you're 20 years old
and you don't know a thing about the 60s
let's say may look like that but you and
I should know better just remember what
the world was like in the 60s the United
States had anti-miscegenation laws so
strict that the Nazis refused to accept
them federal law required that housing
federal housing was specifically for
whites only no blacks so if some like a
little worker or save managed to get
enough money to get it that house he
couldn't get into Levitan and the other
housing developments
of course anti-sodomy those the women
still did not have the legal rights of
peers they were still living under the
laws of the framers which designated
women as property not not people didn't
change till 1975 you remember the
anti-war movement in the early 60s when
Kennedy was rapidly escalating the war
it was almost impossible to get anyone
to even listen to any effort to do
something about this demonstrators we
try to make demonstrations that were
violently broken up the churches were
attacked if there was a demonstration
going on this is Boston I'm talking
about the most liberal city in the
country up until the late sixties that's
changed enormously opposition to
aggression now is far higher and we've
seen it over and over in short in many
ways the country's become a lot more
civilized think not thanks to gifts from
above thanks to the activism of people
like you back in the sixties had a big
impact it frightened the daylights out
of his leads liberally leads so if you
read it read it you haven't done it read
books like the crisis of democracy by
the trilateral commission early
seventies trilateral commission is
liberal internationalists from around
the world the corridor administration
was drawn almost completely from its
ranks and what were they concerned about
too much democracy
the kids are out in the streets
protesting women are demanding rights
the working people are saying we should
have rights to political the special
interests namely everybody except
corporations while they're asking for
the kind of rights that they don't
deserve that's talking about the
Liberals
the colleges are a real problem we have
to do something they are failing in
their mission of indoctrination of the
young I'm quoting incidentally these are
the Liberals they're failing in their
mission of indoctrinating the young we
have to make it harsher under control
you go to the right end of the spectrums
much more extreme the point is that
liberal the whole spectrum was very
frightened and wanted to come down like
a ton of bricks to put an end to this
heresy of calling for democracy and
rights and we enter into a period of
very savage capitalism okay that's the
neoliberal period all sorts of things
but like when Reagan came in you know
he's reading the script that's handed to
him by his corporate masters written
over the sunny smiley reason first thing
is a government is the problem
so get government out of our affairs
meaning handed over to unaccountable
private tyrannies that's called
libertarian in the United States but the
government is somewhat influenced by
public opinions which bet there's got to
put everything in private hands no
influence of the public appearance we
have to destroy the labor movement
that's a force for freedom and democracy
so his first acts were to try to crush
the labor move went on incidentally all
this stuff was picked up by Clinton was
many just expanding this he did some
other things we trying to we'll know him
but a very significant right away Reagan
reading the script legalized stock
buybacks
and tax havens that was illegal before
and it was enforced
there weren't any that's not small money
that's tens of to trillions of dollars
of pure robbery of the public by the
private sector and it's right in front
of us at this moment the major
corporations who were you know they're
throwing away there are copies of
hanging around for the moment and
appealing to the nanny state to bail
them out why do they need a bail because
during the last few years of very high
profits instead of developing their own
productive capacity and you know I'm
barely mentioned at doing something for
the undeserving public they were buying
back stock to enrich themselves and
there and there have been shoot their
executives pay up to the skyrocketing so
he has a now they're not prepared so the
public has to come back and bail them
out again something we're familiar with
in the Reagan period now that can be
changed unfortunately it's not possible
at this moment not to bail out the the
criminals who have led to the crisis you
have to be too important for the economy
but you can put conditions and say you
get one penny from Plus is that a stop
permanently any stock buyback period
you've got to stop any use of tax havens
period you and that can be enforced
it was enforced for 50 years pre-written
can be again you got to put working
people on your board of management board
of directors if you feel you can't do it
then quit somebody else will do it those
conditions can be imposed they don't
destroy capitalism but they do mitigate
it's cruel impact and give us breathing
space to move further all of these
things are feasible lots more like okay
it's not that we don't have
opportunities and choices we do we have
to understand what's happening
understand its roots it corrects for the
opportunities work out the proper
tactics you know not crazy one sensible
ones and we can get out of this mess we
don't do it it's gonna be disasters
well you leave us with both serious
analysis of what we face the dangers we
face we'll also some hope and I deeply
appreciate that and I know our viewers
who will as well
