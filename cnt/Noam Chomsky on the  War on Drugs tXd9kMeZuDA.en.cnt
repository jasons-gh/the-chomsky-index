well let's take a look at the war on
drugs Brent it has been declared
probably 20 times in the last 20 years
or so every couple of years it's
declared its declared against a
background of understanding for example
it was studied years ago by the RAND
Corporation the main government advisory
corporation and the Army in which they
investigated the just straight
cost-benefit analysis of various ways of
treating the drug problem drug problems
here it's not in Columbia so they said
well you know which ways of dealing with
the problem here are cost-effective and
they found which will surprise no one
who's paid attention to the history that
the most cost-effective way of doing it
is prevention and treatment okay in fact
if you think about it that's the way one
of the worst drug problems has been
handled I mean there is a drug which is
much worse than cocaine it's called
tobacco it kills far more people then
cocaine does and it was handled pretty
well by cultural change so if you look
through the 1980s it's a class issue so
people with education you know degree of
privilege simply adopted a more healthy
lifestyle they stopped smoking they
stopped eating red meat they didn't
drink as much coffee and so on there
were no police you know that nobody
carry out chemical warfare in North
Carolina and Kentucky to destroy at the
back of the field they sit was simply an
educational process a kind of cultural
change that led to a significant decline
of the use of by far the most dangerous
drug among people who were a part of
that cultural change that took place
thanks to their privilege okay now
that's exactly what the rand on the army
a study years ago they weren't of course
discussing tobacco but that's exactly
what they concluded about hard drugs and
marijuana they said the best
the cheapest and most effective way of
dealing with it is prevention and
treatment well in another way use of
police okay that's much less effective
and much more costly there's a third way
interdiction at the borders that's still
more expensive by quite a large margin
and far less and far more costly and the
worst way of all way more costly than
anything else and totally ineffective is
what we call fumigation but would in
fact is chemical warfare I've been down
to southern Colombia and seen some of it
its chemical warfare which is driving
huge numbers of peasants off their land
destroying their crops Colombia has the
second biggest refugee problem the world
after Sudan and they're driven at the
urban slums and multinational
corporations come in and start mining
and so on and so forth that's the least
effective and the most costly and you
know the fact that we do it again if you
can kind of abstract yourself and
pretend you're a Martian looking at this
it's just kind of unimaginable I mean
the number of people in Colombia killed
by us tobacco is way beyond the number
of Americans killed by Colombian cocaine
maybe go a country like China it's
astronomically more okay do they have a
right to come to the United States and
carry out chemical warfare and North
Carolina and Kentucky because they have
a tobacco problem and it's coming from
here honey you can't even speak the
words it's so outlandish but we do it we
think it's just fine you know even
though it's known to be the least
effective the most costly and totally
immoral as we see right away if we think
the situation reversed well that's been
going on for decades that's the war on
drugs the use it has affected the use of
drugs here at all let's hear from Ernie
in Tucson Arizona Ernie welcome to talk
of the nation hi I'm a an internal
medicine physician as well as they were
district pharmacists in Arizona also
perform homeland security exams on for
patients are immigrating the United
States were situated about 86 miles from
the border
and I see the intersection of those
three different fields and I think
personally that they should legalize
drugs all drugs that they can control
them tax them provide prevention and
treatment program just like to do for
alcohol decrease the amount of home
invasion across the border as well as
decrease the number of narco traffic and
death along the border decrease the
incentive for people bringing drugs
across I mean I had a piece of property
26 miles north the border people were
walking across the border all the time
you have buses full of illegal
immigrants from the way to the small
town 26 miles north the border and for
my from my perspective what you see on
the news are these huge drug busts of
kilos of marijuana and cocaine yet when
I report to the local police that
there's somebody forging my name on
narcotics at the local pharmacy they
send me over the detectives i'll either
ricordi i never get a call back i
reported this to DEA i get the same
treatment so I think that it's all
huffing and puffing that there is no
serious program to try to decrease the
amount of narcotics come in this country
I think it's more for political reasons
but they can get a foothold these
countries set up more army bases etc
Ernie let's give our guests a chance to
answer thanks very much well on the
legalization issue it's not something
that's discussed either by myself or in
the in the in the White House no country
no country in the world has legalized
drugs and if you think about the
legalized drugs we do have we're talking
about the prescriptions earlier we know
that there are lots of problems we're
not able to control them we're not able
to keep them out of the hands of young
people we're not actually able to keep
them from causing deaths among a lot of
people so I don't think legalization is
anything that that's going to be
entertained or discussed at any level
