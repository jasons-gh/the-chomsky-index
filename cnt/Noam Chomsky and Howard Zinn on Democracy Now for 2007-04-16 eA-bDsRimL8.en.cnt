report we're broadcasting today from
Boston
it's Patriots day here in Massachusetts
a state holiday to mark the start of the
Revolutionary War in a democracy now
special we're joined today by two of the
city's leading dissidents Noam Chomsky
and Howard Zinn Noam Chomsky began
teaching linguistics at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
Cambridge over 50 years ago he's the
author of scores of books on linguistics
and on u.s. foreign policy his most
recent book is called failed States the
abuse of power and the assault on
democracy Howard Zinn is one of the
country's most widely read historians he
taught political science at Boston
University from 1964 to 1988 his classic
work of people's history of the United
States has sold over one-and-a-half
million copies it's altered how many
teach the nation's history Howard Zinn's
latest book is called a power
governments cannot suppress today an
hour with Howard Zinn and Noam Chomsky
in a rare interview with them together
and I welcome you both to Democracy Now
what a day to be here this is the day of
the Boston Marathon
it is raining it is a major storm
outside and tens of thousands of people
well we're either of you planning to run
today well today is patriots day
Howard's and what does patriotism mean
to you I'm glad you said what it means
to me it means to me something different
that means to a lot of people I think
who have distorted the idea of
patriotism patriotism to me means
doing what you think your country should
be doing patriotism means supporting
your government when you think it's
doing right opposing your government
when you think it's doing wrong
patriotism to me means really what the
Declaration of Independence suggests and
that is that government is an artificial
entity government is set up and this is
what the Declaration of Independence is
about government is set up by the people
in order to fulfill certain
responsibilities equality life liberty
the pursuit of happiness and when
according to the Declaration of
Independence the government violates
those responsibilities then and these
are the words of the Declaration of
Independence it is the right of the
people to alter or abolish the
government in other words the government
is not holy
the government is not to be obeyed when
the government is wrong and so to me
patriotism in its best sense means
thinking about the people in the country
the principles for which the country
stands for and it requires opposing the
government when the government violates
those principles so today for instance
the highest act of patriotism
I suggest would be opposing the war in
Iraq and calling for withdrawal of
troops from Iraq simply because
everything about the war violates the
fundamental principles of equality life
liberty the pursuit of happiness
not just for Americans but for people in
another part of the world
so yes patriotism today requires
citizens to be active on many many
different fronts to oppose government
policies on the war government policies
which have taken trillions of dollars
this country's Treasury and used it for
war and militarism
that's what patriotism would require
today Noam Chomsky the headlines today
just this weekend one of the bloodiest
and months and Iraq the number of
prisoners in US jails in Iraq has
reached something like eighteen thousand
who knows if that's not an underestimate
an Associated Press photographer remains
in jail imprisoned by US authorities
without charge for more than a year the
Health Ministry has found 70 percent of
Baghdad schoolchildren showing symptoms
of trauma related stress your assessment
now of the situation there this is one
of the worst catastrophes in in military
history and also in political history
the recent most recent studies of the
red cross show that Iraq has suffered
the worst decline in child mortality
infant mortality increase in infant
mortality known but it's since 1990 and
that is it's a combination of the effect
of the murderous and brutal sanctions
regime which we don't talk much about
which devastated the society through the
1990s strengthen said I'm saying
compelled the population to rely on him
for survival it probably saved him from
the fate of other whole long series of
other tyrants who were overthrown by
their own people supported by the US and
then came the war on top of it which is
simply increased the horrors the decline
is so is unprecedented
the increase in infant mortality under
violent unprecedented it's now below the
level of countries and worse than the
countries in sub-saharan Africa that's
one index of what's happened
the most plausible probable measure of
debts in a deaths in a study sponsored
by MIT incidentally carried out by
leading specialists in Iraq and here
last October was about 650,000 killed
it's soon a little push a million there
several million people have fled
including the large part of the
professional classes the people who
could in principle help rebuild the
country and without going on it's a
hideous catastrophe and getting worse
it's also worth stressing that
aggressors do not have any rights this
is a clear-cut case of aggression and
violation of the UN Charter the supreme
international crime in the words of the
Nuremberg Tribunal aggressors simply
have no rights to make any decisions
they have responsibilities the
responsibilities are first of all to pay
enormous reparations and that includes
for the sanction effect of the sanctions
in fact it ought to include the support
for saddam hussein during the 1980s
which was a torture for iraqis and worse
for Iranian the pay reparations hold
those responsible accountable and attend
to the will of the victims doesn't
necessarily mean followed blindly that
certainly attend to it and the will of
the victims is known there are regular
us run polls in Iraq the government and
holding institutions the just an
overwhelming support for either
immediate or quick withdrawal of US
troops about 80 percent to think that
the presence of US troops increases the
level of violence over 60 percent think
that the troops are legitimate targets
this is at least all of Iraq if you take
the figures for Arab Iraq where the
troops are actually deployed it's
considered
we hire and these figures keep going up
there unmentioned virtually unreported
scarcely alluded to in the
baker-hamilton critical report that'll
be our prime concern along with the
concerns of Americans Vice President
Cheney saying this war can be won yeah
that which is an interesting study being
done right now by a former Russian
soldier in Afghanistan in the late 1980s
is now student and tirado who's
comparing the Russian press and Russian
political figures and military leaders
what they were saying about Afghanistan
comparing it with what Cheney others and
the press are saying about Iraq and not
to your great surprise change a few
names and comes out about the same
they were also saying the war in
Afghanistan could be won and they were
right if they had increased the level of
violence sufficiently they could have
won the war in Iraq any rate in
Afghanistan they were also pointing out
of course they described the correctly
you know the heroism of the Russian
troops their efforts to bring assistance
to the poor people of Afghanistan to
protect them from the us-run Islamic
fundamentalist terrorist forces their
dedication the rights they have won for
people in Afghanistan and the and the
warning that if they pull out for the
total disaster mayhem they must stay and
win unfortunately they were right about
that too and they did pull out it was a
total disaster the us-backed forces
toward the places to shred so terrible
that the population even welcome to
Taliban when they came in so yes those
arguments can always be given the
Germans could have argued if they'd had
the force that they didn't that they
could have won the war the Second World
War I mean the question is not can you
win
the question is should you be there you
say in truck med Afghanistan sure the
Russians could have won if they had
could have tolerated the level of
violence what are you saying about Iraq
do you feel the same way
depends what you mean by when the United
States certainly has the capacity to
what's the country out I mean there's no
question about that if that's winning
yeah you can win it's in terms of the
goals that the United States attempted
to achieve the US government not the
United States to install a client regime
which would be obedient to the United
States which permit military bases which
would allow US and British corporations
to control the energy resources and so
on in terms of achieving that goal I
don't know if they can achieve that but
that they could destroy the countries
beyond question we're talking to Noam
Chomsky and Howard Zinn on this Patriots
Day that's celebrated in Massachusetts
we're in Boston Massachusetts and we'll
be back with them in a minute
under the ground because someone tells
me that deaths coming around
I will not carry myself down to die if I
die let me die with my there's been
rumors of wars wars that have been the
meaning of life has been lost in the
wind some people are thinking that the
end is close by stead of learning to
live they are learning to die let me die
let me die in my footsteps

are taking those headlines as we
continue today talking about the state
of the world with two of the leading
dissidents here in this country Howard
Zinn legendary historian author of many
books a people's history of the United
States as well as well his latest as a
power governments cannot suppress we're
also joined by Noam Chomsky Noam Chomsky
linguist at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology his latest book has failed
States the abuse of power and the
assault on democracy Howard you went to
North Vietnam can you talk about how the
Vietnam War ended and also your
experience there why you went well
I went to North Vietnam and early 1968
with father Daniel Berrigan and the two
of us went actually at the request of
the North Vietnamese government who were
going to release the first three Airmen
prisoners American Flyers who were
imprisoned in North Vietnam and and the
North Vietnamese wanted to release them
during the Tet holiday also the Tet
Offensive sort of as a gesture I suppose
a goodwill gesture and and they asked
for representatives of the American
peace movement and so Daniel Berrigan
and I went to Hanoi for that reason and
of course it was it was an educational
experience for us no one was talking
about in response to your question about
the victory and winning and kind of
question is of course why should we win
if winning means destroying a country
and there's still people who say oh we
could have won the Vietnam War as if the
the question was you know can we win or
can we lose instead of what are we doing
to these people and yes I know I'm said
yes we could win in Iraq by destroying
all of Iraq the Russians could have won
and Afghanistan by destroying all of
Afghanistan we could have won in Vietnam
by dropping nuclear bombs and killing
instead of killing two million people in
Vietnam killing 10 million people in
Vietnam and if that would be considered
victory you know then who would take
satisfaction in that the what we saw in
Vietnam is I think what people are
seeing in Iraq and that is huge numbers
of pink dot people dying for no reason
at all and what we saw in Vietnam was
the American army being sent halfway
around the world to a country which was
not threatening us and we were
destroying the people in the country and
here in Iraq were going the
the way also going halfway around the
world to do the same thing to them and
our experience in Iraq contradicted as I
think the experiences of people who are
on the ground in Iraq contradicted again
and again the statements of American
officials the statements of the high
military statements like oh we're only
bombing military targets oh these are
accidents when so many civilians are
killed and yes as Cheney said victory is
around the corner what we saw in Vietnam
was horrifying and obviously it was
horrifying
even to GIS in Vietnam because they
began to come back from Vietnam and to
oppose the war and to form the yet Nam
Veterans Against the War
so you know we we saw we saw villages as
far away from any military target as you
can imagine absolutely destroyed and
children killed in their graves still
fresh by American jet planes coming over
in the middle of the night you know when
I hear them talk about John McCain as a
hero I say to myself we asked he was a
prisoner and prisoners now treated and
everywhere and this is terrible but John
McCain like the other American Flyers
what were they doing they were bombing
defenseless people
and so yes Vietnam is something that by
the way it's still not taught very well
in American schools I spoke to a group
of people in an advanced history class
not long ago a hundred kids asked them
how many people here have heard of the
mule eye massacre no no hand was
released we are not teaching Vietnam if
we were teaching the history of Vietnam
as it should be taught then the American
people from the start would have opposed
the war instead of waiting three or four
years for a majority of the American
people to declare their opposition to
the war Noam Chomsky you went to
Cambodia after the bombing
I went to Laos and North Vietnam when
and why two years after Howard early
1970 I spent a week in Laos a very
moving week happened to be in Laos right
after the CIA a mercenary army had
cleared out about 30,000 people from the
plain of jars in the in northern Laos
where they had been subjected to what
was then the most fierce bombing in
human history it was succeeded shortly
after by Cambodia
these are poor peasant society probably
most of them didn't even know they were
in Laos there was nothing there the
planes were sent there because the
bombing of North Vietnam had been
temporarily stopped and there was
nothing for the Air Force to do so they
bombed Laos they had been living in
caves for over two years at trying to
farm at night they had finally been
driven out by the mercenary army to the
surroundings of vientiane and i spent a
lot of time interviewing refugees with
fred branchman who did heroic work and
bringing this story finally to the
american people and so war and
interesting things in laos then I went
to North Vietnam where I also as Howard
had been had been invited by the
government but I was actually invited to
teach it was a bombing pause a short
bombing pause and they were able to
bring people in from outlying areas back
to Hanoi and the Polytechnic University
or what was left of it the ruins of the
Polytechnic University they came and I
lectured on just about anything I knew
anything about these are people who have
been out of touch with faculty students
others had been out of touch with the
world for five years and they asked me
everything from
Norman Mailer writing these days two
technical questions and linguistics and
mathematics and whatever else I could
say anything about I also traveled
around a little bit not very much but a
few days but enough to see what Howard
described too right close to Illinois I
never got very far away which was the
most protected area because in Hanoi
there were embassies and journalists and
so the bombing those severe was nothing
like what it was much farther away but
even there you could see the ruins of
villages the shell of the major hospital
in tanta which had been bombed by
accident of course areas that we're just
moonscapes you know where there had been
villages in an effort to destroy a
bridge and so on so that those were my
two weeks in Laos and Vietnam you were a
linguistics professor at MIT at the
tunnel so why did you go what drove you
to and what was the response here at
home well I I was able to actually I had
intended to go only for one week to
North Vietnam but there really wanted
other details the the UN bureaucrat in
Laos who's organizing flights was a very
bored Indian bureaucrat who had nothing
to do and apparently his only joy in the
world was making things difficult for
people who wanted to do something not
untypical and fortunately for me he made
us he made it difficult for me and my
companions that gallant dick Fernandez
to go to North Vietnam so I had a week
in Laos which was an extremely valuable
week I wrote about it in some detail but
I was teaching at the time I was to be
away it was a vacation week and so
actually I thought linguistics and the
Polytechnic University about the
opposition here at home and your level
of protest at MIT what did you do well
MIT was a curious situation
I happen to work in the laboratory
which was 100% supported by the three
armed services but it was also one of
the centers of anti-war resistance
starting in 1965 along with an artist
friend in Boston Herald Tova SH we
organized tried to organize national tax
resistance its 1965 like our that was
giving talks taking part in
demonstrations getting arrested by 1966
we were becoming involved directly in
support for draft resistance helping
deserters others and it just continued
it's worth remembering there's one often
hears today justified complaints about
how little protests there is against the
war in Iraq but that's very misleading
and here is Howard was saying a little
sense of history is useful the protest
against the war in Iraq is far beyond
the protest against the war in Vietnam
at any comparable level large-scale
protest against the war in Vietnam did
not really begin until there were
several hundred thousand US troops in
South Vietnam the country had been
virtually destroyed the bombing had been
extended to the north allow us soon to
Cambodia where incidentally we have just
learned or rather we haven't learned
what we could learn if we had a free
press that the bombing in Cambodia which
is known to be horrendous it was
actually five times as high as what's
reported greater than the entire Allied
bombing in all of World War two on a
defenseless peasant society which turned
peasants into enraged fanatics during
those years the Khmer Rouge grew from
nothing few thousand scattered people to
hundreds of thousands and then that led
to the part of Cambodia that were
allowed to think about that was the
first word this is this but the war the
real protest against the war in Vietnam
came had a period far beyond what has
yet been reached in
RAK first few years of the war there was
almost nothing
I mean it's so little protest that
virtually nobody in the United States
even those when the war began
Kennedy invaded South Vietnam in 1962
that was after seven years of efforts to
impose a Latin American style terror
state which had killed tens of thousands
of people and elicited resistance 1962
Kennedy sent the US Air Force to start
bombing South Vietnam under South
Vietnamese markings but nobody was
deluded by that initiated chemical
warfare to destroy crops and ground
cover and started programs which rounded
ultimately millions of people into what
amount of the concentration camps called
strategic Hamlet's where they were
surrounded by barbed wire to protect
them as it was said from the guerrillas
who everyone who they were voluntarily
supporting is there an indigenous South
Vietnamese resistance that was 1962 you
couldn't get to people in a living room
to talk about it by in October 1965
right here in Boston most maybe the most
liberal city in the country they were
then already a couple hundred thousand
troops there bombing North Vietnam had
started we tried to have our first major
public demonstration against the war on
the Boston Common the usual place for
meetings I was supposed to be one of the
speakers that nobody hear a word the
meeting was totally broken up off of
students marching over from universities
by others hundreds of state police which
kept people from being murdered the next
day's newspaper The Boston Globe liberal
newspaper was full of denunciations of
the people who dared make my old
statements about bombing the north in
fact right through the protests which
did reach a substantial scale and we're
very significant especially the
resistance it was mostly directed
against the war in North Vietnam the
attack on South Vietnam was mostly
ignored
incidentally the same is true of
government planning we know about that
from the Pentagon Papers now many
subsequent documents there was
meticulous planning about the bombing of
the north
just bursty bomb and how far should you
go and so on bombing in the south and in
the doc internal documents it almost
nothing a very simple reason for it the
bombing of the South was costless nobody
was going to shoot you down nobody's
going to complain you know do whatever
you want
wipe the place out which is pretty much
what happened the north vietnam was
dangerous you could hit Russian ships
and the Haiphong Harbor as I said they
were embassies in Hanoi people could
report you were bombing an internal
Chinese railroad which happened to pass
through North Vietnam so there could be
international repercussions and costs so
therefore it was very carefully
calibrated if you look at say Robert
McNamara's memoirs a lot of discussion
of the bombing of North Vietnam
virtually nothing about the bombing of
South Vietnam which even in early in
second 1965 was it triple the scale of
the bombing of the north and I've been
going on for years now there's a great
deal more protest actually one
interesting illustration and that is
Arthur Schlesinger the crepes
best-known American historian in the
case of the war in Vietnam the earlier
supported fact if you read his thousand
days as story the Kennedy administration
it's barely mentioned just wonderful
thing that's happening by 1966 as there
was beginning to be concerned about the
costs of the war we were reaching
situation rather like a lead opinion
today about Iraq it's too costly we
might not be able to win and so on so I
think I wrote I'm almost quoting that we
all pray that the Hawks will be right in
believing that more troops will allow us
to win and if they are right we'll be
praising the wisdom and statesmanship
American government in winning a war in
Vietnam after turning the land turning
it into a land of ruin and wreck so
we'll be praising their wisdom and
statesmanship but they probably won't
work
you can translate that into today's
commentaries which are called the doves
on the other hand greatly to his credit
when the bombing of Iraq started my
Schlesinger took the strongest position
of spare anyone I've seen in
condemnation of it first day it's so
strong that it was almost never didn't
appear in the press but I haven't heard
a word about it since as the vine began
he said this is a date which will live
in infamy and he recalled President
Roosevelt's words at Pearl Harbor I
think that will live in infamy because
the United States is following the path
of the Japanese fascists very strong
statement and I think that sort of
reflects a difference that you see in
public attitudes to opposition to
aggression is far higher than it was in
60s Howard Howard's and how did Vietnam
end the war end and what are the
parallels that you see today
do you see parallels today well I
suppose if if you believe that Henry
Kissinger deserve the Nobel Prize and
you would think that the war ended
because Henry Kissinger went to Paris
and negotiated with Vietnamese but the
world the war ended I think because
finally after that slow buildup of
protest I think the war ended because
the protests in the United States
reached a crescendo which couldn't be
ignored and and because the GIS coming
home were turning against the war and
because soldiers in the field were
well they're throwing grenades under the
officers tents you know the fragging
phenomenon I mean there's a book called
soldiers in revolt by many and David
Cortright
and he details how much dissidents there
was how much opposition to the war there
was among the soldiers in Vietnam and
how this was manifested in their
behavior and desertions a huge number of
desertions and and essentially the
government of the United States found it
impossible to continue the war the ROTC
chapters were closing down in some ways
it's similar to a situation now with the
government in Iraq the government in is
finding our government is finding that
though we don't have enough soldiers to
fight a war sort of sending them back
again and again and with the recruiting
sergeants here in the United States are
going to enormous lengths and lying to
young people about what will await them
or what benefits they will get the
government is desperate to maintain the
military force today in Iraq and and I
think in Vietnam this dissonance among
the military Innis inability to really
carry on the war militarily was a
crucial factor of course along with the
fact who simply could not defeat the
Vietnamese resistance and resistance
movements and as well we're finding out
in in Iraq today resistance movements
against a foreign aggressor they will
get very desperate they will not give in
and and the resistance movement in
Vietnam would not surrender and so the
US government found it obviously
impossible to win without just dropping
nuclear bombs destroying the country and
and making it clear to the world that
the United States was an outlaw nation
and and and impossible to hold the
support of the people at home and so yes
we finally did what a number of us have
been asking for many many years to
withdraw from Vietnam and the same
arguments were made at that time that is
when we called in 1967 well I wrote a
book in 1967 close Vietnam the logical
withdrawal and and the the reaction to
that was you know this
we can't withdraw it'll be terrible if
we withdraw you know there'll be civil
war if we withdraw there'll be a
bloodbath if we withdraw and so we
didn't withdraw on the war went on you
know for for another you know six years
another eight years if you you know six
years for the Americans to enjoy eight
years totally the war went on and on and
another twenty thousand Americans were
killed another million Vietnamese were
killed and and when we finally was was
drew no there was no bloodbath I mean it
wasn't that everything was fine when we
was druid and they were you know
reeducation camps set up and and Chinese
the people would driven out of Hanoi on
boats and so wasn't but the point is
that there was no bloodbath the
bloodbath was what we were doing in
Vietnam just as today when they say oh
there will be civil war there will be
chaos if we withdraw from Iraq there is
civil war there is chaos and I know was
pointing out what we have done to Iraq
with two million people driven from
their homes and children and the dire
straits and no water no food and so the
remembrance of Vietnam is important if
we are going to make it clear that we
must withdraw from Iraq
and find another way not for the United
States for some international group
preferably a group composed mostly of
representatives of Arab nations to come
into Iraq and help mediate whatever
strife there is among the various
factions in Iraq but certainly the
absolute necessary first step in Iraq
now is what we should have done in
Vietnam 1967 and that is simply get out
as fast as ships and planes can carry us
out we're going to break and come back
to this discussion howard zinn historian
he'll be speaking in Faneuil Hall
tonight at 7 o'clock in New York City
and historic site in Boston where we're
broadcasting from in Boston and he'll be
launching a power governments cannot
suppress Noam Chomsky is our guest we'll
be back with him as well his book store
and fire all the bombs and guns
there are children hungry children there
are mothers fathers brothers they're
only pawns in your new Sarah Thompson
Sarah Thompson singing is it for freedom
this is democracy now democracynow.org
the war and peace report I'm Amy Goodman
my guests here in Boston as we broadcast
from Massachusetts on this Patriots Day
are Noam Chomsky Noam Chomsky professor
of linguistics at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and Howard's and
legendary historian taught at Spelman
for years till he was forced out because
he took the side of the young women
students then went to Boston University
and only recently in the last few years
was what given an honorary degree by
Spellman did you feel vindicated
I always feel in the kid Noam Chomsky
what did you think of Nancy Pelosi House
Speaker third and line in succession for
the presidency after Dick Cheney going
to Syria together with the first Muslim
Congress member in the United States
keith ellison from minneapolis the only
thing wrong with it was that it was the
third person in line I mean if the
United States were government
we're sincerely interested in bringing
about some measure of peace prosperity
stability in the region
instead of dominating it by force they
would of course be dealing with Syria
and with Iran pretty much the way the
baker-hamilton report proposed except
beyond what they proposed because they
propose they should be dealing with it
in matters concerning with Iraq but
there are regional issues in the case of
Syria they're issues related to Syria
itself but also to Lebanon and to Israel
Israel is in control of in fact has
annexed in violation of Security Council
orders has annexed a large part of
Syrian territory the Golan Heights Syria
is making it very clear that they are
interested in a peace settlement with
Israel which would involve as it should
the withdrawal of Israeli troops from
occupied territories is their seek are
their secret negotiations going on
between Israel and Syria never know
what's going on a secret but so far
Israel has been flatly refusing any
negotiations in fact the only debate
that's going on now is whether it's the
United States that's pressuring Israel
or Israel's pressuring the United States
to prevent negotiations on the Golan
Heights and in fact on the occupied
territories altogether this is called a
very contentious issue Israel Palestine
which is kind of surprising
it's a contentious issue only in the
United States and even not among the
American population
it's a contentious issue because the US
government and the Israeli government
are blocking a very broad international
consensus which has almost universal
support even the majority of Americans
and which has been on the table for
about 30 years
blocked by the US and Israel everyone
knows who was involved in this what the
general framework for a settlement is it
was put on the it was brought to the
secure
council in 1976 by the Arab states the
Jordan Syria and Egypt the so-called
confrontation States and the other Arab
states they proposed a two-state
settlement on the
internationally-recognized border a
settlement which included the wording of
UN 242 of the major resolution
recognition of the right of each state
in the region to exist in peace and
security within secure and recognized
boundaries that would include Israel and
a Palestinian state
it was vetoed by the United States not
similar resolution vetoed in 1980 it
won't run through the history but
throughout this whole history with
temporary and rare exceptions a couple
here and there the US has simply blocked
the settlement still does and Israel
rejected sometimes it's dramatic
in 1988 the Palestinian National Council
the head governing body formally
accepted a two-state settlement they had
tacitly accepted it before there was a
reaction from Israel immediately there
was a coalition government Shimon Peres
it's like Samir their reaction was
quoting that there cannot be an
additional Palestinian state between
Jordan and Israel additional implying
that Jordan already is a Palestinian
state so they can't be in another one
and the fate of the territories will be
settled according to the guidelines of
the State of Israel meeting shortly
after that the bush number one
administration totally endorsed that
proposal that was the Baker plan James
Baker plan of December 1989 fully
endorsed that proposal extreme rejection
ISM and so it continues with rare
exceptions just moving to today the Arab
League proposal has been
reintroduced its 2002 but they brought
it up again couple of weeks ago that
goes even further calls for full
normalization of relations with Israel
within the framework of the
international consensus on a two-state
settlement which might involve to use
official US terminology from far back
minor and mutual modifications like
straightening out the border words in
the wrong place or something and then
their technicalities to be resolved
plenty of them but that's the basic
framework supported by the Arab world by
Europe by the non-aligned countries
Latin America and others it's supported
by Iran doesn't get reported here
everyone loves Ahmadinejad's crazed
statements but do not report the
statements of his superior the Ayatollah
Khamenei who's in charge of
International Affairs modern chat isn't
a new with it
it was declared a couple of times that
Iran supports the Arab League physician
Hezbollah in Lebanon has made it clear
that they don't like it they don't
believe in recognizing Israel but if the
Palestinians accept that they will not
disrupt that there are 11 EES
organization Hamas has said they would
accept the the Arab League consensus
that leaves the United States and Israel
in splendid isolation even more so than
in the past 30 years in rejecting a
political settlement
so it's contentious in a sense but not
in that there's no way to resolve we
know how to resolve change depends on
people here if the majority of the
American population who also accept this
decided to do something about it yeah
change do you think it's changing for
example with Carter's book coming up I
think it's it's one of the signs of
change and there are many others there's
just a change in mood in the country I
mean anybody who's been giving talks
about this just knows it from personal
experience I mean not very long ago if I
was
giving a talk on the Middle East I mean
even at MIT you know alone anywhere else
there would be armed police prison at
least undercover police to prevent
violence disruption and breakup of
meetings and so on that's a thing of the
past by now it's much easier to talk
about this they were actually part of
Carter's book was quite interesting
I mean Carter's book was essentially
repeating what is known around the world
Palestine peace not a party yeah he
there were a couple of errors in the
book they were ignored the only serious
error in the book which a fact checker
should have picked up is that Carter
accepted a kind of party line on the
Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982
Israel invaded Lebanon killed maybe
fifteen twenty thousand people destroyed
much of southern Lebanon they were able
to do it because the Reagan
administration vetoed Security Council
resolutions and supported them and so on
the claim here you know Thomas Friedman
or someone is that Israel invaded in
response to showing of the Galilee from
by Palestinians Palestinian terror
attacks and Carter repeats that it's not
true there was the border there was a
ceasefire the Palestinians observed that
despite regular Israeli attempts
something heavy bombing and others to
elicit some response that would be a
pretext for the planned invasion when
there was no pretext they invaded anyway
that's the only serious error in the
book ignored there's some very valuable
things in the book also ignored one of
them perhaps the most important is that
Carter's the first I think in the
mainstream in the United States to
report what was known and dissident
circles and talked about namely that the
famous roadmap which the quartet
suggested as a steps toward settlement
of the problem the roadmap was instantly
rejected by Israel
I'm gonna interrupt you here because
we're gonna have to end the broadcast
we're going to bring the folks part two
of this conversation in the next few
days but I want to end with Howard
tonight you'll be a Fanueil Hall in
Boston do you have hope right now as a
man who has been part of dissident
movements for many years led them
chronicled them in these last few
minutes of this first part of our
discussion by the way you're going to be
with me in Faneuil tonight but do I have
hope is that what you're asking
well I do I think American people
basically decent and good people and if
they learn the facts and as they are
learning the facts they become aroused
as they did during Vietnam as they did
in the years of the civil rights
movement I'm gonna leave it there now
but part two later in the week Howard
Zinn Noam Chomsky thank you very much
want to thank Joe qudoos and Mike Burke
and becky stalley and our folks here in
new york
Robbie Karen and Boston and Denis
Moynihan I'm Amy Goodman thanks so much
for joining us
