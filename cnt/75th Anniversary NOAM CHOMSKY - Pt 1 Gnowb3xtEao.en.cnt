it's fantastic especially from upstage
to see such a full house tonight and
wonderful that so many Syracuse ins and
friends from across Central New York
could be here to see Noam Chomsky and
I'd especially like to thank the
Syracuse Peace Council for all their
good works and especially for organizing
this evening I can think of no better
birthday gift to celebrate your 75 years
of activism than to hear from the
preeminent political thinker of the
modern era professor Noam Chomsky
and I'd also like to thank the Peace
Council for asking me to introduce no it
is an honor i have not had since i was a
student at MIT back in the 90s for the
few of us MIT students who were
activists we had an amazing array of
activists professors there to teach us
certainly gnome was chief among them but
there was also professors like Mel king
and Urban Studies and Martin diskin in
the studies of Central America Lois comp
and literature Ruth Perry in women's
studies Vera Castillo kowski in my own
field of physics and I don't mean just
in the classroom though that opportunity
was foremost gnome and Louie conf would
teach us an evening class so that those
of us who happen to be graduate students
and people who were employees and even
members of the community could come to
that class in the evening and audit but
sometimes repeatedly audit that class
that was meant for students so that we
would have the chance to hear and learn
from them on a regular basis and we had
other opportunities of students we
student activists organized a radical
newspaper which we called the thistle
and at any opportunity when there was an
explosive new development on the world
stage we knew that we could always just
send an email or give a call and we
could count unknown for an article about
anything from the Gulf War to the
invasions in Central America to
apartheid he was always there for us as
students now for professor whose
writings are the third most referenced
body of work after the Bible and
Shakespeare
and for an activist who has a speaking
schedule so full that he has to plan
opportunities like this over a year in
advance gnome was always there for us as
students after knows political analysis
class was cancelled two of my friends
just decided to get up their nerve and
go and ask him for an independent study
and his response was fine every
Wednesday and I think ones now a
professor at MIT and the other is now a
professor at Harvard in those days when
we were interacting with other political
activists across the country because at
that time there was a lot of heavy
activism going on was often asked by my
counterparts at other University why is
known at MIT shouldn't he be at some
more radical place like Berkeley clearly
these people did not recognize that
gnome is what on the first and foremost
but foremost a linguist and the father
of modern linguistics he is foremost a
scientist which at MIT originally meant
that he was within the department of
electrical engineering and computer
science though they they have their own
department album but from my perspective
MIT is exactly where gnome should be I
have to admit my own bias I'm a
scientist I'm a physicist and in my
opinion what distinguishes gnomes method
of political analysis is that he uses
scientific principles and the scientific
method to understand politics and power
dynamics and that's why he was such a
perfect teacher for those of us who
happen to be at MIT as a scientist known
analyzes without any Aristotelian
preconceptions about what the actors on
the world stage might be saying or
whether they are abiding by the
principles that they profess instead he
has taught us to analyze the data to
look at the history of events
to analyze the power dynamics so when
the US administration used to talk about
human rights it was known that did the
analysis that saw the correlation
between human rights violations I was
reported by independent organizations
and US aid that we were funding those
people who were committing the greatest
atrocities we were befriending the
dictators of the world and that was no
more articulately put than in his book
turning the tide which for the first
chapter just lists the atrocities that
were committed in the war on Central
America with our funding of five hundred
million dollars a year to places like El
Salvador and when the news media talents
balanced reporting where people talk
about how we have a free press in the
United States it was known Chomsky and
ed Herman who in their book
manufacturing consent tallied up the
column inches and looked at who actually
was getting the greatest voice within
our supposedly fair and balanced
reporting and also within that same book
how the news media in all of its forms
is slowly being consolidated into fewer
and fewer hands and how that financial
analysis is going to automatically mean
that the voices that represent us are
going to be the voices of the few and
the voices of the wealthy and when
pundants talk about the terrorist threat
it is known who's quick to tally up who
around the world has done the most
killing in whatever form that happens be
it army or armed group as my physics
doctoral advisor used to say the data is
the truth and no must all self
consistent and predictive analysis and
that theory of power dynamics regardless
of whether it agrees with your
assumptions is the best representation
of the truth nome has given us a
powerful gift the power of analysis the
power to analyze the world dynamics
frankly and honestly sometimes will like
what we see and sometimes we don't but
we can't work to change the world until
we understand it ladies and gentlemen it
is my great pleasure to introduce
professor Noam Chomsky
I was asked to can you hear me with no
how's that better okay I was asked to
talk about what drives us foreign policy
sorry Oh how's that better okay and what
drives us foreign policy and what we can
do to change it a good way to start an
inquiry into what drives foreign policy
is to start with what doesn't drive it
and that's pretty easy to determine
there's a simple method just took I'll
take a look at the conventional theses
as to the roots of foreign policy and
ignore them because they you can quickly
see that they don't work so the major
thesis constantly is that foreign policy
is driven by noble intent so
humanitarian intervention and bringing
democracy and so on that acclaim as far
as I know as close to universal almost
every foreign policy initiative by any
state expresses noble intent and it's
very familiar in our own history back to
the very beginning so you might say that
US foreign policy begins when the
pilgrims arrived in Massachusetts and
they came with the most noble of
objectives you can see them on the
internet if you look up the Great Seal
of the bay colony of Massachusetts three
hundred and eighty years ago it depicts
an Indian with his Spears pointed down
sign of peace and a scroll coming out of
his mouth saying come over and help us
so the pilgrims who were coming were
noble humanitarians who were responding
to the plea of the poor pagans to come
and Christianize them and help them and
incidentally exterminate them but that
that's one of those things collateral
damage that's called these days and as I
say that is universal so if you read say
Hitler's speeches when he was taking
over trick Slovakia or invading Poland
full of the most humane uplifting
rhetoric or Japanese fascists when they
were rampaging in China and in the hope
with the intention of creating a earthly
paradise for the people they were
massacring and protect them from the
Chinese bandits were who were inflicting
damage on them and that you might search
and see if you can find an exception to
that it's pretty rare so what it means
is that the claim of noble intent simply
carries no information literally it's
completely predictable so therefore it
carries no information even in the
technical sense of the word so you can
disregard a second thesis is that
foreign policy is driven by what's
called the national interest what's the
national interest so for example is the
say take the CEO of General Electric and
cleans the floor of his office do they
have the same interests well not exactly
there's some respects in which there are
some shared interests for example the
interest in security and it's very
commonly argued that security search for
security is what drives policy that's
pretty easily testable so take for
example of the invasion of Iraq now that
was undertaken with the expectation that
it would increase the threat of terror
in fact it did by about a factor of
seven the first year is that undertaken
to preserve security and hardly it was
recently an inquiry in Britain jokate
inquiry looking into the roots of the
war the planning for the war and the
head of their mi5 essentially the FBI
testified that both British intelligence
and the US intelligence knew quite well
that there was no threat from Iraq but
that invading it would create a thread
which indeed it did others react pretty
much the same way now there's one
exception to this foreign policy and
domestic policy are driven by a search
for security in a very special sense
security for those groups in the society
that Adam Smith called the Masters of
mankind those who basically owned the
society and as he described are the
principal architects of policy and
design it so that their own interests
will be well served no matter how
Grievous the impact on the domestic
population that's a thesis that holds up
pretty well
as modern more sophisticated versions
but it's it's simple and essentially
true so take for example the two
thousand eight election obama won the
election because he was able to outspend
McCain is rival and the main reason he
was able to do it was because there was
a flow of funding from the financial
institutions like core of the economy
these days and they preferred him to
McCain so they poured money into his
campaign and he was able to swing the
election well they expect to be paid off
you don't give money for nothing if
you're among the Masters of mankind and
they were the country was in a deep
recession when Obama came in the first
task was to create a commission to
economic commission to try to find the
way out of the recession if you take a
look at who was on it he was very
careful to exclude all critics of the
policies that led to the recession
including Nobel laureates and picked the
people who designed the policies that
created the recession almost without
exception and there there was a result
read you the version of the result that
was just produced by the Special
Inspector for government special
inspector for the bailout program Neil
Barofsky he points out that there was a
legislative act that authorized the
bailout and it was a bargain the bargain
was that the financial institutions that
created the crisis it would be saved by
the taxpayer and the victims of their
misdeeds would be somewhat compensated
by measures to protect home values and
preserve homeownership the core of the
recession was an eight trillion dollar
housing bubble that collapsed leaving
people with no home
no kappa well he goes on to say that
only the first part of the bargain was
kept the financial institutions were
rewarded lavishly for causing the crisis
and forgiven for outright crimes but as
he puts it the rest of the program
floundered foreclosures continue to
mount with eight million 213 million
filings forecast over the program's
lifetime while the biggest banks are
twenty percent larger than they were
before the crisis and control the larger
part of the our economy than ever they
reasonably assumed that the government
meaning the taxpayer will rescue them
again if necessary indeed credit rating
rating agencies incorporate future
government bailouts into their
assessments of the largest bank banks
exaggerating market distortions that
provide them with an unfair advantage
over smaller institutions which continue
to struggle and of course encouraging
them to undertake risky transactions
with a big profit because when it
collapses as it will the taxpayer will
come and bail amount so in short barosky
concludes Obama's programs were a
giveaway to Wall Street executives and a
blow in the solar plexus to their
defenseless victims all in accord with
Adam Smith's Maxim from the 17-7 70s and
it's pretty much the same on foreign
policy so take a few just let's pick a
few critical moments for formation of
foreign policy the global system changed
radically during world war two the
United States emerged from the Second
World War as overwhelmingly the most
powerful state in the world richest most
powerful and it expected to make use of
that power to organize
the world in the interests of the
domestic Masters of mankind during the
Second World War President Roosevelt's
planners State Department planners
experts in foreign policy from outside
had regular meetings in which they
planned for the post-war world they knew
that Britain the United States was going
to replace Britain Britain as the global
dominant power and they wanted to lay
out plans to what the world would look
like well there's a month leading
British diplomatic historians Jeffrey
Warner recently pointed out after a
study of this that from the documentary
record it's perfectly clear that
President Roosevelt was aiming at United
States hegemony in the postwar world and
not surprising given us power and they
had specific plans they plan to
construct what they called a grand area
which would be under us control that
would include the entire western
hemisphere the Far East and the former
British Empire including crucially the
Middle East energy reserves that's the
minimum the maximum would be as much as
possible certainly the core of the
erasure the economic industrial core of
Eurasia Western Europe well that was the
grand area and in the Grand area I'm
quoting the United States will main
maintain unquestioned power with
military and economic supremacy while
ensuring the limitation of any exercise
of sovereignty by states that might
interfere with its global designs and
more significant the wartime plans were
soon implemented this ought to be sort
of the first week of a freshman course
in college on post-war foreign policy
it's very significant and that's
remained that stays the policy
and it's often stated pretty
forthrightly so it takes a bill clinton
sort of nonetheless aggressive side his
doctrine presented to congress was that
the United States has the right to use
military force unilaterally to ensure
inhibited access to key markets energy
supplies and strategic resources and the
US must maintain military forces forward
deployed in Europe and Asia in order to
shape people's opinions about us not by
persuasion and to shape events that will
affect their livelihood in our security
in that special sense of security well
that doctrine Lysa's licenses military
intervention at will and it actually
goes well beyond the much reviled george
w bush doctrine which at least required
pretexts for intervention for clinton
you need a pretext just controlling the
grant area but clinton's doctrine was
presented politely and so it received no
censure unlike the brazen and arrogant
pronouncements of his successor it's
styled it matters not the content the
content remains pretty much the same
well take the invasion of iraq which is
quite interesting if you look at it
closely throughout the course of the
invasion it became clearer that the US
was going to fail who was not going to
achieve its objectives and as the fender
became clear the actual goals of the
invasion could no longer be concealed
with usual pretty rhetoric and they were
expressed not reported but expressed by
the government so in november 2007 the
bush administration produced a
declaration of principles here's the way
it's gotta work the united states forces
must remain indefinitely in Iraq and
you must privilege American investors
two months later in january 2008 Bush
informed Congress that he would reject
any legislation that might limit the
permanent stationing of US armed forces
in Iraq or us control of the oil
resources of Iraq pretty straight
standard brand area doctrine these are
incidentally demands that the United
States had to abandon as shortly after
in the face of Iraqi resistance there
was another step in a major defeat well
it's the the same world war two
principles hold for what's now
considered to be the greatest danger to
world order and in fact is considered
the leading foreign policy issue for the
United States that's the Iranian threat
last year was year of Iran because this
terrible Iranian threat well what
exactly is the Iranian threat it's
something rarely discussed but there
actually is an authoritative answer it
was given by the Pentagon and US
intelligence in their annual report to
Congress on the global security
situation highest possible source they
point out that the Iranian threat which
they take to be very severe is not a
military threat in fact the Iranian
military spending is low even by the
standards of the region and miniscule
fraction of us spending furthermore Iran
they say has limited capacity to
deployed forces abroad and then they
look into its strategic doctrine its
military doctrine and they say the
military doctrine is defensive it's
designed to deter an invasion long
enough so that diplomacy can set in well
they of course discuss the nuclear
threat
and they say that if Iran is trying to
develop a nuclear capability that would
be part of their deterrence strategy ok
that's the military side of the threat
however it's a very severe threat one
because deterrence violates grand area
principles remember the basic principle
is that no interference with us actions
is to be tolerated and if a country can
deter an invasion or can deter
aggressive aggressive action that's an
interference with our right to dominate
the world so that's a threat and there's
another threat which they point out
that's what they call Iran's efforts to
destabilize the region how is your n
destabilizing the region well by trying
to develop to extend its influence into
neighboring countries by cracked in
Afghanistan by commercial extending
commercial relations cultural relations
and so on and that's destabilizes the
country in contrast when we invade those
countries and half destroy them that
stabilizes the region and this is normal
practice this is the normal usage of the
term stability it's used that way all
the time sometimes so extreme it's hard
to believe so for example when the u.s.
overthrew the parliamentary government
in Chile and installed a vicious
dictatorship this action was criticized
by an elite leading foreign policy
analyst James Chase for one but he said
nevertheless it was necessary to
destabilize Chile in order to impose
stability and that's not a contradiction
if you understand the technical meaning
of the words stability means we run it
we own the world anything that
interferes is destabilizing that's
unchallenged at home
of course but not in the rest of the
world and that's significant because
over the years the u.s. capacity to
implement grand area strategy has
declined the strategy is the same
rhetorics about the same but the
capacity to implement it has designed
has declined and for good reasons the
peak of us power in the world was right
after World War two the United States
literally had half the world's wealth
that's unheard a position of
overwhelming military power it's
industrial competitors were either
destroyed or severely weakened and at
that point the ability to implement
policy was simply overwhelming well that
changed through decolonization
reconstruction of the industrial
societies us share of global power
declined remained enormous but it
declined by say 1970 it was maybe
twenty-five percent of the world's
wealth still colossal but not half by
that time the world was becoming what
was called tri-polar three major
industrial centers one was North America
based in the United States another
Europe now recovered primarily based in
Germany and the third was East Asia at
that point japan-based and now it's the
world's most dynamic industrial region
that china is the core of it in a
certain sense but it's worth and were to
remember that china is an assembly plant
the more advanced technology fancy
software and parts and components they
mostly come from the industrial
societies on the periphery of China
Taiwan South Korea and Japan and also
from the United
state in their sent to China to assemble
if you take a look at say the trade a
lot of talk about the trade deficit with
China however if you calculate that
trade deficit correctly in terms of
what's called the value-added in China
to the to what you purchase say if you
purchase an ipod how much of the values
actually added in China turns out that
the trade deficit with China is
overestimated by about twenty-five
percent and it's underestimated with
Japan and South Korea and Taiwan by
roughly the same so yes it's a growing
important country but it's really the
industrial region that's growing well
the let's take a look at Latin America
in Grand area strategy it was just taken
for granted that we control that in
America period it's our backyard Henry
Stimson Secretary of War under roseville
described it as our little region over
here which has never bothered anybody
that's as he was working to ensure that
other regional alliances all over the
world would be dismantled a while Aaron
would be strengthened go on to say the
early 70s Richard Nixon at the time when
the next administration was planning the
destabilization of Chile in order to
impose stability at that time the
National Security Council highest
planning body pointed out that if we
don't control Latin America we how are
we going to control the rest of the
world that's the easy one so we better
make sure we control Latin America well
that's changed in the last ten years
South America for the first time in half
a millennium since the European
explorers came South America has begun
to move towards independence towards
integration countries integrating with
one another requisite for independent
and also towards addressing some of
their horrendous internal problems by
now the United States has been kicked
out of every military base in Latin
America and South America that's quite a
shame
the Bush and Obama administration's had
hoped to maintain a couple of aces in
Colombia the one country that's more or
less under control but the Colombian
Constitutional Court has so far blocked
it actually the one major the one
remaining a major military base in the
continent it outside of North America is
in Honduras and very likely that's large
part of the reason why the you what
Obama broke with Latin America and in
fact with most of the world by
supporting the military coup in Honduras
leaving a highly repressive in brutal
regime but with the military base intact
well last februari februari a year ago a
new organization was formed the
community of latin american and
caribbean states select it included all
states of the hemisphere apart from the
US and canada anything like that was
just unthinkable in earlier years
they're going to have their first
meeting in July and it'd be worth
keeping an eye on it if that functions
that's a harsh blow to us domination of
its traditional backyard well control of
America a lot of Latin America was
regarded from the very beginning as
central to grand area doctrine and in
fact us way beyond back to them under a
doctrine but it was nowhere near as
crucial as control of the vast energy
resources of the Middle East what
President Eisenhower called the most
strategically important area of the
world the State Department described it
as the stupendous source of strategic
power probably the richest economic
prize in the world in the field of
foreign investment and that was a prize
that of course the US
intended to keep for itself and its
allies in the unfolding new world order
after the Second World War well despite
changes and there have been plenty
planners still adhere to the doctrine
that was expressed shortly after the war
by one of Roosevelt's leading advisers a
burly who said pointed out that if we
can control Middle East energy resources
we will have substantial control of the
world it's not a small issue and it
follows that loss of that control would
threaten the whole project of global
dominance that was clearly articulated
during World War two and has been
implemented and sustained to the extent
possible since that day despite major
changes in World Order well right now
that's threatened that's the
significance of what was happening it's
been happening for the last couple of
months in the Arab world spectacular
display of courage dedication commitment
by popular forces outcomes uncertain but
a lot has been achieved and it's this is
extremely threatening to the United
States because it's threatening to bring
democracy and democracy if it means
anything it means that the will of the
population has some effect on policy not
just the Masters and that's really a
threat domestically too and we know what
the will of the population we know a lot
about what the will of the population is
now it's not reported I'm it's known but
not reported but it's obviously not on
the planners there are studies carried
out by the major US polling agencies
they're released by prestigious
institutions like the Brookings
Institute in Washington and they're very
very striking so take a gyp the most
important country in Egypt ninety
percent of the population regard the
United States as the mage
threat to their interest in fact they're
so critical of US policy that about 80%
think the region would be more secure if
Iran had nuclear weapons to counter
us-israeli domination and the figures
are very small percentage maybe ten
percent in the region think of Iran as a
threat well the figures vary from
country to country but roughly like that
well as I say it's not reported there's
not a single report in the United States
and the mainstream you can find it but
the edges but obviously planners know
all about it well there's this a
principle behind it the principal was
expressed quite accurately by the head
of the Carnegie Endowment Middle East
research program the former high
Jordanian official that Marwan washer
that what he pointed out is that as long
as the populations are under control and
they are passive and apathetic then the
powerful can do we like what they like
so therefore it's fine to disregard
public opinion until they get out of
control which is what's happening now
now that's an old principle and again if
the media schools universities were
doing their job everyone would know what
I'm going to say because it's quite old
and important dopeman so go back to say
1958 President Eisenhower the President
Eisenhower was concerned about public
opinion in the Arab world he was
concerned about what he called a
campaign of hatred against us in the
Arab world and not by the government's
which are more or less under control but
by the people and in that same year the
National Security Council produced a
memorandum long Declassified which gave
the reasons it said there's a perception
in the Arab world that the United States
supports harsh and
brutal dictatorships and that we oppose
democracy and development now we do it
because we want to gain can maintain
control over their energy resources and
went on to say that this perception is
more or less accurate and furthermore
that's what we ought to be doing on the
operative principles of foreign policy
and World Order so as long as the washer
doctrine holds populations are
controlled we don't care if there's a
campaign of hatred will go on and
control their resources and support
democracies and dictatorships and block
democracy and development well let's
move on to George Bush number two after
nine eleven as you'll recall he gave a
kind of a plaintiff speech in which he
asked you know why do they hate us and
he concluded that they hate our freedom
right after that the Pentagon initiated
a research study and Science Board which
concluded responded to him he said no
they don't hate our freedom they hate
our policies another end was essentially
a repetition of what the National
Security Council had said in 1958 they
didn't add what we should conclude it's
not that they hate our freedom it's that
we hate their freedom and there's a good
reason because if they are free they're
going to follow the policies the will of
the population and that means the u.s.
is just going to be driven out of the
region that's obvious from the campaign
of hatred and 58 and everything since
and the contemporary polls we saw a
pretty dramatic demonstration of how
educated elite opinion interprets that
right now kind of striking that there
wasn't any commentary on it you've all
followed WikiLeaks I'm sure the most of
the WikiLeaks exposures the one that
received most attention in the headlines
you know
with enthusiastic commentary and so on
was that the Arabs support US policy on
Iran Durant being the main threat to the
world well that's true of the Arab
dictators which is all they cared about
but it's dramatically falls through the
population the population on the
contrary strongly opposes US policy and
even calls for Iran to have nuclear
weapons however as long as the moisture
doctrine holds you know you keep the
population or control who cares all
educated opinion cares about is the
dictators and as long as they're
supporting us we don't care about the
population was very clearly Illustrated
but it is a problem and you can see it
right in front of your eyes day after
day Egypt is still under military rule
hasn't been a real large-scale social
and political change but there have been
changes and the new Egyptian government
is more responsive to the popular will
and things are happening that are
considered extremely threatening in the
United States as good reasons why we
oppose democracy so for example a couple
of weeks ago the Egyptians permitted
Iranian ships to go through the Suez
Canal for the first time in 30 years
breaking the US policy of isolation just
a couple of weeks a couple of days ago
in fact Egypt organized a unification
agreement between the two major
Palestinian factions Hamas and Gaza and
 off from the rest
now that again is a very day Israel
reacted very harshly us did too and for
good reasons for about 20 years a major
US Israeli policy has been to separate
Gaza from the West Bank it's in
violation of the Oslo agreements 1993
which describe them is a territorial
unity but you know that was the policy
and it's been pretty successful but the
unification agreement if it holds might
overcome that furthermore unification
might make it easier might ease the way
towards diplomatic negotiations for a
political settlement of the
israel-palestine conflict that's been
when one of the ways of holding that off
has been to claim that the Palestinians
aren't a partner for peace well if you
look at the record again this doesn't
get reported but it's easy to discover
for 35 years the United States has
unilaterally been blocking a political
settlement it's alone in the world on
this along with Israel you can see it in
Security Council votes vetoes General
Assembly resolutions public statements
and so on and in fact if the unification
agreement facilitates the path towards
negotiations us and Israeli isolation is
going to become so dramatic that it's
going to be hard even for the pressed is
not to report it well that's and
certainly most of the rest of the world
understands so that's dangerous the New
York Times warned about something else
which they are concerned about very much
namely the 1979 peace treaty between
Israel and Egypt The Times reported the
concerns in Washington that that treaty
might be threatened it's very
popular among Egyptians and the treaty
they said is a cornerstone of the
region's stability well there's that
nice word stability again actually the
peace treaty is actually a cornerstone
of the region's instability very
dramatically when the peace treaty was
signed in 1979 does an interesting
history which won't go into but when it
was signed Israel responded rationally
they concluded that Egypt which is the
main deterrent to his Israeli actions
only major military force in the Arab
world so with Egypt neutralized Israel
could move ahead much more freely
towards integrating the occupied
territories to the extent taking them
over to the extent that it wanted all
illegal of course and also by attacking
its northern neighbor Lebanon which they
proceeded to do right away major attack
killing tens of thousands of people well
that's instability in the info normal
meaning of the world were but its
stability in the technical meaning
because it accords with us plans so
that's why the treaty is called a
cornerstone of the region's stability
kind of like it ran well it checked the
u.s. reaction to the democracy uprising
and you can see all this playing out
very straightforwardly major principle
is democracy is a real threat so we've
got to do something to deter it well
there are several categories of states
the most important are the oil-rich
states where the dictators are reliable
and obedient Lakes a Saudi Arabia well
they're they're given free reign to
crush the demonstrations because we want
to keep things the way they are Saudi
Arabia for example there was a it was an
effort to have to join the democracy
uprisings but security presence was so
overwhelming that people were afraid
even to go out in the streets okay no
comment about that
the same thing happened in queit also a
reliable dictator the most interesting
cases by Fran navaja Raymond isn't all
that important in itself except that it
hosts the u.s. Fifth Fleet which is the
major military force in the region but
crucially Bahrain is just a couple miles
from Saudi Arabia off the coast it has a
majority Shiite population eastern Saudi
Arabia right next door is also majority
Shiite I both have sunny dictatorships
and as an happens to be where most of
Saudi oil is says they're deep concern
that the major oil resources in the
region eastern Saudi Arabia and southern
Iraq southwestern Iran well mostly
Shiite might fall under Shiite control
which might move towards independence so
therefore any democracy movement in
Bahrain has to be crushed and it has
been crushed and violently sooty the
city led military invasion gave the
Bahraini security forces the capacity to
destroy the tenth cities it destroyed
taher that their version of Tahrir
Square pearl square break into the
hospitals empty the hospitals throughout
the doctors and the patients capture and
torture a human rights activists it's a
real horror story going on right now
destroying mosques all kinds of
atrocities virtually no comment that's
necessary to keep thee for the stability
of the reliable obedient oil-rich
dictators well take the countries that
don't have that had dictators but not a
lot of oil so for example Egypt and
Tunisia well in those cases the u.s.
followed a very standard game plan I'm
you have to be kind of blind not to see
it over and over again through the years
some favored dictator gets into trouble
and the procedure is always the same say
no somoza and Nicaragua Marcus and the
Philippines of troon in South Korea
bhutto in the Congo the Suharto in
Indonesia is case after case what you do
is support them as long as possible and
if it becomes impossible to support him
like for example if the army turns
against him then show them send them
away somewhere and try to restore the
old regime as much as possible maybe
with new names it's exactly what's going
on in Egypt and in Tunisia right in
front of our eyes the very familiar
pattern some has it works sometimes it
doesn't that that's the policy well that
leaves one other category an oil-rich
dictator who isn't reliable and there is
such a case that's Libyan and here's
what the US has done is very and Britain
or work together is very striking
they've strongly supported Qaddafi I
don't have time to go into the details
if you like but up till the present
they've been very strongly supporting
him but now this chance to get rid of
them and so that's what they're trying
to do just done before I came over here
I was listening watching BBC on
television now they're perfectly frank
about it the reporting says yeah we
support the rebels that's what we're
doing and the head of NATO was
interviewed and he said well you know
it's justified because the regional
powers asked us to the Arab League is
kind of a half-truth at least the Arab
League did call for a no-fly zone but it
immediately retracted as soon as it saw
that the US Britain and France were
going way beyond the resolution to
protect civilians and we're just joining
in the
rebellion was another small point at the
same time that the Arab League called
for a no-fly zone over Libya it also
called for a no-fly zone over Gaza to
prevent further us Israeli attacks on
Gaza which is devastated the place that
literally didn't get reported in the
united states except way out at the
margins you can read about it in the
international business breath well that
we don't have to adhere to that call
because it doesn't accord with air our
goals well the in libya this the actual
intervention i mean you can say it's
right you can say it's wrong but at
least we're to be honest about what it
is it's direct intervention on the side
of the rebels as not protecting
civilians just make try to see if our
side can win it's it's kept the
intervention is carried out by france
britain in the united states note that
those are the three traditional imperial
powers they're doing it in virtual
isolation there's token participation by
NATO or in little in the arab world
where this huge military forces in egypt
saudi arabia nothing they don't want to
be involved a couple of reconnaissance
planes from qatar africa it's an African
country the African Union's calling for
diplomacy they don't want to be involved
they don't want the intervention the
major regional power turkey also a huge
military force and NATO that they're not
trying to impose any no-fly zone what
anything to do with it the so-called
BRICS countries Brazil Russia India
China South Africa the main emerging
countries it's most of the world they
just completed a conference in China and
they came out with a declaration
opposing any military force in Libya and
calling for negotiate
diplomacy well again you can have
whatever opinion you like but the the
facts are quite clear the Imperial
triumph or it is isolated they are
acting alone it's another sign of the
decline and the capacity to rule the
world just getting more free and open
and the same is true in the case of Iran
the United States is extremely isolated
on that the non-aligned countries that's
most of the world they have been
supporting your ends right to enrich
uranium vigorously from the beginning
well we don't care about them the region
I've already mentioned in the region
public opinion overwhelmingly supports
not only Iran's right to develop nuclear
energy but even to have nuclear weapons
well the mawashi doctrine tells us we
can ignore the regional population the
same is true of turkey major power which
is nothing to do with the isolation in
fact they're increasing commercial
relations with Iran same is true of
Brazil most respected country in the
south well the United States can
tolerate Turkish and Brazilian
disobedience though with some dismay but
there's another country that's harder to
ignore that's China the press warns that
China's investors and traders are now
filling a vacuum in Iran as businesses
from other countries mainly Europe pull
out in response to us demands and in
particular China is expanding its
dominant role in Iran's inner energy
industries and Washington 9 doesn't like
it but it's reacting with a touch of
real desperation so the State Department
recently warned China that if it wants
to be accepted in the international
community meaning by the US then it must
I'm quoting skirt and he it must not
skirt and evade international
responsibilities which are clear that
what
the international responsibilities well
to follow us orders China does observe
UN sanctions because they're mostly
toothless and they're criticized but it
here for that but they're not following
unilateral US sanctions and therefore
they are not meeting their international
responsibilities this just elicits
laughter in the Chinese Foreign Office
at the real threat of China is they just
can't be intimidated I mean their
picture is look we've been around for
3,000 years major civilization in the
world we have been fending off the
barbarians we don't care about them now
and that's that's frightening I mean
I mean if you're the Mafia Don and
people stop following orders you're in
serious trouble so that's the main
threat of China now there's also talk
about a military threat and in fact the
Pentagon just released a study of it
they say that China's military budget is
approaching one-fifth of what the
Pentagon spent to operate and carry out
the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan a small
fraction of US military spending which
is roughly the same as the world
combined the new york times reported
that china's expansion of military
forces might deny the ability of
American warships to operate in
international waters off China's coast
what about international waters off the
US Coast like say and the Caribbean Sea
the Chinese Navy deploying there just
imagine what would happen if they did
the strategic analysis literature is
quite interesting the technical energy
it speaks of a classic security to not
dilemma in the us-china confrontation
each side the regards its primary
interests at stake so China's interests
are the territorial the waters rattled
near its border and our interest is that
the waters right near China's border
that's a classic security dilemma that's
hard to deal with and of course make
sense if the u.s. controls most of the
world you look at the intellectual
journals like the New Republic recently
expressed its concern about the fact
that China sent ten worships through
international waters that just off the
Japanese island of Okinawa which indeed
is a provocation unlike the fact which
they'll mention that Washington long ago
converted the island into a major
military base in defiance of the
protests of the people of Okinawa that's
not a provocation on the standard
principle that we own the world well
actually there is good reason for
China's neighbors to be concerned about
its growing military and commercial
clout and in the Middle East although
our public opinion supports an Iranian
nuclear weapons program I don't we
certainly shouldn't do so we should try
to do something to reduce or eliminate
that the nuclear weapons program not on
Iran but everywhere the foreign policy
well uh how
