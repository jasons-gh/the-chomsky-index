here the term libertarian means the
opposite of what it always meant in
history libertarian throughout modern
European history meant socialist
anarchist they met the antes none of the
socialist movement the workers movement
and socialist movement I sort of broke
into two branches roughly one statist
one a D status the statist branch led to
Bolshevism and Lenin and Trotsky and so
on the a D status branch which included
Marxists left Marxists Panico rosa
luxemburg others to kind of merge more
or less into an amalgam with the big
strain of anarchism into what was called
libertarian socialism so an ER
libertarian in Europe always meant
socialist here it means ultra you know
in Rand or Cato Institute or something
like that but that's a special u.s.
usage having to do with the a lot of
things quite special about the way the
United States developed them this is
part of it there it meant and always
meant to me socialists and socialists
anti-state the anti state branch of
social socialism which meant a highly
organized society completely organized a
night with chaos but based on a
democracy all the way through that means
democratic control of communities of
workplaces of federal structures built
on systems of voluntary association
spreading internationally now that's
traditional anarchism at least you know
anybody can have the word if they like
but it's a mainstream probably the
mainstream of traditional anarchism and
it has roots coming back to the United
States it has very strong roots and the
American working class movement so if
you go back to say the 1850s the
beginnings of the Industrial Revolution
I was right around the area
I live in eastern Massachusetts textile
plants and so on the people working in
those plants were in part young women
coming off the farms they were called
factory girls through the women jungle
farms and work in the textile plant they
from their point of view were what they
call wage slavery renting yourself to an
owner was not very different from
chattel slavery but you know what they
were fighting civil war about and you
have to recall that by the in the mid
19th century that was a common view in
the United States for example is the
position of the Republican Party it was
Abraham Lincoln's position it's not a
odd view but there isn't much difference
between selling yourself and renting
yourself that's our the idea of renting
yourself meaning working for wages was
degrading you couldn't it was just an
attack on your personal integrity the
and they despised the industrial system
that was developing that was destroying
their culture destroying their
independence their individuality
constraining them to be subordinate to
masters losing there was a tradition of
local republicanism in the United States
we're free people you know first three
people in the world this was destroying
and undermining that freedom this was
the core of the labor movement all over
and included in it was the assumption
just taken for granted that those
quoting those who work in the mills
should run you have repeatedly defined
anarchism as the view that the burden of
proof is on the authority and if that
burden fails to be met then the
authority is illegitimate and should be
dismantled but you also seem to use the
terms anarcho-syndicalism and our theme
for today libertarian socialism
interchangeably with anarchism is there
a difference between these terms and if
so can you describe the differences well
first of all anarchism covers a very
wide-range I mean the what you just
quoted seems to me like a kind of a core
principle of anyone who's involved
anywhere in anarchist movements should
at least accept that that authority is
not self justifying authoritarian
hierarchy institutions you know
authoritarian structures structures of
domination dominance and control are
have a burden of proof I mean they don't
they're not self just to find they have
to meet a challenge they should be
challenged and I think that everyone
ought to be an anarchist in that sense
it doesn't carry any then come further
questions about what you do about it but
it already challenged and if it can't
meet the burden of proof which is
usually the case that not always then
they should be dismantled that's this
will be done everywhere not from
families to international affairs and
professions science whatever it is
actually is kind of striking that in
some domains is just taken for granted
like in the in the sciences if your
science students it's assumed that the
task for students is to challenge you're
not supposed to just copy what you heard
the fields would die if they did so
you're supposed to challenge a request
it could demand evidence and proof and
if you can't find to change but that
ought to extend to all of life now
anarcho-syndicalism little bit different
that is a particular brand of anarchism
which was particularly concerned with
things like workers control control by
working people of production the means
of production decisions over production
this is like a kind of a core part of it
that's the syndicalist part libertarian
socialism is just the traditional word
for anarchism it's
I mean it's young French term rigidly
and so if you take a look at the French
journals and associate ease in Liberty
oh it's anarchist journal it's it's the
non status component of the anarchist
tradition and a lot of it was
anarcho-syndicalist in characters one of
the main French writers Danielle give as
published major volumes on libertarian
socialism is basically a nanner
but dealing with the anarcho-syndicalist
the variant of it of course there are
plenty of other things that call
themselves anarchist you know so this is
by no means the whole story libertarian
socialists and vision and work to create
predictably enough libertarian socialist
society what would be the core features
what are the core features of that
theory what are the core features of
that Society well apart from accepting
the general principle of energy as Amit
concentrates tends to concentrate on the
productive system so for example workers
control and Industry control of other
institutions by people who participate
in them it's not inconsistent with what
sometimes called communitarian anarchism
which concentrates on control of
communities by participants in fact they
generally both groups think these ought
to be integrated it's question of where
the focus of attention is but I don't
think the real conflict is just a
question of what Sprite what's
prioritized what's the center of concern
and activity what other things will flow
from it partly tactical choices partly
ideas about where the source of
creativity power search for freedom
would be in a society you can have
different views on that when we when we
talk about anarchism
it's often about well people understand
it as not being organized as being a
kind of chaos well in but in fact it's
trying to find the institutions that can
be effective but I'm minimally coercive
in a libertarian socialist society what
would those what would what would what
kind of institutions would that be well
within the main libertarian socialist
anarchist on our cross in Douglas
tradition what's assumed is it should be
a highly organized society it should be
based on popular control at every level
so begins with for example control by
working people of whatever institution
they're working in factory you know
offices whatever might be and control of
communities and then these should be
integrated a through voluntary
Association that could be regional then
there should be Federation federated
structures that extend beyond and on to
organization of international society
but it should be highly organized though
controlled from below not with I mean
anything complex is going to have to
have some degree of representative
decision-making but always under direct
control and recall and so on so it's
kind of a you know so pure democracy if
you want hmm
in fact you know the few the exempt it
takes a number the one of the major
achievement of mainly
anarcho-syndicalist development was
libertarian Spain and what was didn't
have a lot of time it was wiped out
pretty soon but it was a pre what
developed rather quickly was a fairly
organized society with a lot of
interaction between an agriculture and
Industry commune
and so on pre success will economically
do now libertarian socialists
traditionally insist that the
organizational structure of
organizations must prefigure the desired
Society so for instance if we want a
direct democratic society then we should
use direct democracy here and now why is
that so important well the traditional
idea goes back to bakunin is that you
should the way to carry out social
change is to build the the seeds of the
future within the present society to try
to I mean what's really involved in
social progress ultimately is a kind of
change of consciousness not not just
organization but just letting different
values and different concerns come to
prevail and the way that happens is
through participation in action not not
by reading about it and one of the ways
to do it is to start with direct
democracy where you are and that's a lot
of ideas about how to do this I mean
work sharing lots of possibility of
decision making common decision-making
and that helps it's it's essentially I
agree with this it's essential for
gaining an understanding of what a free
democratic society might be like even if
it's a small group would say a
publishing house with ten people and you
learn you experiment you see what works
what doesn't work you can go on to
bigger things
if you one was to build the libertarian
socialist organization what would be the
core features of it will be the core
elements well core elements first of all
would be authentic participation that
means everybody not one person's a
secretary one person's a janitor you
know one person does the finance and
therefore you kind of automatically
a hierarchy of decision-making vague
based on role in the system but really
participating that doesn't mean
everybody can do everything like you
know I can't be a surgeon somebody else
can but it means that in anything that
involves decision making functions it
should really be shared it should be
true in say universities like where I am
or publishing houses or factories or
anywhere else that's the beginning and
as soon as you do that it just breaks
down barriers among people for one thing
it means there is some kinds of work
that nobody wants to do but has to be
done well that has to be shared if
that's not shared then you got a problem
but that can be instituted a joint
participation decision-making can be
instituted if there is representation
immediate recall when under public you
know cooperative action I mean all of
these things can be instituted on very
small scale and can spread the larger
ones and that if it goes far enough
becomes a major organization well let me
begin by referring something that I've
already discussed that is if it is
correct as I believe it is that a
fundamental element of human nature is
the need for a creative work for a
creative inquiry for for free creation
without the arbitrary limiting effects
of course of institutions then of course
it will follow that a decent Society
should maximize the possibilities for
this fundamental human characteristic to
be realized that means trying to
overcome the elements of repression and
oppression and destruction and coercion
that exist in any existing society ours
for
example as a historical residue now a
federated decentralized system of free
associations incorporating economic as
well as social institutions would be
what I refer to as anarcho-syndicalism
and it seems to me that it is the
appropriate form of social organization
for an advanced technological society in
which human beings do not have to be
forced into position of tools of cogs in
a machine in which the creative urge the
that I think is intrinsic to human
nature will in fact be able to realize
itself in whatever way it will I don't
know all the ways in which will
anarchism can be conceived as a kind of
voluntary socialism that is a
libertarian socialist or
anarcho-syndicalist or communist
anarchist in the tradition of say
Bakunin and Kropotkin and others had in
mind a highly organ organized form
society but a society that was organized
on the basis of organic units organic
communities and generally they meant by
that the workplace or the neighborhood
or both and from those two basic units
involving the place where a person works
and spends his creative energies and the
place where he lives in relation to his
neighbors and others around him from
those two basic units there could drive
through federal Arrangements highly
integrated kind of social organization
which might be national or even
international in scope where decisions
could be made over a substantial range
but by delegates who are always part of
the organic community from which they
come and are returned to it and are
revocable and in general would live
there in fact so it doesn't mean a
society in which there is literally
speaking no government so much as a
society in which the primary Authority
and source of authority comes as it were
from the bottom up to not exact on the
top down at
we're representative democracy as we
have it in the United States and and
Britain would be regarded as a form of
from the top-down Authority even though
ultimately the voters decide
well representative democracy as in say
the United States Great Britain would be
would be criticized by an anarchist of
this school on really two grounds first
of all because there is a monopoly of
power centralized in the state and
secondly and critically because
representative democracy is limited to
the political sphere and in no way in a
serious way encroaches on the economic
sphere and anarchists of this tradition
have always held that that Democratic
control of one's productive life is at
the core of any serious human liberation
or for that matter any significant
democratic practice that is as long as
there as long as individuals are
compelled to rent themselves on the
market to those who are willing to to
hire them and as long as their role in
production is simply that of ancillary
tools then there are striking elements
of coercion and oppression that make
talk of democracy very limited is given
meaning dint these precedents suggest
that the there is something inherently
pre-industrial about the applicability
of libertarian ideas in this way but it
necessarily presupposes a rather rural
simple society in which the technologist
production of fare is simple in which
the economic organization tends to be
small-scale and localized and in which
all the problems which we associate with
modern industrial society just aren't
there well let me separate that into two
questions one how anarchists have felt
about that and two what I think is the
case as far as anarchist reactions to
that there there are two there there
there has been an anarchist tradition
which was and one might think say if
Kropotkin is a representative which was
which had much the character you
described on the other hand there's
another anarchist tradition that
develops into anarcho-syndicalism which
simply regarded anarchist ideas as the
her motive organization for a highly
complex advanced industrial society and
that tendency and anarchism merges or at
least into relates very closely with a
variety of left-wing Marxism the kind
that one finds in say the council
communists that grew up in the
Luxembourg in tradition and that is
later represented by by Marxist
theorists like say Anton Pannekoek and
well who developed a whole theory of
workers councils in industry as the and
who was itself a scientist and
astronomer very much part of the
industrial world of Dutch Dutch Marxist
no it's the latter not so which of these
two views is correct I mean is it
necessary that anarchist concepts belong
to the pre-industrial phase of human
society or is it the rational mode of
organization for highly advanced
industrial society well I myself believe
the latter that is I think that
industrialization and the advance of
technology raises possibilities for
self-management over a broad scale that
simply didn't exist in an earlier period
and that in fact this is precisely the
rational mode for a an advanced and
complex industrial society one in which
workers can very well become masters of
their own immediate affairs that is
direction of and control of the shop
that also can be in a position to make
to make the major substantive decisions
concerning the structure of the economy
concerning social institutions
concerning planning regionally and
beyond because they can have in fact
objectively now that is technology
permits and industrialization permits
institutions do not permit them to have
control over the requisite information
the relevant of the relevant training to
understand these matters a good deal can
be automated much of the necessary work
that is required to keep a decent level
of social life going can be really
consigned to machines at least in
principle which means humans can be free
to to undertake the kind of creative
work which may not have been possible
objectively in
my stages of the Industrial Revolution
I'd like to pursue in a moment the
question of the economics of an
anarchist society but could you sketch
in a little more broadly began a
political constitution of an amicus
society as you would see it in modern
conditions but the big political parties
for example what forms of government
residual forms of government would in
fact remain well as let me sketch what a
kind of what I think would make the
perhaps a rough consensus and one that I
think is essentially correct beginning
with these two modes of immediate
organization and control namely
organization and control in the
workplace and in the community one can
imagine a network of workers councils at
a higher level representation across a
factory or across branches of industry
or across crafts and on to General
Assemblies of workers councils that can
be regional and national and
international in character and from
another point of view one can project a
system of governance that involves local
assemblies again federated regionally
dealing with regional issues Crossing
crafts industries trades and so on and
again general at the level of the nation
or beyond it through Federation and so
on now they each of these and exactly
exactly how these would develop and how
they would enter enter and relate and
where they need both of them are only
one well these are matters over which
anarchist theoreticians have debated and
many detailed proposals exist and I
don't I don't feel confident to take a
stand in fact I think these are
questions that pretty much would have to
be worked out but would love for example
be direct national elections and
political parties organized well take on
coast-to-coast as it were off from north
to south in Britain to win those kind of
elections because if the were there
arguably created kind of a central
authority which would be what I call to
the idea of any I know the idea of
anarchism is that delegation of
authority is rather minimal
that is participants at any one of these
levels of government representatives any
one of these levels of government should
be directly responsive to the organic
community in which they live and in fact
the optimal situation would be that
participation in one of these levels of
government should on the one hand a
temporary and even during the period
when it's taking place should be only
partial that is the members of a workers
council who are for some period actually
functioning to make sure around
decisions that other people don't have
the time to make should nevertheless be
in part also continuing to do their work
as part of the workplace or neighborhood
community in which they belong now as
for political parties that my feeling is
that an anarchist society would not
forcefully present prevent the physical
political parties from former izing in
fact anarchism has always been based on
the idea that any sort of procrustean
bed any any sort of system of norms that
imposed on social life will will
constrain and very much underestimate
its its energy and vitality and that all
sorts of new possibilities of voluntary
organization may develop that we may not
even think of today at that higher level
of the material and intellectual culture
but I think it is fair to say that
insofar as political parties are felt to
be necessary anarchist organization of
society will be both failed that is it
should be the case I would think that
where there is direct participation in
self-management in economic and social
affairs then factions conflicts
differences of interest and and ID and
opinion which should be welcomed and
cultivated will be expressed at every
one of these levels why they should fall
into two or three or in political
parties I don't quite see I think that
the complexity of human interest in and
life is that does not fall in that
fashion parties represent basically
class interests or largely buses would
not existed and classes would have been
eliminated or transcended in such a
society historically have the
any sustained examples on any
substantial scale of societies which
approximated to the anarchist ideal
there are small societies a smaller
number that have I think done so quite
well and there are a few examples of
large-scale libertarian revolutions
which were largely anarchist in their
structure as to the first small
societies extending over a long period I
myself think the most dramatic example
is perhaps the Israeli kibbutzim which
for a long period may or may not be true
today really were constructed on
anarchist principles that is of direct
worker control integration of
agriculture industry in service personal
life on an egalitarian basis with direct
and in fact quite active participation
in self-management and where I should
think it's primarily successful a good
example of a really large-scale
anarchist revolution or largely
anarchist revolution in fact the best
example to my knowledge is the Spanish
revolution in 1936 and in fact you can't
tell what would happen that anarchist
revolution was simply destroyed by force
but during the period of in which was
alive I think it was a inspiring
testimony to the ability of who are
working people who organize manage their
affairs extremely successfully without
coercion control how far does the
success of libertarian socialism or
anarchism is whether really depend on a
fundamental change in the nature of man
both in his motivation his altruism and
also in his knowledge and sophistication
I think it not only depends on it but in
fact the whole purpose of libertarian
socialism is that it will contribute to
it it will contribute to a spiritual
transformation precisely that kind of
great transformation in in the way
humans conceive of themselves and their
ability to act to decide to create to
produce to inquire precisely that
spiritual transformation that social
thinkers from the left Marxist tradition
from Lexus Luxembourg say on overthrew
anarcho-syndicalist have always
emphasized so on the one hand it
requires that spiritual transformation
on the other hand the its purpose is to
create institutions which will
contribute to that transformation
