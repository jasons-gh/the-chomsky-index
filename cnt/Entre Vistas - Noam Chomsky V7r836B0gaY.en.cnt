[Music] 
the shows that it is a huge pride to receive you just thanks for having 
coming here to interviews will participate in this conversation with me and the teacher 
jones that two voices rice espina who is editor of the magazine theory and debate and the 
insured rose who teaches at puc de sao paulo and at the sociology school and 
politics of sao paulo both participated in this conversation with 
these humidity that comes from the united states visit us professor thomas i 
I know you were in Brazil at the end of the 20th century 
only came back at the beginning of the 21st century was here last year here is one more 
time that brazil you discovered at the end of the century for this brazil that the 
you see today is quite something I have a different interpreter in Brazil now the 
I look at my wife Valeria is Brazilian and introduced me to aspects of Brazil that 
I was unfamiliar on my first visit and of course on the first 
time I was here about 20 years ago it was a very different period in 
Brazil still Brazil she was emerging 
luxury is from the ends of the dictatorship and it was a good thing of the period of development that 
then came the bank a world bank describes it as being the glorious decade of 
2003 until 2003 if and then the reaction came and now we have a period of your 
very important for the future of brazil 
the tension is obvious angle and understandable Brazil had to make a choice 
soon another direction will be taken another direction that are opposite 
another mother who will determine the future of the wealthy country and because of 
importance of brazil and latin america and it is in fact in the world a lot by 
we will have very important hemispheric and global implications so it is a 
historical moment for Brazil criticized in that specific period of time when 
you were here the first time brazil was chaired by a sociologist 
by an intellectual fernando henrique cardoso 
you return to brazil in another ex-president of the country 
the worker is currently stuck in curitiba 
what this days in Brazil the teacher 
nor abandon the line if it were me we visit null short my period in 
curitiba prison a few days ago I personally see him on how I 
I consider one of the most important political prisoners of the current period 
chan because those who think can think 
on the charges are not very impressive charges against him 
accompanying in a radical way that is disproportionate to the sentence and received 
above compared to the accusations and if mainly in the context of these corners 
of Brazil in the last few years going back to the 90s we cannot 
interpret this except as being a side of and prison political moment 
designed to ensure that he did not participate in the presidential election 
like he would probably win would know his presidencies if allowed to 
he participate in the campaign is this the Brazilian people could be heard 
would certainly support you hard windows what come out of the elections the fact that the figure 
most popular policy in the country that has an impressive track record during its 
presidential mandates being kept outside the electoral system is a fact 
very negative in the history of Brazil as I said the schools that will have to 
be done now are of great importance to us 
rarely do you have such a decisive moment of difficult pride 
teacher is like to tell me about the image that brazil has today an out if 
correspond to what you have seen here if it corresponds to you have to 
information far from brazil abroad 
has changed quite significantly since the times of my first visit to the 
Brazil 20 years ago during the period 
January 12 is new is the government squid the actions that President squid took 
together with his foreign minister celso amorim took brazil is 
the center of the world to the stage of the world year and has become one of the main countries 
acting on the global stage no one and started to achieve the 
potential and has always been predicted for Brazil for over a century ago 
when it was anticipated that brazil would become what was called the colossus of 
a promise that was never achieved but that was beginning to be realized 
in the glorious decade as the world bank called it in brazil plays a role 
very important in international affairs and I quoted the voice of the streets 
mtur to the non-western world 8858 giving them a place something that was once 
tried for many years several times since the beginning of decolonization and the 
think the international economic order of work is different another 
way to see information in order was to always slow the progress of that area 
important in the western beauty powers part of the covenant there was a 
significant change or institutions to develop first in latin america 
were independent for the first time from that imperial order of the united states 
forms in the formation of brics and for example again created san antonio 
being had no influence from a pressure that could modify the scene 
worldwide and traditional use this was a very important development but 
now unfortunately this has greatly declined the role of brazil 
so we can not say that this is more true Brazil has withdrawn is 
international affairs of international relations is a point and even 
losing its connections with africa which was quite promising and very 
important but I think the moment was not lost and all this was not lost 
can recover but it will not be easy because the insured is a teacher I 
I would like to know your opinion on similarities and differences between the 
presidential candidate in brazil jair bolsonaro and the president tramp many 
talk about these similarities although tramp, right 
political before the evolutionary presidency reputed since 91 with 
meaning is of this influence detran pi in the pocket application the milan i think 
that people there aren't even many analysts who are trying to 
make a differentiation in domestic strategies in gel policies 
information that can be assigned europe not before selection not 
understanding what's going on a field that has won main euro scumi is 
one with exclamation marketing the exclamation point everything just me i i i see the movie 
is a television guy is a man wanted confidence and is a very effective politician and 
he has a task on the boy and he is a sea wolf with him has to be 
always in front of everything to appear was the most subtle victorious year too 
well a political commitment wins long before recognizing what i intend june 
in two will be presented a different one represented a supporter is real which is 
the power of surprises and wealth including the real estate industry and 
the richest these are their main players 
if you read the legislation used by the executive carried out on the government 
quiet they are uniformly designed to 
serve the interests of the dense who support it that only the great references 
the second group already supporting are voters and and and people who return to 
power which is completely dissociated by that first support group and 
saints in his government does not open the executive and legislative field until 
are directed at dra voters but the yen's task is either 
to keep the real ones anyway to show up if the person who is defending 
these voters finds we are the establishment of and languages   of 
traditional forum that justifiably they resent these and the people have 
resentment of the very rich cerutil and this is the point of connection against these 
offenders he pretend to be the person who will defend the red the general public 
the vast majority of the population that has suffered a lot during the jury the 40 
years of the experiment of neoliberalism and the economic policies of the states 
united they left out most of 
population these policies to neoliberal policies were designed to 
concentrate wealth by humala clinton and it automatically treated itself and if it has not 
political power through oss that are obvious to people does not discuss here the 
democratic system becoming more more dysfunctional beer to serve the 
interests of the majority of the population does not take into account 
on prison day this has been a period in the united states of stagnation 
or thriller for most of the American people and 
wealth grew but only in the hands of a few a fight at night 
got rich in that and the real wage taking out inflation discarding the 
American worker inflation is lower than income today Saturday 
that in 1979 when the neoliberal experiment was starting to circulate with 
tati in england and then with him in the united states so we have 
anger resentment of the majority of people across England in the states 
united came in a situation where it was bigger 
a gogo skunk can appear android and try and how to become oo years 
apparent spokesperson for those where the majority of the population is being affected 
he really feels the nacion justice sets that they were left of 
brands have been nationalized and tries to drive their anger or resentment 
against vulnerable people and and lots that actors mothers who get help 
of the public health system is the shampoo is doing that group so it's a 
world situation and it is very interesting that we go out to urp squid the elections 
recent problems sweden for example which is a very interesting country in 
as in most European countries in the last european elections almost all 
they centrist parties went into decline as well as going into decline 
united states business is we are not o the establishment has always fallen and the right 
is growing more and more of the far right growing and the explanation 
your swedish soul for that is who are the result 
is due to immigration with foreign states you see up close this is not 
truth of Fabius there was a study of the book done with five 
economists ue this is how last time the through the photo give right and 
and that the vote on the right before this immigration flow and wants to cut the benefits 
and wants to create austerity programs that have started to be 
actually undertaken even for their previous Social Democratic governments 
that was already going to the right too and it happened across europe and the 
as the immigrants appearing there became the expiratory goat 
convenient for this right there is study shows here in finland which is 
neighboring sweden there was the same phenomenon as the rise of 
right and had no immigrants to the city a migration to the truth I 
I think we are seeing in the United States in England in Brazil the last 
module and not in much of the world if there are numbers the mall will work 
certain figures that in order to explore the situation on the court well he is dedicated 
with a use to its true supporters which is the private wealth the 
power of large companies banks financial institutions and at the same 
time they can introduce themselves or try to introduce themselves as the guardians of the 
people that defended by the majority of the people and that despises and trash is this is very 
interesting and complicated game and the team is playing this game with a 
very special brilliance of the years and the liberals is helping the shock in the end 
accounts focus attention for an instant mind is ethics saying things 
crazy with alan absurd comments that he does vulgar behavior in condemning 
this environment are ending up contributing to the image that they 
are even trying to develop as a spokesperson for the change of people who are 
despised by a wealthy millionaire elite who are considered 
temporary a word that she melted is never expressed attitude 
aquino and people feel that this person who will defend you the people who 
against those who are condemning it to their culture who are playing with the 
your daughters who don't take you seriously make jokes and your widow defends you 
with three but in fact what he is doing is the opposite of weakening 
the interests of the people if you see for example i am the odor of juruti a 
realization of the expectation that he learns even his government managed 
for example a law that was passed on tax reform and that reform 
tax was to give money for a very rich use and for the sector favors the 
large companies and and for the interests of the real estate industry that the trump has 
her interests and at the same time she was there that the carefully designed and 
in fact the online architect who is the mayor of the deputies 
analyzes the bill was approved in the income tax reform he the in 
that we created a huge deficit so we have to do some 
thing with verses so what are we going to do we're going to cut spending 
we will cut social spending in the area of 
public health in the area of   public education for the welfare state 
social for people so it's a two knife as the first one looks like they're 
walking a lot of money for the rich and then in the afternoon the general public and at 
while trying to present and defend when the person who defends the 
interests of the majority of the people who pay so the sound is very interesting this 
realization that the ground because it managed to do this very well playing this game is the 
employee seems to have tried to make a game similar to brazil 
before entering again specifically on the Brazilian question before the picture 
electoral election what are you saying last 
analysis is that neoliberalism is a major enemy of democracy 
the whitish law by a simple goal function 
neoliberal policies have a very clear and definitive effect and deconcentrate 
wealth in the hands of a few and accelerate the great expansion of institutions 
banks' financial interests a great expansion and a radical change to 
characteristic of banks if you go back in the 1950s 1960s a period of 
growth of the western economy and the curious 30 years that have been called 
after the war then during that period the banks were silvio bank you 
could put his money in a bank if he had a small band happens to be 
can lend someone their money for the bank to whom they are 
starting a house buying your own home but starting at the beginning of 
1970s and exploded in the 80s and 90s the banks itororo ar or institutions 
from speculating you to real economy data playing games with 
complex financial instruments with a lot of speculation and exploded 
look at all of this combined - the huge growth of hobbies that came to 
hit the sky more and more money going to influence the results of 
elections for the general population led to stagnation in their lives 
if you see real wages like jade are lower today than they were before 
of neoliberalism austerity in europe and had the same consequences on the 
real income of workers in england and the rest and america 
also suffered two lost decades of adjustment 
structural change based on the same phenomenon so there were also other parts 
in thematic ways so we all know about the crisis the river rwanda in 
90s but not one but few people noticed the studies that were 
made sociologists and anthropologists working in rwanda in the 1980s 
where structural adjustment the structural adjustment program were instituted 
which led to a very harsh effect on the population and had an effect of 
lead to the ethnic conflict that ended up happening and this is an obvious consequence 
of the worst of people's lives people seek scapegoats when the worst to 
sexual and civil situation with a saint if the background to the atrocities in the 
90s the same thing happened in the constancy when adjustment programs 
structural neoliberal programs were instituted in the 1980s 
I raise the exacerbation of ethnic conflict or that later exploded in the 90s 
ok this has done everywhere countries like united states and now the 
Brazil and settled on the stage which is a gogo theme can appear and make a 
appeal to and attract to that anger and resentment that exists most of 
population and pretend to defend that majority of the population against an elite that is 
hated this phenomenon is showing up in every lane played putting the blame 
by the situation being addressed scapegoats so in sweden the sounds 
immigrants in the united states the blame is on the Mexicans who are the mothers who live 
doing well with the family purse so if we go to the shipment there were attacks 
racists at the time of the president irrigation of mothers who received support scholarship from 
government to the stock market queens he called in the united states 
I see and in the meantime he showed me some mamma dames to do with the ginca driver to 
receive the benefit of social security and taking a distraction then 
attention of an ethnic minority is usually people who are more 
vulnerable you these minorities this is the technique that if 
uses and we have seen this technique being used worldwide and this is a consequence 
how neoliberal policies were made and I'll tell you 
taking a quick break is a privilege to hear a class like us 
we are listening here we have to take the break and come back as soon as possible 
possible even now [Music] 
[Music] we are back to the union cafe 
of bank employees here in downtown Sao Paulo with the interviews program 
talking today with this absolutely unique figure in the universe 
intellectual in the world the teacher on the streets and now asks is to breathe through 
North American framework that lost, there is room for the construction of the left by 
a rope on the left build a candidacy as opposed to crack 
in the next elections how has this movement been taking place 
this internal articulation [Music] 
I think this is a victory for the right 
if you go back to prevention 2016 so what impressed you sleeping was the election 
from iphan if you think about it this was not 
surprising after all for two reasons for an ounce and coincide public 
chromium all republican primaries before the last two ten years when the 
candidate appeared from the base to base of popular vote 
the person was so extreme in so absurd that the establishment 
Republican put all efforts to try to bring you candidate who 
come from base one after another they managed to do that they managed 
have your elected as the best example but what happened in 2016 
it was more or less the same except this time they didn't 
managed to smash the triangle and think it was the crucial difference some that 
spoke on behalf of the base what evangelical Christians the future and fruit the 
clear tributaries that propose themselves to this type of candidate you opposed people 
desperate people who were angry afraid of losing their jobs 
always a more intense thing since they failed to defeat this type of 
candidate so what happened that venice where a billionaire - that 
had huge media support with the united states tv channel 
practically doing the Fabio campaign the funding is huge especially 
at the end of his campaign there was a huge organization of money 
who joined his campaign for the transit and senate and at 
congress of deputies and he barely won the election because he lost in the vote 
popular and this is not a thing and in the advances but there was one thing that 
happened that was extraordinary and much more important than that which was the 
varnish campaign among Democrats you have to recognize that in the states 
united the elections are more or less bought 
literally the academic academic research is very large that shows you 
can predict the outcome of an election is a fairly large precision public 
gordhan so much for the inmate elections for the congressional chair looking 
a single variable for campaign spending and that's just the beginning but what 
happened in 2016 is that for the first time in a century of 
gold and a candidate appeared without any explicit support the companies was not 
ready directly by the affluent fiocruz that the rich and allows also had not 
support everybody to float with him this call of socialist 
in the united states the service is a bad word is different from other 
parts of the world you can't say that word 
socialist is a shovel a bad word you talk social socialism is a bad word 
nor was he known by the links he would have won the nomination for the candidate 
of the Democratic party if some party leaders let them really have 
this is a very big break for more than a century public in history 
Irish state policy after the elections I benefited emerged as 
being the most popular political figure in the country in the united states and the new 
popular movement that he more or less followed and called for success he 
continues to do many things by electing people who were 
moving away from the standard of the national democratic party and now there is a conflict 
between the democratic party among the supporters of clinton are you gentlemen 
democratic is more or less what it was we always live moderate democrats who 
went to the right and are the big concern is to attract the most professional 
rich big donors support from big companies and gaining power that's the biggest 
but this one has another that the popular base a new part of the public is well 
different in the democratic party which is social democratic sometimes even more than 
that this more advanced than those with concerned about minority rights 
and with the working class women's working class rights 
women's rights this is a party track which way it will take 
it is still unclear something very similar happened in england 
the glue movement than the leader and now the labor party in england is 
much like what is happening in the united states is a 
very decent person occur very honest very direct cares about the 
egg he turned part labor in england no party that really 
knows how to react to the wishes of the great people it represents and this is not common for 
a political party I must say rarely does this happen with political parties 
politicians we can discuss this but this is not 
very common but the world cup and letting that time even became the figure 
leading politician in england on the company's political scene and he's 
under another place a tremendous attack from the media the media 
attacks he is and others want to be another of the labor party was to get rid of him 
you may have an idea that the labor party led by a 
decent person who actually really cares about his supporters with his 
represented cares about the people who suffer everyone that's an hour in the 
fear aaa what happened so far the same thing with the varnish campaign 
in two in the united states and something has happened in other places here 
similar things are happening in different ways in different countries and 
one of them that I think is very important together right 
is the transnational thing year the focus ie it is off the movement and 1,025 that 
is now presenting transnational candidates with the save program 
what is still good about the European Union to overcome the defects that 
are serious about the european union in 2010 and sees sources a few days ago is did 
a joint statement calling for the establishment of a 
progressive international right to counterbalance the forces 
reactionary and backward international level headed by 
sandri is people is the shampoo i bolsonaro supported by position in brazil among 
them to italy and other countries so going back to your question and i think 
this went straight to the point the dissatisfaction the anger against the 
neoliberalism its disaster has led to two types of reactions a reaction is the right 
to the emergence of the right which is very dangerous 
there is another way was the growth of progressive left forces 
democratic zcas which could the daytime that are in a position of him forward 
to change policies was significant in a more 
progressive and I think that's exactly what's going on and in the election in the 
brazil this is what is at stake in the brazil election the choice of two 
paths in this is a worldwide insured rose phenomenon still remaining in the 
neoliberalism issue is a fundamental point in the show brought these 
examples of resistance and he is ours we have that he occupies an important place 
in the use of language in the construction of narratives how to build a narrative 
of confronting neoliberalism fleeing which are the main ones of the old 
I think this is very clear that it is not a matter of language as being 
simply open and honest and clear about the developments that are 
occurring at 1 to 1 is not quantum physics i think is a 
very simple thing right in front of us and we can see the things that are 
happening class stagnation the decline in real wages the cut 
in social spending social benefits and a sharp increase that this concentrated 
of big capital everything is very well documented years 
the work of thomas p that had the french economist the growth 
extraordinary financial institution of banks that in brazil 
particularly has been is extremely lively and disturbing juruti is very 
impressive when the recession hit Brazil in 2013 and 2014 
bank profits have gone up like never before and symbolic of what has 
happened and dramatically in brazil partly because of the rates of 
stratospheric interest rates and which prevent credit that is beyond any interest rate 
interest in the world and offers temptations for private capital 
switch to financial paper transactions that have much more 
money from it and moving away from the real economy of the productive economy of 
companies and privatization within the country's assets seeking quick profits at 
short term is happening dramatically in brazil and other countries 
countries and in the cancer and narrative that we talked about i think the appropriate narrative 
to write everything that is happening accurately describe it very clear 
for most people that the scapegoats that you are addressing 
their anger is not the source of their problems not only are they suffering 
even more than yourself because the source of the problem is up there and not 
down there and so I think it can be shown 
the facts are clear and are easily understood people feel and come is 
in your party of their lives in a negative way so I think 
this is the narrative that must be built together 
work on and around a solution that is clear and reasonably 
build policies that can be undertaken to overcome regression or 
delay that has occurred in the last 40 years and this is a very serious regression 
the previous period was in most parts of the world it was a period of growth 
reasonable large more or less egalitarian in a sense there was a 
very large increase in civil rights in that period the rights of minorities 
women's rights at a higher level of civilization development of 
organization through the popular citizenship activism movement but that 
frightened an elite the elite who are part of neoliberalism's reaction to 
concern that much of the population was becoming too 
engaged in the citizenship political system growing up working for their rights 
and achieving it is to homer the traditional forums of 
oppression and domination and who managed to overcome and question this is not quite 
coming to people who have the money privileges power and incidentally it was up to 
even called the democracy crisis there was too much democracy don't we have 
that diminish democracy and we i think the way to tackle that is 
simply tell the truth what's going on in a simple and 
understandable direct keep the facts and 
able to break these distortions that there is this smoke screen that 
existed I don't think it's an impossible task is 
attacking my best says for example success even sleeping being socopa in 
england is proof of what something can be done and much more can be done 
that their programs were not very advanced for those benefiting from 
example united states he is called socialist but in fact he programmed the 
sambas policies were not a big surprise for I want a lot like the 
original is israel in the 50s which was considered a conservative the 
president hasmann the spectrum was now i'm to the right that to return the 
moderate center 16 a moderate liberalism seems revolutionary today in 
day but we can go well beyond that very well 
we're going to do another quick break don't leave it 
[Music] 
we went back to a cafe by the bankers' union in downtown sao paulo with the 
interview program today tuxedo red carpet although we don't even need the 
tuxedo and the red carpet just the illustrious guest professor at the jasc who 
dispenses with greater presentations professor saints that as soon as you arrived at the 
Brazil you said that the workers' party 
would need to speak to Brazilian society and recognize the errors that 
committed what exactly did you mean by 
this i think we had first 
place fantastic achievements great achievements in the squid period with the stage 
describes it as the glorious decade and a novelty in the history of the 
Brazil so there have been fantastic achievements of Brazil 
really assumed a prominent place in the international arena which was of great 
importance was became a voice for the south of the globe but big governments 
problems great opportunities have also been missed 
some of the problems that had to do with one of the most serious problems 
had to do is that the party allowed granted the oak is a plague of corruption 
that hits latin america and i must say that even worse in rich countries 
it's not a thing in latin america only people play a lot make fun of 
latin america corruption in latin america but if you compare corruption 
from latin america with united states and england europe 
and latin america doesn't even come close to this corruption game that exists in europe and 
the seasons is not an aberration when the big banks in europe and the 
united states manages to get billions of dollars 
the jp morgan tonight bike and all these seats 
they are never condemned is nothing to do with us because they work through 
of how long you pay fines is a 15 billion fine 
dollars and you deduct from income taxes payable and you are happy and 
you don't go to jail there when i found a corrupt one in these banks anymore 
in latin america on another level corruption is serious so i'm not 
saying other than that this is a problem that must be faced and overcome a 
another problem that happened was the rustling is to take advantage of the 
opportunity for tis to stay the Brazilian economy to economic policies were 
designed to seek profit from the fact that china was a huge 
market for raw materials and primary products 
soy iron ore and so on which means bringing the manufactured 
cheap Chinese and can be imported into Brazil and thereby weakening 
local manufacturers to local industrial production which was accelerated by 
extraordinary growth of banking financial institutions that 
were absorbing the wealth of the economy 
through paper transactions and moving away from productive investment all 
these things could have done in a different way 
the fundamental structural problems of Brazilian society have not been 
faced during that period have been left intact and this includes the 
structural system that is increasingly financed but private capital as a 
everything beyond financial capital has no responsibility for any stone 
the movement of a country and a very big difference between latin america and 
stay in south east asia is that in latin america never managed to escape 
colonial standard in which the very rich have no responsibility for the 
society as a whole and are guided by another path they carry capital 
that they have to zurich for switzerland or bought houses in the magazine era saw their 
children to study at oxford at colleges abroad they don't have 
no interest in your society society this is southeast asia in the 
last century that has none of the advantages of latin america do not have the 
natural resources that latin america has no years nor material 
even so it must be us sometimes country grew up because they had a control 
very strict about the more circulating sectors more aquatic could not 
export their capital and had by the death gangrene for capital flight 
and that was accepted but it is and loans were had targets according to a 
program to develop nationally these rural business loans and 3 were 
very poor technology transfer was required in a standard if you want to 
invest here you have to transfer technology along with this investment 
so in general the pattern of southeast asia was different in latin america and 
it was done in latin america and specifically in brazil it wasn't 
signed by the workers' party, something could have been done and the 
media monopoly in Brazil is very serious is a very serious problem throughout 
latin america also knows all the countries of latin america the media 
controlled and in the hands of few family members are oligopolies and right-wing 
and this has been a minus for every effort in latin america to go on a 
more progressive direction I post the details for you if you want 
diego is nicaragua missing in the 80s you during the santista period 
nicaragua for example the main newspaper la press openly publicly 
was asking for the overthrow of the Sandinista government supporting the attack on the 
government a newspaper as if it had existed in the united states 
editors owners would be trapped were soft they would face 
death squad if you say something like that in nicaragua they were the three 
great editors of the big newspaper and the same thing was true in venezuela 
when there was a short military coup and the press supported this military coup in 
venezuela cbsk american television supported the military coup in venezuela 
and you never will and there will be cps again so this event is his in chile is is the 
unbelievable and this is true across the continent what 
the director been faced with this problem there are ways to create alternatives to the 
media monopoly of radio televisions and this has not been implemented and 
there were a whole series of problems of this kind that should have been faced in the 
seriously on your visit to ex president lula you can say 
these things to him yes yes I spoke clear why not I see 
I told him all this but I think it's not true it's the squid which is the 
responsible for the pt as a whole that has to think the union the forces 
progressives of intellectual teachers like you activists 
militants this are things that belongs to society 
as a whole because we can't escape the structure 
basic colonial colonial standards that concentrated wealth and made a world 
his own away from the rest and who does not work for the country and even 
having a high degree is where do you know a minority who have 
great but that has a contempt for most of the people this is something that the 
I could better understand how I married the valeria that the media 
Brazilian and then I can have a more inside view coming from her she 
serving as an intermediary and showing how privileged certain sectors are and 
How do they see the poor? 
be able to reach 11 a conclusion that the car covers from the working class 
that I can't go to college that can't speak the language 
Portuguese is appropriate that it could be a leader of the country as it was when it happened 
column and are cultural attitudes that come along with the lack of concern and having 
commitment to the majority of the people of the country 
it is a high option of employment closed at international level this characteristic 
colonial cities that Brazil and many Latin American countries are still 
failed to overcome the colonialism that existed, I am not suggesting that 
things are wonderful that's not what i'm talking about you know 
we are recording at the bar of the bankers' union in sao paulo downtown 
city   and ran an ambulance cheat sometimes even police cars and I must 
confess that when we think it's police we get a little worried 
woe to him if they knew that this dangerous people of communism are here 
international rose 
the teacher who both sequentially with the conversation about the media is 
do you think it is the new alternative media have as it had a way to 
to force a change in behavior in this mainstream media 
changing one using a little bit is in relation to a left-wing government in 
brazil what do you think could be done against monopolies you just 
would advise cutting concession well i think social media doesn't 
plays a very complicated role but a role exactly on what you 
said they get their pressure between ba and 
prejudices distortions the main media of large chains of 
tv and radio we've seen it the last few days on 
Brazil we had these huge manifestations of he not thousands of people 
took to the streets in all capitals is a fantastic event and I ate the help of 
my valeria wife i could see the media and the media didn't give the big tvs anything and 
radios gave nothing globe articles nothing came out about the demonstrations through the 
social networks people can see what's going on and can spread and you 
have an idea of   these big real demonstrations 
the same thing happened in the west I for example the media in the united states 
practically nothing I have nothing like nothing happened in Brazil 
this is not the kind of thing that the mainstream media the mainstream media will support this 
it's a new thing is i'm going to briefly describe george orwell's in 
essay that almost nobody read because it was suppressed the presentation was selected 
of your level the animal farm now everyone in this book has love shape 
no one nor the book presentation the book introduction as i said was 
deleted from the edition was discovered years later and later published 
in his introduction he says the following this book is a satire of the animal 
totalitarian but you people of england shouldn't feel like the 
holders of the absolute right because in england it frees and in popular ideas 
they can be suppressed without the use of force and he goes on discussing 
quickly how do you do that i'm quoting uncle now a reason 
that gets them here is about is that the press is owned by rich people who 
for some reason he doesn't want certain ideas to be expressed and there is another reason 
that he says that in my opinion it is even more important here is the culture 
dominant intellectual who has a hegemonic culture in the country if you have 
a good educational background you found the time you 
understanding that there are certain things you shouldn't say the 
man should think there are already things you shouldn't even think about and you much less 
say it is part of your nature that is part of nature what we call 
high-level education very well educated people is already part of 
your understanding that you shouldn't say certain things and is a consequence of what the 
writer george orwell said of free england and most of the world 
democratic western are ideas in popular that events in popular can 
be suppressed without the use of force and this can be overcome 
searching for the things you just asked 
so the media has public concessions are public concessions to television by 
example uses public space public good 
the roads are belongs to the people belongs to the state and are given through concession 
a public concession to private companies but to be done in another way 
these concessions can be changed there may be a national media like 
bbc in england for example or it could be a community radio a radio 
local a local tv but that actually with squid 20 years ago i went 
quite impressive must say an event the suburbs of rio de janeiro the 
south and nova iguacu i don't know if the project still exists but 
a small TV producer was going to the suburbs in the new city iguacu 
that was close to the river and established the equipment in a public square where the 
people were there and congregating and it showed a screen on a big screen is 
in the public square that featured TV shows on insects described 
by people from the community itself and the actors who were even from the community 
nova iguacu community some were comedy skits some 0 reports 
other serious political discussions and one of the young actresses who 
performed on this public television in the square would walk through the crowd as 
question microphone asking questions and comments from people people 
commented that it was being shown on the big screen in the public square and others reacted 
so there was an interaction from a large audience of that local community 
focused on discussions and interactions of very serious issues and 
this kind of community tv popular tv can be done was made that was 20 years ago 
years ago in many ways from the national media to the communities 
developing a basis for informing an information system 
that could break the media monopoly and many actions can 
be done at different levels eleven insured 
between getting into an issue that you worked on that the issue of the role of 
women in politics you know that historically women are oppressed 
right and recently throughout the 20th century 
but has recently been playing an important role in the united states with 
quiet is in europe all you see is this great pressure from 
women in this contemporary political debate and role it took a long time 
a long time to get there thousands of years ago to get there is in fact is very 
interesting that the united states is actually a little behind with respect to 
this exists in other countries of the world including latin america where 
women have already elected presidents prime ministers and it never happened 
in the united states so it is already late in this 
the internship is well behind with respect to these women achievements but 
is finally starting to see a breakthrough is not American scenery 
electoral campaign more and more women are presenting themselves as candidates 
candidates is in American politics minority women who have never 
applying for politics before is there are several examples that I could cite to 
you but it's a tough battle for women if you see the background in which 
it's hard let's take england united states for example that were 
historically the countries that went earlier to pass by promoting a form of 
democracy of democratic governments democratic systems in the united states 
when it became an independent country and ended in 1780 and ended up accepting the law 
English law if women were not sewn people in English law of the 
underage women were the property of their 
her father's husband and the property was then handed over to the 
husband and in fact if you see the debates at the congress you should be entitled to 
voting for women dream one of the arguments against making the right 
back the woman who would be unfair for unmarried moments because a man 
getting married would have two votes his and his wife's vote 
his property this lasted for a long time the denial 
of voting for women and there was a very big battle he is from the 19th and 20th century 
to try to break that barrier against women women's rights 
to vote was only approved in 1920 is almost in 
same time that Afghanistan has the right to women will vote 
in fact until 1985 after a militancy in the 60s in 1975 for the first time 
the United States Supreme Court ruled that women are peers 
they have rights to appear and as members of the jury in courts 
federal and before women could not they had status of beings 
humans could then be part of juries in 1975 is not that long ago and 
so progress even progress being made still has many barriers against 
women so yes I agree with you to a women's struggle and tremendous 
in one of the great achievements of political activism of the 60s and 
Since then, these institutions have 
women, but it has a long way to go to make further progress. 
great was made after centuries and centuries of struggles 
I think how you have this is one of the most important points in the 
cultural and political point of view but there are many barriers to 
overcome but this is a sign of what can be accomplished by popular struggle of 
hard movement and was given as a gift to women 
rights are never given are earned through struggle and this can 
be won professor john squire as ultimate 
unfortunately asks why our time is running out 
since the attack on the towers of new york in the united states that were already the police 
the world won more arguments to watch the planet earth 
what is the limit of that unfortunately one year is very discouraging for us 
contemplate if we want to see how the future will appear 
look at china china has made great progress in many ways but in 
others the picture is scary there is a 
very large control and surveillance the Chinese people chambers is recognitions 
facials and following people's activities by watching people and how it is and 
how will they behave in their participation the leaders and has punishment 
this and this looking forward but we allow it to continue 
the amount of swimming that is being collected on people the lives of 
people who are not of their choosing is extraordinary just to give you a 
example the united states probably other countries also the manufacturer 
automobile once are now considering a major problem they have 
lots of data about people if you drive a car they knew where you 
went where it was where you came across the car if you passed a red light if 
you for a return all this data is stored by 
automobile industry in the computer systems of cars in the states 
united and they understand that this is a tremendous way at first 
could be used for citizen surveillance and control but could be 
used for advertising to make money on top of that information like 
is that we can find a way to communicate this data to gain 
money is is one of the ways it could be that you can give and receive a 
gift from the company that sold the car in heavy rain the messi whatever the 
auto company can give a gift and put and retribution you 
agree that the dashboard in front of you while driving is on me with 
an advertising screen so if you're entering the neighborhood of a 
restaurant and the bank is database know that sometimes you stop for lunch 
at a dinner restaurant will put that restaurant's advertising on the screen 
which is a few blocks away and you can and maybe at the restaurant then you 
going to have this effort to influence and shape the behavior that you don't 
manages to escape on its benign side of that of surveillance and storage of 
data on people but there is a much more negative aspect is that these 
things can be used to monitor watch over control irony give many 
people want to suppress something with the right to get states data is that 
the can be handled manufactured to the thing that appeared on facebook can be 
used and as a means of directing their behavior for fear of being punished 
influence their behavior to be eaten be punished you can 
publicize something about these people that's all 
possibilities who is this and anyone who has a cell phone is 
under constant surveillance every minute of the day wherever you go 
this information appears where it is going ready and mullet of cta going to 
some central source that stores this status 
this has terrible imminent dangers this is a system that we need 
seriously take into account is and try to figure out ways to restrict 
finish embarrassing this type of system and establish another title 
under democratic control and not under central control by big brother for 
someone who's watching us the teacher we went I don't have 
words to say thank you and sir i have a long career as 
journalist but certainly be able to have the privilege of interviewing or is one of those 
things for us to put on the curriculum and keep there stored with great affection 
thank you very much the two roses that made this conversation so great too 
thank you very much for seeing us so far in this new schedule 
remembering that in interviews he comes back next Tuesday at ten o'clock that 
you can see this program through our facebook channels on youtube 
always remembering more reason after listening to professor jonas who 
never despair
