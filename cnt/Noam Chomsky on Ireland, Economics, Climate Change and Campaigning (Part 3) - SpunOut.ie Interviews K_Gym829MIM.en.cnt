working people in Michigan in the
Midwest to take over those industries
running themselves rather profitably
that produce what is needed in fact what
you observe in the United States today
is almost surreal now in the country the
country's infrastructure is terrible
I mean compare say your extended
European not British with the
continental and one things very
seriously needed because of the energy
crisis the climate crisis the
infrastructure crisis this high-speed
transit know the transportation
secretary Thomas Transportation
Secretary is in Europe they're trying to
use federal stimulus money to obtain the
- for contracts with say Spanish
companies to produce high-speed rail
technology been equipment for the United
States it's not blandish at the same
time they're dismantling the industrial
capacity at home which could very well
produce it well it's not necessary just
sit and watch that happen anymore that
was necessary for Bolivian peasants to
watch the World Bank privatized water so
that some economists
that killed company could make plenty of
money but they wouldn't have ordered a
drink they kicked the company out took
the system over themselves and that can
be done here
what's your key message to people in
terms of how they can solve these
problems how they can supposed to take
my deleted are not in this particular
case we're version communities can take
over the industrial facilities that are
being dismantled vendors who run though
themselves the only popular support for
that and may be federal support - that
doesn't have to be it probably wouldn't
even be a fraction of what's being given
away to big bankers those are all
feasible tasks if the populist anger
goes in that direction you know any
similar things elsewhere that could be
painful on the other hand if it turns
into a right-wing rage
let's Sarah Palin Rush Limbaugh hostile
rage could be extremely dangerous that's
and it's the task of tasks of series of
organizers and activists to try to help
direct these understandable currents
into constructive directions rather than
those
I have very ominous consequences that I
presume similar things circumstances
it's the same is true and many other
things so take say that it takes a
health care I'm in the main issue that
Congress has been struggling with for
the last months as a health care bill
u.s. health care system is a complete
scandal
it has event twice the per capita costs
of other industrial societies it has
some of the worst doctors 50 million
people of no insurance at all and the
reason is it is also the only health
care system in the industrial world
that's based on essentially unregulated
private insurance companies well and a
powerful drug industry this is the only
country in the world that I know of
where the government is barred by the
law from negotiating drug prices with
the big pharmaceutical industries well
you know you have an unregulated
insurance system regulated form a huge
pharmaceutical industry which is free do
it once and of course benefits from
enormous government support research and
development awkward pricing rights and
so on it's not a free market system as
long as you have that yeah you're going
to have extremely expensive and wasteful
and inefficient health care system now
the public hasn't used on this for years
decades the public has been favored or
some sort of
national healthcare system well that's
not even the agenda private financial
institutions and the pharmaceutical
industry won't permit it that they
basically own Congress in the White
House they get their way now there was
an attempt in the current bills to deal
with public concern by allowing what was
called a public option that is among the
options that would be available for
health care would be a problem
sort of like Medicare the program for
the elderly and there was a also an
option to allow buy into Medicare so
instead of the 65 a good buy ended 55
though but it was pretty strongly if it
still is strongly in favor of those
choices you look at the polls which kind
of like to they're not going to be
enacted because of our the insurance
companies and the financial institutions
the are the private insurance companies
going to be regulated well the latest
poll just came out about two days ago
and by a large margin people think
something should be done a large margin
in favor of regulation
in fact with the wait would you read in
the press is that the public is opposed
to the health care reform that's true
because they wanted to go farther
no because the power of private capital
is so extraordinary and Congress and the
White House are so subordinate to it
we're going to end with at best some
minor improvement over a system which is
so fiscally how to control that it's
correctly destroyed the budget well I
said those are signs of furious feathers
of democracy and of organizing and
activism that has to be dealt with and
you do you see that everywhere
it takes a global warming that's you
know that's a that's a if nothing is
done about that nothing serious it's
gonna be a maybe not a death knell for
the species but it's remotely through
the world it'll lead to a catastrophe
sooner or later the energy industries in
the United States are strongly opposed
to doing anything about because it will
cut into their short-term profits and
they have launched a huge propaganda
campaign I wish the media are fairly
receptive to to try to convince the
public that it's true it's not a
significant issue and that has been
successful in the past year to the polls
the proportion of people who think
as a serious problem has dropped sharply
affected its draft to the point we're
barely a third of the population thinks
of human activities as our second global
warming well that's a great victory for
the energy corporations it's a huge
defeat for our grandchildren we're going
to live with the consequences of this
and here's a test where organizers and
activists have their work cut out for
them an issue that's basically one of
species sugar how do they do it we don't
know it's not going to happen by itself
there are many other issues thank you
very much
