to imagine a more appropriate choice to
deliver a lecture named for the late
edward syed than Noam Chomsky the
careers of both men combined the most
meticulous scholarship and political
passion and personal courage both have
stood as the conscience of an
intellectual world that far too often
succumbs to the temptations of power of
the powerful like Saeed Chomsky is not
as not afraid to say the unpopular thing
to point out that many emperor's have no
clothes to project alternatives when the
media and the political leaders say that
no other course is possible and to think
of what may be rather than what is this
is why for students scholars and
political activists around the world
both Syed and Chomsky have served as a
source of inspiration there's a story
that in the 1970s the Prime Minister of
Italy gathered a group of intellectuals
and pleaded with them to help solve one
of that country's periodic crises I
think it was Umberto Eco who rose and
responded mr. prime minister the role of
intellectuals is not to solve crises it
is to create crises let us hope that
Noam Chomsky continues to create crises
for those in power for many years to
come so ladies and gentlemen let us
welcome the edward saeed lecturer Noam
Chomsky
when I was a young teenager and my
father was getting a little nervous
about some of the directions I was
pursuing he did mention to me that he
had been a member of the IWW and I'm
sort of curious so I I asked him why he
joined the IWW and he said when it came
over on steerage as an immigrant I was
working in a switch up in Baltimore
barely know any English he said a guy
came around and was trying to sign
people up he couldn't understand what he
was saying but he seemed to be for the
workers so excited I don't think they
have that in Wikipedia well to the
subject I think that the greatest
singular achievement of syed is a
literary critic has been to put
imperialism at the center of Western
civilization what you find in both
historical political literature and
literary works in the West in the last
400 years is a great emphasis on the
role of enlightenment in the making of
civilization and its discontent is Aman
democracy on democratic values and on
liberalism as an aspect of enlightenment
there's an almost remarkable tendency to
not mention imperialism as shaping the
contours of Western civilization in
literary criticism and historical
writing there are two times before
Said's or aunt ilysm and after
Orientalism well I've been quoting the
assessment of edward said's literary
contributions by his close friend and
comrade and struggle iqbal ahmed was
like like edward he was a rare and
stellar example of an engaged
intellectual dedicated to truth and
justice in Word and in action
they're passing a few years ago is an
irreparable loss for the poor and the
suffering of the world and also for
depth and clarity of thought and
understanding among Edwards many
achievements was to draw the culture of
imperialism out of the shadows and
explore its deep roots and its pervasive
implications in many domains and these
remarks I'd like to explore some of its
specific manifestations focusing on the
events that opened the way to the famous
unipolar moment of unchallenged u.s.
global hegemony 20 years ago it was
interested to see the pictures on the
wall as I came in remembering those
moments and also the ways in which these
events are remembered on the 20th
anniversary which was celebrated last
month to do so requires following two
tracks that one is policy the others its
interpretation through the prism of
Imperial ideology and the dawn of the
unipolar moment is a very instructive
test case I think in both domains we can
gain a sense of how deep are the roots
of Imperial ideology by considering
completely unambiguous cases none are
more clear than horrendous crimes that
are were frankly acknowledged by the
perpetrators but passed over as
insignificant or even denied in
retrospect by the beneficiaries namely
us settler colonialism which is commonly
the most vicious form of imperial
conquest that provides quite graphic
illustrations the English colonists in
North America had no doubts about what
they were doing Revolutionary War hero
General Henry Knox the first secretary
of war and
the liberated American colonies he
described them quoting the utter
extirpation of all the Indians in most
populous parts of the Union by means
more destructive to the Indian natives
than the conduct of the conquerors of
Mexico and Peru which would have been no
small feat in his later years after his
own contributions to these crimes were
long past John Quincy Adams lamented the
fate of what he called that hapless race
of Native Americans which we are
exterminating with such merciless and
perfidious cruelty among the heinous
sins of this nation for which I believe
God will one day bring it to judgment
other were some who offered a more
comforting refrain among them Supreme
Court justice Joseph's story who
wondered at the mysterious ways of
Providence which in its wisdom caused
the natives to disappear like the
withered leaves of autumn even though
the colonists had constantly respected
them distinguished contemporary
commentators that reinterpret the wisdom
of Providence in secular terms one
example is the prominent yale historian
john lewis goddess of Dina Cold War
historians he hails Adams John Quincy
Adams as the grand strategist who laid
the foundations for the bush doctrine
the doctrine that as gatas puts it
expansion is the path to security it was
a very convenient doctrine for those who
can get away with it or have powerful
patrons with evident appreciation the
goddess observes that the doctrine has
routinely applied throughout the history
of the infant Empire as George
Washington termed the New Republic he
passes in silence over Adams as gory
contributions to the heinous sins of the
nation has established the doctrine in a
famous state paper justifying the
conquest of Florida on utterly
fraudulent pretext of self-defense the
conquest was part of Adam's project of
removing or eliminating Native Americans
from the southeast it's a win Earl weeks
the leading historian of the massacre
who provides a lurid account of what he
calls this exhibition of murder and
plunder targeting lawless Indians and
runaway slaves the goddess sites weeks
but spares us the content of what he
said to mention an even more extreme
example that just a few months ago in
the New York Review of Books political
analyst Russell Baker describes what he
learned from the work of the heroic
historian as he calls him Edwin Edmund
Morgan namely here's what he learned
that Columbus found a continental
vastness sparsely populated by farming
and hunting people in the limitless and
unspoiled world stretching from tropical
jungle to the frozen north there may
have been scarcely more than a million
inhabitants I looked carefully no
letters appeared in reaction though a
few months later the editors didn't
publish what they called a clarification
which stated that in North America
recent reach research suggests that the
numbers may have been as high as 18
million well the clarification is
perhaps even more telling than the
original a baker first of all was not
referring to North America rather from
tropical jungle to the frozen north the
research is not recent it's decades old
and it was also known a long time ago
that the sparsely populated unspoiled
world included advanced civilizations in
also in what's now the United States
nevertheless the exercise of genocide
denial with a vengeance
Merritt's little concern or comment
presumably because it's so unremarkable
and in a good cause now not all cases of
genocide denial get such an easy pass
and the criterion is not very difficult
to discern the European Union recently
approved what they call the framework
decision on combating racism and
xenophobia which bans publicly condoning
denying or grossly trivializing crimes
of genocide crimes against humanity and
war crimes putting aside the question of
whether the holy state should be granted
the right to determine historical truth
and punish the deviation from its edicts
what's a particular interest here is the
selectivity of concerns there was a
response among historians who were upset
about it they feared that the framework
decision might bar not only questions
about the Holocaust which is already
banned in many countries but also
inquiry into crimes of the Ottoman
Empire and Stalinist Russia well perhaps
other cases come to mind crops with
Western powers as perpetrators and
beneficiaries but that question didn't
arise to this day the United States is
reverentially admired at home at least
as a city on a hill or as Ronald Regan
Regan preferred a shining city on a hill
last April British historian Jeffrey
Hudson was admonished by New York Times
columnist Roger Cohen for describing the
United States as just one great but
imperfect country among others Hodgson's
error cohen explained in the new year
x is his failure to realize that unlike
all other states past and present
America was born as an idea as a city on
a hill an inspirational notion that
resides deep in the American psyche so
its crimes are only unfortunate lapses
that do not tarnish the essential
nobility of America's transcendent
purpose borrowing the phrase of the
eminent scholar hunts Morganthau one of
the founders of the hard-headed realist
school of international relations
expounding on what he called the purpose
of America the inspirational phrase city
on a hill was coined by John Winthrop in
1630 out lighting outlining the glorious
future of a new nation ordained by God
when you're earlier his Massachusetts
Bay Colony had received its charter from
the King of England and it established
its great seal the seal was worth
looking at I think it ought to be on the
wobble of every classroom in the country
it depicts an Indian with a scroll
coming from his mouth pleading come over
and help us the Charter states that
rescuing the population from their
bitter pagan fate is the principle end
of this plantation so the English
colonists were guided by what Obama's UN
Ambassador Susan Rice calls the emerging
international norm that recognizes the
responsibility to protect innocent
civilians the colonists were thus on a
humane mission as they extirpated and
exterminated the natives for their own
good as their successors explained
so President Theodore Roosevelt aerated
that the expansion of the peoples of
white or European blood during the last
four centuries has been fraught with
lasting benefit to most of the peoples
already dwelling in the lands over which
the expansion took place despite what
Africans are Native Americans are
Filipinos or other beneficiaries might
mistakenly even believe this venerable
conception which is still very much
alive and in fact operative it's been
guided in part by the providential ISM
that has so deeply influenced American
culture and from the early settlers up
to george w bush his case is pretty
remarkable examples this is the
conception that we're carrying out God's
will in his mysterious ways that's
that's been accompanied by another
thesis also then our who also very much
alive the thesis of anglo-saxon
superiority which traces back to the
original Aryans and the Teutons and the
german forests who maintained their
racial purity by exterminating those in
their pads they then cross the channel
did their work and then came over here
which is why were city on the hill these
beliefs are deeply ingrained in English
cultural history and they carried over
to the infant Empire established by the
English in those limitless and unspoiled
world they found for the founder of
American anthropology Lewis Morgan the
Aryan family represents the central
stream of progress because it produced
the highest type of mankind and because
it has proved its intrinsic superiority
by gradually assuming control of the
earth Charles Darwin endorsed the view
that the history of the culture of mine
from Greece to the Roman Empire and
onward only appears to have
purpose and value when viewed in
connection with or rather a subsidiary
to the great stream of anglo-saxon
immigration to the west and finally to
the united states where the advance of
civilization has reached its peak
because the nation produced the greatest
number of highly intellectual energetic
brave patriotic and benevolent men as
the project was approaching its final
stages final success in the mid 19th
century the government of Governor of
California Peter Burnett informed the
public that the war of extermination
will continue to be waged between the
two races until the Indian race becomes
extinct the inevitable destiny of the
white race is beyond the power of is
beyond the power and wisdom of man to
overt to avert only the Lord understands
it the progressive national poet Walt
Whitman saw the course of history in a
similar way our conquests he declared
take off the shackles that prevent men
the even chance of being happy and good
on the conquest of half of Mexico he
asked rhetorically what has miserable
inefficient Mexico to do with a great
mission of people in the new world with
a noble race ralph waldo emerson wrote
that it's very certain that the strong
british race which is now overrun much
of this continent must also overrun
Texas and Mexico and Aragon also and it
will be in the course of Ages of small
import by what particular occasions and
methods it was done easy to on but
examples are really quite unfair because
the ideas have been conventional in fact
they're almost universal are dependent
exceptions the some and approaching the
present
very few eyebrows were raised as far as
I could see when a leading scholarly
history of US diplomacy is 1969
commented wittily that after liberating
themselves from British rule the United
colonies were able to concentrate on the
task of felling trees and Indians and of
rounding out their national borders
liberal scholar Thomas Bailey standard
histories of American diplomacy well
it's important to recognize that after
the civilizing effect of the activism of
the 60s as such words are no longer
acceptable although there's a long way
to go well with these inadequate words
of background let's turn to the present
on the double track of policy and
ideology beginning with the latter with
ideology so let's begin with the month
of november two thousand nine that was
marked by the joyous 20th anniversary
celebration of what british historian
Timothy Garton ash calls the biggest
year in world history since 1945 which
changed everything thanks primarily to
Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms within
Russia and his breathtaking renunciation
of the use of force a luminous example
of the importance of the individual in
history leading to the fairly open of
Russian elections of March 1989 and
culminating in the fall of the Berlin
Wall on November ninth which opened the
way to liberation of Eastern Europe from
Russian tyranny that's what's celebrated
on the pictures as you walk in the
general mood was captured rather well by
a British barrister matthew writer
writing in the London observer he spoke
for we call the niners that's the
generation that's now providing global
leadership Barack Obama and their lead
and their conception
history was shaped by a world changed
without guns in 1989 events that gave
them confidence in the power of
dedication to non-violence and justice
that's today's global leaders these
accolades for November 9th are deserved
and the events are indeed memorable and
the picture is even compelling which is
why it's virtually a hundred percent of
commentary as you can check for
yourselves it's compelling as long as we
keep rigorously to a dominant principle
of Imperial culture we must focus
laser-like on the crimes of enemies and
are on our own high-minded condemnation
of the crimes of enemies but crucially
we must make sure never to look at
ourselves and the principles apply in
the familiar way to the events of last
November and some alternative
perspectives mostly unintended may be
instructive one was provided
unintentionally by a German Chancellor
on bellaire miracle who called on all of
us according her to use this invaluable
gift of freedom to overcome the walls of
our time that's good advice and we can
easily follow it one way to follow it
would be to dismantle the massive wall
which dwarfs the berlin wall in scale
and in length which is snaking its way
through palestinian territory
corson gross violation of international
law if anyone cares about such details
well like virtually every state action
this annexation wall as it should be
called is justified in terms of security
that's a reflex whatever state does but
as is commonly the case the claim lacks
any credibility at all if security were
the concern the wool would be built
along the border and it could be made
completely impregnable the purpose of
this illegal monstrosity which is
constructed with decisive the u.s.
support and European complicity is to
allow Israel to take over valuable
Palestinian land and the main water
resources of the region that's one part
of a much broader annexation project
which we fund and support otherwise it
couldn't continue the highest Israeli
authorities recognized from the outset
that these programs were in direct
violation of international law there was
never any ambiguity its leading legal
authorities in Israel but as defense
minister Moshe Dayan commented in late
nineteen sixty seven settling Israelis
and occupied territories contravenes as
is known international conventions but
there's nothing essentially new in that
just quite true so the issue can be
dismissed at least it can be dismissed
as long as the global hegemon provides
diplomatic cover and the needed material
and ideological support and is therefore
a co partner in crime another
perspective on the 2009 celebrations as
provided by the leading scholar advocate
of what's called democracy promotions
Thomas Carruthers good scholar who
writes from an insider's perspective he
served in these programs
during the Reagan administration and
regards himself as a kind of neo
Reaganite after reviewing the record
Carruthers ruefully concludes that all
us leaders have been schizophrenic they
need some kind of psychiatric help the
schizophrenia is that they support
democracy if and only if it conforms to
strategic and economic objectives by
some strange accident hence they
supported in Soviet satellites but not
in u.s. client states these judgments
were dramatically verified through the
1980s period leading up to the fall of
the wall of the fall of the wall has
been rightly celebrated in recent weeks
but there's been little notice of what
happened one week later on November 16th
1989 in El Salvador that was the brutal
assassination of six prominent Latin
American intellectuals and Jesuit
priests along with their housekeeper who
to Elba and her daughter Celine by the
elite applicable battalion armed and
trained by Washington the battalion had
just returned from a several month
refresher course at the JFK special
warfare school at Fort Bragg and a few
days before the murder the battalion
took part in a further training exercise
run by US Special Forces flown to El
Salvador to the Cayenne is heralded as
El Salvador's best the battalion had
already left a bloody trail of the usual
victims during the horrendous decade of
the 1980s which opened in El Salvador
with the assassination of Archbishop
Oscar Romero the voice for the voiceless
as it was called by much the same hand
and a story was similar throughout
Central America leaving hundreds of
thousands of corpses and general misery
during a rain of torture murder
and destruction a guided by the Reagan
administration under the guise of the
war on terror that they declared in 1981
as they came to the office well it was
surmised at the time that the murder of
the Jesuit intellectuals was planned by
the high command of the Salvadoran army
and that was confirmed two weeks ago by
the publication in the Spanish press of
the document the actual document
ordering the murders and the murder of
any witnesses this was signed by the
chief of staff and his associates it's
all in hand all of them so closely
connected to the Pentagon and the
embassy US embassy that is very hard to
imagine that Washington was unaware
these dramatic discoveries have yet to
be reported here and I am not
anticipating that they will mainstream
Spanish press why our services takes
some competence to missing one can
easily understand why the consciousness
of the niners was shaped to non VI
dedication to non-violence and the power
of idealism that's fair enough if
attention is rigorously guided by the
culture of imperialism this focused on
their crimes with errors removed from
site and removed from memory now the
contrasts for the 1980s between the
liberation of Soviet satellites and the
violent crushing of hope in us domains
is striking and instructive but it
becomes even more so when we broaden the
perspective the assassination of the
Jesuit intellectuals there was a
crushing blow to liberation theology
that was the remarkable revival of
Christianity that had its modern roots
in the initiatives of Pope John the 23rd
and Vatican to which he opened in 1962
it's an event that ushered in a new era
in the
story of the Catholic Church quoting the
distinguished theologian hunt scream
inspired by Vatican to the
latin-american bishops adopted what they
called the preferential option for the
poor renewing the radical passivism of
the Gospels that had been put to rest
when the Emperor Constantine in the
fourth century established Christianity
as the religion of the Roman Empire as
come describes it that instituted a
revolution which converted the
persecuted Church to a persecuting
church as remained in the post Vatican
to attempt to revive the Christianity of
the pre-roman period priests and nuns
laypersons took the message of the
Gospels to the poor and the persecuted
and brought them together in based
communities encourage them to take their
fate into their own hands and to work
together to try to overcome the misery
of survival in the vicious realms of us
power well the reaction to this grave
heresy was not long in coming in 1964 a
military coup took place in Brazil the
basis was laid for it by the Kennedy
administration actually occurred a
couple of weeks after his assassination
it established a national security state
and Brazil kind of a neo-nazi national
security state it overthrew an mildly
social democratic government instituted
a reign of torture and violence it was
the most decisive victory for freedom in
the mid 20th century according to
Kennedy Johnson ambassador Lincoln
Gordon who added that the democratic
forces is now in charge should create a
greatly improved climate for private
investment Gordon's words were echoed
just a few days ago when Obama's
ambassador to undo
first they called the elections under
the military regime a great celebration
of democracy
