I heard you mentioned before that that
prisons and growth of prisons shot me
off the economy and we are seeing a
growth in prisons and everybody from the
left and right saying oh yo there's more
crime you do need more prisons so do
hours in any prison yeah absolutely me
what is that yeah in fact very clear new
girl as you move towards the third
remember what a third-world society
looks like a third-world society has a
lot of superfluous people people are
just useless
they have no human rights and the human
value because they don't contribute to
making profit and enriching the rich you
know they don't even clean their floors
they're not even needed for anything but
well in in one of our third-world
domains that's why we fund security
forces like we half of our military aid
more than half for Latin America goes to
Colombia and the reason is it has the
worst human rights record on in the
hemisphere it's slaughter the security
forces have killed maybe 20,000 people
or so in the last few years you know
political organizers and union leaders
and peasants and so on
and that's the way you make sure you
keep the superfluous people under
control you slaughter them well we
haven't quite reached that level here
though we're getting to be a third world
Society so what we do with the
superfluous people the ones who don't
contribute the wealth production for the
rich and therefore have no don't aren't
human really what you do with them is
first of all try to come up in slums
which are sort of like concentration
camps and if that doesn't work you put
them in jail which is the equivalent
sort of the counterpart in a wealthy
society to death squads and a poor
society and so they're naturally zooming
and they are a shot in the arm it's only
crime is not going up at least as far as
any evidence is concerned I mean if you
can believe the government you know FBI
statistics and all this other stuff
crime is fairly level you know I mean
sort went up in the 70s since then it's
probably the ends even declined but the
perception of crime has increased but
that's because it's it's not that it's
not a serious problem especially if
you're a poor person it's an extremely
serious problem because crime is mostly
poor people preying on each other so
you're a poor person you know
down in Roxbury yeah crimes a problem
but they're not the ones are calling
from our prisons no the to put you know
their own sons in jail the in fact there
are now more black males in the prison
system and in the education system in
the you know relevant ages in fact what
the criminal system is simply being used
as a war against literally a war against
an unwanted part of the population a
part of the population that used to be
industrial workers or at least have the
opportunity to and maybe work themselves
up but now just have no rights because
you don't need that anymore you can get
them cheaper somewhere else so you got
to get rid of that's a large part of
what the drug worse about drug war has
no effect on drugs in fact as I
mentioned a large part of and it's well
known outside the United States is in
the bishop statement that a large part
of the drug policies are fomenting the
production of drugs and in fact if
anybody wanted to do something but the
drugs they go to wherever those two
hundred sixty billion dollars of annual
profits are being laundered namely US
banks you know you don't see many
bankers in jail the drug program is
designed and implemented to criminalize
and unwanted population black males
Hispanic males and so on so you know you
take a look at that chain gangs in
Alabama and it'll be somebody who had a
jointness pocket you know that's sort of
thing so that's what you do it as for
the the system has a side benefit it's
state spending
so it has a stimulative effect on the
economy firms like say merrill lynch you
know and prudential and so on they are
putting out bonds tax-free bonds for the
building of prisons and making a lot of
money on it it's a growth it's part of
its it's part of the growth system you
know it's come it's not the scale of the
pentagon but it's sort of you know it
got the same function in fact the
military corporations are all like
Lockheed and so on they're already
realizing it so they are now exploring
the possibility of entering on you know
climbing on that gravy train and sewing
developing high-tech
high-tech high-tech methods of
surveillance and control which the
public will pay for and it will be dual
use technology and you will use it for
something else actually is a big story
in The Wall Street Journal about it a
couple months ago so you know you can
you good engineer you can figure out a
way to implant an electrode and somebody
so then some supercomputer somewhere
I'll have them under surveillance and if
they go the wrong place you stand at a
shock or you know in drug you know
chemicals or something or other and that
way you could have very efficient
monitoring of and control of large parts
of the population which would be quite
cost-effective except of course for the
technology which the public is paying
for anyway prison construction alone is
a booming industry and the security
personnel has been maybe still is the
fastest growing white-collar operation
for some you know profession for some
years so all of this stuff goes on with
pouring money into the hands of the
wealthier sectors Merrill Lynch
construction also the prisons are being
privatized I don't remember the figures
but the growth of the privately run
prisons is far higher than the state-run
prisons and that's just another scam
privatized prisons is like privatized
health means public pays the costs and
one or another technique but there's
private profit and you have a lot of
techniques of you know you can cut down
costs by pouring putting more prisoners
into a cell and you don't have to give
them any care and no rehabilitation none
of that stuff so I think the whole thing
is is a very natural consequence of the
policies designed to create a third
world type society now when I say third
world I don't mean the United States
going to look like Mexico you know much
too rich for that but it's going to that
structure you know that kind of
structure at a richer level and yeah
that's prisons are a part of that just
as death squads and the terror of the
security forces is part of Mexico and
Colombia
