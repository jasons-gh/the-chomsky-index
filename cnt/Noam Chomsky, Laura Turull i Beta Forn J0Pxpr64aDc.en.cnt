Not here? (man) Here on camera. 
Here. 
(Salellas) The indictment states: 
"The initiative that created the website Let catalans vote 
it was crucial to achieve membership 
of characters from the international scene 
in the face of the judicial closure of the referendum websites. 
This is the fact, the fact for which it is asked ... 
such a serious penalty against Mr. Jordi Cuixart. 
And what is that fact? 
Seek adherence to a political referendum demand, 
, well-known people like Noam Chomsky, 
that we have asked that they be summoned as witnesses 
in this plenary and which the Court has considered irrelevant. 
But in any case, do you seek the support of those characters ... 
Can a referendum demand be a criminal act? 
Were they guerrilla warfare actions? 
(home) War scenario and guerrilla scenario. 
-Tractors, straw alpaca barricades ... 
-Bottles started to rain ... -Screams, blows, kicks ... 
What were the slogans heard? 
- "Fascists", "sons of bitches" ... - "We will vote", "independence" ... 
"Out of the forces of repression", "Out of the forces of occupation" ... 
"Fascists", in Catalan, "fascists" ... 
-It's a piece of square cloth that said "Omnium", with a stick ... 
-It can't be. Either participated or did not participate. 
-Time is relative. -Completely contradictory. 
If there is only one, an email ... 
urging him to act violently. 
(home) No. 
You have been summoned by the defense of Jordi Cuixart in this trial 
as a witness, 
but it has been rejected by the judges at the time of being able to express itself. 
We asked Jordi Cuixart's lawyers 
what questions would they have asked him, 
and if you like it I'll do some for you now so you can answer them for me. 
The first is: what is a political prisoner? 
Jordi Cuixart is a political prisoner. 
According to international standards 
and taking into account the facts 
that happened in Catalonia in October 2017, 
Do you consider the allegations serious? 
which are made about Jordi Cuixart 
correspond to what happened? 
You signed several manifestos 
such as "Let catalans vote" or "Justice and Freedom", 
who demanded the release of political prisoners 
along with various international personalities 
such as several Nobel Peace Prizes. 
Why did you join? 
It's funny, because in every prison there's always a hallway. 
-Have you noticed? -There were also some in Estremera. 
Yes, yes, but covered. It's like "the hallway." 
They must have done it a thousand times, this hallway. So many. 
It's just that it's weird to be here. 
Yes, yes, a lot. 
It's been many months since we came, since mid-January. 
Look at. I had never seen him. Wasn't he there before? 
-I do not remember. -I wasn't there. 
It's just that it's weird to be here without ... knowing they're not there. 
Hello. How are you? Laura. 
Well. Hi, Beta. 
Hello. How are you? 
Well ... It's weird, being here. Strange feeling, right? 
Little bit. Do we enter the speaker? 
Let's go. Yes? Raul. 
Had you been here? 
- (Laura) I do, twice. - (Beta) I don't, ever. 
That is, when you communicated, when you talked to your parents, 
it was always in an open space, without glass. 
Yes, in family-friendly rooms. 
(Beta) Yes, I decided, when they came here, 
as we were entitled to a more family visit, 
that I wouldn't come to the phone booth, because I'm not really having a good time at all. 
I do not like it. 
Because? Because communication is hard, right, I guess? 
The glass ... Yes, yes. 
Does that remind you of Estremera, for example? 
In Estremera you speak through the glass more than once. 
In Estremera, several times, but it was different, it was darker. 
In Estremera it was much colder. The space is half that. 
Yes. It's very old, all very chalked ... It's not nice, to be sitting there. 
If not, we usually went to family vis-a-vis, 
which is a room where there is no glass. 
That that's where you can touch, hug, let's say, is different. 
And it's an hour and a half. Well, in Madrid there are two; here is an hour and a half. 
And here are only 40 minutes. In the phone booth, 40 minutes. 
Yes, and when it's over, it's over. 
That is, it is cut and you do not have time to say goodbye. 
And then, suddenly, the voice stops and you don't hear anything anymore, 
and you are left with half an explanation. 
So you can't say goodbye. No, no. 
Then it all starts with gestures. Like this... 
Touching the glass ... Or vocalizing a lot. 
What is that image, right ?, which is always explained, 
that one puts his hand up, the other puts his hand up and it's a way to say goodbye. 
In fact, they're pretty clean here, 
but in Estremera I remember lips stuck to the glasses. 
And small, big hands ... 
That's shocking, that. 
Are you following the judgment, you, now, 
with your student life you have? 
Yes. 
I haven't seen all the statements, but most have; 
let's comment on them, in fact. 
I set out, at first, to see it all, 
but of course, now I've seen that no ... 
It's just that it's hard to combine judgment with your whole life; 
it's like being on trial for 24 hours, 
more keep up with everything and also try not to be affected by certain things. 
It is very complicated. 
Sure, there are a lot of people who live it very politically, that. 
You live the two facets, don't you ?, the most political facet ... 
Of course, there is the human factor, and it is already beginning to take its toll on them. 
I talked to my dad a couple of days ago, and they're tired, 
and you see that they are losing weight ... 
I mean they're ... I don't mean shattered, 
but every day there and everything ... you notice them. 
Then you also suffer for it. 
They seem to be fine, but they are having a bad time, right now. 
And you went to see the trial. You said it, that you have been to the Supreme. 
And what sensation has it generated for you, that of being within the Supreme? 
The first day was awful. 
The first day the trial began ... We were there for a week. 
Yes, we were there the first week of trial. 
And the first day impacted us a lot. 
Already for everything that happened to us in the morning before we entered. 
But in there ... I think we were aware of that, and we said it, 
that there are two realities, that in this judgment there are two realities. 
Because it was our first contact with people who are from Vox; 
you realize a reality I didn't know. 
And you see there are two totally different stories. 
People from Vox who came to talk to you? 
Yes, yes, yes. And we had, not a discussion, but we were reprimanded ... 
What did they tell you? Well ... 
-If we repeated the words ... -A few words a little beast. 
Let's say that, at the outset, 
people were nice to us, both of us ... 
Then, when they knew who our parents were, 
They looked at us sadly and said: 
"You Catalans are so wrong. 
Your parents are so wrong! " 
And "they will spend so many years in prison" ... 
That, I remember they told us. 
-But that "is what they deserve." -Because, obviously, right? 
"They have broken Spain and of course ... they have to rot." 
One of the things I always wonder, 
when we talk about the situation of prisoners and their families, 
it's about their parents. 
The grandparents. 
And that all this must upset them deeply. 
A lot, and because they are great. 
And, in my case, they are sick. I mean no ... 
My father has been imprisoned, and I always say: 
I will see my father come out of it; my grandparents... 
Everyone thinks like this. 
It makes me angry, doesn't it? 
Our grandparents, who were already fighting to get out of a dictatorship ... 
and they left the skin there to get it. 
And now he goes and locks their son in jail. 
My grandmother was small and lived in the midst of the Franco dictatorship, 
and it's like all of that was a bit of a taboo subject, for her. 
Her mother was locked up in prison 
when she was just born, to be a Republican, to share ..., 
well, because they said he was handing out Republican propaganda. 
And now all these resentments have resurfaced 
and it is as if he now understands even more 
all for which his parents fought. 
All this repression becomes much more evident to him 
or this abuse by the Spanish state. 
I will always remember my grandfather, 
when my father was called to leave, he said: 
"Whatever happens in Madrid, we will always be by your side." 
And that breaks the heart ... 
Sure, because I hadn't seen it that way. 
But of course, my father was going to Madrid; 
I didn't know if my grandfather would be able to go there, and he didn't know either. 
He said, "Maybe this is the last time I'm here with you ..." 
# 
(Ragman) There was a time when there was a statement on our own 
to tell us "we agree with what Mr. Forn says." 
# America! 
In the end, he is a politician, he does what he causes. 
# America! 
I think there was a point, and I must say so, of irresponsibility. 
# You are so grand and gold, golden. 
# Oh I wish I was deep in America tonight. # 
(Pina) Just if I could clarify in what media ..., 
the content of those statements attributed to Mr. Turull. 
(Ragman) Allusions were made 
which had been of Councilor Turull. 
Of course, they weren't just Forn's, that's for sure. 
I have in my memory that they were referring to Councilor Turull. 
If I'm wrong, I apologize. 
# 
It amazes me that one of the most influential thinkers in the world can be fixed 
in what is happening in a small place called Catalonia, 
in relation to a state such as Spain. 
Tell me what repression is. 
For example, the police crackdown that took place on October 1, 
you were not surprised, then. 
Why do you think a state should act this way 
in the face of a referendum, even if it has been unilateral? 
Do you think it makes sense in the 21st century 
raise a process of independence? 
You who know the world, 
because he has looked at it, he has observed it, he has analyzed it a lot, 
Do you think that if this new state were economically viable 
what would Catalonia be, if it had already become independent? 
But the feeling is that this solidarity that you explain, 
this organization, 
in the end it doesn't end up changing things, does it? 
He always gains power. 
(man: intercom) "Revenue booth, open cell 5 and 29." 
"Revenue booth, you can now close M29." 
(intercom: woman) "... in modules, returns the input of the first turn." 
Have you been told what a cell is like, your parents? 
(Laura) Very narrow, long, 
with a rather small window, I think little light enters. 
A bunk bed, toilet, shower ... and a desk. 
(Beta) And there's no curtain. 
(Laura) Or they do it with garbage bags. 
(Beta) Things as simple as this, in prison not ... 
you don't have them, and that's it ... 
(Laura) It's kind of like a survival. 
A prison is a city, and each module is a neighborhood. 
And you have to live with it. 
Have you been surprised by your parents all this time? 
That is, did you change the image you had of them? 
Personally, yes. 
I would never have imagined two years ago that my father would write me letters. 
Or things we've talked about or told me. 
I have talked about him on my personal issues 
that I never imagined I would talk to him about it, 
and less through a letter. 
So, I think that despite the distance, 
i think this has brought us together a little more, 
and having such short communication. 
But deep down, I now notice that I have him much closer to me. 
So I think this is a change from these ..., 
well, positive things that all this brings. 
Did you reproach your father with anything? 
of what you have done in recent years? 
Me, now, being him in jail, no. 
But I admit that when it came out, yes. 
Because I did get very angry with him 
when all that of the investiture debate happened. 
I had a fatal day the day before, but fatal, 
because I saw that, all of a sudden, one day, 
my father was either president of Catalonia or he was going to prison. 
And I knew that if I went to jail, I wouldn't be out in a month. 
I felt it. And look, it's been a year. 
Sure, I told him everything. 
And I admit that I happened that day, but ... 
I want it to be understood. 
When I told him everything I told him, I told him to protect him, 
to say "enough, it's over." 
You asked him to ... Stop. 
Let him leave politics now. 
"I'm sick of the country always going ahead of me and my family." 
I said, "Enough, stop. 
Let it run, let another be put into it; you've done enough ". 
Because I saw that everything was rushing. 
And that day I had a really bad time. 
I had ... I think I was scared that day. 
I didn't know what fear really was, and that day, yes. 
Because he said, "It's just that you're leaving tomorrow, and it looks like you're earning it." 
But well ... It's just that the situation, in the end ... 
We spoke with Xavier Domenech, 
because we are preparing other programs of the "Four Cats", 
and we have spoken specifically of this moment in the investiture debate. 
What is the hardest moment you have experienced in Parliament? 
(sighs) 
As hard in brutal "plan", 
and then I could go see him in prison, 
it was ... it was the day before the arrest 
by Carme Forcadell, Jordi Turull, Josep Rull, 
and of all who ended up in prison. 
Because the day before there was the investiture debate 
where Jordi Turull appeared in Parliament. 
That was very very beastly. 
That is, to have a debate with a candidate for the investiture ... 
that ... that you see his face, 
and that you also know or think you may end up in jail the next day, 
it's one of the most beastly things I've ever experienced in parliamentary life. 
I've experienced others, too. 
In Madrid I have lived a lot of beasts, too. 
But I would say the most shocking ... was that moment. 
I don't know if at that time we all knew how to live up to it. 
And when I say "all" I mean "all," eh, 
of the most diverse political spaces, 
we did not know how to live up to that moment. 
That is, you did not rethink your vote much later. 
Yes, I ... I ..., to be honest, 
I, in that debate, remember that I answered Turull ... 
and there was a time when the tone made me a little sour, 
and it was actually because he was angry. 
He was not angry with Turull, 
he was angry with the situation that had brought us to that. 
And he believed that someone, it can be openly said, 
I don't think it should have been ... 
He decided so and is very respectable, 
but it shouldn't have led ... that situation to be lived 
from its political space. 
I think, for me, that was very strong. Is the... 
If at that time it might have been worth it ... 
I think we did what we thought we should do. 
The next day we were reporting what had happened. 
But in any case, it's a good question to ask. 
And the answer? 
We voted for what we voted for and I think that's what we had to do. 
But I still think it's a good question to ask. 
I mean, you still wonder. 
I may ask, yes. 
Do you have the feeling or do you have the feeling 
that your parents have gone from being the converging prototype 
to be people of more consensus for other parties, 
like that of Domenech at the time? 
Our parents are still the typical convergents, 
if you mean it that way, they haven't changed anything at all. 
They are just now people who made a commitment 
and they promised people that they would hold a referendum and they did, 
and now they are in prison. 
Meanwhile, others who go from more revolutionary, look where they are. 
Then I don't think they have changed anything politically. 
Are you surprised, therefore, by what Xavier Domenech was saying now? 
Yes, but I have to tell you that I think everyone is healthy ..., 
that is, everyone knows that day was a mistake. 
It bothers me in a way 
that it costs so much to acknowledge the mistakes that have been made. 
Exactly, yes. 
And let it be so prudent to say "Well we did it wrong." 
Of course. In front of them was an uncle who was going to jail the next day. 
-And everyone knew it. Everyone knew that. -I everyone ... 
I was hoping not, but ... 
Did you meet people you didn't expect? 
who have been very empathetic with you, 
that they have understood the situation, that they have given you a lot of support? 
Xavier Domenech. 
I the next day I went to jail, 
that that full investiture was made, 
the most sincere and humane hug I had that day 
it was his, but by far. 
That is, there are things you feel when they hug you, and the looks. 
And his gaze was of deep sadness and anger, 
just like mine. 
And I remember when we hugged, we both started crying. 
I will always remember it. 
That's why I told you that there is no personal reproach to him. 
I would love to see him again, but I will always remember the hug. 
This one was much more sincere 
than that of any other Member of Parliament. 
I want to be a little more critical and I think ... 
Yes, I have received, I mean, all this time, 
I have received a lot of support from a lot of people. 
But there comes a point that ..., I really appreciate the emotional support, 
but there comes a point where I may not need so much emotional support, 
nor the visibility of a yellow ribbon, 
but acts.

Tell me how many judgments you have followed throughout your life. 
There are many countries in Latin America 
who are in court proceedings of their political leaders, 
especially from the left, who were ruling for years. 
Do you think this could happen in a country like the United States? 
that there was a trial clearly for a political cause? 
(man) Tap? Yes. 
Miquel Seguro, 1. 
And how do you see it? What? 
The trial. 
An unwanted situation for many. 
In a situation like this you can be critical, 
you can empathize with a victim, 
one can disagree with this victim 
and, above all, what I think should be done ... 
it is a global reflection, individual but also global, 
of why we have not been able 
to resolve the situation in another way. 
Are there people who are not interested in critical thinking? 
I think none of us are interested in the background. 
Because it puts us in a position 
of discomfort with ourselves. 
In other words, Ortega y Gasset said that with convictions one lives there, 
but ideas are held. 
Talking about convictions is completely impossible, I think, 
because everyone has their own 
and therefore we can easily feel ... 
mm ... attacks or not understood, or insulted. 
But we can talk about ideas. 
And critical thinking has to do, first of all, 
with the ability to be honest with the use of these ideas. 
Critical thinking can lead us to question the law, to disobey it, 
for example, because we consider it unfair. 
The law is one of the possible answers 
in the face of complex situations 
and in the face of plural societies like ours. 
But probably what we should not do is sanctify this law 
as the only way to interpret this situation. 
This is not to say that the law is bad in itself, 
or that the legal system should not be respected. 
But could we say that the referendum, for example, 
was it the fruit of critical thinking? 
One of the possible readings is this, but not only ... 
There are other readings. 
And so, if the referendum was the result of critical thinking, 
the referendum itself should be able to take on criticism 
which from the outside can be done to him. 
# ("If I Had a Heart", Fever Ray) 
# 
(Melero) Once you've explained all this, 
the question would be whether after the exhibition 
which they carried out to members of the Government 
they obtained in return some recrimination, reproach or directive 
to guide their activity. 
(Ragman) "Do the work you have to do," 
that was the President's response. 
# 
Do you trust, at your age, at the age of 90, 
that states can change, 
that is, that this power can become more citizen? 
Can it be a tool for change? 
Why is democracy scary? 
I know he doesn't like personal questions, 
but I would like to end by asking him what he aspires to in life. 
I asked him for a personal aspiration 
and he told me about the challenges facing the new generation. 
Have you thought these days what would have happened if they had left? 
Bfff ... 
No ... I'd rather not think about it. 
I mean, they didn't leave and that's it. 
No ... I don't want to think about it. No, no. 
The reality is this, and it is. No... 
I think if I learned anything during that time, 
is that looking back doesn't do me any good. 
-Then, I look forward and that's it. -Yes. 
And what he didn't do or what he did, is done, therefore ... 
But those days must have been a difficult decision to make, right? 
It's just that it wasn't a few days, it was a matter of minutes and hours; 
I think not for hours. 
Then, there was the option for them to leave, but ... 
My case was, "No, I'm staying." 
-My father came to leave. -Yes. 
So, well, we've been taking things as they've been coming. 
My father knew that our support would always have him, so ... 
Whether he was out or ... 
We supported his decision to return. 
I imagine you must now think hard about the end, 
that this trial is over, that's why you explained ... 
of the sacrifice your parents make on a day-to-day basis. 
But do you think about the sentence? Are you afraid it will be hard? 
No, not at all. 
Fear must have whoever wants to rule this country in the coming months. 
Because you cannot rule a country by criminalizing its people. 
Our situation will not change no matter how damning it is. 
We've been going to jail every weekend for a year and a half. 
So let's go with the attitude of winning. 
And if we don't win here, we will win out. 
To me what worries me is not how long they are in jail 
because, as I said, we will face whatever comes, 
but the solution is not this. 
Not because they are more or less years in prison 
the political problem will be solved, 
because, as I said, it's a political problem, so no ... 
And do you think about the day they come out? What will I do with them? 
A lot. It is inevitable not to think about it. 
A party. We've talked a thousand times about where we're going to party. 
-We'll have a party together ... -We're looking for a house, we always say that. 
We look at houses and ... 
"we'll do it there, we'll do it there, yes, yes." 
In fact, one day, with Junqueras' wife, I remember, in the Supreme Court, 
Speaking of which ... well, that week my sister was 18, 
and I remember he came and said to me: 
"Laura, if necessary, we will spend a month drinking cava every day, 
but we will celebrate it all "; and I thought" Of course I do ". 
So ... No, no, ufff ... I want them to come out ... 
I don't think everything is so easy and so happy when they leave ... 
No. But to dream it, we dream it. 
They will not let us celebrate it so easily. 
If they don't come out at once, for sure. But think about it, yes. 
-Of course. -Yes, yes, yes. 
It's just that they've been closed for a long time. 
Then it's like ... it's like, well, the joke could end, right? 
But, well, in the end you accept it. Humans get used to everything. 
But we will keep fighting until they come out. 
And let them all return home. It's done.
