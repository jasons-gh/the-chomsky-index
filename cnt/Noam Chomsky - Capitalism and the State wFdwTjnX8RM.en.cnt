it's not a capitalist model it should be
called a state capitalist model I seen
your reading what do you mean exactly by
the advanced economy relies very heavily
on the state sector and in fact if you
look through economic history the
developed countries currently rich
countries first England then u.s. than
the rest always had a very powerful
state that intervened dramatically in
the market to the benefit of the
merchants manufacturers industrialists
and so on so for example during its huge
growth period in the nineteenth century
the US had far and away the highest
tariffs in the world and it in fact
remained that way until the mid 20th
century when the US had was so much in
advance of every other country that it
was willing to tolerate a market
exchanges in which it would win but that
stops too so when the u.s. started
manufacturing started flowing behind
Japan Ronald Reagan practically doubled
protectionist barriers and that's only
the little piece of it now that's a
piece that economists often studied but
if you look at the modern economy is
based very extensively on state
organized and directed R&D subsidy
procurement bailout the information
technology revolution as an example
computers in the internet biotechnology
always has a substantial state component
a huge in fact and the fact that we
overlook these state capitalism
dimension it's what you call presenting
one of the mythologies and it's kind of
interesting to see it now there's a lot
of wailing about how the government is
intervening and the financial I mean
what do we gain in creating such a
mythology why do we want to overlook the
importance the centrality of the state
especially there's good propaganda
reason
I mean the doctor'll system is mostly
business run Public Relation system and
so on and they want people to oppose
state intervention for the benefit of
the public so they would like to have
benefits cut for example and they don't
want the state to interfere with
managerial prerogatives compensation for
example right now but they're very happy
to let the government the public
basically be a cash cow they just want
that part concealed so the picture that
comes out is that we have a system of
entrepreneurial initiative of the
consumer choice and so on
I remember about 10 years ago read a
speech by Alan Greenspan to the
newspaper publishers strolling the
magnificence of their free enterprise
system he did something that must be
able to talk about this he gave examples
every example that he gave was a
textbook example of research and
development and procurement inside the
state sector which often for a long
period and computers in the internet
were pretty much in the state sector for
decades before he can make profit out of
them but it's kind of you know escapes
people's minds and others are not them
sometimes it's almost comical like if
you look at the World Trade Organization
there are constant legal battles going
on between Europe and the United States
over civilian aircraft production
there's actually two majors of Indian
aircraft producers in the world Airbus
and Boeing and they're debating
technical debates about which one is
getting a bigger government subsidy I
mean Airbus gets it directly the United
States gets it through the Air Force and
aerospace and so on but they're kind of
story you're telling us that in fact the
the centrality of the state has been
conceded but in all concealed in a way
self conceded I mean if you brought it
forth it would undercut the argument
that we have to cut benefits but
precisely in the current situation in a
way the
the whole of the state is really in in
plain sight so because you know well
right now it's what it's different
because now it happens to be in the
financial institution in the last 30
years or so the financial institutions
have a lot of pretty much of a market
system and the results were predictable
and in fact predicted repeated deeper
crises huge bailouts and so on that's
the way market systems work but even in
the financial sector which is to some
extent approximating a market the
government's intervened crucially I mean
I'm take the too-big-to-fail policy
that's a government insurance policy you
know it and it gives perverse incentives
it encourages Citigroup and others to
take huge risks because if they get into
trouble the population or veil amount
what could have been your choice
regarding the the bailout of the banks
do you think that we should have left
this bank to go down the drain or do you
think that we should have as it has been
the case held vermin and other
possibilities abilities forget what I
would like look you see the workforce in
the community take them over but in the
existing system a possibility would be
for the government just to buy them so
to buy Citigroup would cost a fraction
of what it costs to bail it out yes and
and then you know if they didn't want to
run it themselves after they can fix it
up they could give it away to somebody
but that would interfere with the with
managerial prerogative in fact if you
look right now Wall Street is exultant
because the the whole system is being
reconstituted with almost no
modifications and you know they I mean
couple days ago they allowed dozen or so
banks to return the tarp money that's
supposed to get them to start Lyn to
give money back to the public yeah if
you look at the footnotes it also cuts
back their lending yeah and that was the
point of the tarp stimulus and you know
they quote Wall Street how do you
explain that we that we led these Bank
these banks becoming too big to fail
becoming a system
risk and and what does it tell us about
the relationship between the financial
sector and the political sector in a way
in order for for an institution to
become a systemic risk you know the
felice to be legitimate this institution
would have to deliver a systemic service
so well where is the systemic service
who made the decision decision was made
by a political system which is
extensively dominated by the financial
sector actually Adam Adam Smith had the
right comment about this we're supposed
to worship him but not read him but he
had interesting things to say in if you
look at wealth of nations he he
discussing England of course he says in
England the principal architects of
policy who are merchants and
manufacturers makes sure that their own
interests are very peculiarly attended
to taken care of however Grievous the
impact on others and that's perfectly
natural will you expect them to do well
ok today the principal architects aren't
merchants manufacturers they're
financial institutions who gave most of
the funding for the last election and so
on so yeah they've made the decisions I
mean this began there's a shift in the
seventies the first period after the
Second World War was so-called Bretton
Woods systems designed by K John Maynard
Keynes and Harry Dexter white US and
Britain and it was based among other
things on a regulation of capital so
state governments could stop capital
export if they wanted that currencies
were more or less regulated and Keynes
and white but anticipated that this
would lead to rapid growth and it did
rapid and quite egalitarian growth they
also recognized that this would leave an
opening to government's to carry out
social Democratic programs I mean once
you financialized the economy
has happened in the seventies and huge
speculative flows and tax on currencies
and so on it creates what economists
call a dual constituency for governments
they've got the voters they've got the
financial sector international financial
sector and the way they vote is if they
don't like a government policy they vote
against it by destroying the economy by
capital flight by tanks on currencies
and so on and in a competition the sense
of outrage is not greater than what it
is I mean why is it that we have more or
less accepted environment it's okay for
recent for these entities to really
socialize low season and privatize gains
why is it always been happening I'm the
high tech economy like computers
internet and so on biotechnology it's
based on the principle extensively you
know a hundred percent but that the
public pays the costs and takes the
risks and eventually which can be after
decades profit is privatized I mean
computers for example where they were
being developed in the lab where I work
back in the 50s they're completely
unmarketable huge monsters when they
finally got the most under Pentagon
contracts you know IBM was in there
learning how to shift from punch cards
to electronic computers and so on I
finally in the sixties IBM was able to
actually manufacture a computer Stu
expensive they couldn't sell it anyway
so it was the government the National
Security Agency took it it wasn't really
until about 1980 that they started
making a profit out of these things the
internet was in the public sector for 30
years and runs through the rest of the
economy so what's being done with the
financial institutions public pays the
costs and profits privatized yes that's
the way the system works so it's nothing
new anyway so but where is the issue
accountability the issue of
responsibility in all these pathologies
which are being generated first of all
who's supposed to be accountable I mean
the people who make Adam Smith's
observation is correct the principal
architects of policy are they would only
be accountable to an organized active
public but in our modern democratic
system the public has been essentially
atomized and marginalized
