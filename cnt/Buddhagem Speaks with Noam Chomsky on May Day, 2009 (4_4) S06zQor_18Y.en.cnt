the big labor unions you believe that
they're that naive that they really
think of that or do you think they
understand basically that they're
playing on the mediator part of the
elite yeah I mean it's hard to know what
distinguish between what you know like
you takes a Nazi leaders they probably
believed in what they were doing
Stalinist leaders know that's very easy
to convince yourself that what you're
doing is the right thing especially when
what you're doing benefits you so if
you're a labor leader you get invited
into the corridors of power you know you
part of the you know the rich gotten is
that's the life you lead so you just
incorporate the values and then you
justify to yourself what you're doing
which is never hard but the effects are
very clear of course this is quite apart
from the role of the afl-cio and
supporting ish asst brutality aggression
violence or all over the world they were
right in the forefront of trying to
destroy working-class organizations
everywhere in the world trying to
undermine democracy and so on that's
part of their service to the people who
run the place and so at this point in
time with with this sardine made a
revolving around the Haymarket martyrs
and the Chicago idea that later gave
rise to the Industrial Workers of the
world we see we're seeing a resurgence
in the industrial workers of the world
do you find that comforting or do you
think that's against and so at this
point in time
with this starting made a revolving
around a market martyrs and the Chicago
idea that later gave rise to the
Industrial Workers of the world we see
we're seeing a resurgence in the
Industrial Workers of the world you find
that comforting there do you think
that's a good sign that's a good time I
guess I'm one of the few people who's
the son of a member and a member
probably aren't many of them from but
here in November okay well actually my
father joined in 1916 I guess yeah he
once explained to me why he was an
immigrant right off the ship didn't know
any English he was working in a
sweatshop and I said some guy came
around and trying to organize the
workers he he didn't understand much of
what he was saying but he seemed to be
on the side of the workers so he decided
to join us yeah Wow but that's a yeah if
it did revive it would be a good thing
and there are signs of it so for example
there was a sit-down strike in Chicago
and sit-down strikes terrified ownership
I said because there doesn't take long
to go from a sit-down strike to take
note of the factory and they partially
one that strike most strikes smart one
but this one was it was a small factory
in and around Chicago somewhere but if
some were militants see like that
develops in order to let me take say the
what's happening with the in the auto
industry well you know on paper the
unions have a substantial share in
ownership now in governance know as the
structure of things now works that's not
going to mean anything that means it
going to pay the cost but it could mean
something it could mean that working
people could actually take over the
industry and turn it to socially
constructive uses
so maybe not car maybe subways maybe but
maybe mass transportation is something
that would not only be very useful for
the society but for the world and it's
worth remembering that markets which
were supposed to love have many built-in
inefficiencies one of them were now seen
no but there are others like markets do
not give you choices they give you very
limited choices so if I want to go home
tonight the market allows me to choose
between a Ford and Toyota but it does
not allow me to choose a subway system
which I'd like much better be much more
convenient better for the environment
everything else that's something has to
come out of a democratic society and the
market doesn't allow them but if working
people did take a role in running the
industry I think they could think in
those terms conceivably and they
technically have the authority to
convert the industries including the
military industries to something
socially constructed of course if they
tried to do that not only private
capital but also state power would come
down like a ton of bricks but if there
were popular support for democracy and
improving the environment so on they
could conceivably defend themselves so
those are options that could exist if
the if you can overcome the grip of
ideological control and just
concentrated power which is not
impossible thank you so much so I see I
 you answer swath width on mee mee
