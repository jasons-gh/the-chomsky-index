that when I graduate I'm going to be a
history teacher history teachers what do
you suggest in high school or what do
you suggest I do in that context to
geometry well you know that's really
important you know a lot of people I
suspect many of you if you think of your
own experience I know me you can
remember cases where a teacher really
made a terrific impression on you I mean
most schooling is just train training
first do pity and conformity but every
once in a while and that's institutional
to there are reasons for that but
occasionally you know you get a spark
somebody will challenge your mind you
know make you think encourage you to
think and so on that's tremendous effect
you know you just reach all sorts of
people of course if you do it you're
going to be you may very well have
problems you have to tread a narrow line
there are plenty of people who don't
want students to think they don't
they're afraid of the crisis of
democracy you know people start thinking
and you get all these problems I was
quoting at the beginning you know they
won't have humility enough to submit to
a civil rule you know all right I'll
start trying to press their demands in
the political arena or they'll you know
have ideas of their own instead of
believing what they're told and
privilege and power typically doesn't
want that so they can react and the high
school teacher who tries to get students
to think may find the repression firing
and so on said a lot about the role of
the media in a so-called direct
democracy I'm wondering how you see the
role of our educational system what it's
doing right now what forces are driving
it and what constraints are on it and
how should it operate well I quoted the
trilateral commission view of the
educational system namely it's a system
of indoctrination of the young and I
think that's correct it's a system of
indoctrination of the young that was the
way the liberal elites regarded and
they're more or less accurate so the
educational system is supposed to train
people to be obedient conformist not
think too much which told stay passive
don't cause any crisis a democracy don't
raise any questions and so on that's
basically what the what the system is
about
even the fact that the system has a lot
of stupidity in it I think has a
function you know it means that people
are filtered out for obedience if you
can guarantee lots of stupidity in the
educational system you know like stupid
assignments and things like that you
know that the only people who make it
through our people like me and like most
of you I guess who are willing to do it
no matter how stupid it is because will
we want to go to the next step you know
so you may know that this assignment is
idiotic and the guy up there couldn't
think his way out of a paper bag but
you'll do it anyway because that's the
way you get to the next class and you
want to make it and so on and so forth
well there are people who don't do that
you know there are people who say I'm
not going to do it is too ridiculous you
know those people are called behavioral
problems or something like that they end
up in the principal's office or in the
streets or selling drugs or whatever and
all of this is a technique for selection
for obedience and I have I don't how to
prove this but I have a feeling that
when you go to the elite universities
you find more obedience and conformity
probably because you're getting the
students who were better able to do it
well all of that is functional that's
the way it works but it and it works
right through graduate school I mean if
you dare except how do you get the
graduate school it's already a little
more varied because some real
contradictions develop in the system the
problem is that you can't have progress
this way no now especially in the
sciences and engineering that's a
problem because the corporation's need
science and engineering you know if you
don't have innovation you're really in
trouble so they have to encourage
creativity and independence because you
can't get anywhere if you just copy what
somebody told you you have to be
challenging things all the time
challenging everything you know thinking
new thoughts and so on and there you got
a real contradiction it's hard to train
people to be creative and challenging
and so on and yet to ensure that
somewhere else in their lives they're
conformist and obedient and everything
so you have problems that's a serious
problem in Japan dentally we think of
Japan is
tremendous superpower but that's very
misleading Japan for example it's very
poor in science for example and they're
aware of it and part of the reason is it
such as part of it it's part of the same
thing that makes them good workers
obedient workers it's a very obedient
society very deferential and conformist
society and one effect of that is that
you you know there are real constraints
against independent fries and thinking
and you see it in the sciences very
clearly the but it's a problem here too
so there are those contradictions when
you get to graduate school they're
beginning to show up they show up much
less in the ideological subjects because
they're it doesn't matter so much if
people have you know there isn't the
profits aren't made by historians having
original ideas about the French
Revolution so they can have conventional
ideas and that means that the the
pressure to try to support innovation
and freedom is much less and the
profession the pressures for conformity
on the other hand are much greater
because in the ideological subjects it
begins to be dangerous if people think
the wrong thoughts it's not so dangerous
if they have new ideas about physics so
so you but nevertheless you know you
begin to get a little flux in the system
by the time you get to graduate school
and even at lower levels you find it I
mean there's you know there are teachers
who do stimulate thought and sometimes
they get away with it and all the way
through you know if people are learning
things you just you just can't control
you can't make them just regurgitate
what they heard now there's a lot of
pressure to turn the schools into the
Marine Corps and there's a lot of
support for it for example there's this
bestseller last couple of years by Allen
bloom that was all over the
supermarket's closing the American mind
yeah which ever you know huge bestseller
supermarket racks which is where I read
it and things like that well you take a
look at what he's saying and it was
plenty you know a lot of enthusiastic
accolades for it and so on he was saying
that a couple of smart guys will decide
what the great thoughts are and every
student will memorize them and that's
education okay well you know I mean
that's a way to turn people
the pure automata I mean even if they
happen to pick the great thoughts there
is no way less likely to get anybody to
think about those thoughts than to make
that the curriculum that finishes them
off no but and I think that's the
purpose really i mean the purpose is
just to impose authority you know here's
the great thoughts all this other stuff
is rubbish just learn those you're okay
I'll pick them you memorize them that's
basically the line now of course that's
that's the opposite of Education that's
the way you study Talmud or something
like that but it's very popular and I
think it reflects the same concern over
the crisis of democracy faq Ellen was it
bloom himself was extremely the incident
that really got to him was a case in
Cornell where he was a professor where
some black students took over one of the
administer one of the buildings and he
was he said that's just like the knots
you know fact of the Nazis his old
business about the Nazis and so on and
so forth well you take a look at what
happened and that key isn't tell you
what he thought the and he says the
faculty capitulated you know just like
Heidegger capitulated to the Nazis and
so on what actually happened if he look
back is that there were real grievances
undoubtedly the students shouldn't have
done what they did go into the building
with guns and so on but it was settled
very amicably it was settled amicably
nobody was killed the grievances were to
some extent dealt with and the net
result was better than it was before
well he didn't tell you what he thought
they should have done but it's sort of
implicit I mean I guess they should have
bombed the place or something like that
but that's what really set him off and
in general what set many people off was
the you know the the 60s are now
described in the literature as if it was
a time when students were running around
burning libraries and you know
destroying the foundations of
civilization and so on what was actually
going on as they were asking questions
you know they were raising questions
they were looking into things that
people hadn't looked into before they
were not just obedient and from the
point of view of a lot of the faculty
that's equivalent to burning the
buildings they can't even that small
distinction you can't make
and this pressure to turn the school's
back to the days when you didn't have to
worry about those things like
disobedient students asking questions
about things he didn't tell them to
think about and so on
