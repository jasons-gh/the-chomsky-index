so now I want to turn to US politics you
you have expressed sentiments of support
for for Bernie Sanders what what are
some ways that perhaps his outlook might
fall short I know you've called it could
describe him as the New Deal Democrats
how are some way what are some ways that
he can change to to fit more to express
more the needs of the American people
well I think it's first of all kind of
academic the chances that Sanders will
win the nomination I think are not great
the main reason is these is tremendous
attack on them just take a look at how
he's treated in the media there's
actually it's pretty obvious just from
reading but there's a good study about
it by in these times and published a
detailed study a factual study of how
the media has been handling Sanders so I
think all stops will be old to make sure
that he doesn't get the nomination if he
gets the nomination the attacks will be
wild will get the whole Republican
propaganda machine going after this
Jewish atheist you know wants to kill
all the white you know chances he could
be elected or pretty small but if he
does get elected miracle he won't have
Congress how you gonna win Congress the
Congress is the u.s. electoral system is
structurally constructed so that the
reactionary elements have an
overwhelming advantage like in the last
election I think the Democrats won
Congress Senate by about twelve million
votes they lost the Senate that happens
all the time
these is a structural effect of that
maximizes the effect of the rural white
conservative you know where's our
America and traditional the Democratic
votes tend to be concentrated in the
cities which most of them are laws you
know plus the gerrymandering on the
voter suppression everything else so yes
it has to be an enormous Democratic
victory for them to win Congress which
is unlikely furthermore even if you win
Congress most of the people elected from
the other month the Democrats are
basically what they call Blue Dog
Democrats moderate Republicans they're
not gonna support Sanders as plans on
top of all of that there's a very the
fact is that US politics are dominated
by wealth and we see that all the time
the wealthy basically controlled
legislation so the barriers against
carrying out progressive legislation are
quite high so could happen but it would
require an enormous popular mobilization
the kind that took place in the 1930s
that enabled the New Deal measures to be
carried
