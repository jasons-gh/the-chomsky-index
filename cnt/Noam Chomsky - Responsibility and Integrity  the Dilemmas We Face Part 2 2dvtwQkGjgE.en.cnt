uh the wrong kind of story must be
marginalized and kept from the eyes of
the public and meanwhile we focus on the
terrible crimes of others like Charles
Taylor and in Sierra Leone it's pretty
obvious why they wanted to cut Qaddafi
out he was a friend and Ally so you
don't want to implicate him well now the
story has changed so you know we talk
about what we can do about this monster
that's again perfectly normal to take
just one last case in the 1970s the
Saddam Hussein was an enemy that changed
in the early 80s in fact in 1982 the
Reagan administration decided that they
wanted to provide arms to Iran to Iraq
that to assist in their invasion of the
grand well as a little impediment
there's a an institution called the
terrorist list of terrorist States and
Iraq was on the list of terror States so
the government had to remove Saddam from
the list of terror states and since
there was a gap that put somebody in so
they would Cuban in honor of the fact
that Juba had been the victim of really
massive terrorism and the preceding
several years shooting down an airliner
killing 75 people blowing up embassies
all sorts of crimes so they were put in
on the terrorist list to replace Saddam
who came out the next year nineteen
eighty-three had Donald Rumsfeld going
to Baghdad shaking hands with his friend
Saddam during into arms and other deals
this continued right through the 1980s
us support for Iraq was so strong that
Iraq was given a kind of a gift that no
other country has except Israel they
were permitted to
attack a u.s. ship and kill a couple of
dozen sailors and get away with it with
it nothing but a weak apology nobody can
do that except for Israel which did it
in 1967 but that shows real love the
u.s. essentially entered the war the
u.s. also denied Saddam's atrocities
that's Halabja massacre the longfellow
massacres occurred everything denied in
fact the administration even intervened
in Congress to prevent them from issuing
a declaration of sanchar for these huge
atrocities the worst ones of Saddam's
rule and finally the u.s. entered the
war directly and central Iran
capitulated they couldn't face us
participation in the war love for Saddam
continued after the war in early in
1989's that's year after the war ended
the this the president was now President
Bush first president Bush he invited
Iraqi nuclear engineers to the United
States for advanced weapons training in
nuclear weapons manufacturer that's 1989
a couple of months after that President
Bush sent a delegation to Iraq to convey
his greetings to his friend Saddam this
was april nineteen ninety the delegation
was led by Senator Robert dole he was
Senate Majority Leader later Republican
presidential candidate other high-level
senators we have the transcript they
brought Bush President Bush's greetings
to Saddam they assured Sonam that he
could
nor critical some critical comment he
was hearing in the American press that
we have this freedom of press business
so we can't figure out a way to shut him
up but you can ignore them and in fact
the White House assured Saddam that they
would remove from The Voice of America
you know the official international
press service avoid eliminate a reporter
who was being too critical of their
friend this was april of nineteen ninety
a couple of months later Saddam
committed a real crime he disobeyed
orders or maybe misunderstood them it's
not clear and he invaded quate ok he
suddenly became the reincarnation of
hitler said I'm realized when he invaded
quate that he'd made a mistake that he
thought he could it could be authorized
he'd understand these or right away is
in trouble and then the discourse in the
White House is interesting which would
also have in the White House they were
concerned Colin Powell's head of the
Joint Chiefs said the problem is that
Saddam might withdraw and leave a puppet
regime behind and all the Arabs States
would be perfectly happy and we can't
allow that to happen so we have to go to
war and destroy Iraq well if Saddam had
been allowed to do that he would have
duplicated almost exactly what the US
had done a couple of months earlier
namely invaded Panama in order to kidnap
the thud who had also disobeyed orders
brought up the Florida where he was
tried for crimes that he committed while
he was on the CIA payroll installed a
puppet government about the only
difference is the Latin American States
weren't happy about it they threw a rant
Panama out of the collect the coalition
of democratic states and so on the
deaths were also a little different
Gordon Human Rights Watch try the
estimated when I said I'm invaded quaid
there were about 800 people killed
according to Panamanian human rights
groups when the u.s. invaded panama
there about 3,000 killed now we don't
look at casualties that we cause that's
another thing that's off the record so
there's no Western confirmation of these
calculations but they could very well be
right the American forces were bombing
apartment houses were neighborhoods and
so on well that's not exactly the story
the way it reaches us it's only the
story the way it happened all the way
through and that's again quite typical
it's like not mentioning the slightly
embarrassed in fact that the
International Criminal Court absolved
the Qaddafi of the atrocities for which
they just condemned Taylor because he
was a friend and an ally like Saddam
Hussein this story just proliferate so
far that it's almost pointless to give
examples it's hard to think of an
exception it's close to uniform and that
tells you something very significant
about the the role of intellectuals and
their responsibility in the service of
power both in supporting atrocities and
crimes and in reshaping the current
scene and histories so that it looks
good for us you know for the powerful
this may be against the will of the
public as in the case of Vietnam but it
ends up being the picture that's
transmitted to later generations so it's
what you read in school and so on well I
said that the dreyfus are swarthy that's
when the term intellectual became into
common use
there were intellectuals before the
Dreyfus arch they weren't called that
called something else and it goes back
to the origins of recorded history so
you go back to say classical Greece
there was a man who was made to drink
the hemlock the death sentence because
he committed a crime he was corrupting
the youth of Athens by challenging false
gods and that's crime so you riddim he
was a dissident and treated the way
distance are treated roughly the same
time in the from the biblical records we
discover that there were dissidents
again they weren't called that they
weren't called intellectuals they were
called prophets that's a bad translation
of a very obscure Hebrew word nobody
knows what it means but they were called
prophets but if you look back at if you
read the Bible what they what they were
was what we would call visit and
intellectuals they were carrying out geo
political analysis warning that the the
Kings were you know carrying out actions
like alienating the Assyrians and so on
which were going to cause disaster they
were calling for mercy and justice to
widows and orphans they were condemning
the crimes of the evil king and so on
were they treated nicely we'll go back
to the Bible and take a look they were
called haters of Israel that's the
origin of the phrase that a self-hating
Jew would you hear all the time extends
to anti-american you know meaning
critics of your own country and its they
were driven into the desert you know
imprisoned and not treated nicely at all
there were intellectuals who were
treated very well than honor
they were there were also called
prophets the centuries later they were
called false prophets but they were the
flatters the court and they were doing
fine and that's the way it works
flatters at the court are honored and
respected the critics are punished one
way or another how they're punished
depends on the society but always
treated badly in one way or another it
can be at the extreme it can be like the
assassin assassinated Jesuits lesser
punishment could be easy novel and
softer I've and similarly all the way
back this is a very persistent theme of
in history you can think it through see
if you can find exact counter examples
actually there are a few counter
examples and they're very striking so
today in today's world the only really
significant counter examples that I know
of at least are in Turkey in Turkey
leading intellectuals the prominent
writers the most prominent writers
academics journalists publishers and
artists and not on your protesting
constantly the crimes of the Turkish
state to preserve not only protesting
those crimes but constantly
participating in civil disobedience
against them which means facing
sometimes enduring really severe
punishment like long jail sentences I
don't have any other country like this
and i have to say when i come to europe
i always have to smile a little when i
hear that the Turks are not civilized
enough to be allowed into the August
European Union I mean maybe but from
another point of view
a little bit different but that's the
only major exception that I know today
so there are exceptions undoubtedly well
that's one interpretation of the
responsibility of intellectuals what's
the general task that they fulfill the
factual side there's also the value
issue there you have two factual side
yuge you can study the facts and draw
pretty conclusions with fair confidence
when you turn to the values of course
you're asking what your own moral values
are and I think there are a number of
pretty simple ideas that ought to define
what the role of intellectuals oughta be
by intellectuals I just mean people of
relative privilege training resources
opportunity an ability to be in a
position where you can get involved in
some fashion and Affairs that matter to
human beings so it's intellectuals it
excludes for example a great scientist
who just stations laboratory and you
know means his Nobel Prize it excludes
that somebody who is working so hard
putting food on the table that he just
doesn't have time to think about these
things but it includes in our societies
like ours a large group of other people
for example anybody related to a
university anyhow because we have these
privileges and opportunity so that's
roughly the category at one principle
that you think would be obvious is that
we applied to ourselves the same
standards we apply to others or maybe
harsher wants more stringent ones but at
least the same ones so if terror is bad
when they do to us then terror is bad
when we do it to them maybe 10 times as
much and that's again to take a
historical example if anyone were to
follow this principle
that takes a 911 you know great modern
event that changed the world transformed
the world it was a terrible atrocity
undoubtedly could have been a lot worse
very much like how else punishment could
have been worse so suppose on 911 that
al-qaeda had say bomb the White House
killed the president installed a
military dictatorship murdered thousands
of people tortured tens of thousands of
people established an international
terror Center in Washington which
started overthrowing governments in
other countries and installing
comparable dictatorships carrying out
assassinations abroad and so on brought
in a group of economists you know maybe
call him the Kandahar boys who quickly
tanked the economy that drove it into
the worst depression it had been in
maybe in its entire history okay that
would have been worse it happened on 911
it happened on 911 1973 as the overthrow
of the high end a government in Chile
and the installation of you know
dictatorship was a lot worse than
infected Latin America they often call
it the first 911 it was a comparably
worse than what we call 911 by any
dimension you can think of with that one
and it certainly changed the world it
was instrumental in causing the rash of
dictatorships that spread over Latin
American and much else not to say speak
of what it did to the people of Chile
but
that's not in history if we were to
accept the elementary principle that the
usual defect wrong agency us was behind
the if we were to accept the principle
that we apply to our self the same
standards we do to others that's the way
we'd be discussing and teaching and
thinking about the atrocities of 911
needless to say it's not though it is in
parts of South America the victims tend
to have a somewhat more realistic view
of the world than the ones who hold the
clubs the so one principle is at least
apply to yourselves the same standards
you do too i apply to others and it
sounds simple that almost never observed
another is to set priorities you know we
all have finite energy and time can't do
everything so try to focus on the things
that are important now what r importance
of course is another value judgment so
what's important well one criterion for
importance is things that you can
influence so if there's something going
on somewhere where you can have an
influence well that's important to focus
on may be nice to criticize the crimes
of Genghis Khan but you can't do much
about it and the same is true of crimes
carried out by somebody else now you can
see how awful it is but nothing much you
can do on the other hand crimes in which
you're involved yourselves you can do
quite a lot the closer you are to agency
the more you can do so that should be
the focus well I won't run through
examples and leave it as an exercise but
you'll find that exactly the opposite is
done exactly the opposite in fact you
can pretty well determine what the role
of intellectuals ought to be by taking a
look at what is going on and just
turning it to the opposite comes out it
turns out to be a pretty successful
technique of
analysis so that's another thing you can
do other things you can do are to
participate in changing the your own
surroundings as much as the societies
you can reach in such ways that these
values will be accepted whether it's by
teaching by organizing by activism many
other ways I just end by citing an
injunction by which which often is used
to formulate these principles which I
think merits and critical attention it's
a precept used by people who personally
are close friend and who I respect and
honor a lot a Quaker activists at quaker
human rights anti-war activists very
courageous people also involved in civil
disobedience protests very dedicated
picking the right principles their
precept is that they should be telling
truth to power and I think that's that's
the one thing I really disagree with
them on I don't think that the role of
people with some degree of privilege say
like us should be to tell truth to power
one reason is power already knows the
truth you don't have to tell it to them
they understand it very well that's why
they're doing what they're doing another
is that they're not the righted so
they're not the right audience you
should be reaching people who don't know
the truth tell them furthermore you
shouldn't be telling them that you
should it's not that we have some you
know I you whoever it is has some kind
of magic authority we have our own ideas
they have their
is in 1975 for example the large
majority of Americans I think knew the
truth that the war was not a mistake it
was fundamentally wrong a tomorrow you
have to tell them the truth you can
participate with them and failing at
finding out the truth learning it
yourself charging them to think it
through for themselves so you should be
reaching out to other people trying to
learn the truth as best it can together
with them and it should be the audience
that matters not the powerful and it
should be on issues that are
significance so I think is somewhat more
complex version of that precept ought to
be adopted but the basic the intuition
behind it is right and I think it's a
sensible guide and from that we can kind
of work out what the responsibility of
intellectuals ought to be comparing it
with what the function actually is and
drawing appropriate conclusions I'll
stop there
you
how can we be heard so long as we're
nobody yet unknown economically
dependent and supposed to get somewhere
is this working yeah well first of all
nobody is nobody and if you want to have
their very good models as to what young
people can do if achieved a great deal
so let's go back say 50 years and go to
North Carolina and the United States or
Georgia in the United States at that
point young people who were facing far
harsher difficulties than you are young
black big kids decided to sit in on
restaurants to insist on being waited in
restaurants which was illegal for blacks
at the time so a small group of young
kids college students and went and sat
in at a bar and a diner the police came
took him out throw him a jail I'm sure
it wasn't very pleasant the next day
more came back and did it again after a
couple of years it ended up really
revolutionising the country that's what
one of the things that sparked civil
rights movement they were at a lot of
more Spelman College black college they
had virtually no support from the
faculty to faculty members supported
them both were thrown out one was Howard
Zinn you may know my old friend of died
two years ago he was a faculty member he
supported the students he was expelled
the students themselves went on a lot of
them became joined the group that became
the Freedom Riders at that point white
students for some white students from
the North came down to join them and
they rode in buses through the South
trying to register blacks couldn't
register than it they didn't wasn't easy
several of them got murdered others were
beaten thrown into prisons I was down
there for demonstrations and you could
see are you watching while State Police
were beating and people kid young kids
mostly driving them up the they were
fleeing to the steps of the federal
building where the State Police are not
allowed to go and the federal building
was lined with federal marshals sent
from Washington who were throwing them
back into the streets that's the way the
government was protecting well you know
they achieved a great deal martin luther
king who was a extremely important
person would have been the first to tell
you that he was writing the ground swell
that they developed and that's by no
means the only case that picked my own
university at MIT MIT and it was
practically 100% funded by the Pentagon
which contrary to what a lot of people
believe means it was extremely free the
Pentagon didn't care what you did they
wanted to create the economy of the
future that was their job it's a highly
undemocratic they were using public
resources on not they the government
used public resources on the pretext of
defense to develop computers
the internet micro electronics and so on
that's the way the high-tech economy
developed but it was a very passive
place very passive a quiescent people
doing their work not paying much
attention to anything there were about
five student who decided to try to stir
the place up some of them you may no one
was Michael Albert and now runs Z net
mother was Steve Shalom who's a couple
Pete bomber a couple others and they
just kind of began organizing groups
around the campus by 1968 they had so
radicalized the campus that Mike Albert
was elected student president on a
platform so radical you can barely
believe it well he was thrown out we had
to get him back in usual things happen
but the point is that universities never
been the same to this day now it's an
active a lot of participation totally
different relationships among people and
it's a center of activism and the things
like that happen all the time there's a
tremendous amount that young people can
do in fact if you look at the what takes
a Tahrir Square in Cairo that was mostly
organized by fairly young people I guess
in their 20s mostly tech-savvy began
reaching out to others they didn't
really expect much at the beginning but
they within a couple of weeks they had
half of Egypt out there then they
overthrew a dictatorship a long way to
go but the major event again initiated
by young people who were committed and
active and there plenty of other
examples you can be heard or write in
linguistics you have wondered where the
language is an optimal solution do you
think there is an optimal solution and
politics as well or should we sometimes
accept the least bad option
well if there is an optimal solution I'm
not smart enough to figure out what it
is there's just too much we don't know
about human beings and about societies a
lot of will would have to be learned by
experimentation trying things if they
work try other things and so on and in
fact this is a pretty traditional view
on the left so they take karl marx you
read through all of his works you find
practically nothing on post capitalist
society a couple of sentences scattered
around here and there so on a post
capitalist society you know everyone
would fish in the morning and grows
garden in the afternoon a couple of
lines like that and there was a reason
for it he believed in workers democracy
his conception was that there would be a
popular revolution working people would
take control of their own fate than
their own institutions and then they
would work out what the society ought to
be like he didn't have a prescription
and some ideas about general principles
but not a description on the other hand
there are there were people on the Left
still are Mike Albert who I mentioned is
one who think that you can give a very
detailed account of what a future
society ought to be like and they've
worked out you know detailed proposals
but you could try out right now even
within the present society well you know
between these two extremes there are
lots of approaches that people have
taken and you have to decide how much
you think you understand and I don't
think I understand very much so I don't
feel a moron marks aside and I think
these things will have to be worked out
I doubt that there's anything that you
could call an optimal solution that
people are just do different they live
in too many different ways
