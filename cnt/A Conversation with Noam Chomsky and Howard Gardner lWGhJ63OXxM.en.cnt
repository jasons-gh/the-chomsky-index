greetings and welcome everybody thank
you all for coming out
I'm Matt Courtney a recent graduate of
the mind brain and education program
here at Harvard Graduate School of
Education yeah I want to remind everyone
that there is going to be a Q&A towards
the end of the program and it's now my
pleasure to introduce our host for this
afternoon dr. Howard Gardner
thanks Matt am i audible okay
well I'm very pleased to be part of this
mind brain and education sponsored event
and it's great that Noam Chomsky who is
a neighbor of ours was a memorial drive
and a friend of me and my family and one
of the world's great scholars
intellectuals thinkers really part of
the history of our era has agreed to
come over here and to spend a bit more
than an hour he and I are going to talk
for a while and then as Matt says we'll
open up for questions
some of you know I've been here for a
long time fifty-five years living in
Cambridge but I realized I've known you
have been here longer you're a mere
child and
noam chomsky actually had the same
teacher that I did a man named Nelson
Goodman who was the founder of project
zero where I've continued to work for
almost 50 years
and I believe it was it was Nelson who
recommended you for the Society of
fellows which was a very important
intellectual center still is in the
Harvard campus and another tie that we
had though I think before we knew each
other is you spent time of the Center
for cognitive studies with Jerome Bruner
many of you know who who recently died
and I would say that neither I nor Noam
agreed with everything that Nelson said
were agreed with everything that Jerry
said but we learned from their
stimulation in their company and it's
part of what makes living in Cambridge
whether you're in Harvard or MIT or
somewhere else in the vicinity a very
very special experience this afternoon
getting ready for my class next week who
was here from my class great I was
reading the theory of justice by John
Rawls and I did not remember that you
are cited in there you know that oh yeah
yes that Noam Chomsky's ideas in aspects
of a theory of syntax which was
published a few years before a theory of
justice was one of the things that got
Rawls to put forth a certain argument
about intuitions in the moral in the
moral sphere
Nome has also been a friend of the
school his wife Carol taught here for
many years taught children's language
was a colleague of those of us who were
in Larson Hall and he's been good enough
to come here at various times to
converse with students I've seen him in
what used to be Conroy Commons we not
have a Guttman cafe and most recently we
had a conversation there quite
interesting one the year two ago about
the work of Paulo Freire who clearly had
some influence on your thinking about
education so the my rough plan for today
and I think Nome has agreed with this is
that we're going to start with about 15
minutes talking about language and then
segue into some time on cognition and on
the mind and then some time on education
and several if you were good enough to
submit questions and I've looked at them
and some of them will crop up in the
conversation but I decided that it was
better to be have a conversation than
for me to be the question man but when
we finish our conversation we'll open up
the mics and if your question wasn't
touched on you could bring it up and if
it wasn't submitted you can bring it up
too and I asked know whether there were
any topics that were off-limits and we
said no so
the the the floor is open um so when you
came up here to work in the Society of
fellows to be a fellow for three or four
years probably um we were already
working on issues of language oh yeah I
was I was doing the earliest work on
what later was called generative grammar
and a lot of that was based on some
ideas of Nelson's about the
constructional systems partly based of
new work that had come out on was just
becoming known on recursive function
theory and of course some ideas from
mozilla terraces so um i followed that
but i think some of the students will
probably need a little more texture so
if you could put it in a bit more Lele
Lele
well what's now called generative
grammar or which kind of began right at
that time late forties is an effort to
capture something that was not known at
the time
unfortunately it was only discovered
decades later but it was kind of a
challenge for the study of language that
was issued right at the beginning of the
modern scientific revolution by Galileo
by the scientists philosophers at the
Royale monastery another theme they
pointed out that there's a human's have
a to them virtually miraculous ability
to use just a few symbols to convey to
others an infinite number of thoughts as
they put it what passes within their
soul to convey to others who have no
access to their souls and they can
somehow do this like this using small
number of symbols
Galileo regarded this is the greatest
invention in human history comparable to
Michelangelo
with the greatest artists in scientists
and it was a challenge which was not
taken up because nobody see exactly what
it meant but generative grammar not
knowing anything about this beginning to
take it up that really wasn't until mid
20th century but the intellectual tools
were available to try to capture these
ideas see how this could be done
that's basically what now you all know
is the theory of computability of the
work of great mathematicians in the
1930s and 40s hurdle of Alan Turing
others established the theory of
computability on a very firm ground we
could then understand clearly what it
meant for a finite device like your
brain for your laptop to have the
capacity to generate the an infinite
number and amount of number of objects
in this case linguistic expressions the
each of which if properly interpreted
constitutes of potential thought so at
least you can begin to address the
challenge that was issued 500 years ago
and then pretty much forgotten and again
unfortunately all of this was totally
unknown only discovered decades later
but and I was lucky to have been born
just at the right time at the time when
these ideas were becoming available in
the logic and mathematics so if you were
an undergraduate he could learn about
these things which I did and it wasn't
immediately clear how you could trust
without without the to try to capture
the tribe after the principles in our
mind obviously a finite object which
have its capacity to use a small number
of elements to convey to others thoughts
that maybe they never thought over
themselves that can understand if you
look back over history this was still
not as well-known as it should be
incidentally this is one of the things
that Nelson's didn't like at all I
should say but which was what let me
just check are you is a professor
Chomsky not a little bit audible back
there Paul can you hear me if you go
back in 17th century and take a look at
the Descartes discourse on method
and look closely at the argument thank
you for his famous body mind dichotomy
why does he argue that there's a mind
distinct from the body we look over the
argument which is interestingly it's not
really didn't recognized much in
scholarship of history philosophy could
just take a look at it
he believed like every scientist at the
time including Goodman that the world
was a mechanical object it was a machine
like something like that an artisan
could make out of gears and levers and
leads that push each other around and so
on and that he tried to show to carry
out the basically Galilean effort to try
to demonstrate that everything in nature
could be accounted for in mechanical
terms that was the goal of the early
modern scientific revolution and he
thought he had shown that but he
recognized that there were certain
things that didn't fall within
mechanical explanation and crucially it
was the use of language he recognized
that our ordinary use of language is
what could be both creative that we are
constantly producing new expressions
which have never been producing for
which we never heard which others have
never heard
and which are appropriate the situations
but are not caused by the situation like
virtual distinction by the way the
Cartesians put it we are incited and
inclined to speak in particular ways but
not compelled like we could say start
talking about the today's Red Sox game
if there is one or something like that
but it wouldn't be appropriate in the
situations that we're not doing but it's
certainly within a capacity to do it or
what was he talking or were they
thinking about what that let's just say
syntax versus semantics no they weren't
just what you do this was all before any
of these concepts could be sharpened
precisely it's just we have some means
to do this in fact it was considered
well in fact this is where it what are
these names well for big card other
that's out of my era mine was a an
object and entity physical entity which
is based on a different principle than
the mechanical principle of which the
rest of nature's base and it's
fundamental element is a kind of
creative capacity there are precursors
to this interesting one but good thing
in Dakar that becomes critical so that's
the crucial distinction between mine to
the body and notice that this is
perfectly reasonable scientific
hypothesis people there
but it's not very sensible scientific
hypothesis there's something that's not
accounted for by a mechanical conception
of the universe there's no machine could
do this so therefore you have got some
other principle in nature that's a risk
oh dude I'm thinking of thinking entity
the fate of this doctrine is also not so
well understood the standard wine if you
take a philosophy course is that we can
get rid of what Gilbert Ryle fault the
ghost in the machine is the mine you get
rid of that normal mysticism we just
kept the machine and it's even commonly
argued that Newton demonstrated that the
fact of the matter is Newton with Judas
much to his dismay and disbelief he
shows that the world is not a machine
that no mechanical system can has even
the most elementary properties of the
natural world the motion of the heavenly
bodies of the tides of going to the
floor for drop it so nothing is
mechanical there are no machine so the
ghost is impact the machine is born
didn't comes the question what you do
with that and that has been history but
going back to the core question of
language which was kind of dropped for
centuries because there's nothing like
to do with it now you couldn't pick it
up in the mid nineteenth
he's and begin to try to work out what
those principles be and what they would
be very good reason to believe that
they're common to all humans we know a
lot more about that now than we did 70
years ago but it was that an assumption
of yours or is that in a conclusion that
you came to or a bit of both it was an
assumption but by now it's pretty well
established so if you take someone from
a tribe in the Amazon said that has had
no contact with other humans for 20,000
years and it's a child bring it up and
Boston they won't do the same as
everyone here virtually this haven't
been tried in every possible case but it
seems they seem quite apparent and there
are other reasons to believe it and it's
the other reasons that gives me not a
comparative reasons
the other reason which is considered
very controversial but you can be a
truism is there's no other possible
relation of how anybody knows
like we have virtually no evidence for
what we know so therefore it must be
coming from something that's internal to
us and in that case they say that again
because I want to make sure I get it and
I want to make sure other people get it
so take the fact that we own we grow
arms and legs not wings or that we
undergo puberty isn't made everyone
knows that we didn't learn through those
name it was not experience that got the
embryo to develop through the years
precisely in this way and there's a
simple reason
there's no relevant evidence in the
environment there's nothing in the
environment of the embryos and says that
grow arms not wing there's nothing in
the environment of a Penuel hidden says
they better have Huberty these are just
things that happen because that's the
way we are and I can take a look closely
at cognitive development it's very
similar you look really closely you see
that much greater wood for the fuel
no evidence you just don't have the
evidence for the most elementary thing
you know from the meanings of words of
Phil the interpretation of the
expressions over years but I think one
of the things which you might touch on
the sign language because you know
somebody who is a a more empiricist mind
might say well but of course people hear
language all around them and that's why
they speak them that's why they speak it
and that's why they're understood but I
don't know much about sign language but
I believe it became of interest to you
because people spontaneously create
languages even if they don't have some
languages it's only in the West it's
pretty much less generation that we've
gotten understand a great deal about
sign language but I should say that the
first person who picked this up was era
Klinenberg
who was sort of founded the modern
biology of language but he was one of a
small group of students at Harvard back
around the early fifties we were friends
there were two or three of us Erica
Morris Hallie none of you know them
meaning when one acted weathers who
simply thought that the entire
intellectual atmosphere was off the wall
at that time the dogma was radical
behaviorism virtual thought Skinner's we
should you should say word about what
that is because that like a tourism
means that everything is a Hermann by
conditioning and training zone so
Skinner Klein the other leading figures
were preached the doctrine and it was
standard that was behavioral science in
fact the whole concept behavioral
sciences is a very strange one I mean
physics isn't called meter reading
science it's true that the data for
physics comes from reading meters but
you're not the physics is not the study
of data it's the effort to explain the
data and any serious approach to human
beings in their nature the psychology
should be using whatever data you have
something else to try to find out the
try to explain what's going on so
they're in concept of behavioral
sciences it's just set things up
completely in the wrong direction
do you know where the term came from by
the way I don't but it's an interesting
question I probably came out of the
funding that's what I would have guessed
the Ford Foundation yeah because they
set up a Center for behavior but it was
just the spirit at the time at late 40s
early 50s very Zuber areas they were
going to do everything you can imagine
partly for connected to us political
power or so and it's worth remembering
that until the Second World War the
United States was a cultural backward it
was like a small town in Indiana if you
wanted to study physics or mathematics
so you went to Germany want to be a
writer an artist you went to Paris but
nobody would stick around here and in
fact a lot of the country still liked
that the changes have not been changes
since the forties but they left a lot of
the country pretty much on but which is
what you see many of the things we've
seen
but the the forties changed everything
Second World War changed everything the
u.s. came out just a billion the world
where everyone else is destroying them
but that had its cultural counterpart we
can kind of throw out all this old
European stuff start afresh do it the
American Way with technology and science
and computers were on the horizon that
we had techniques of experimental
techniques of conditioning work
information theory was coming along look
at start afresh get rid of that old
stuff new things the right way and out
of that behavioral science came as a
kind of a natural outgrowth of the whole
cultural intellectual cultural
environment but is it get back to what I
was saying about sign language Eric
there were a few of us I think maybe
three or four at the barber we thought
all of this was total nonsense
Lennie Berg was German by birthright
he possessed German silver Mars was
Latvia originally but the building of
German
and that was a help because they could
read the ethological literature which at
that time was pretty much unknown here
Attenberg and Lawrence others which who
were studying there was Comparative
Zoology but they were basically studying
psychology from a different point of
view studying it the ways they way the
real way in which animals functioned
instinctive behaviour locally that was
considered and happen but because the
way we studied animals here was by
giving them rewards punishments and
putting printings how to spend schedules
of reading or some skepticism so if you
take a look at the undergraduate
journals one of the best was the
Columbia
which was super behaviorist with
department but they the kids had a
wonderful cartoon once so they showed
a couple of pigeons if there are maybe
mics in a cage and one of them was
saying to the other you see that guy out
there I have him condition every time I
push a bar isn't he a fellow which turns
out not to be very far but aside from
little bits of skepticism here and there
it was
it was dogma that's still very live
issue the truth anyhow Eric went on to
become this sort of fundamental work his
book highlights obstacle foundations
like whoever stole 1967 the basis for
modern biology of language but one of
the things he discovered back in the
early 50s which was not seem so exotic
that nobody paid attention to it
but he was observing in the Perkins
school for the depth of the neighborhood
the big schools of the desk and he went
there just to observe and at that time
and for a long time afterwards but the
schools were run and training was run by
what was called the oralist tradition
kids were not supposed to learn
something that was wrong they had to
learn lip-reading so they were not
allowed to sign than the teachers were
not allowed sign and parents are not
allowed to gesture this was maybe still
going on but it went on for a long time
and what Eric noticed is that in the
classroom if the teacher earned for the
blackboard the people start going like
this they had obviously invented their
own fine way that it was the kind of
thing you didn't let the teachers see
you know so and he did it when she was
looking the other way but that should
have been picked up later many years
later after much of this was understood
there were a serious studies of this
kind of thing
Lila kleitman briefs I color and one of
her students susan goldin-meadow
actually found this most of it what
about 30 years ago I guess 20 years ago
found a group of several kids through a
four year old three four year old kids
who were cousins who were deaf and whose
parents have been rigidly indoctrinated
and
oralism so the parents wouldn't even
move their hands walk around like that
but when she observed is playing
together she noticed that they were
signing and it turned out when she
looked at it closely but they hadn't
they had invented their own sign way
with no it was not zero and when it was
investigated very quickly of course they
began to be taught American Sign
Language but what they had the stage
that they had reached was about normal
for their develop in the developmental
level and since then other such cases
have been found
they have also cases of groups of people
deaf people isolated from others we've
just invented their own sign light
you're helping me connect dots which I
think will be particularly interested to
the MBE mind-brain education people
because Eric Lenin Berg was part of the
Roger Brown Ursula pallucci group ursula
bellugi is one of the most eminent
scientists who got a doctoral degree
here at the Graduate School of Education
and it's probably the leading researcher
on the death and you know as as Noam has
implicated and our mutual friend Jerry
Fodor wrote it most people thought that
you couldn't learn anything about
language from the brain that was the
that was the claim and it was it was
Lenin Berg more than anybody else who
you know saw language as a neural
challenge um so I want to ask you know
being having my eye on the clock when
you hear the phrase cognitive science
the cognitive psychology what what does
that connote to you and what what kind
of reactions do you have well cognitive
science or cognitive psychology
developed in the 1950s that's kind of a
reaction to the prevailing behavioral
science the kind of intellectual
environment
a George Miller Jerry Bruner a couple of
others started doing experimental work
mature deviated from in fact conflicted
with the doctor and I would say dogmas
of the behavioral science mentality and
I think they must have founded the
Center for cognitive science probably in
the early sixties here at Harvard George
Miller himself had Jenna dedicated
behaviors if you read his book it's
called language and communication around
1950 textbook basically it's very worth
about behavior but he was pretty
open-minded guy and the more so the most
and the he was actually Erica supervisor
and dissertation supervisor kind of
tricky in those days if you were
psychology student at Harvard there were
two stars in the department Skinner and
Steve ethnicity and they hated each
other they each thought that the other
was full when we're doing total nonsense
so if you were a student either had to
be a Steven student or Skinner's the
Stevens was a psycho physicist meaning
he took physics as his model and the
George Miller was quite open-minded so
anybody who didn't want to fall it and
one of the other camps ended up with URI
Eric did but
cognitive science distance again
developed as a kind of a from taking
kind of a critical attitude towards the
behaviors doctrines and then increasing
for doing its own direction and the
developed in all sorts of ways right now
but a lot of it is simple still
associationism behaviors but much of it
isn't but the Miller and Werner will be
set up the kind of institutional basis
for when you went to work at the Center
for cognitive study if you remember what
you were working on was 1964 with the
game aspect the book that I mentioned
that that influenced John Rawls so your
there was a famous of you might say
infamous debate between you and Chafee
you and Piaget even though you didn't
like to call it a debate the IJ's work
is probably more familiar to people here
can you say a bit about what you liked
and what you didn't like in piaces work
the debate incidentally was invented by
Harvard University Press in order to try
to sell the book literally everyone
involved was strongly opposed the table
and the framework but what it was was a
conference of Wyoming near Paris where
PJ and I gave opening talks and then
others both
KJ's work was extremely important in
recognizing that the children went
through stages of conceptual development
and that these were not simply the
results of training but they were
somehow coming from somewhere else it's
when you looked at the somewhere else
that it became pretty mystical I mean
there was no mechanism in JJ for any of
these stages to develop or for the
transition to take place it's going to
became pretty hand waving at that time
but he developed very interesting
experimental techniques the try to show
the kinds of things that children
understood like various levels and much
of this his these he opened the
experimental paradigms which of course
have been developed since that have been
extremely productive as a lot of his
actual speculations about the nature of
the stages no apparently hang up turns
out that when you do experiments much
more carefully but you can show that as
much earlier stages and he assumed that
children have implicit understanding
of the kind that's often on the
exhibited later stages lot of valuable
work like this and some of the done
language some on conceptual development
so that's all really valuable though
it's at the conference that's in this
book it's kind of confrontational
because there's a there were Geneva
psychotic edgy get his colleagues and
associates for women with others in the
work group of biologists every fine
biologist Jack cut across Wi-Fi Cove
Jack my other newsroom a piace
unfortunately it was a kind of a
creationist
he had strange anti evolutionary ideas
and this was kind of derided by the
biologists over there there was a lot of
the thrust of the debate was actually
initiated by Jared coder who argued
relatively vigorously yes he tended to
do those of you know I'm very vigorously
that all of this that the approaches
that the Geneva people were taking
couldn't possibly make an exam but you
had to assume a fundamental of innate
characteristic you can get the most
simple generalizations boy oh rather
along the lines of Nelson Goodman's new
rhythm of induction over Goodman himself
didn't accept this yes I do remember
Jerry Fodor once said that if he could
have written fact fiction in forecast
which was the book where Goodman wrote
about that he would have been a very
happy camper but that would never accept
with the conclusion what Goodman
actually showed that we never I was a
student when I was writing the book
didn't we argue about it at the time but
cited the book on it but if you take a
look at this argument what he showed is
that any inductive step depends
essentially on the notations that you
think
so things brutal breathing example okay
but how do you pick one set of notations
rather than another there he being
radically Andean natives do you assume
this just from experience but there's
definitely no way for that to work well
that was really where you and he but I
mean going back to pi/8 just for one
more minute it's also the case that pIJ
didn't know what to do with language and
that was a big problem
they didn't people didn't but the others
picked up their picked up their ideas
they had a few proposals which about the
state the stages at which certain kinds
of constructions that we developed the
work by Tom liver and others using a
jetty and techniques the in a more
sophisticated way I showed that these
this understanding was at a much earlier
stage and they thought possible but they
related it to certain levels of
conceptual development well I'd like to
talk a bit about your own education and
then your more general thoughts about
education before we open it up you you
have often remarked that you were
fortunate to have an education that you
liked since everybody here is interested
in education and many of us would like
education we like you talked a bit about
the yeah year your pre-collegiate
education religious education was in two
radically different formats the first
one I feel from about age 2 up to 12 was
in a do we I the experimental school run
by Temple University's Department of
Education which happen to be strongly do
at that time and it was it was a
marvelous educational experience that
was challenging
no competition everyone was no ranking
in fact I should say that after this I
went into an academic high school which
is a black hole of my experience but it
was a shift from the two kinds of models
of education that go way back to the
Enlightenment but one model is the model
of Education as that pouring water into
a vessel and then you something you take
a test and so on that's one model of
Education unfortunately the one that's
pretty much being imposed by current
standards the other model is that
educators have to have nice image that
was used by Bill humph on hold humble
the founder of the modern research
university said that education should be
like laying out of thread along which
the student progresses in his or her own
way so there's a structure it's not just
anything goes but what's important is
learning how to learn learning how to
discover how to invent
how the face problems great new problem
solved
that's the alternative model and the
duet models really like that
so this equipment there were there were
tests they were subject of course but
you were encouraged really to challenge
to inquire to think them through for
yourself do sometimes individual
projects reference a lot of joint work
but one interesting thing about it is
that no one had a conception of how
students were ranked I didn't learn
until I got to high school literally I
didn't know I was a good student but the
questions have never come up I mean I
knew I had skipped the year but nobody
paid any attention and I was the
smallest kid in the class nothing else
but and everyone was expected to do what
they could do well as possible and but
for me at least it was a wonderful
experience for others back and forth but
the shift from that to a college
oriented academic high school rigid
curriculum you know get the right answer
in the test forget about what you learn
that was quite a dramatic shift but then
I was I went to college I was
unfortunate yeah but basically I said
all in Pennsylvania
Oh University of Pennsylvania know her
in those days you didn't leave home so
the idea of going to college somewhere
we didn't live in the ride you lived at
home and worked in the school so I went
to the University of Pennsylvania but
luckily for me it was kind of totally
own structure so it it was possible in
those days more than now kind of just
make up your own curriculum I'm just
realizing you were there then when the
GI Bill accept the GI bill was just
beginning so a lot of the students in my
class looked to me about like you know
are the 1625 that's big difference but I
quickly run into action Nelson Goodman
Zillah parents a couple of others
different
just put together a kind of an odd
collection of choices of discipline so I
have no professional training let me let
me ask a question um Ellen laga man who
was a Dean here 10 or 15 years ago
had an interesting after ism she said
what people in education don't realize
is that in the battle between Thorndyke
and Dewey Thorndyke one now Thorndyke
was essentially is you know within
Education occupied the same role the
Skinner would have had in psychology
somebody who was very much interested in
the pouring the stuff down model rather
than the opening up thread model so if I
were a chomskyan I might say and I know
he'll tell me I'm wrong what I want to
say the natural inclination must be for
people to think of education that way
and that's why the Dewey approach and so
difficult to instill and maintain all
over the world how would you how would
you respond to that well I think there
are social and cultural pressures in
that direction so it's quite interesting
for example to look at what happens
right here
in the transition from the 60s to the
70s so I haven't read it I urge everyone
to read quite a couple of important
documents that came out in the early
seventies from opposite ends of the
political spectrum which have a direct
bearing on educational policy from that
point on one of them from the right is
the Powell memorandum the memorandum by
justice Powell wasn't him Supreme Court
justice he's a corporate lawyer this was
a memorandum which was intended to be
confidential but it quickly leaked it
was written to the Chamber of Commerce a
business organization and it's a lament
about the sixties so it's if it's the
style it's kind of interesting except
it's paranoid and wildly exaggerated
that kind of like a three-year-old child
who has a toy taken away and thinks the
world is coming from in it this is the
mentality of the business world
recognizing they don't have a hundred
percent control anymore it's only 98
percent control so everything is a total
disaster so what he describes didn't
really have to read it to get the
sentences how the colleges have been
completely taken over by the Marxist
left
run by Herbert Marcuse
there's the dirty media are completely
Marxist the business world has been
totally marginalized oppressed white on
earth II they have nothing left
everything's been taken over by the
radical left kids kids in the streets
universities everything and then he
gives advice he says look we don't have
to just sit there and let this happen
and we're the ones who fund the
universities we have the money we can
fight back and defend great back those
the important values and civilization
against this crazed watch this feminist
etc Ohm's law and that begins from the
right what we have in fact seen in the
schools colleges and universities since
imposing more discipline more authority
more rigid approaches and so on then go
to the left which is much more
interesting with you to the opposite end
of the spectrum is a publication of
liberal internationalists in the United
States it's basically the Carter
Administration that similar groups
Europe Japan the first publication of
the trilateral commission called the
crisis of democracy and the American
record curve was a professor of
Harvard's and the Huntington well-known
liberal intellectuals their position
well their lip look compared to power
perhaps but that's wrong it's kind of a
Kennedy I said alright centrist at
Central and what you like but but this
these this is basically chartered
liberal in fact the members of the
Commission staff they put the Carter
Administration that's basically the
victim the so what's the crisis of
democracy the crisis of democracy is
exactly what Powell's or kids are
running around in the streets all these
activist movements are starting
discipline as hunting the failure of the
institutions responsible for the
indoctrination of the young that's their
phrasing this is a belittle so we have
to do something about the institution's
responsible for the indoctrination of
the owner they're not doing it properly
so we have to have
or rigidity control and in general more
moderation and de buffers with the
permit crisis of democracy is that
people sometimes call the special
interests are demanding rights and
there's too much pressure on the Strix
of a state that you respond over these
demands so we have that more moderation
in democracy then who are the special
interest well kind of young people old
people or women and minorities of
working people farmers and affect the
population the population instead of
being passive obedient and quiet the way
they're supposed to be are demanding
rights and the pressing of the state to
respond to their needs and so on can't
have this so we have to have more
moderation and democracy and do
something about proper indoctrination of
the oven but that's essentially the
spectrum and out of that comes what we
call neoliberal capitalism innit with
its impact on the university's now
that's not the first time this happened
the same thing happened after the first
world war which set the stage for the
office of the educational assistance
the Walter Lippman for example he was
named yes I have I didn't compute the
Huntington but if you search Schlesinger
I would but there was that was it
doesn't be different a different kind of
splitting I don't think there was that
much split it so picked apart the
pleasure to who is considered he became
for he's known as a pic said at the big
issue at the time was me into their
China war and Huntington and she wasn't
her supposed to have been a different
size were they I mean she was eager was
a strong supporter of the Vietnam War
up until 1966 during the period when he
was involved early sixties he thought it
was great
1966 he began to be critical he wrote a
book called the bitter something brother
which was regarded as a critique of a
war let's take a look at the petit he
said what he said is he was hitting
himself against Joseph Alsop right-wing
I feel kind of a Huntington style
liberal I should say who was a strong
supporter of the war and the
Schlessinger says something like this he
says we all hope that mr. Alsup will be
correct and that US forces will be able
to crush the opposition in Vietnam and
he's honest he says leaving it a land of
Rick we will hope he will pray he said
that he will be correct but he probably
won't be so therefore we should think
about taking a different approach that's
the criticism of the war let me try to
wrap this up because this context here
which probably not many people here know
know was already a very influential
thinker in the Academy and his work in
linguistics was beginning to be known by
people interested in other social
sciences that's where the cognitive
revolution he was one of the
revolutionaries but you know the second
Noam Chomsky emerged in the middle 60s
as a critique written as a critic both
of you got now more and more generally
of American foreign policy and not just
American and I remember going to the
first teachings when I was a student
where you and other people were raising
consciousness so to speak about rather
than analogous to what happened with
Iran and other countries in subsequent
years and Noah is always taking the
position that his science is a different
enterprise than his work in political
and economic criticism and I have no
reason to to quarrel with that but
around the world is probably your
political views which are much more
known by people who are educated but not
particularly in the Academy and
I remember a few years ago hearing a
reading that you do email for five or
six hours a night he's in touch with
many people all over the world often
young often very innocent and naive but
wanting to know things and he tries to
answer that on the question I asked I
think I would agree if you were to say
that there's always a poll within
education and other social political
realms between people who want to loosen
up to give more freedom more exploration
X exploratory and people who want to
maintain the holes of power very very
tightly having reached a certain age
myself I'm rather depressed that the
hello.log Minh see me more right than
wrong and when we talk about education
here we tend to talk about the nation at
risk and then the educational summit of
the late 80s which put together a
bipartisan thing which is right from
George HW Bush and Bill Clinton through
the Obama administration but now I'm
getting political so it's time if it's
okay with you to open it up so there's a
there's a mic on the floor and I think
it's first-come first answer
Sara are you going to be first
thank you very much for this interesting
talk I have two questions one related to
linguistics one related to the topic of
politics as we were talking I felt like
what we were saying
he said that language is innate and that
something compels us to communicate with
others but I'm wondering if that's more
of a function of its community is
language a function of coming into
contact with work of coming into contact
with others or do people just
communicate even if they're alone I mean
what I not what do anomalies teach us
something like the one would happen to a
child who lives alone if you were alone
that they still have this innate
compulsion to communicate you know we
don't do experiments with humans so you
can't really answer the question yeah
but the chances are that the child would
be so utterly psychotic wouldn't arrive
thank you there are so many cases which
are sort of like this you know the case
of Judy that's the best known case this
is a girl who was
actually who was found when she was
about 12 years old she was locked in a
room tied to a chair she had been there
since he was about to her psycho lunatic
parents have locked her in there and
they showed food in she apparently had
almost no human contact since about two
years old when she was found before she
released the therapist to pick with the
pair of her and tried to train her and
get her back into the world of the name
Susan Curtiss wonderful Perkins I call
it written the Bevin and it looked as if
for a while as if Jeannie was she tried
to see if she could take her into
general from general cognitive
development including language and it
looked for a while as if she was gaining
knowledge of language but it turned out
to be mostly a delusion she was very
smart and she was able to apparently
have a lot of charm they were fooled
people that were thinking that she was
talking but it turned out she couldn't
recover life now it probably recovers
the right word because by now there's
evidence that children of age who if
they've had normal
they're probably the most of the light
is already there not exhibiting it but
it seems to me in their direct evidence
for that so we don't know what happens
in the earth days but that's Sheila's
yes it was like a team so psychotic you
can tell what happened from that
experience what we know if we know
something about other kinds of cognitive
development where you can experiment
with animals so for example the main
work wooden stones I'm very fun vision
and it's known probably know these
things that if you take say a kitten at
birth and if you if the kitten is not
given pattern stimulation visual if it's
given no visual stimulation it's a
visual cortex this computer if it's
given a visual stimulation that isn't
pattern it'll never develop vision when
you get physical degeneration of the
stripe cortex peripheral apart from the
visual
and this means that if a kitten go to
save several weeks without pattern
stimulation it will be physically blind
and it's that's the kind of thing that
seems to be true of most aspects of
development if a child let's say is
brought up say because of some physical
disability in seeing stilts and can't
walk and maybe it's cured at age 2 is
about I never learned how to walk we
think things just have to develop at
their own pace and probably languages
like that but we don't know thank you
for that my second question is related
to dogma we talked a lot about dog
laying in the nineteen sixties in the
nineteen sixties and how that trajectory
changed what do you think are the
dollars of today even in the Covenant of
Sciences with an education education I
guess with an education like in the
nineteen fifty years it was behaviorism
I kind of politically also trucked the
scene I'm wondering if there are ways
or and in a way that kind of is related
to the political scene because we're
late time it's a political scene
politically like it's the the political
scene and the series of the 1950's
I guess that's my impression or my
understanding form the dogmas of that
time that you can like I'm thinking
aloud that you can in a weight
indoctrinate people or people were
vessels to be filled and on the
political side you also had the sort of
narrative prior it's not a simple
situation well anything in institutional
politics they party politics there's
been a shift to the right so for example
they say the Bernie Sanders phenomenon
Sanders was considered a radical you
know but if take a look at his political
positions but they would no surprise
Ironmen are literally I mean he was
calling for higher taxes on the rich
during Eisenhower exterior they were way
higher he his policies were basically
new fuel policies
Eisenhower his position was instated was
anyone who doesn't accept New Deal
programs doesn't belong in our political
system if I now that's gets it away out
on the left you know a political
revolutions on take a look at say yeah
Hillary Clinton she's basically what
used to be called a moderate Republican
today's Republicans are just so far off
the political spectrum linemen but both
party to prove to be right
today's what are called New Democrats
Clinton Democrats are basically moderate
Republicans new fuel Democratic programs
are considered what's the radical that's
what's happened at the institutional
level on the other hand if you look at
people looks like different very
different if I just look around the room
if you have looked around the room fifty
years ago it would have been
well-dressed white male okay very that's
quite different
it's been a big dream and that it
reflects itself in all kinds of ways but
there's much more engagement on
political issues and so you can see it
in the spontaneous rise of the Sanders
movement just push a button and it all
comes out
so there's changes in others in
different directions which is part of
the reason for they remember hey thank
you um we're a lot of questioners so I'm
going to ask people to give questions
brief and just one per customer and if
we get toward the end what I may do is
have people ask the questions one after
another and let professor Chomsky decide
which ones to engage but I think we're
manageable for now hi professor Chomsky
it's Ben it's an honor to see you face
to face have studied you for four years
so thank you for coming here and doing
giving your tongue my question is that
multilingualism and what are your
thoughts on children who multilingual
and something you're the children who
learn languages more than two three
languages when they're born and their
development years children learn several
languages what do you think of
multilingualism far as we know children
normally without any special conditions
can easily learn five or six languages
as they're growing up and typically not
even though they're different like it's
just you talk to the kids in the streets
this way and you cook your aunt this way
so if your grandmother this way was
going to become there's a kind of a
recognition that comes along maybe three
or four years old way look at this I'm
building different mind
but it doesn't seem to have any
inhibitory effect at all but again you
don't experiment with humans just
natural experiment with that seems to be
the way forward
and in many parts of the world that's
just normal growing up in West African
community maybe more we're taking my
friend Mara Sally who we mentioned he
grew up in Latvia and he learned he grew
up with five lines but his parents with
Germans but Latvian to the kids in the
street picked up Russians and where went
to Hebrew school in Hebrew Yiddish was
this background and they all took were
there it's probably worth in thank you
it's probably worth interleaving that
we've been talking entirely I believe
about spoken language yeah that's
important factor sign languages differ
and they do develop something easily and
there's we don't have experience about
learning different sign languages
simultaneously but would probably work
those anyway chocolates me thank you
very much this has been a great talk so
far it's enlightening unit my question
is this the work of researchers like
Mary Lou Jetson Polina Hannah Kiva
Giorgio ganas and Jacqueline seems to
suggest that advances in artificial
intelligence and the artificial
intelligence and nanomaterials may one
day bring us to a point where brain
computer interfaces reach extremely high
fidelity essentially reading people's
minds and uploading information directly
into their brains how do you see
language evolving in a world where
humans can share information while
bypassing traditional sensory modalities
I think one should be fairly skeptical
about a lot of this right so there's a
lot of hype connected with artificial
intelligence I mean there are certainly
interesting things happening there are
useful development it's nice to have a
google translator these things that
people carry around what you do but they
couldn't do before but I think the
increments are not anywhere near as
great as just talk about that what's
called singularity you know will have
computers so smart which means programs
about the computer program so smart that
they'll be able to do things that humans
have - well that's true authority
through of your hand calculator if you
multiply numbers way faster than you can
and more accurately it's also true that
all those faster than you can but the
intellectual content is
much thinner the achievements of AI are
mostly through massive data collection
and data analysis so it's true computers
are good at storing data and going
through that and if you take a look at
how the a translation works but back in
the 1950s there were it was thought that
if you we could understand language well
enough to program computers to literally
translate like I should say I thought
and it took a long time before it was
realized this is not the way to do a
translation the way to do it and the way
your google translator works is to take
say the Canadian parliamentary record
which happened to be in French and
English in parallel and just take you
know millions of pages of this stuff and
try to do a statistical analysis which
says if this sequence of words here's an
English this sequence of words was
likely to appear in
with some reasonable probability and
that you work all this out and get a
google translator intellectually it's
working but it's useful but is it true
that initially your work was funded
because the military didn't want to take
what you were doing and use it for
translation and widespread illusion
I'm a widespread illusion but basically
the military didn't care what you were
doing
so in our our project that MIT for
example that was some of the main work
was on American Indian life the first
gender of grammar was IBM that's it we
had people studying translating boom
bolts great-grandma what the military
was doing was serving as a kind of a
funnel by which taxpayer money was being
used to create the high-tech economy of
the future so what was being done was
just developed the high-tech economy if
you have the our backpack archive not
just oh yeah but ARPA was actually a
little bit late again but it came out of
the early efforts to develop the
Internet as well 1960 which you know the
military funded them but nobody had any
military purpose well we haven't found
out whether there was a predecessor to
justice Powell who was writing no this
is I mean this was just us Industrial
Policy the way you develop the economy
of the future was by funding by the
government government meaning the
taxpayer funding research and ultimately
handing it over to private corporations
for profit you can see it's very easily
right around English let's pick a walk
around MIT
and that take a look at the buildings of
what do you see you see pharmaceutical
corporations genetic engineering and so
on but why are they there because
they're ripping off the research that's
done under public funding at the
University if you were here in the
nineteen sixteen you would have what
seemed like private electronic firm
ripping off the work that was being done
at the research level at Cox at MIT of
the Harvard computer left but the
cutting edge of the economy has shifted
from electronic based the biology based
so therefore funding has shifted and the
private enterprise systems of cold
follows along to try to cannibalize that
what's being done at public expense I
mean the basic way the economy works is
kind of public subsidy private profit
and the Pentagon happened to be a
natural way of funding electronics based
research it reminded me of something you
talked about the end of the Second World
War there was an incredibly important
document then Vannevar Bush's um you
know paper the the and science the
endless frontier and you were
essentially a fruit of that and I was
too
a little bit later and that's so
different now where no candidate would
want to talk about science that way yeah
there was understood at the end of the
Second World War that that of the bush
was a leader in this that funding public
funding of research and development
would have an enormous effect by the
later on the group
please speaking of I think a lot of us
have last night's debate on the mind and
every four years it seems that we talk
about the coarsening of public discourse
which which is often hyperbolic but I
think maybe this year brings more true
for for a lot of us that maybe we've
reached the nadir and I'm wondering if
you believe that the way that we
communicate that that language at least
at the public level has changed recently
what the causes might be and whether we
can kind of ascribe qualitative
judgments like better or worse to that
just wondering what your thoughts were
especially if you saw the faith I think
the headlines this morning were very
accurate the level of the debate
a gutter level which was kind of
appalling unless you look at history so
he'd go back to the 1790 about the same
take a look at the Jefferson's
condemnations of John Adams I mean it's
it's really pretty depressing to look at
not very different from West might in
fact Madison himself by the early 1790s
letter to Jefferson used the phrase
which applies very well today he
deplored what he called the daring
depravity of the time describing both
the corruption of the economic system by
old stock job that we call financial
institution and the vulgarity of the
inner changes so we haven't gone that
far
25 years that it's true that in the
short term it's a dramatic eye without
putting words directly in your mouth
you've always been very suspicious of
the notion that there could be something
like a political science I don't know
whether we would apply to economics -
but the getting laws of any sort about
the way language changes in the terms of
the questionnaire abuse very difficult -
well we just don't understand enough
about human society it's not a criticism
of political science and say that it
doesn't have deep theory I mean that
wasn't true of the Natural Sciences
either until model understanding and
insight is develop for the most part
they were measurement science in fact as
late as the late 19th century the
physics is still mostly aside some
measurements changes took place later so
it's not a criticism of the field with
just a comment of the complexity of the
subject matter and the limits of our
industry
we just don't understand that that's
right
okay thank you yeah thank you so much
for speaking with us today mr. Chomsky
my question comes about the topic of the
critical period hypothesis that children
the critical period hypothesis that
children develop language easier or more
naturally before puberty and many of us
our language teachers and we see that it
can be a struggle to teach language in a
classroom so my question has to do with
the arguments you heard against the
critical period hypothesis how as
educators we can maybe improve the input
for our students either younger than
puberty or older students or adult
learning languages thank you again it's
the same problem that I mentioned
earlier we don't do experiments with
humans if you did you could settle the
question so it's mostly experience and
generally there's some experimental work
which seems to indicate that conform
with what general experience is that
there are several stages of linguistic
development which are probably critical
I mean first couple of years most of the
languages internalized around puberty it
appears to become harder to pick up a
second language yeah much more work to
do with a childhood kind of like growing
growing on it happens to the child the
child will do it probably basically
correct but it's not rigid I mean there
are it is possible to gain a substantial
command of the second language in your
20 to 30 if you have the preference to
it but that's why we need to go to
Europe right now I'm not 50 years ago
but now practically everybody speaks
English and they mostly they all learned
over the second language
thank you
yeah we'll we'll keep going just to
these questioners I think but no but no
but no one additional all right good
okay hi thank you very much for today's
talk
I've always enjoyed reading your
political commentary as well so my
question really is uh what are your
views on the strain of intellect
anti-intellectualism
that we do see today in political
discourse and and also to comment a
little bit about the ability or
inability of language to communicate
truth in an age of truthiness where you
know especially in age of new media
where it lines to it often enough hold a
very strong policy of truth in them he's
interested you know that a lot of part
of his question about the fact that
about the situation where people's
assert things without any evidence and
if it's repeated often enough this is
this is Stephen Colbert sermon
truthiness it it acquires the the the
veneer of truth and and he put it in the
broader spectrum of anti anti anti
intellectualism it's a question about
today but I suspect you may tie it other
times ever change I mean that said this
is always true for back if you go
the thoughts Mazar except that there's
no matter what the size and it's nothing
about language it's just part of the
general cultural level pretty surprising
in the United States I mentioned before
but one of the things that people often
don't understand about the imagined
state is again that up until the Second
World War it was a kind of cultural
backwater and it remains that for a
large part of the population so say one
of the problems about convincing people
that there's a problem with global
warming is that about 40% of the
population in the United States not else
or with 40% in the United States are
convinced but it's not a problem because
the second coming is looking here a
couple of decades do they have evidence
event
these are just deep-seated beliefs long
history always been an extremely
fundamentalist religious country and a
lot of it remains like that but what
you're seeing is nothing new it's just
the baby depression maybe the question
leaning toward you see signs of hope
what do you think this is the condition
of their son suppose a lot of the
population is gay I mentioned before
what this room would look like 50 years
ago sign of hope and it's indicative as
many other things okay thank you keep
going three or four more questions today
so my my thought is what sort of things
in terms of activism the language what
sort of things in terms of activism and
language for instance when you were
speaking about technology there are
languages of Technology what sort of
things this technology you have to look
to the mystic sense how would you say I
think when no one was talking about
languages the technology oh I think you
will use it you you were using it
language itself as a form of pigeon
illusion
yes language itself is a form of
technology when you're describing what's
going on in your head when you're
producing these expressions is that your
you're unconscious ly and inaccessible
to consciousness your mind is working
through a certain something kind of like
a computer program which is putting
together a complex expression that
articulates the thought that you have
how you're choosing to do that as a clue
but in fact nobody has a clue how you
choose to list your finger you know
being simplistic that's a total mystery
but you can we can begin to understand
some of the things that are going on in
your mind and even begin to airily to
find some of the neural Carla so in that
sense there's a kind of a like that kind
of a mechanical formal procedures like
the computer program but the crucial
thing about is
but it does have this creative character
that the Court recognized it is the case
of the the early recognized somehow this
internal system of confrontation that
you and I share probably all humans
share is we are able to use it to convey
to others the thoughts that are in our
minds and of course the others have no
access to their mind so how does this
miracle take place
that's what amazed to Galileo and his
colleagues correctly is that clarifying
what you were asking about yeah it does
in a way thank you very much okay thank
you
hi so my question comes from being
multilingual
violate bilingual and have
multi-cultured person and so like from
my experiences it has really brought a
lot of confusion and being them with a
bilingual or almost attorney lingual and
my question is is there a state of
cognition receiving language that all
cultures and languages want to reach a
state of cognition prior to yeah the
language prior to language that all
cultures and language with jazel overtly
would ya want to reach want to evolve
into I mean I would assume so it's
pretty hard to study because it's kind
of like asking is there taught without
language the dog thing
how do we answer the question the only
way we know how to study thinking is
through its love which the Kartik
ulation and we can see that we certainly
do lots of things that we can't
articulate it like look if I decide how
I'm going to drive to work tomorrow
then we trying to figure out which path
to take where I won't run into a detour
and all that kind of stuff you're doing
complex computations of some sort of
tennis right I'm presuming we that's
happening we're working maybe professor
Chomsky's gift to other areas of
cognition other than language is really
to what extent can the ways in which
analyzed syntax grammar be applied to
other spheres rules is interesting one
of the things if you look at Rawls's
theory of justice it uses a grammatical
model what he was thinking about was
asking can you construct something like
a generative grammar for moral judgment
now the history of this idea is kind of
interesting
he came other really harsh criticism
so much so that he kind of put it to the
side and worked on other things but it
was picked up last 10 years or so first
by John me fail Oakland philosophers now
teaches law at Georgetown who did a very
good dissertation finally a book first
answering roles as critics picking up
roses model responding to roses critics
and then beginning to develop something
like a moral grammar and even initiating
empirical research to see if he can
verify his conclusion that work was
since picked up by other our cows are a
couple of others and it's a it's a live
feel you could do it another area thank
you for come on flexuz okay yeah
mr. Chomsky this is a question from my
father a PhD in linguistics from 1984 in
Georgetown and he's asking me this from
Morocco and I think I owe this to him
you were asking how in the future
you think universities will continue to
teach linguistics apart from a general
education subject and apart from the
current engineering approaches to
linguistics in schools of science and
engineering how this is how will they
will linguistics be taught as a subject
on the tone in education in higher
education particular example engineering
or will it be simply absorbed is that is
that apart from from the way that it is
already being studied for engineering is
it continued is it going to be taught as
a field of its own on its own
what do you mean more humanistically you
mean more humanistically
the way it used to be taught in the
before the eighties early 80 well by now
it's expanded way beyond that but there
is a serious question that's not just
about languages that's about what's
gonna happen to the university
there are major efforts but to try to
turn to try to impose a business model
on the educational system and to get it
to produce object called graduates who
will be useful for the business world
now this has taken a most extreme form
in the United States probably in
Wisconsin where the the government has
the state government is really
destroying one of the finest
universities in the country University
of Wisconsin by trying to reshape it so
that its sole goal is to produce
graduates useful for the current
business world and Wisconsin I mean
apart from the sort of vulgarity of the
program it's also going to destroy the
business world
it's not gonna function and what says
real education basically I mean it even
got to the point where it led to a media
backlash at one point the governor Scott
Walker committee had decided that they
should remove from the official
formulation of the university's purpose
pursued proof who needs that stuff and
that was a little too much that they
have to claim those clerical error in
the story but this is happening not just
there it's happening in Europe through
the the Tory government Conservative
government in Europe in England has
imposed programs of
marketization which essentially say that
for example of the classics department
at Oxford and wants to receive money
they can show that they couldn't survive
in the market okay that they have a
product that can be a commercially
viable one commentators Stefan Bellini
I write that educational policy I think
worth many times what are supplementary
little bit the government is trying to
convert first-class university into
third class
commercial enterprises and this kind of
thing is happening all over much of the
world in various ways and unless that's
resistant universities are going to lose
their highest values and achievements
we're not perfect by any name
it's a real struggle it's kind of an
analogue to turning the elementary
schools in two places where you produce
kids who can answer questions on the
exam and not understand well you can
tell your father that some of us are
working at this issue last question
thank you I also have these questions
too and I believe as myself that were
still interested in education linguistic
many people sitting here should be and
there's a lot of people who leave
there's a certain age that beyond which
the other men have a hard point where we
it is almost impossible to is perfect
language perfectly for any language but
many people would believe like if giving
some good or in high environments it is
still possible to apply language almost
imperfectly later or adult age you or
people which be some in our environments
or factories des canal it had possibly
to our language acquisition regardless
of age order like also later age
I think the gist of your question was
can we abolish puberty so that people
can continue to learn languages easily
into later life it's extra question
finally asking me if we couldn't grow
wings and fly like it is that your
question
I haven't sample with the puberty your
physical organisms we are and with
tremendous capacity but you're very
capacities impose a limit I'm if you
have the capacity to grow arms it's
because you're genetically designed grow
arms but that means your block from
growing wings and this carries over to
the cognitive domains as well if we're
capable of acquiring certain things and
gaining certain kinds of understanding
it's going to follow that there are
other things we'll never understand this
is a very controversial
commonly believed many scientists
believe but we can really learn anything
but I think that's basically assuming
that we're not organisms we're angels
if we're part of the organic world that
we're going to have structure which
yields capacities and by their very
nature you of limitation and I think
there are a long story into the mirror
but there are interesting cases in
history where we have reached the limits
of wonder
in fact what I mentioned about the
mechanical theory of the world is one of
them the early Scientific Revolution was
based on the conception of the world as
a machine Newton to his dismay proved
that it is he never believed it regarded
as an absurdity but no scientific person
with scientific capacity could ever
believe but it seemed prove this is
mainly because of interaction that this
which is not mechanical and what
happened actually is a very important
change in intellectual history that you
I think not sufficiently acknowledge
what happened is that the goals of
scientific inquiry were lowered for
Galileo Newton and others the goals were
to get an intelligible account of the
world the diet the goals were lowered to
gaining intelligible theories about the
world so everybody in scientists could
understand
Newton's theories he could of course
understand his theories didn't think
they were observed but he thought what
they were saying wasn't there because
they were not giving a picture of the
world that's intelligible to us and if
you look at the later history of science
it just gets more and more
unintelligible
but I think that's and there I think
things like that happen in the
literature or in the or no you do it
limits and they have to search other way
let me make one one point final no no
I'm Chomsky as she pointed out who grew
up in America where it was possible to
get broad education and there's nobody
who made better use of it than you did
even the serene for an hour we ran
through history science language
politics as phrase was talking about art
literature I feel lucky that I the half
a generation younger had that privilege
as well it is in jeopardy for the
reasons that he
and neither of us was going around that
much longer it's really up to you all
the praise I used what some of you have
heard it's a Howard Gardner's attempt to
be witty it is between the literacies
and the livelihoods literacies begins
with a lie it's what you learn in school
so you could do anything
it's go lastic why be good to ultimately
you want to have them work you should be
able to work but another thing that
begins with a lie is little arts and
sciences and fundamentally that's what
our universities and colleges more than
anywhere else in the world gave people
who camp to do without becoming
pre-vocational or hyper vocational but
for the reasons that Nona said it's very
much in jeopardy you've gotten a whiff
of it today intellectual Giants and
the way we can thank him the underline
of applause just to make sure that
people in the future have access to that
that breath in that said wisdom thank
you
