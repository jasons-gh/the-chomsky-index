there's there's a place for
probabilistic models in the study of
language your study of anything but it
doesn't carry very far the fundamental
problems remain the same so the
probabilistic models just tell you
nothing nothing about the creative
aspect of language use about the gap the
fundamental gap between incited and
inclined and compelled now there is a
place for them and in fact there's
interesting work on it so some of the
most interesting work on language
acquisition by charles yank in this case
linguist psychologist at the University
of Pennsylvania he it's pretty clear
that a child approaches the problem of
language acquisition by having all
possible languages in its head it
doesn't know which language it's it's
being exposed to and as data comes along
that class of possible languages reduces
so certain data comes along and the mind
automatically says ok it's not that
language some other language and in fact
we find in the children's in literature
on child acquisition and experiments
with child acquisition it's been
discovered that at various stages like
the children are imitating possible
languages that they've never heard so at
some stage a child make that
english-speaking child can be producing
sentences of the kind that appear say in
Italian or in German because it just
doesn't know yet it's never heard any
data as saying that that's the way it
ought to be but that hasn't been ruled
out yet so the child is producing things
that are never never experiences in the
local language but they remain still not
ruled out now if you work out the method
of ruling out languages you do
introduced probabilistic inference and
it can lead to some interesting results
as in gangs work so there is nothing
wrong with statistical inference just
doesn't care either
