what do you think is the most the single
most important action the United States
can take and what about its role over
the year is what is its interest here
well one important action that the
United States could take is to live up
to its own laws of course it would be
nice if it lifts up the international
law but maybe that's too much to ask but
live up to its own laws and there there
are several and here incidentally I have
in mind advice to activists also who I
think ought to be organizing and
educating in this direction there are
two crucial cases one of them is the
what's called the Leahy law patrick
leigh senator Lee introduced legislation
called the lay law which bars sending
weapons to any military units which are
involved in consistent human rights
violations there isn't the slightest
doubt that the Israeli army is involved
in massive human rights violations which
means that all dispatch of us arms to
Israel is in violation of US law I think
that's significant the US should be
called upon by its own citizens to and
by others to adhere to US law which also
happens to conform the international law
in this case as Amnesty International
for example for years has been calling
for an arms embargo against Israel for
this reason these are all steps that can
be taken the second is the tax-exempt
status that is given to organizations in
the united states which are directly
involved in the occupation and in
significant
at attacks on human and civil rights
within Israel itself like the Jewish
National Fund take a look at its charter
with the State of Israel which commits
it to acting for the benefit of people
of Jewish race religion and origin
within Israel one of the consequences of
that is that by a complex array of laws
and administrative practices of the fund
pretty much administers about ninety
percent of the land of the country with
real consequences for who can live
places they get tax-exempt status also
for their activities in the West Bank
which are strictly criminal I think
that's also straight and violation of US
law those are important things and I
think the US should be pressured
internationally and domestically to
abandon its virtual unique role
unilateral role in blocking a political
settlement for the past 40 years ever
since the first veto in January 1976
that should be a major issue in the
media in convocations like this and the
United Nations and domestic politics and
government politics and so on
