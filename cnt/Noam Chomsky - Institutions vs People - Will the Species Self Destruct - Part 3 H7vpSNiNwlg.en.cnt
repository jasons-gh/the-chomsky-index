so vicious crimes in Kosovo hidden asked
why that limit was imposed interesting
question but let's put it aside actually
it's not quite accurate he knew it's not
for Malaysia richest crimes in Kosovo is
for his crimes after March 24th 1999 if
you read the indictment you find that
virtually every crime mentioned is at
that's the day when the u.s. NATO
bombing began virtually everything
mentioned is some crime that took place
after the bombing there are reasons for
that time frame as well carefully
invaded in the huge literature that's
come out about this topic come back to
it if you like but I'll skip it now
anyway it's fact virtually nothing in
the indictment few things but very
little before the bombing so the war
crimes trials are in fact for crimes
within a very specific time frame namely
the crime and they're real crimes no
doubt about that the crimes committed
under NATO bombing the crimes that were
incidentally anticipated and not very
surprising change the fact that their
crimes well without proceeding to that
I'll mention that there's another trial
going on right now it's not in Belgrade
or in The Hague but in Washington this
is the trial of general Johnny lumen
tongue he's an indonesian general who
was implicated in planning and executing
massive crimes in east timor in 1999 far
beyond anything attributed to the washer
bitch i should say furthermore not only
are these much worse than character they
also had to be war crimes not just
crimes against humanity that is crimes
in the course of aggression of serious
kind furthermore these crimes were not
carried out under bombing by a
superpower in fact not even under any
fighting
going on just plain massive attacks on
the civilian population there was a
superpower involved actually to the
United States and Britain they had been
involved for a long time the 25 years in
fact they were involved they involved in
arming and training the killers that
continued right through 1999 in earlier
years their involvement actually it was
Jenna Seidel one of the places where
that overused word really applies
relative to the population the deaths
killings were probably greater than
anything since the Holocaust and that
continued through 1999 the US British
client destroyed about seventy percent
of the country drove out eighty-five
percent of the population killed nobody
knows how many people and nobody ever
will know for a very good reason the
United States prevented the dispatch of
any forensic experts quite different
from Kosovo where the place was flooded
by forensic experts to try to dig out
crimes of the official enemy but here
they were withheld despite pleas from
the UN Australian furthermore the US has
blocked any tribunals so they'll never
be an investigation but there is a trial
going on lumen Tom's trial living tong
with served court papers in washington
on march 27th he was in Washington at
the invitation of the State Department
he's one of their favorites the State
Department was pretty upset by the fact
that he was handed a subpoena and the
u.s. apologized profusely to the
government of Indonesia for this
indignity he was quickly spirited out of
the country but the trial is proceeding
in absentia and in silence there hasn't
been a word about it good reasons unlike
Milosevic under NATO bombing lumen
tongue is a u.s. run criminal
responsible
for much worse crimes so therefore his
trial right in Washington are not very
easy to ignore has to be ignored by the
usual principles well of course could be
argued that lumen tongue is not the top
commander which is correct it's greatly
implicated he was not to talk command
the top commander was generally ronto he
was granted an amnesty in advance just
in case they're ever might be a tribunal
not that there's much threat of that the
top leaders are of course exempt and the
decisive role of the United States and
Britain that's also exempt and it is
decisive back through the Ford and
particularly Carter years in fact the
role of the United States is virtually
entirely suppressed in the United States
with pretty has been all along still is
in Britain not so completely written as
not as a less disciplined society than
us not just in this respect well even
worse than that the current story that's
now around and that will enter his
history of course is that the u.s. led
the humanitarian intervention in East
Timor because it was so appalled by the
crimes which in fact it was carrying out
and this was after it had unfortunately
overlooked the crimes of the past 25
years for which over which it was
presiding and for which it provided the
crucial military and diplomatic support
with about a third of the population
wiped out all thanks to the complicity
of the media and the intellectual
culture generally folks like us people
who are always very agitated about the
other guys crimes well these are near
historical Universal told too easy to
continue this shameful story just
keeping to the sunday New York Times
which incidentally I
and exhausted i've just sampled i could
go on for another hour on that but i
won't it's the the and i should say that
the US and Britain are by no means
unusual and said before the spree
standard the main difference between the
United States and Britain and other
societies is that the United States and
Britain have never been defeated and
furthermore they have been dominant
societies and for those reasons alone
they have nothing to regret it follows
that if you're not defeated and you're
in a dominant position you didn't do
anything wrong that's kind of like a
principle of logic therefore you have
nothing to regret and in fact you can
bask in the self adulation for your
courageous leadership and the cause of
human rights and freedom and so on and
it's essentially the task of the
intellectual community to make sure that
this all works very smoothly and it does
there's rarely a hitch well I should say
in for accuracy that they're sometimes
as a hitch so the charge is not totally
accurate the error country the United
States as you know was founded on a and
developed in fact on the basis of
terrible crimes slavery and the most
extreme ethnic cleansing in history I
suppose and there have been occasional
statements of regret never any official
statements one of the rare examples and
they are very rare in high places is
John Quincy Adams he was a major
contributor to massive crimes and long
after his involvement in that long after
he was out of office Adams declawed I'm
quoting the heinous sins for which I
believe God will one day bring this
nation to judgment he hoped that this
belated stand would somehow aid that
hapless race of Native Americans that we
are exterminating with such merciless
and
phidias cruelty he hoped in vain of
course the attack escalated very quickly
and continued until the disposition
dispossession and the extermination were
almost complete leaving us miraculously
guiltless in the eyes of the history
that we construct actually how guiltless
Lee are you can test from your own
recent experience neural beneficiaries
of a good education I'm sure like most
people you were focusing paying a lot of
attention last November two stories
coming from a county in Florida the
dateline was Seminole County Florida
that was the scene of various electoral
shenanigans you can now carry out an
experiment you can ask yourselves how
you would have reacted if there was an
election in Germany now and everyone was
focusing their eyes on electoral
shenanigans and say hi county with area
if you can imagine that you're looking
in the mirror you might if you don't
know why you want to find out what the
that's back to John Quincy Adams in fact
well this let's go back to the all of
these are just among the prerequisites
of power powerful you're allowed to
disease things these are illustrations
of the truisms that I mentioned well
let's look at the question a little bit
more generally back off a little
actually question has been addressed at
a very question of whether this will
lead to self-destruction I'm now doing
an interpretation of an article that
didn't interpret what he said the way i
do but i think it applies the general
question was addressed by the grand old
man of american biology Ernst Meier of
Harvard he wrote an article a couple
years ago on the adaptive
value of higher intelligence and he was
pretty skeptical about it his reasons
were that he said we've had about 50
billion species since the origin of life
only one of which achieved the
intelligence needed to establish a
civilization that did so very recently
in a very small breeding group from
which we're all descended probably were
lots of other close relatives but
they're gone probably exterminated along
with big mammals the yeah that's what's
left and that's the one exception he
concludes Meyer that this kind of
evolutionary accident is not favored by
selection the history of life on Earth
is refutes the claim that it's better to
be smart than stupid the successful
organisms are stupid they are adapted
the very narrow ecological niches
beetles bacteria actually phage which
are in mass as was the most successful
capacity for rapid mutation helps Meyer
adds the rather somber observation that
the average life expectancy of the
species on earth is about a hundred
thousand years it's just about the
lifespan of the one species that most
radically broke the pattern and now
faces the question of whether it's
better to be smart than stupid that's
the question I'm asking well the species
is certainly smart enough to have
developed the capacity to destroy itself
no doubt about that and it's also
demonstrated that capacity quite
consistently throughout history quite
dramatically so in the past several
hundred years with the salt and assault
on the environment that sustains life on
the diversity of more complex organisms
and on each other as well just the last
century there were about a hundred
million deaths which are directly
attributable to war the last decade
contrary to what's often said brought
nothing new the consequences of the
collapse of the British and the French
and the Portuguese empires were far more
destructive than what followed the
collapse of the East European tyrannous
and in fact those still remain very
prominently on the front pages today
decades later that's contrary to what's
commonly claimed but that takes us back
to the truisms I mentioned earlier the
many of the conflicts of the past decade
can be attributed to an enemy empire
that collapsed leaving a terrible legacy
namely the Soviet Union so therefore
those atrocities are real as distinct
from the legacies of our friends and
allies which is incomparably worse but
not real by virtue of the historical
truism that I of immunity of power and
privilege from inspection well even
though the 90s were not unusual and in
fact less destructive than the collapse
of earlier empires Western empires and
even though the number of interstate
conflicts has declined quite sharply
through the 90s nevertheless it wasn't a
pretty decade by 1998 interest internal
to state interstate conflicts had left
about five million dead 10 million
refugees 5 million people internally
displaced forty percent of those are in
Colombia where the regular increase
300,000 a year of the past decade is
expected to accelerate pretty sharply as
Washington's war moves into full years
Clinton's plan colombia that's in
addition to over a million who just fled
the country well more ominously still
the kind of intelligence needed to
establish a civilization
Ernst Meier referred it has constructed
particular kinds of dominant
civilizations and they are based on
institutional structures that do
increase the likelihood of dreadful
outcomes the most obvious example is
just the international system which 10
is designed in such a way structured in
such a way that it tends to enhance an
apparently inexorable drive to adapt
modern technology to the most
destructive ends nuclear weapons are the
most threatening example and in
deference to the principle of looking at
ourselves we might attend to our own the
situation right here the primacy
assigned to nuclear weapons in the
highest level strategic planning of the
Clinton years there's a reason so
putting from documents of the Strategic
Command highest level Planning Group
they say unlike chemical or biological
weapons the extreme destruction from a
nuclear explosion is immediate with few
or any palliatives to reduce its effect
so therefore the planners recommend that
nuclear weapons be visibly available
because although we are not likely to
use nuclear weapons in less than matters
of the greatest national importance
reassuring I suppose nevertheless they
cast a shadow over every crisis or
conflict furthermore it's beneficial for
our strategic posture if some elements
of government may appear to be
potentially out of control that the
United States may become irrational and
vindictive if it's vital interests are
attacked should be a part of the
national persona we project that's
what's called credibility in public
discourse and it's projected the world
is very frightened including Europe the
US must therefore reject the basic
principle of the non-proliferation
treaty namely that nuclear powers make a
good faith effort to eliminate nuclear
weapons and the US must retain them as
the basis for our strategic posture that
includes the right of first use of
nuclear weapons against non-nuclear
powers which have signed the
non-proliferation treaty it's all very
explicit in any country that valued its
freedom this would be all over the front
pages and would have been four years
since been Declassified the basic
conclusions have been approved in
presidential directives Clinton
directives they authorize first use and
they maintain nuclear weapons and launch
on warning posture that perpetuates a
high alert regime of the past years with
the ever present danger to survival
there are new programs that are being
initiated to implement these decisions
there is a change in the post-cold war
period sort of the Pentagon so on
internal documents right after the Cold
War ended recommended as implemented a
change from targeting what it primarily
would had called the weapons rich
environment of the Soviet Union to the
target rich environment of the rest of
the world the third world which is
actually been the main target of US
military action right throughout the
Cold War and is remaining so apart from
some modification of pretexts with the
Cold War requires major change since the
end of the Cold War is change of
pretexts and elimination of the
deterrent the u.s. violence has even
made pretty explicit well more evidence
that it's may not be better to be smart
than stupid is the national missile
defense program there's a standard
criticism of this namely that it would
be useless since there are easy modes of
delivery that don't require missiles
Graham Allison leading strategic analyst
over Harvard Kennedy School pointed out
that
if terrorists wanted to smuggle a
nuclear warhead into New York City all
they have to do is wrap it in a bale of
marijuana another another common
argument is that they won't work that's
the standard criticism it's not going to
work a much more dangerous possibility
is that it might work or that it might
even appear to be working remember that
in issues of survival like nuclear
strategy appearance has got to be an
identity interpreted as reality can't
take any chances so if there's any
possibility that it might work it's
extremely dangerous as long as it's not
going to work it's just the waste in
Phoenix is the way to fund high-tech
industry if it looks as if it might work
however then that's really dangerous and
US intelligence estimates have been
pretty clear about this they predicted
that the deployment of the national
missile defense that looks feasible is
come quoting I was going to impel China
to develop new nuclear armed missiles
expanding its nuclear arsenal by a
factor of ten prompting Indian Pakistan
to respond with their own build ups with
a likely ripple effect to the Middle
East these same analyses and plenty of
others point out that the Russians only
rational response would be to maintain
and strengthen the existing Russian
nuclear force us negotiators clinton-era
negotiators in fact encouraged Russia to
adopt a launch on warning strategy
themselves the idea was to alleviate
Russian concerns and to induce them to
accept the national missile defense and
the revision
the ABM treaty that's a proposal that's
pretty bizarre when expert commented
because we know their warning system is
full of holes so it simply maximizes the
threat to us and everyone else there was
a UN conference on the non-proliferation
treaty last May was very broad in fact
universal condemnation of the national
missile defense on grounds that it would
undermine decades of arms control
agreements provoke them to weapons race
but both political parties in the United
States are committed to it though at
different rates very few including
allies pay much attention to the tales
about rogue states Canadian military
planners for example advise the
government that the goal of national
missile defense is more to preserve us
native freedom of action than because
the United States really fears North
Korean or Iranian threats to classified
briefings but well the reasons commonly
given for this are the pressure of
military industry and so on which could
be I suspect myself and I approve it
that a non-trivial factor and this may
be traced back again to cultural
patterns in particular a kind of a
curious paranoid streak in American
culture which may well be the result of
centuries of victories against much
weaker enemies facing no military threat
since the war of 1812 so the bully in
the schoolyard may well come to fear
that everyone hates him for some reason
as compared with the other countries
there are remarkably high levels of fear
in the United States that's of all sorts
of things crime terrorism aliens among
us Judgment Day
spend anything you think of except for
the real threats to the United States
and the world which are high and
probably increasing now that would be
something of a problem if we were
talking about Afghanistan but we're not
it's vastly more significant when we're
talking about the most advanced
civilization that intelligence has been
able to create and the most dominant
well these global concerns are not
alleviated by other us stands last
November November 1999 the United States
blocked the UN General Assembly
resolution opposing space-based weapons
it was passed 138 20 the US and Israel
alone abstaining but the u.s. abstention
is a veto the two years earlier the US
Space Command published what it called
its vision for the year 2020 which
called for what they call full-spectrum
dominance including control of space
military control in order to protect us
interests and investments well there are
plenty of threats in the world but the
major problems lie right at home and
hence are within the sphere of our
influence and control which brings us
right back to the truisms that I
mentioned at the outset well let's again
a lot more to say about this but let's
turn to another domain so consider
something nice and mild not nuclear
weapons neoclassical markets markets in
which isolated individuals seek only to
maximize a particular form of
self-interest instantly a form that's
consciously constructed with very great
effort with perceptions instituted by
vas industries that are devoted to
and planting and reinforcing them in the
United States about one-sixth of gross
domestic product that's well over a
trillion dollars a year is devoted to
marketing much of it is just
manipulation and control trying to
institute these values starting their
infancy well these constructed systems
have a number of well-known problems one
is that unborn generations who are going
to face the consequences I have no vote
in the market from which it follows that
their interests count as zero in the
market system they don't enter into
consideration in a well functioning
market that alone tends to undermine the
possibilities of the sustainable
development on which survival relies
these threats are currently being
enhanced very consciously by dedicated
efforts to weaken the institutional
structures that might address these
externalities as they're cold and even
more important to undermine the culture
of sympathy and solidarity that sustains
them now this last commitment i think is
pretty important money I believe it's
the driving force behind the propaganda
efforts that are designed to undermine
popular support for healthcare systems
of the kind that are found in other
industrial societies and to create a
largely artificial sense of crisis about
the schools and the Social Security and
in fact about any institutions that rely
on the dangerous sentiment that we might
care about somebody else not just
ourselves the Social Security scam has
other routes and it's a scam take a look
if you don't believe it whatever one
thinks about transferring Social
Security to stocks the stock market
there are two consequences which are
absolutely clear and unavailable one is
that it's a huge bonanza for Wall Street
another is that
it entails that working people are going
to have to have it are going to end up
with a tremendous stake in the value of
stocks of the stocks on which their
survival post-retirement survival
depends on the survival of their
families that means that working people
will have a strong reason to oppose
decent wages and working conditions
health safety health and safety
standards in the workplace the social
social and economic rights that are
given formal endorsement in the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
with which the u.s. strongly opposes and
other principles that are naturally
despised by the unaccountable private
thira knees that dominate the domestic
in the international society and close
alliance with one another and the
powerful states that they largely
dominate that's another prescription for
disaster and not so in such a long term
well it's commonly claimed it is a huge
payoff for these problems what's called
globalization or the new economy or free
markets or other terms terms of
propaganda I believe referring to the
social and economic policies of the past
twenty odd years according to the story
they have led to unprecedented economic
growth though unfortunately a few have
been left behind and do something about
that all led by the spectacular
fairytale economy of the United States
you've read this a thousand times so it
takes a the most critical voice in the
New York Times Anthony Lewis on march
10th he informed us that I'm quoting the
greatest economic boom in America's
history in fact in the world's history
came in the 1990s what is Louis
referring to he's referring to the fact
that a slow recovery from the recession
of the early 90s was compensated by a
growth spurt in the last few years that
brought the growth rate for the 90s to
about the
lovely rather dismal 20 years that
preceded it all that is well below the
level of economic growth or productivity
growth in the first what many economists
call the Golden Age of Western
capitalism that's from World War two up
till the mid 1970s it was in the mid
1970s that the Bretton Woods system of
regulated capital was dismantled and the
new era of globalization and
neoliberalism was instituted bringing
with it uncontroversial II a substantial
deterioration in macroeconomic
indicators wherever the rules were
followed including the United States
furthermore even the relatively anemic
growth in the United States through the
90s was unusual in that it left out most
of the population I don't know if this
earlier period in US history of which
that's true during the Golden Age prior
to neoliberalism during the Golden Age
wages and benefit rose very rapidly
across the board to give you some
figures from 1947 the 1973 real wages
rose seventy-five percent from nineteen
seventy three to nineteen ninety-eight
they fell nine percent back to the level
of 1967 furthermore it was level growth
in the golden age in fact the lowest
quintile had the highest growth rate in
the highest quintile had the lowest and
benefits and so on along with it during
the globalization phase the benefits of
the much slower growth are very highly
skewed even after the growth spurt of
the late 90s the male median wages are
below 1989 pika last business cycle for
a large majority of the population there
well below the 1970s
a family incomes have been more or less
sustained but that's why far heavier
workload in fact the heaviest in the
industrial world by the early 1990s take
massachusetts in massachusetts median
income declined by half above half below
declined by about ten percent in the
1990s it was even steeper decline in
connecticut in california purchasing
power for her family dropped about a
thousand dollars during the 1990s
according to a recent federal reserve
bank of california report notice that
these are the stars of the new economy
you know real fancy places social
indicators have been declining since the
mid-1970s they before that they rose
kind of tracking gross domestic product
they've been declining since they're now
about the level of forty years ago the
poverty levels approximately like 20
years ago the highest in the industrial
world second is england the other
country that's more or less kept to the
neoliberal rules the furthermore even
this much less than impressive the
economic performance is very fragile
fact everybody knows that now it's
fueled mainly by consumer spending the
consumer spending is stimulated by
fanatic propaganda efforts one
consequence of it is that it's led the
unprecedented debt household that passed
disposable income last year for first
time in American history and also a huge
trade deficit now the trade deficit is
not much of a problem for policy makers
to MIT Nobel laureates had a op-ed in
the times about that economics reflected
retired economics professors yesterday
and they're right it's not they talk
about the threat of the deficit it's not
much of a problem to policymakers but
they didn't point out that it's a major
problem for the population if you look
at polls it's been the most important
economic issue for the population
for some years it doesn't enter into
political campaigns at all but that's
for another reason that's because this
is an issue on which the business
community has one view and the
population has another view and such
issues cannot enter into the political
arena in our democratic society because
of the way it's structured so but if you
look at polls yeah the trade deficit and
capital mobility generally people don't
call it that that's we're talking about
is the leading economic issue because
people understand that it's a threat to
job quality and job security as indeed
it is on the problems these problems of
worldwide they're not just the US so the
executive secretary of the economic
commission of Latin America and the
Caribbean is a Antonio ocampo he gave a
talk at the American economic society in
January in which he reviewed the record
for Latin America he's been a kind of a
booster for this system for years and he
pointed out that trade and investment
did increase during the prescribed
reforms but he says the enthusiastic
predictions have turned out to be a
mirage Latin America he points out as
the region where the reforms were most
strictly enforced and growth fell under
the reforms to a little over half the
level of the three decades of state-led
economic development from the 1950s
through the 1970s before pre
liberalisation and globalization in
contrast he points out the one success
story of the new era is East Asia and
China where the regime's dramatically
didn't follow the rules furthermore
though he didn't point this out this is
fully consistent with two centuries of
economic history including the United
States it's an interesting story too
long review here so what leads a anthony
lewis and other commentators to such
curious fantasies well you
guess the reason narrow circles have
indeed benefited enormously and that
includes the folks who tell everyone
else the happy news people like us and
the circles in which we live for the
most part are doing fine you know
spectacularly well if you keep to the
approved the modern doctrine that
nothing matters except me well you know
the conclusions are not all that strange
however outlandish they are in fact let
me stress that is a modern doctrine
these doctrines would have appalled Adam
Smith and other founders of classical
liberalism in fact there are a major
assault on enlightenment values as is
the structure of the dominant
institutions concentrations of
unaccountable private power
unaccountable the public of course
administering and controlling markets
and violation of market principles
controlling in fact owning the doctrinal
institutions and with an overwhelming
influence on the powerful states and
international institutions the ones that
modestly call themselves the
international community what are the
expectations for the future well we have
expert predictions about that too the US
intelligence community with specialists
from the academic and world of private
sector they just published a report on
predictions for the year 2015 and they
give several scenarios the most
optimistic scenario that they give is
that globalization proceeds on course
and in that case they say it's evolution
will be Rocky marked by chronic
financial volatility and widening and a
widening economic divide well financial
volatility means slower growth and less
productive long-term investment and a
widening economic divide means less
convergence to a global market that is
to a single price and wage so what
they're predicting is less
globalization in the technical sense but
more globalization in the doctrine Lee
approved sense which doesn't mean to
with globalization that has to do with
capital mobility and investor rights
that's the most optimistic scenario for
then there's some bad ones for Latin
America their prediction is that the oil
producers Mexico Venezuela and Brazil
ought to do all right but most others
will fall behind in fact very badly
behind Mexico and Brazil however will be
unquote increasingly confident and
capable actors that's an interesting
comment because they certainly know that
Mexico and Brazil have the highest
equality in the world so they're not
talking about Mexico and Brazil what
they're they're not going to be
confident and capable actors rather
small sectors within Mexico and Brazil
which happened to be linked to
international capital and they're going
to be separated from the rest by an
increasing divided according to the
best-case scenario of the experts
Mexico's particularly interesting case
it's described as the star pupil of
Latin America and the reason is it's
been following the rules of the so
called Washington Consensus you know
neoliberal rules for 20 years and also
it had the extra advantage of benefiting
from NAFTA since 1994 so what happened
well for the last 20 years wages have
steadily declined probably about fifty
percent by 1990 another twenty-five
percent decline since NAFTA that
includes a ten percent decline even in
the manufacturing industries which are
supposed to be the best performers
poverty levels of our up ten percent
since NAFTA there now increasing at
about twice the level of the population
income inequality has deepened economic
power is more concentrated quote from a
recent study of the Latin American
section of the Woodrow Wilson Center
50 firm's account for half the export 20
corporate groups control three-fifths of
the national economic output small
Mexican companies face nearly
insurmountable financing costs trade and
farming continue to shed excess workers
labor intensive industries which is
almost everything there agriculture
light industry can't compete
internationally all of these costs
incidentally are radically
underestimated because of the highly
ideological method of estimating
economic costs it's not neutral so not
counted here are the costs of the huge
flow of migrant workers trying to
survive coming to the United States
where they work at very low wages
benefits awful conditions
