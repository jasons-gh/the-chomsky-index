hello I'm Nam Abdullah here in front of
the MIT to do an interview with
Professor Noam Chomsky Noam Chomsky is a
linguist political activist philosopher
I'm here to do an interview with him on
the long-standing Kurdish issue in the
Middle East the current estimate is some
30 to 40 million people are living in
adjacent parts of Turkey Iran Syria and
Iraq now let's see what Noam Chomsky
thoughts are on this issue in the Middle
East we are really pleased to have you
with us professor Chomsky I'd like to
start with the question of how you
became interested in the Kurdish issue
in the first place Oh
quite a long time ago I mean they I
don't have to tell you that the prevail
of the Kurds has been very bitter and
brutal and I can't remember when I
learned about it must be 50 years ago
but then in the 70s I followed it pretty
closely with what went on with with you
know the interactions between the Shah
and Henry Kissinger and so on all those
lovely things and then of course in the
1980s but then later I became more
focused on the Kurds in Turkey and I've
visited there a few times but then
Arabic here was involved with protests
against the repression which in the 90s
was pretty horrible and improved a
little in the years since but so
unfortunately regrettably yes as you say
things have sort of improved and as we
are seeing now changed sweeping the Arab
world it's a switch to Syria where a
significant portion of the greater
Kurdistan territory is located what kind
of impacts do you see these Arab Spring
or color spring might have on the
Kurdish question outcome of the
Arab Spring is pretty indefinite at the
moment that's different in different
countries in the oil dictatorships Saudi
Arabia Emirates Kuwait it's got almost
no impact they're made in Saudi Arabia
the first efforts to participate even
symbolically and the Friday
demonstrations were crushed instantly in
Bahrain you know what happened and so
that region the oil-producing region
it's essentially nothing much as yet
happened thanks to due to repression in
northern Africa that's where the main
progress has been Tunisia was there has
been significant move towards a more
open democratic society of course they
got rid of the dictator Egypt is a kind
of a mixed story that's the most
important country given in size role in
the Arab world but and there were real
achievements I mean the the dictator was
gone the practice significant progress
and the freedom of speech crucial
achievement was in right of labour
organization both in Tunisia and Egypt
there had been militant labor
organizations I mostly crushed by the
dictatorship but but some game and this
freed them up in fact their
participation and the uprisings I think
probably what essentially made the
difference and that's been improved
there's no independent labor organizing
moves towards an independent Union for
the first time unified one on the other
hand the regime is still in place
what I am interested in our impacts of
this Arab Spring revolutions on the
Kurds what do you think there might be
some possibilities for the Kurds to to
gain some sort of independence in any of
the regions where they live I wish I
could say yes
but I don't really see much of an impact
I think the question is whether the Arab
Spring uprisings will be contained if
they'll be contained I don't think there
will be much of an impact if they grow
and develop and spread beyond then there
could be an impact but for the moment
they've been pretty much contained I
mean there has been progress in Tunisia
Egypt Syria is a monstrosity but the
impact of the Arab Spring has so far
been it's been significant that's of
historic importance but it's still been
constrained within the places where
significant action has been taking place
primarily Egypt in Tunisia what you'd
hope would happen was that it would lead
to pressures for more independence and
freedom and other regions but that has
not much happened I mean in Turkey it's
going backwards
the Iraqi Kurdistan is retains its
relative autonomy in Syria I suppose the
Kurdish populations mostly is probably
flee if they came but if we if we take
rocky Kurdistan for example there is
that the Kurds already enjoy a
semi-autonomous status and the Kurdish
leadership and the people are already
speaking in louder voices of the
possibilities of establishing a state
don't you think you think that's an
impact of the Arab Spring I mean one
could say they have been emboldened by
by the Arab Spring so that's a good
thing but my least you know my whatever
limited knowledge I have of it it seems
to me that's mostly related to
developments inside Iraq so are the
Kurds in northern Iraq ready to declare
independence do you think well I don't
have to tell you what the problems are
you know very well if there was an
independent
at Kurdistan in northern Iraq it would
be landlocked that would be surrounded
by hostile neighbors Turkey obviously
isn't gonna like it dear friends nothing
to like it
Arab Iraq isn't gonna like it has very
little access to the outside world so
it's it would be in a difficult
situation I think one of one of the
things that Kurds we've wanted to see in
northern Iraq before the withdrawal of
US forces was the establishment of a US
military base some Americans wanted that
as well but that did not have it and and
and and the Kurds I mean can we say the
Kurds are more vulnerable as a result of
the withdrawal of US forces in northern
Iraq because there's it really depends
what happens in Iraq it depends on
whether Iraq can hold together I mean I
don't tell you Iraq is a federal wreck
after the invasion and occupation and if
it crumbles as it might if F major
sunni-shia conflict erupt and the south
into the bath area moves towards some
kind of independence of our province it
moves toward some kind of independence
the country will pretty much split apart
what effect that it might increase the
opportunities for the Iraqi Kurdistan
but it is in the literal independence
well has its you can see its positive
aspects from the point of view of the
Kurds themselves would carry serious
problems of isolation encirclement
hostile enemies and so on it's a
delicate situation I don't know I mean I
would I think optimally an Iraqi
Kurdistan could become under the best
conditions the center for a broader
Kurdistan that we extend the southeast
in Turkey northern Iran if the situation
improves there I have to see what
happens in Syria of course there is also
a Russian and then one
say I mean I mean of course there there
are so many people like you saying that
Turkey would oppose an independent move
by the Iraqi Kurds because that would
that would make the Kurds in Turkey ask
the same demands right but but what one
could say that turkey is Turkish
interest in Iraq is sort of undermined
by the rise of Iranian influence in the
south of Iraq and in Baghdad and the I
mean the Shias are rolling there and the
shears are loyal to Iran they are but
Turkey has a sort of an ambivalent
relationship to the XI world so for
example it has pretty good relations
with Iran in fact it's Turkey has not
accepted the you know in words it does
but in practice it hasn't accepted the
US European sanctions on Iran it's
moving to its increased commercial
relations Iran and Turkey are very
natural trading partners
how many ran as energy turkey needs a
turkey as manufacturing the only round
EADS and so far at least they have not
this is conte this problems as tensions
but as far as I can see they're still
moving slowly toward some kind of
accommodation and if turkey accommodates
to around its it'll do the same with
Shiite regions in Iraq so I don't see
that that's necessarily a reason for
hope for the courage I think the point
you made before is the crucial one
turkey is very concerned that
independence in Iraq in northern Iraq
and the Iraqi Kurdistan would encourage
similar tendencies within southeastern
Turkey that's the real problem where of
course the bulk of the Kurdish
population but well one could say by all
of these social media with the help of
social media and all of those
developments and the people have been
have having been empowered and and even
even if the Kurds in Turkey and the
people want to have some sort of
independence I mean what can they go
doing today's in today's world right
just what they're doing all over the
place in Saudi Arabia they just crushed
it in Egypt it's it's been constrained
you know the the previous regime is
still pretty much in power the
dictatorship had a kind of a informal
relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood
technically they repressed it but they
also were somewhat integrated with it
the Muslim Brotherhood has
socio-economic policies that are that
conform to the goals of the Western
powers in the United States and that
could very well I mean they're likely
takeover of the political system at
least in the short run would be
acceptable I think to the United States
and its allies and would sustain the
neoliberal program that in fact was the
lot of the object of the uprising always
took pretty harsh conditions for the
large majority technically there was
economic growth but very narrowly
concentrated stagnation are worse for
the majority reduction of benefits
credible corruption those are the usual
consequences of the neoliberal programs
even to the extent that they're applied
in the West it's sort of similar and
that's probably going to remain in place
and if that's true the US will Allies
will support it and use it to contain
what they regard as radical elements I
mean the Western powers face a real
problem in the Arab world they cannot
permit democracy they've got to do
everything they can to repress authentic
democratic velv risings that is a very
simple reason for that in fact you can
find figure to find the reason just by
looking at the
opinion there are regular opinion polls
throughout the Arab world done by
Western polling agencies us ones a
recent one by the Center for Research
and Qatar and they will come out about
the same way at the population in the
Arab world as distinct from the
dictators regards the main threat they
face as the United States and Israel
they don't regard around as a threat
didn't like it ran but they don't regard
as a threat and in fact considerable
majority even I think the region would
be more secure if Iran had nuclear
weapons well the United States certainly
doesn't want attitudes like that
exemplified in government policies but
that's what democracy means I would like
to move back to Iraqi Kurdistan in in
the period after the us-led invasion of
Iraq in 2003 there have been significant
oil was where reserve was discovered by
the Iraqi Kurds and they have signed
dozens of oil contracts with giant
international companies including Exxon
Mobil and of the United States and total
of total of France do there's the
presence of these companies in Kurdistan
boost the boost the position of the
Iraqi Kurds to secede from Iraq there
what kind of role does oil today oil has
a complicated rule that countries that
are there's a phenomenon known in the
international relations literature is
the resource curse when a country
depends on X port of a primary commodity
like oil there's some quite standard
tendencies that follow that one is high
concentration of wealth
another is undermining of production and
development in
domains currency Rises it's hard to
export easier to import some sort of
crushes independent development you see
this all over and it's probable that
that would happen in concentration of
wealth the corruption undermining of
independent production and development I
suspect that the same tendencies would
develop in a independent Iraqi Kurdistan
and in addition it would have the
problem that it is surrounded pretty
much by hostile neighbors but like the
president of the giant companies means
that these companies have big interest
in Iraqi Kurdistan but but but a country
like Turkey would not simply attack
Kurdistan when there are huge companies
investing there that's not so clear if
turkey wanted to attack it the huge
companies wouldn't do anything about it
they would accommodate companies you
know they're very powerful but they're
really not independent agent so take the
US relations with Iran it's a striking
case the major US energy corporations
like ExxonMobil they would be delighted
to be able to enter it ran and exploit
its huge energy resources but they're
barred by state power which means that
they have to sit there and watch well
China other others get the advantage and
that's happened before that so for
example in 1953 when the US and Britain
overthrew the parliamentary government
in Iran the United States wanted to
displace England that was a general
process over those years of the United
States displacing England I mean
throughout the former British Empire
included Iran
so Washington wanted the American oil
companies to take 40% of the Iranian
concession they didn't want to and the
reason they didn't want to is that it
would they could get much they had much
more profitable operations in Saudi
Arabia and if they were to move into
Iran as Washington one of them too would
probably cost them so they objected and
the US government - simply forced them
to it threatened antitrust suits other
measures that are the government can
apply so the companies went along it
happens other places in the world - that
takes a Cuba American energy
corporations pharmaceutical corporations
agribusiness want to normalize relations
with Cuba as does the majority of the
American population government won't
permit it
so it's certainly true that the energy
corporations are very significant and
powerful but not all powerful they are
compelled to accommodate to state power
even if when you look closely it may be
oil company executives in the White
House and State Department who are
ordering them to do these things the
concerns of an individual as the CEO of
a corporation can be quite different
from the concerns of that same
individual in a high position in the
State Department or the National
Security Council moving from this all
rich regions to Turkey where there is
pretty much no oil for the country the
economy to depend on I mean this has
allowed Turkey through to definitely
progress economically but politically
there has been so much so many ups and
downs visibly the Kurdish question in
Turkey even after the coming to power of
reject ever Lohani AK Party and it's an
Islamist leaning for political party
just be enrolling for almost more than a
decade I mean the Kurds are a different
promise to solve the Kurdish question
but the Kurds are not seeing much
development
what's the contrary I mean what happened
in the last ten years
about by the end of the 90s it was
monsters but the first time I went that
year back here was I think about ten
years ago and the people were living in
caves
I mean Turkish security officers all
over the place if my guides who were
Turkish dissidents and human-rights
watch people if if they noticed children
playing in the streets of the our
buckaroos children who had their clothes
the combination of colors of their
clothes were the Kurdish colors they'd
steer us in a different direction
because of the consequences that would
follow for the parents once we left and
it was pretty ugly and this was the end
of the horrible period of repression you
know tens of thousands of people killed
the thousands of villagers destroyed the
millions of refugees and so on the
following here is it improved and
through not to become marvelous but in
the early years of this millennium that
was improving that was a more latitude
for the use of Kurdish more openness for
Kurdish customs and practices and the
repression clearly reduced but in the
last year or two it's been going
backwards now there's thousands of
Kurdish activists in jail a very pretty
harsh repression of journalists and
academics but also of the general
population and we don't really know
where that's going that trajectory right
now is not good I think I was there just
a couple of months ago for freedom of
speech conference in Istanbul and one of
the main issues was the renewed
repression of the Kurdish population as
a result of this continued reproduction
by the Turkish state we have the PKK a
Kurdish an Workers Party it's an armed
and guerrilla movement in the mountains
of northern Iraq and it's been in a
bloody struggle with
for over three four decades and it's
literally jailed in Turkey as you know
Abdullah Ocalan now when people talk of
the solution the resolution of the
Kurdish question in Turkey some people
say it's impossible to resolve this
issue without the participation of the
PKK or or Jolla how do you view this can
we solve the Kurdish issue if we don't
bring in this guerrillas into the
discussions the concept of bringing in
the guerrillas is kind of ambiguous
they can the political the Kurdish
political parties to a certain extent
are a cover for the PKK and it kind of
functioned in that way it happens
repeatedly so say el salvador
there was a guerrilla organization FMLN
which the US fought bitterly against i
mean i'll saw that there was a
monstrosity in the 1980s with the US
backed war against the guerrillas they
are now and they now have political
power there are ways of changing these
things you know the things things
developing so that I mean take say
Israel Israel was the Israeli government
you go back to the 1940s it was based on
significantly on major terrorist groups
I mean by 1980 after the State of Israel
was established literally the three top
positions in the Israeli government
that's the Prime Minister the Foreign
Secretary and the head of the Jewish
Agency non-governmental scientists
organization all three of them were
former terrorists one of them had been
jailed by the British and the others
would have been if they had been caught
you know but that was the government so
lots of things can happen to as a
guerrilla movement
in the right circumstances it makes it
transition to being a political
organization which happened in Guatemala
it's happened and could happen in
Colombia hasn't yet and in many other
places I mean I take the president of
Brazil right now she was jailed as under
the dictatorship and now charged with
terrorism meaning opposing the
dictatorship if you go back to Iraq as
we're running out of time I mean under
decades of sunni-led governments in Iraq
the genocide was carried out against the
Kurds chemical weapons were used
thousands of villages were razed to the
ground including my village but since
2003 the Sunnis have have been
marginalised that she has have come to
power can I mean should the Kurds fear
that a shia-led government might be as
as bad as a Sunni narrator should always
remember their famous slowed them that
the Kurds have no friends except the
mountains sure they should fear it and
in fact if you look at I mean you look
at the role of the United States which
is overwhelming anywhere in the world
and certainly here in the 1980s as the
Reagan administration supported Saddam
Hussein strongly I thought he was taken
off the terrorists list in 1982 the US
could provide him with arms when the Al
Anfal Massacre and chemical warfare took
place the US government officially
denied it blamed it on Iran would not
permit Congress even to make more than
symbolic objections in 1980 not and the
u.s. pretty much won the war for the
iraq-iran war for it so though by 1989
after the war was over this is now
George Bush number one as president he
actually invited Iraqi nuclear engineers
to come to the United States for
advanced training in nuclear weapons
development now nobody talks about that
now because a couple of months later you
know they change their policy but you
know the government's don't have they're
not moral agents they pursue their
interest they can switch 180 degrees
happened over and over and the American
US invasion us-british invasion of Iraq
was pretty much a failure they didn't
achieve their their goals and there was
a significant defeat and that was in the
sense that the real winner of the
invasion was Iran
extended its influence to Shiite Iraq
what will happen next
and how the outside powers will react
depends on their calculation of
interests the record shows very clearly
how easily this can change i'ma take
what happened in Iraq in the 1970s with
with the repression of the Kurds
the us-supported uprisings that when the
Iraq made a deal with the Shah
he was stood by quietly when the Kurds
were massacred that's when Henry
Kissinger made his famous statement that
they shouldn't confuse foreign policy
with missionary work in other words
we'll do what we want for our own
interest but it seemed that the Western
powers have tend to be tend to become
supporters of the Kurds for the moment
in some places like for example in Iraqi
Kurdistan the Western powers have been
supporters of the Kurds in Turkish
Kurdistan during the 90s the period of
the by far the worst repression Clinton
wasn't in the United States was ending
80% of the arms and other Germany others
were providing arms to the government in
fact if you take a look closely as the
atrocities against the Kurds increased
in the 90s the u.s. armed flow increase
to the extent that turkey became the
leading recipient of US arms anywhere in
the world apart from Israel and Egypt
which are kind of a separate category in
fact in one year 1997 that Clinton sent
more arms to Turkey than in the entire
Cold War period combined up to the onset
of the counter insurgency at the same
time they were supporting Iraqi Kurds
you just can't look at you know you
can't look at history and believe that
governments act out of a kind of moral
commitment and the Kurds have a history
which demonstrates this with horrible
reality professor Chomsky thank you so
much for this opportunity you really
appreciate your time and your thoughts
are really valuable for us it's really
pleasure
you
