there's an enormous amount of money and
effort goes into this it's not the only
thing but any means there's a lot of
other reasons why the United States is
so unusual in this respect but this is
one of them and it's used I mean whether
that's the source or not it's certainly
used you know always so another
technique of trying to create the
marginalization of people the removing
people from the actual social and
political struggles that might make
their lives better you know maybe they
and to keep them from working with one
another by dividing mouth in all sorts
of ways and in a myriad techniques you
know find the fashion to keep the hated
masses with out of the public arena
where they don't belong and certainly
out of anything having do with control
of the economic system where it's
unthinkable that they should have a role
that's got to be in the hands of private
tyrannous that's unquestionable where
the United States has acted
internationally it's the same way you
look at the trail of intervention it's
almost always the same not just
third-world countries for example like I
just came back from Italy okay you may
not know this but Italy was the target
of the major CIA activities since its
origins the internal record runs dry
around the mid 70s so Donald can't say
after that but from the origin of the
CIA in 1947 up to at least the mid 70s
Italy seems to have been targeted more
than any other country in an effort to
undermine Italian democracy Italy was
regarded as sort of a third semi third
world country had a very strong labor
movement and when the American army in
fact the American British Army's what
they did what they called liberating
italy in 1943-44 they were appalled to
discover that northern Italy had been
liberated by the resistance which had
established functioning society with
very strong labor control the resistance
was mostly labor and peasant based they
held off the Germans had liberated most
of the place
they had instituted labor worker
management in factories they had thrown
out what were called the what these
Americans and British they had they were
protecting workers but they call you I'm
now speaking for the terminology of the
u.s. British documents they were keeping
useless workers and throwing out
arbitrarily dismissing owners and bosses
and that's of course intolerable and the
system was functioning I further than
where they were focusing on unemployment
which was recognized was Italy's major
problem but that's their problem not our
prob our problem is to restore the
traditional structure which meant
traditional hierarchies actually it
meant restoring fascist structures and
fascist collaborators and so on and our
big effort was made to do that and it
was did not entirely successful by 1948
when the first election took place it
looked as if Labour based forces would
probably win and a huge effort went into
trying to ensure that that wouldn't
happen by withholding food Italy was
starving by restoring the police to
fascist control by all sorts of threats
and manipulation pretty big operation
and the first major CIA operation among
others and they took it really seriously
again something you would learn in a
free society is this thing called the
National Security Council you know which
the main planning outfit which publishes
doesn't publish but it produces
documents top-level planning documents
which are among not the only important
ones but among the most important ones
they tend to get released maybe 35 years
later so you can look back at them so we
have them now from the late 40s and the
first one NSC one 1947 is devoted to
Italy and it calls for it says you know
we're going to try all these measures to
ensure that Italy doesn't have a free
democratic government which would have
don't say it this way but what amounts
do that which in which there'd be a big
role for the organized working class in
Italy but and they say but if this
doesn't work you know if
the Communists as they call them which
means in fact a lot of work Nam units
but if the Communists come to power
through a legal vote through a legal
election then the United States is going
to declare a national emergency and is
going to support military activities
inside Italy to overthrow the
democratically elected government that's
how seriously they took it back in 1947
they also knew exactly why the
Communists were powerful on you read it
in the records extensively because they
were honest because they were supporting
working class interests it's true that
they were collaborationists they weren't
trying to separate Italy from the
Western alliance or anything but they
were defending working class interests
and people supported and I had a mass
based working class party there were
plenty of others besides communists but
they had to be prevented either by
coercion likes a withholding food and
violence or if that didn't work by
direct intervention military
intervention that was taken very
seriously and in fact it goes up to the
prison how is it the wealthy tin will
pull the wool over the eyes of the
American worker by controlling the power
and government and using it against the
working public using against slavery
well take right now let's say as an
example there's a couple days ago I
don't know if your father I put myself
through the pain of reading the New York
Times every day for some masochistic
reason which I won't try to explain but
the the they've got a you know their big
chief correspondence or the main thinker
is a guy named Thomas Friedman who had
an article through four days ago in
which he big think piece in which he
said well he said the Cold War's over so
you know the breakdown isn't hawks and
doves anymore we have to have some new
breakdown and he said the new breakdown
he says there's two one is between
integrationists and
the other term I forget you know aunty
integration is that means people are in
favor of more globalization and what
they call free trade which isn't free
trade and you know all that kind of
stuff and people who want to slow it
down or end it that's one break and the
other is between people who are in favor
of a safety net and those who think that
everybody autumn you know be on your own
and get what you can okay so those are
the two ways people break up that gives
you four possible types of people right
two of them he sort of dismisses as
lunatics so there's this apathy stays in
ross perot they fit into two of those
boxes the other two boxes are sort of
saying people clinton and gingrich and
i'll put aside gingrich Clinton but
Gingrich and gets right to your point I
think Gingrich is put in the corner that
says integrationist and that will take
the hindmost you know everybody for
themselves well that's testable you know
it's testable that that's Gingrich is
positioned for example on the question
of whether gingrich's and integrationist
like in favor free trade we can ask how
he reacted when the Reagan
administration instituted the greatest
wave of protectionism since the 1930s I
that's just straight protectionism
alongside of huge increase in public
subsidies to private power to industry
along with say the biggest
nationalization in American history to
take over continental Illinois bank and
so on and so forth that's all radically
an integrationist okay I hadn't inger to
react we can ask that question answer is
he thought it's great
