you asked us after September 11 one of
your points we got to look in the mirror
we being America or the West it a look
in the mirror at our own was that a way
of saying look people like bin Laden are
angry at us for good reason in other
words is there a way to justify what I
was saying the statement of mine that
you just quoted is a very conservative
statement in fact it was articulated by
George Bush's favorite philosopher Jesus
Christ who pointed out famously defined
the notion hypocrite a hypocrite is a
person who focuses on the other fellows
crimes and refuses to look at his own
that's the definition of hypocrite by
George Bush's favorite philosopher when
I repeat that I'm not taking a radical
position I'm saying which is just
elementary morality but even if he is a
hypocrite and they not Haiti everyone ok
even and you let me ask another question
see if this here's an experiment try to
find a phrase in the massive commentary
on September 11th which is not
hypocritical in the sense of George
Bush's favorite philosopher fine one
phrase all right but I don't think you
can do it ok but before I don't want to
get Gnostic here and and religious on it
but I do what this is not religion this
is elementary morality if people cannot
rise to the level of applying to
ourselves the same standards we apply to
others they have no right to talk about
right and wrong they're good but let's
talk about even in right and look
there's nobody pure but an argument has
been made I know that the US has
committed atrocities however they did a
more brutal regime the Taliban there
wasn't even worried there wasn't even
warrant when people were in but is that
a moral thing to do they did get rid of
a brutal regime their run celebration ok
good fine I let him bomb Israel and get
rid of the brutal regime there let them
bomb was Becca Stein and get rid of
regime they say the Taliban Israeli
government are the same no they're not
the same their brutal regimes but let's
go back a stage the goal was not to oust
the Taliban that was not a warring that
was a war aim that was picked up several
weeks after the bombing started okay all
right let's go back
suppose that we and there doesn't a
cyclist long list of brutal regimes
around the world which ought to be
overthrown but knocked by somebody
bombing them however let's go back to
the late late October when the after
three weeks of bombing when the US and
its British client decided to shift the
war aims to overthrowing the Taliban
regime there was a meeting sponsored by
the United States in Peshawar Pakistan
of a thousand Afghan leaders they
unanimously condemned the bombing and
said it was undermining their efforts
which they thought could succeed to
overthrow the Taliban regime from within
the u.s. is doing it just to show off
their muscle I know you want to so the
question of whether to overthrow a
regime eeeh that arises and I think the
Afghans are right regimes should be
overthrown from within and in this case
it was probably very likely that that
would succeed it was a small brutal
group highly unpopular plenty of
opposition to it which could have been
organized from within and that's the way
to overthrow regime if we want to
overthrow the regime of Uzbekistan now a
great favor but it happens to be not
very different from the Taliban the way
to do it would not be the bomb was
Beckett's done but to support internal
democratic forces and let them do it
and that generalizes around the world
now robert kaplan who writes about
foreign policy I spoke to him recently
about his book warrior politics and I
put some of your points to him he said
about the distinction between the
terrorist States you call Israel you
know America and and the terrorist
States that America calls the Taliban he
said I wish Noam Chomsky had been with
me in Romania in the 70s or the 80s just
one of the seven or eight warsaw states
with just one of the seven or eight
prison systems with 700,000 political
prisoners adult choice of foreign policy
as
distinctions the argument that Chomsky
makes has no distinctions because
there's a difference between the
quantity and the kind of dictators that
America supported and the quantity and
the kind of things we went in in Kanye's
world for 44 years so let's take his
example I am
Ceausescu hideous regime yeah which he
forgot to tell you the United States
supported I supported right till the end
as did Britain so the example that he
gave is a perfect example and it's a
small example because we support much
more brutal regimes but Suharto was one
of the worst killers and torturers of
the late 20th century the United States
and Britain supported him throughout
he's our kind of guy as the Clinton
administration said in 1995 a horrible
atrocity is in fact you know when he
came into office in 1965 with a coup the
CIA compared it to Hitler Stalin and now
it led to total euphoria in the United
States and Britain massive support when
he carried out even worse atrocity
comparable atrocities elsewhere the
couple of you know hundreds of thousand
people killed then hundreds of thousands
later
full support continued right through the
end of his rule in fact continued past
his rule in late 1999 when they were
rampaging and destroying what was left
of East Timor the US and Britain
continued to support him and I can
continue through the world like this I
mean what Catalans Kaplan says that that
there is a distinction that everyone's
got some blood of their hands but he
says ah we have significantly less blood
because what we are soft imperialist
really state terrorists so like when we
supported his example Ceausescu in
romania right to the end that's good how
about killing several million people in
Vietnam how about killing hundreds of
thousands of people in Central America
in the 80s leaving four countries
devastated beyond you know beyond they
may be beyond recovery look nor does it
disqualify Ben that the fact that this
quality that bin Laden is a terror
or that say the Taliban or terrorist
state that fact doesn't disqualify them
from bombing Washington what
disqualifies from doing that is even
even they were mama Gandhi they
shouldn't do it
Kaplan's can't understand trivialities
the triviality here is that nobody's
competi altra right-wing jingoist slike
kaplan is comparing atrocities by
various countries
what honest people are saying this seems
to be incomprehensible is that we should
keep to the elementary moral level of
the Gospels we should pay attention to
our own crimes and stop committing them
this would be true even if we were
killing one person okay and it's even
more true when we're killing millions of
people let's bring it to the bigger
picture than just because it the
question he says we all agree with the
gospel this is a nasty if you leave
people alone they'll kill each other
yeah and that's why what you need was he
caused is an organizing hegemon of
overwhelming power which it always does
yeah which is always asked he's right
because we and why is it us because we
have the power and we have a massively
subservient intellectual class of which
is an illustration which will support us
atrocities no matter how awful they are
is realpolitik that shows off in another
land with his gospel that he says we
look not sweet forget gospel I'm talking
about the most elementary morality if a
person doesn't understand that they have
no right to talk okay if you don't
understand that you pay attention to
your own crimes you have no right to
talk he talks about Machiavellian
virtues sometimes we do a bad thing to
protect our democratic and our good
institutions and the justices and how
are we protecting our democratic
institutions by supporting mass
slaughter in southeastern Turkey in the
last few years without supporting our
democratic institutions was it
supporting our democratic institutions
not ours but anybody would Kaplan argue
that the nation state has a right to use
any means necessary to protect its
sovereignty oh then then he's justifying
the
she's saying Malaysia bitch had any
other right to anything he wanted to
repress the customers and Albanians that
reasoning do we needs a Constabulary a
force a central force in this case its
American in America because it's a
superpower to sometimes use unjust means
in the service of just causes what are
the just causes what was the Just Cause
in for example slaughtering Kurds in
southeastern Turkey what was it just
cause I can what was the Just Cause in
supporting Suharto when he wiped when he
killed a couple hundred thousand
landless peasants in Indonesia went on
to become one of the biggest torturers
in the world and then destroyed
slaughtered a third of the population of
East Timor what was it just cause what
was it just cause when we invaded South
Vietnam forty years ago this is the 40th
anniversary of the public announcement
of the u.s. attack on South Vietnam
ending up killing millions of people
leaving the country devastated is still
dying from chemical warfare what was the
Just Cause what was it just cause when
we fought a war to a large extent
against the Catholic Church in Central
America in the 1980s killing hundreds of
thousands of people every imaginable
kind of torture and devastation what was
the Just Cause can I continue yeah we
were the Just Cause for people like
Kaplan is we did it therefore it's a
Just Cause you can read that in the Nazi
archives to says we've seen the enemy
and the enemy isn't us it's the Islamic
fascists theirs into fascism there and I
don't want to live with them we don't
want to negotiate them we must destroy
them ergo the war against the Taliban
justified the war against the al-aqsa
brigades justified I mean he has a
different distinction but we see the
face of the enemy and we should do
anything to root them out how do you
respond to that argument on to that by
saying that there are many evil forces
in the world if we want to stop
atrocities I think it's a great idea to
reduce the level of atrocities and
violence around the world the easiest
way to do it simplest is to stop
participating in it if we stop
participating in it we will already
reduce the level of a trial atrocities
in life
enormous ly and if we can ever reach the
moral level minimum moral level of
terminating our own massive
participation and atrocities then we can
move to another question of what we do
about the atrocities of others and I
think there I think that it's right to
deal with them yes there is an enemy
there are people who carried out crimes
against humanity and there are ways to
deal with crimes not by a bombing
another country and putting millions of
people at the risk of starvation that's
not a way to deal with crimes when the
US was condemned for international
terrorism in Nicaragua and then vetoed a
security hadn't dismissed the
condemnation by the world court of
course and escalated the crimes and
vetoed a Security Council resolution
calling up on it to observe
international law the right reaction for
Nicaragua was not to say we have seen
the enemy and we must destroy them so
therefore let's set off bombs in
Washington but if it's wrong for them
it's wrong for us again by elementary
moral standards so we should ask well
what was right for them and what's right
for and which would be right for us and
I think they couldn't do what was right
for them because we blocked it we're too
powerful but we could do what was right
for them and we never even considered it
because we don't rise to that minimal
moral level
