[Music]
Angela look at this line what do you
expect out of tonight well it's great to
see such a big crowd Noam Chomsky always
turns out a great crowd of folks eager
to hear his latest insights and analysis
about the many pressing crises facing
our country and our world tonight he'll
be talking on the theme of extinction or
internationalism with a real focus on
the climate crisis the multiple ways it
affects us all and implicates us all as
well as the threat of nuclear
proliferation and I expect that
questions from the crowd gathered
tonight and we've got more than 25
grassroots organizations who've come
together tonight to co-sponsor this
event so I'm pleased to be here in
solidarity with those organizations to
welcome folks to the events and to you
know hopefully make sure things run
smoothly and that we have a really
powerful productive conversation that
will compel us all to deepen and
strengthen and sustain our activism we
have a couple of book tours that we are
promoting one is Medea Benjamin and
she's going to be in town talking about
the u.s. Saudi Arabia alliance and the
destructive aspects of it as well as the
war in Yemen which the course is causing
such terrible tragedies and casualties
we also have a a program where we're
sponsoring the leader of the nonviolent
resistance in Palestine we are working
hard to fight new gas pipelines and
fight for clean energy really trying to
move towards the Massachusetts that has
100 percent clean energy for all and
we're also trying to support efforts for
indigenous rights here in Boston there's
an effort to push the city of Boston to
recognize indigenous peoples day we
really see that as deeply connected to
the fight that indigenous folks are
leading against the Dakota access
pipeline as well as obviously being part
of the climate fight we help a lot of
local community outlets with the kind of
media they can't afford to make any more
long-form print stuff podcasts were
doing a lot of multimedia stuff columns
so we're kind of like instead of
starting our own thing we're supporting
the infrastructure that's out there
Vicki Roz bomb I'm on the board of
directors of Haiti project we're a
non-profit we've been around since the
early 90s in rural Haiti and we have a
woman sewing cooperative a woman's
health clinic and a library we employ
over 100 women all the profits go
directly to the women and they're able
to feed their children educate families
and we keep over 100 women employed how
were you all affected by the hurricane
we're in southwest Haiti it did hit our
area fairly hard a lot of people lost
their farms their housing we didn't have
any loss of lives in our specific
community of a couple thousand but in
the surrounding areas there was water is
a problem because of the flooding so we
were very much affected in terms of out
of their Economic Development it's
really awesome to have so many different
organizations grassroots locally based
movement building organizations right
here tonight as part of the event so as
you can see as people are coming in
they're stopping the tables signing up
for ways to get on people's email lists
and Action Alerts signing petitions and
postcards making donations to support
grassroots solidarity efforts so we hope
that people will find many pathways into
long-term activism by coming out to the
event here tonight we see the peace
movement is part of a broad social
justice movement so we're happy to be
here tonight with all of our collegial
organizations and allies
what is the Venezuela solidarity project
and why are you guys here tonight well
first first of all I say that the United
States has demonized Venezuela the right
they have established sanctions illegal
sanctions against Venezuela they have
defined it as a terrorist country and so
on and so forth and we know that that is
not the case we know that what they are
trying to do is change society for the
better so what we're doing is
people-to-people support solidarity with
those in Venezuela who are struggling
against the right wing so one of the
things that we are working on at this
moment is actually sending
we call a seeds of solidarity for
Venezuela and peace show this is our
main campaign of this very moment well
myth with corporate accountability
international we challenge transnational
corporations that threaten Public Health
human rights in the environment could
you give me an example
absolutely so today we're here
petitioning for our cake big polluters
out of climate policy what does your
table represent we're socialist
alternative we're sort of a National
Organization commit to the socialist
movement I think we've seen with this
election that we had Bernie Sanders
running as an open democratic socialist
and he was still able to garner thirteen
million votes so we're seeing sort of a
shifting in the tides a majority of
people would like to see the minimum
wage raised and other like socialist
ideas like that we don't feel socialism
is a dirty word anymore we just think
like it's basic human rights that we're
fighting for like a living wage women's
rights immigrant rights basic stuff that
like any American guy can get behind
even without the guise of the you know
the definition socialism what is the
color of water project color water
project is a project that is it's
designed to help the people of Boston
that believe in the human rights of
water that the United Nations had
declared that every human being has a
right to water so in Boston we find that
which the rate of shutoffs
in the communities of color and
low-income are much higher than in the
more affluent communities in white
communities good evening thank you so
much for being here tonight for such a
timely discussion it's an honor to
welcome you here and to see such a
strong vibrant gathering of so many
people dedicated to grassroots social
change for a more just and sustainable
future Noam is known worldwide as a
noted intellectual prolific author and
one of the most quoted people alive his
unique voice and peerless perspective
offers our movements much-needed Claire
and courage freeing us from the confines
of corporate media and political
propaganda and empowering us to come
together to build our collective power
this event has been organized to honor
Noam and to recognize his many
contributions to generating social
change tonight we have the opportunity
to hear his latest thinking given the
multiple crises affecting our local and
global communities the escalating
rhetoric of hatefulness and persistent
acts of racism misogyny and xenophobia
as well as the threat of Virant violent
backlash against rising popular
movements for justice including those on
indigenous land it is so easy to lose
heart to feel hopeless and to despair as
we gather we are grateful to have people
to turn to like Noam who consistently
strengthen our activism helping us
navigate the distressing times we're in
now with the guidance of his intellect
as well as his deep concern for our
common humanity and his belief in our
power to engage in transformative
resistance extinction and
internationalism have been linked in a
faithful embrace ever since the moment
when the threat of extinction became all
too realistic a concern August 6th 1945
today that will never be forgotten by
those who were alive then had their eyes
open they I personally remember very
well on that day we learned that human
intelligence had devised the means to
bring the human experiment of 200,000
years to an end
it was never seriously in doubt from the
first moment
that the capacity to destroy would
escalate and it would diffuse to other
hands increasing the threat of self
annihilation in the years that followed
the record of near misses is appalling
sometimes from accident and error a few
shocking cases from recklessness and the
threat is growing right now ominously a
review of the record that reveals
clearly that escape from catastrophe for
seventy years has been a near miracle
and such miracles that cannot be trusted
to perpetuate on that grim day in August
1945 humanity entered into a new era the
nuclear age it's one that's unlikely to
last long either
we will bring it to an end or it's
likely to bring us to an end it was
evident at once that any hope of
containing the demon that would require
international cooperation by the fall of
1945 a book calling for a world federal
government reached the top of the
bestseller lists written by Winston
Churchill's literary agent Emery Reeves
Albert Einstein was only one of those
who reacted at once by calling for world
government as what he called the
political answer to the shattering
events of August 1945 recognized to be a
turning point in human history perhaps
the opening of its final stage hopes
that the United Nations might begin to
fulfill that function were quickly
dashed it's an important topic in itself
no time to go into it here well it was
not understood at the time but a second
and no less critical new era was
beginning at the same time a new
geological epoch by now called the
Anthropocene
it's an epoch defined by extreme human
impact on the environment by now it's
understood that we're well into this new
epoch but there has been disagreement
among scientists about just when changes
became so extreme as to signal of the
onset of the Anthropocene a few months
ago the official working group on the
Anthropocene the official geological
group that works on it reached the
conclusion on the on the onset of the
epoch they recommended to the
International geological Congress that
the dawn of the Anthropocene should be
given the same date end of world war two
so according to their analysis then the
Anthropocene and the nuclear age
coincide it's a dual threat to the
perpetuation of organized human life
both threats are severe and imminent
it's widely recognized that we have
entered the period of the sixth mass
extinction the first the fifth
extinction 66 million years ago is
generally attributed to an asteroid huge
asteroid that hit the earth
destroying 75% of the species on earth
that ended the age of the dinosaurs
opened a way for the rise of small
mammals ultimately humans about 200,000
years ago and it hasn't taken us long to
bring about the sixth extinction which
is expected to be similar in scale
to the earlier ones the differing in an
instructive way in the mass extinctions
that long predated humans the body size
was not correlated with extinction it
was kind of an equal opportunity killer
independent of your body size but in the
human generated sixth extinction which
is now underway larger animals are being
killed disproportionately and that
actually extends a record that traces
back to our early proto-human ancestors
they were a predatory species that
caused significant harm to large
organisms white many of them out with
ourselves not too far in the distance
the human capacity to destroy one
another on a massive scale has not been
in doubt for a long time
reached a hideous peak in the past
century the working group on the
Anthropocene reaffirms the conclusion
that climate warming co2 emissions are
increasing in the atmosphere at the
fastest rate for 66 million years they
cite a report last July that particles
of co2 reached over 400 per million and
that the level is rising at a rate
unprecedented in the geological record
subsequent studies reveal that that
figure was not a fluctuation appears to
be permanent a base for further growth
and that figure 400 ppm has been
regarded as a critical danger point it's
perrolli close to the estimated level of
stability
of the huge Antarctic Ice Sheet and
collapse of the ice sheet that would
have catastrophic consequences for
sea-level these processes are already
underway quite ominously in the Arctic
regions regions and the broader picture
is no less ominous practically every
month breaks new temperature records
huge droughts are threatening survival
for hundreds of millions of people and
there are also factors in some of the
most horrendous conflicts Darfur and now
Syria
some 25 million people are displaced by
disasters such as floods and storms
every year that's predicted effect of
global warming that's one person every
second considerably more than those
fleeing from war and terror and the
numbers are bound to increase as sea
levels rise glaciers melt threatening
water supplies for vast numbers of
people the melting of the Himalayan
glaciers may eliminate the water supply
for South Asia several billion people in
Bangladesh alone the tens of millions
are expected to flee in coming decades
simply because of sea-level rise it's a
flat coastal plain that's a refugee
crisis that will make today's pale into
insignificance and it's barely the
beginning the with some justice
Bangladesh's leading climate scientists
said recently that these migrants should
have the right to move
to the countries from which all these
greenhouse gases are coming the millions
should be able to go to the United
States which raises a moral issue here
of no slight triviality well I won't
take time to review the larger record I
presume most of yeren pretty familiar
with it but it should be deeply alarming
to anyone concerned with the fate of the
species and the other species that we're
destroying with abandon and it's not in
the far future it's happening right now
it's going to escalate sharply it's
always been evident that any effective
measures to contain the threat of
environmental catastrophe would have to
be global in scope international efforts
to avert catastrophe have culminated so
far in the Paris negotiations of last
December cop21 they've just gone into
force a couple of weeks ago the date has
been accelerated by concern that a
Republican victory might dismantle what
has been achieved not very much but
something and in fact Republican
denialism has already had a significant
impact it was hoped that the Paris
negotiations would lead to a verifiable
treaty but that hope was abandoned
because the Republican Congress would
not accept any binding commitments so
what emerged was a voluntary agreement
evidently much weaker just a couple of
days ago a very significant agreement
was reached to phase down the use of
hydrofluorocarbons HFCS super polluting
greenhouse gases it's delayed for a time
for India and Pakistan where increasing
heat
awful poverty make cheap air
conditioners which use HFCS desperate
necessity and the right response is
evident the rich countries should
provide subsidies to accelerate the
provision of non HFC devices the kind we
use but nothing like that seems to have
been proposed and if it were its fate
would probably have been the same as
that of a verifiable treaty we might
stop for a moment to ponder a most
extraordinary fact a major political
organization in the most powerful
country in world history is quite
literally dedicated to the destruction
of much of life on earth and in every
possible way
accelerating the race to disaster so
when you consider the states the stakes
it's a fair question whether there's
ever been a more dangerous organization
in human history than today's Republican
Party it's a fair question
and I think the answer is pretty clear
so in the past few years there's been
extensive euphoric talk coverage of the
prospects for energy independence
hundred years of energy independence
with occasional comments on the local
impact of fracking but scarcely a word
pointing out that the euphoria amounts
to an enthusiastic call for the sixth
extinction to swallow us up as well
similarly the growing threat of nuclear
disaster which is real and severe barely
elicits a comment are the two most
important issues in all of human history
on which the fate of the species depends
are virtually missing from the extensive
commentary on the choice of leader for
the most powerful country in world
history and from the electoral
extravaganza itself not easy to find
words to capture the enormity of this
extraordinary blindness that perhaps
words like these lamenting the daring
depravity of the times as the stock
jabbers will become the Praetorian band
of the government at once its tools and
its tyrant bribed by its largesses
over owing it by clamors and
combinations well as you can tell from
the prose style that's not today
it's James Madison wondering about the
fate of the new democratic experiment
and not a bad description of the state
it's reached 225 years later from the
dawn of the nuclear age there have been
halting steps towards an international
response that could contain the threat
of nuclear war or better maybe terminate
the threat by eliminating these
monstrous devices one major step was the
non-proliferation treaty of 1969 in that
treaty the five nuclear States committed
themselves to what were called good
faith efforts to eliminate nuclear
weapons and other signers pledged not to
develop them three states with nuclear
weapons have refused to sign India
Pakistan Israel all three have benefited
in their nuclear weapons programs from
us support Pakistan during the Reagan
years India under Bush Israel ever since
a secret understand
which quickly became public between
President Nixon and Israeli prime
minister golda meir in 1969 well that's
bad enough but it could have been worse
in the 1970s Henry Kissinger Dick Cheney
Donald Rumsfeld other notables were
urging US universities primarily my own
MIT to aid Iran's nuclear programs at
the same time high Iranian officials all
the way up to the Shah were declaring
quite openly that their goal was to
develop nuclear weapons but that didn't
impede the efforts right after the Iraq
war the first George Bush as part of his
program of coddling his close friend
Saddam Hussein went as far as inviting
Iraqi nuclear engineers to the United
States for advanced training in weapons
production that was 1989 all of this is
better forgotten we don't hear anything
about it another international effort to
contain the threat has been the
establishment of nuclear weapons free
zones there is one in the Western
Hemisphere there are others in Africa
and in the Pacific
there are almost operative but not quite
they're still blocked by US refusal to
relinquish nuclear weapons in Jacob
Garcia and the Pacific Islands at the
most important case by far would be in
the Middle East that's an initiative
that's been led by the Arab states for
over 20 years and right now is spear
by Iran it would be the obvious way to
eliminate any threat anyone believes
might come from an Iranian nuclear
weapons program and strikingly Iran is
in the lead in the efforts to institute
a verifiable nuclear weapons-free zone
the United States and Britain have a
unique commitment to this initiative in
when they were attempting to concoct
some kind of pretext for invading Iraq
they appealed to a 1991 Security Council
resolution which banned nuclear weapons
in in the Middle East ignored was the
fact that the resolution explicitly
commits the United States and Britain to
work for a nuclear weapons free zone in
the Middle East the efforts to carry
this proposal forward have been
regularly blocked by Washington
transparently in an effort to prevent
Israel's nuclear arsenal from inspection
apart from its significance in itself a
failure to move forward on a nuclear
weapons-free zone in the Middle East
imperils the non-proliferation treaty
which is the most important of all arms
control treaties it has been
indefinitely extended but that
indefinite extension is conditioned on
pledges to establish a zone free of
weapons of mass destruction in the
Middle East but protecting Israel's
nuclear arsenal from inspection is
evidently a high enough priority so it
justifies a threat to the major arms
control treaty other facts that
unfortunately are not being discussed
well the goal of abolishing nuclear
weapons is not a utopian dream it's in
fact been forcefully advocated by quite
mainstream establishment figures among
them Ronald Reagan's Secretary of State
George Shultz former secretary former
senator Sam Nunn who was the Senators
leading specialist on nuclear weapons
for many years Henry Kissinger
that William Perry is one of the most
respected analysts long ex former
secretary defense long experience at
what he calls the nuclear bring the
these four were the four signers of an
op-ed in The Wall Street Journal which
called for elimination total elimination
of the scourge of nuclear weapons
another highly respected nuclear
securities expert Bruce Blair has formed
new organizations called global zero and
which calls for an international treaty
banning nuclear weapons the
International Court of Justice world
Court came pretty close to this stand in
a historic 1996 advisory opinion on the
legality of possessing of the threat or
use of nuclear weapons the United
Nations is considering a resolution to
launch negotiations on read the wording
a legally binding instrument to prohibit
nuclear weapons leading towards their
total elimination the resolution is
sponsored by Austria Brazil Ireland
Mexico Nigeria South Africa it's
expected to gain the support of more
than a hundred and twenty states but
without large-scale public support and
that's where your responsibility comes
in without that support
it'll pass into oblivion
just like other lost opportunities and
the same holds for the steps that should
be taken right now to reduce the
international tensions that are
escalating the threat of nuclear war -
quite dangerous dimensions this growing
threat has elicited considerable alarm
in national security circles so William
Perry and one of the most respected
analysts has warned in his words that we
are facing nuclear dangers today that
are in fact more likely to erupt into a
nuclear conflict than during the Cold
War
Perry is far from alone every year a
group of experts organized by the
Bulletin of Atomic Scientists updates
the Doomsday Clock that was established
in 1947 at the dawn of the nuclear age
midnight means terminal disaster for
everyone two years ago they moved the
clock three minutes
closer to midnight two minutes closer to
midnight to three minutes to midnight
where it remains that's the closest it's
been since the early 1980s when there
was a very serious war scare it's an
event that should be better known and
understood at that time the Reagan
administration launched an operation
operation Abel Alger Archer if you want
to look it up the operation was designed
to probe Russian defenses by simulating
attacks including nuclear attacks this
happened to be at a time of great
international tensions right then
advanced missiles Pershing to missiles
were being placed in Europe in fact in
Germany with a couple of minutes ten
minutes straight a flight time - two -
Russian territory the there were other
rising tensions at the time well a
couple of years ago some Russian
archives were Declassified and it was
learned that the Russians took Abel
Archer very seriously
there has been uncertainty however about
just what was understood in Washington
the CIA had claimed that the Russians
didn't pay any attention they knew it
was just an exercise
however newly declassified documents
just released have revealed that
Washington understood right away that
Abel Archer was bringing the world to
the verge of terminal war and they also
these newly declassified documents
reveal that US intelligence determined
that the Russians were mobilizing forces
as they put it to an unusual level of
alert according to protocol that meant
that the United States it should have
reacted in kind one hi US Air Force
officer Leonard for routes decided on
his own not to follow prescribed
procedures and to do nothing just to
forget it
very likely averting a terminal nuclear
war we already knew that
shortly after this Russian automated
systems detected an apparent massive
u.s. nuclear attack the officer in
charge stanislav petrov a also decided
to do nothing instead of transmitting
the information to a higher level
possibly triggering a massive nuclear
strike so these two gentlemen Leonard
Perutz
stanislav petrov belong on the honor
roll of people who've on their own
blocked terminal nuclear war they joined
a Vasili arkhipov a russian submarine
commander who in 1962 at the at a
dangerous moment of the Cuban Missile
Crisis decided again on his own to
countermand an order from Russian
submarines which were under attack
countermand an order to send off nuclear
tipped torpedoes which again very likely
would have escalated into terminal war
it's on such decisions that the fate of
civilization has relied all too
frequently in the nuclear age and it
cannot go on well today the Doomsday
Clock has been moved to three minutes to
midnight just as during the time of abel
archer the reasons given by the group of
experts were the growing threat of
nuclear war and also for the first time
the failure of governments to deal in a
serious way with the impending
environmental crisis the two major
threats to survival that initiated the
new era
immediately after world war ii the
primary nuclear threat today is at the
russian border both sides are engaged in
dangerous military buildups carrying out
highly provocative acts and also
expanding sharply there
hurry Arsenal's honor on the US side one
element is President Obama's proposal
for a trillion dollar upgrading of the
nuclear weapons system that includes new
nuclear weapons cruise missiles
nuclear-tipped that are recognized to be
particularly dangerous because they can
be scaled down to tactical battlefield
use which means I officer on the ground
would be tempted to use them something
that could quickly escalate to
full-scale nuclear war to Hillary
Clinton's credit in a secret
conversation that was leaked
she raised questions about whether this
should be continued and again popular
pressure can make a big difference also
highly provocative is an 800 billion
million dollar missile defense system
that Washington has recently installed
in Romania allegedly in defense against
non-existent Iranian missiles it's
recognized and it's of course aimed at
Russia obviously and it's recognized
that on all sides that what's called
missile defense insofar as it works at
all it's basically a first-strike weapon
might conceivably impede a retaliatory
strike so the Romanian installation is
highly threatening to Russia the wheat
of course never tolerate anything
remotely similar anywhere near our
borders the threat of war on the Russian
border is in part in large part an
outgrowth of NATO expansion since the
collapse of the Soviet Union 25 years
ago and that
and ought to elicit a good deal more
thought and discussion than it actually
does this was during the administration
of the first President Bush and his
Secretary of State James Baker and in
Russia
Mikhail Gorbachev you look back at that
time the two sides had conflicting
visions of the world order that should
arise with the disappearance of the
Soviet Union gorbachev called for a
dismantling of all military alliances of
course the Warsaw Pact disappeared to be
replaced by a unified a Eurasian
security system integrating the former
Soviet Union and Western Europe that was
Gorbachev vision a bush and Baker had a
different plan NATO would expand while
the Soviet system collapsed and that's
what happened the immediate issue was
joined over the fate of Germany for
obvious reasons Gorbachev agreed to
German unification even German accession
to NATO hostile military alliance which
is a pretty remarkable concession in the
light of recent history just in the past
century Germany alone had practically
destroyed Russia several times there was
however a quid pro quo namely NATO would
not extend one inch to the east was the
phrase that was used that meant East
Germany Bush and Baker agreed to that
compromise but only verbally it was a
gentlemen's agreement was not in writing
NATO immediately expanded to East
Germany but Bush and Baker correctly
stated that they were not violating a
written pledge
just the gentleman's agreement well
there's rich and interesting scholarly
literature which has been trying to
determine just what happened during that
period and there were some crucial open
questions like exactly what Bush and
Baker had in mind these questions have
been very persuasively answered in an
important way in a recent issue a couple
months ago of the MIT Harvard Journal
international security article by Joshua
it's go it's difference in' he did
extensive new archival studies and these
reveal quite persuasively that the bush
baker verbal commitments to gorbachev
were quite explicitly designed to
mislead gorbachev while US dominance
extended to the east it's an important
discovery shouldn't be hidden in a
scholarly journal well that was only the
first step under clinton nato expanded
further to the east right to the russian
border in 2008 and again in 2013 under
obama a nato even offered membership to
ukraine which is the russian
geopolitical heartland with long
historical cultural relations with
russia a highly provocative move george
kennan and other senior statesmen had
warned early on that right at the
beginning that NATO enlargement was as
canon put it a tragic mistake a policy
error of historic proportions and we're
now seeing the results it's contributing
to rising tensions on the russian border
that's the traditional invasion route
through which russia was virtually
destroyed twice in the past
century by Germany alone and the risk of
terminal war is not slight well
reflecting on these matters
a European historian good european
historian Richard sacra writes that
NATO's mission today is to manage the
risks created by its existence which is
in fact correct it meanwhile NATO's
official mission has been extended well
beyond the official mission is to
control the global energy system
pipelines sea lanes and unofficially to
serve as an intervention force under US
command as we've seen
well the fate of NATO shines a bright
light on the real nature of the Cold War
and its doctrinal basis NATO of course
had been presented as necessary to hold
off the Russian hordes we heard that for
50 years
1991 no more Russian hordes so what
happens to NATO actually what happens
provides no slight insight into it was
the actual operative policy for the
years before actually it supports an
observation by Harvard professor
government adviser Samuel Huntington 10
years earlier 8 1981 and his words you
may have to sell intervention or other
military action in such a way as to
create the misimpression that it is the
Soviet Union that you're fighting now
that's what the United States has done
ever since the Truman Doctrine in 1947
and as the clouds lifted in 1991 with
the collapse of the Soviet Union
are there evidence that bolster this
conclusion came but again it's kind of
hidden from the public though in fact in
the public domain so the Bush
administration first Bush administration
then in office of course immediately
developed the new national security
strategy a new defense budget and it was
interesting reading they said that the
huge military system must remain in
place and not to protect ourselves
against the Russians but because of what
they called the technological
sophistication of third world powers
than if you're a well disciplined
intellectual you don't laugh when you
read those words they also insisted that
it would be necessary to maintain what's
called the defense industrial base that
means the government supported system of
intervention in the economy through
places like MIT and others which creates
the high tech economy of the future and
quite interestingly they referred also
to the Middle East where they said we
must maintain intervention forces aimed
at the Middle East and then came this
interesting phrase in the Middle East
where the major problems that we faced
could not have been laid at the
Kremlin's door contrary to many decades
of lying all of that passed as usual
without comment as the Berlin Wall fell
in 1989 Samuel Huntington pursuing his
earlier logic warned that Gorbachev's
public relations may be as much a threat
to American interests in Europe as were
Brezhnev tanks and the threat of
Gorbachev's piece offers it was indeed
overcome in the manner just reviewed and
we're now facing the consequences well
humans are now facing the most critical
questions that have ever arisen in their
history questions that cannot be avoided
or deferred if there's to be any hope of
preserving let alone enhancing organized
human life on earth we surely cannot
expect systems of organized power state
or private systems to take appropriate
actions to address these crises not
unless they're compelled to do so by
constant dedicated popular mobilization
and activism a major task as always is
education given a couple of examples
before important ones I think and there
are plenty others efforts to develop a
public awareness and concern about the
nature and the enormity of the problems
we face and what their roots are
including in our own decisions and
there's a companion task the usual one
to confront the issues themselves that
can take many forms can draw from
contribute to the success of critical
educational initiatives our own country
is of course the most important case for
one reason because of its unique power
and influence and also for the simple
reason that it's our own it's here that
we can what we do can be most
influential and popular activism can be
highly influential that we've seen that
over and over the activist engagement
for 40 years has placed environmental
concerns on the agenda
of policymakers and not yet sufficiently
but nevertheless in crucial and
significant ways
the huge popular mobilization opposing
nuclear weapons development in the early
1980s was a major factor in terminating
the huge threats that arose at that time
actually paving the way for significant
if again only partial steps towards
reducing the major than the enormous
dangers that they pose and there are
many other illustrations of what can be
achieved by dedicated efforts to educate
to organize at the act and ways that are
based on public understanding public
commitment on the basis of what has been
achieved and that contribute actions
that contribute to deepening and
extending it and also many illustrations
of how the impact of popular movements
can be magnified if they find ways to
unify to integrate their commitments
which share common goals of peace and
justice there are to be sure difficult
barriers to overcome there are powerful
pressures that drive today's crucial
issues to the margins of concern and
discussion the determined also their
enormous impact on global society there
are also cultural and socio-political
problems of considerable significance
it's important to bear in mind that
although the United States has been the
richest country in the world for a long
time way back into the 19th century it
has always been a kind of cultural
backwater and that was true up until
World War two of course that changed
dramatically in the
post-war world but much of the profit
population remains where it was a
culturally traditional pre-modern in
many respects so for example for 40% of
the US population these crucial issues
of species survival are of very little
moment because Christ is returning to
earth within a couple of decades and
will all be settled only that's 40% of
the population two-thirds of the
Americans believe that global warming is
happening far fewer think that it's
caused by human activities only 40
percent are aware that in the words of
the polls most scientists think global
warming is happening and probably but
many fewer are aware that it's not most
scientists but an overwhelming consensus
and unfortunately if you look at the
polls over the past 10 or 15 years
awareness is not improving on the rising
threat of nuclear war and the reasons
for it on the consequences of resort to
nuclear weapons the available
information about public opinion is not
at all encouraging and meanwhile for the
victims of the neoliberal assault on the
population of the past generation as
short-term problems of just getting by
displace fundamental questions about the
fate of their children and grandchildren
so the tasks ahead are daunting and they
cannot be deferred
