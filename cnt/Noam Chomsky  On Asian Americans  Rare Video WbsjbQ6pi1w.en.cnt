hello my name is Jack Chen I'm a
historian at New York University and I'm
delighted to be interviewing Noam
Chomsky today we will be discussing
Asian American and Pacific Islander
issues both in terms of the growing
numbers of asian-americans and Pacific
Islanders in the United States and many
of them are at our college campuses but
also especially focusing on issues of
race its relationship to foreign policy
intercultural kinds of questions and
also questions of philosophy and
education so so no I was you know I
thought it'd be useful to maybe
contextualize a little bit you know I'm
sure at MIT but certainly at NYU and
places like Stony Brook here there are a
lot of asian-american students and many
of them are coming as you know the
children of recent immigrants Korean
Americans have a term for 1.5 hours 1.5
generation and it's my understanding
that also you're you you could be I
don't know if you would consider
yourself that way but in many ways
you're the child of immigrants and you
spoke do you speak Yiddish and parents
refused to let us speak you ah okay
as for different reasons however that's
because there was a in the Jewish
immigrant community that was kind of a
cult or Kampf going on at the time
between Yiddish diaspora oriented and
Hebrew paths in Palestine oriented or my
parents were on that side of course the
other whole groups they just wanted to
drop it all right
right so you spoke Hebrew then my I was
I didn't actually speak it but it was in
a Hebrew culture okay yeah learned it
right right well one of the interesting
questions about being a 1.5 or is that
people have some insight about more than
one culture they're immersed in a family
culture and also community oftentimes a
community culture which has its food
ways languages still immersed in
of very different oftentimes immigrant
you know experience and then they're
also engaged with various aspects of
kind of dominant US culture and so so
part of what I think is very interesting
now about Asian Americans were in this
country is that they're kind of
negotiating that Korean Americans in
particular I've talked about being
caught between cultures but it seems to
me that that's also a resource of
special insight really in critical
insight about the cultural difference
and and how cultures operate and what
the norms of different cultures are I'm
wondering if that's something that that
and determine how its treated I mean it
can be a way of enriching a society in a
culture or where it can be abandoned
many immigrant communities have tried to
suppress and abandon their traditional
roots and organize themselves and I
remember that very well and childhood in
fact went in both directions my parents
were really transplanted immigrant
community happened to be here but my
generation was trying to Americanize
itself in every way could you
was there something of an idea of an
American dream and with another matter
learning baseball statistics and making
sure you were as like the other kids and
even more more so than they were at the
same time keeping to the yellow pony
Hebrew school in the afternoon and so on
and so forth so it's kind of two
parallel universes which was pretty
common of Jewish kids back in the
thirties in the 40s right I'm wondering
if that's part of the reason for that
was there was plenty of any Semitism it
was rife so you just wanted to do you
sort of wanted to keep your identity not
too visible so the one hand you wanted
to kind of become American in terms of
identifying identifying with baseball
like the part of the kids on the street
right there I kind of want to share with
you maybe a few people that I've been
working with and because I think their
experiences in some ways embody the
tension of being caught between
different cultures and also clearly what
happens in Asia has affected them deeply
here it's also a process of discovering
what those meanings are last night at
the event I met a man who is in his 50s
he's Filipino America his father was in
the Philippines a supporter of Marcos he
himself was drafted during the Vietnam
War
and fought in the war and started
dealing with the fact that he wasn't
kind of a mainstream American in the
sense that soldiers were American
soldiers are starting to threaten him in
quo and racist names so he he was
telling me that he not only had to kind
of watch out who was in front of him but
also watch behind his back that's one
story the erga story is a PhD student of
mine who's Vietnamese and she was just
finishing up a PhD a couple years ago
when it was discovered that she had
ovarian cancer and it turns out that a
lot of Vietnamese children who came over
and she says she South Vietnamese now
could be a worker where it offended by
toxins yeah and that it's affected the
children even though they may have been
quite young when they left in a profound
no there's still new cases going on yeah
from Newton children born well after the
chemical warfare was terminated actually
extensive studies of it but they can't
be reported here or they won't because
they aren't reported at least many of
them done by American that public health
specialists and it was just a conference
and Hanoi a couple months ago in which a
leading us
researcher who was concerned with dioxin
did a report an extensive study that
they had done comparing the accident
it's only in South Vietnam that they
didn't use it in North Vietnam so kind
of ugly but to have control population
the he just compared the levels of
dioxin with levels of spring and of
course it coincided closely they also
found that dioxin levels were hundreds
of times as high as what's permitted
here in heavy spraying areas actually
Columbia University just published a
unit in the epidemiological Center I
just published a study in Nature British
science journal a couple weeks ago in
which they discovered that the actual
use of these chemicals was about 50
percent higher than what was reported
and so and there's extensive studies of
the effects there's new cases coming
along it's kind of and here there's
virtually no mention of it which is you
know you don't pay attention to your own
crimes right you know it's what's
interesting about these two examples but
also there are many more that we could
go on and on is that these are people
who have been deeply affected by war
violence u.s. foreign policy when it
come here they're also racialized in
very particular ways they oftentimes are
from our coast or South Vietnamese and
came you know with the support of the US
but then in this country they're they're
kind of treated in their boat then
especially the Philippines because goes
back a century but the Philippines were
very deeply colonized I'm to the extent
that sense of identity was lost in many
respects and they have to kind of
recover what they have to learn what
happened to them Vietnam more complex
because more reason to
many different currents and so on but
I'm taking it sport for Marcus I'm in
the u.s. it is a brutal corrupt dictator
the reagan-bush administration not only
supported and but expressed what they
called their love for him and they're
his they admired his love for democracy
George Bush Senior and so on and that
went on up to practically the day when
the military turned against him there
was a what they called people's power
would be which kind of spread over much
of the country and what the military was
really powerful was present at one point
this was that it was from March 1984 of
I remember the military turned against
him and the Reagan administration
instantly turned against it and this
video is pointing democratizing forces
but folks it is but then they begin
adding markers so people like that are
caught in a very complicated situation
in which they grew up with the support
of the United States supporting a
dictator and part of the dictatorial
system but then became quickly on the
other side where policy shifted almost
overnight and of course the racial
element is just constant no matter
what's the Vietnamese case is complex if
this is a South Vietnamese were she's
probably living in South Vietnam was
split there was a u.s. client regime
with the tone supporters and there was a
popular movement that was opposing it in
the south so it's kind of like France
during the German occupation
I mean Vichy France at playing a sport
it was running the country pretty much
by itself with the Germans in the
background the resistance had plenty of
supporters and in fact after the war
there were pretty serious reprisal
thousands of people here so that's
that's pretty common in countries that
are colonized part of them I think the
challenge of Asian American Studies and
that perspective that brings to let's
say American Studies in American history
is that you have people who have
migrated here who come out of these
experiences and obviously people don't
necessarily critically reflect on their
experiences some of them are escaping
and just kind of trying to assimilate in
a country as quickly as possible but in
their backgrounds and it was interesting
about this Filipino American man is that
he didn't really think about his
identity even after having been in
Vietnam and having had the experiences
he had until he had grandchildren and
then he began thinking about what was he
going to tell his grandchildren what
what identities what did where none of
that Philippines well such as not much
right because it was wiped out by
colonial experience virtually like them
I mean it was kept some circles of
course but for much of the population it
was just expressed many of the Filipinos
that I work with talk about the absence
of presence the absence of presence and
part of the challenge of doing the kind
of education on historical work they do
is to try to try to make something
tangible and real because it's all been
wiped out the archives are gone the
stories are kind of suppressed people
don't talk about the truth everywhere
and take say Korea as South Korea's
becoming democratized it's also bringing
up memories of things that happened
earlier which had been suppressed like
the Jeju Island Massacre which was never
discussed for years but now it's a big
issue on the island a conference that
every year they're trying to admit
spreading through the population what
happened
none of these issues that gets
suppressed for a long time actually
noticed this number places I happened in
Europe I happen to have brought what I
did go to both Spain and Greece shortly
after the dictatorships were overthrown
and the young people just had no idea
what the background was I mean if you
years later it's beginning to come out
but if you talked about what happened
there Barcelona in 1939 I mean I
remember it vividly but only people my
age the same agrees talk about the Greek
Civil War people my age remembered but
hadn't talked about it for years because
you just couldn't talk about those
things and their children so you have to
kind of recover a history was not that
far back in these cases saimin yeah one
of my students is taking one of our
courses and was reading a history book
and and there's a reference to it I
think as a Bruce Cummings history and
Chiodo was mentioned and she suddenly
realized that because her family was
from Jericho and her grandfather had
disappeared and died at a certain point
that was what had happened is that you
know it was a very powerful insight but
the family itself didn't talk about it
really referencing yet but I remembered
from my own childhood my parents never
talked about nice teacher as you my
mother was too young but my thought I
was there till he was 17 but it was just
missing you in dortmund so part of the
the kind of irony or difficulty of being
a migrant in this country is that on the
one hand you have that family experience
oftentimes but then it's also too
oftentimes erased or ignore and it
become these are all different
circumstances in the Korean and Filipino
Spanish Greek case I mean it was
suppressed in the home country under
dictatorships
military rule the fascist governments
and so on which may adds an extra layer
of difficulty to recovering it has to be
recovered in the home country which is
not so easy
Thanks you you write about the necessity
to develop a critical comprehension for
comprehension of reality I guess part of
what what's interesting about the Asian
American experience is that the
experiences are not self-evident but as
people begin to look into their own
family histories and their own
backgrounds this is where is that kind
of what you mean by the kind of work no
it's yeah and its particular specific
problems in the asian-american case and
that it in complicated ways in Asia
there are different parts of Asia
depending on what year it is are
demonized in in the United States to an
extreme extent and this goes way back it
goes varies depends who the Allies are
who the enemies are but it's kind of a
generalized demonization of Asians which
is differentiated much in the popular
culture even though it may be in policy
which just affects everyone on the one
hand will be a demonization of the bad
Asians but then there's always some kind
of group whether it's like Chinese or
Chapman Japanese Americans are Chinese
Americans from one moment to the next or
let's say in South Vietnam and those
were collaborators and therefore the
good it'd be nice but you know I think
in the popular in the general popular
culture these differentiations aren't
clear to people in fact that's important
to understand that the United States
itself is an extremely insular country
how many most people want to know
anything about the outside world and
they can't distinguish who you're for
and who you're against when I remember
take a recent case I had one of the one
of the major wars in the 1980s was
Nicaragua that they issue all over the
newspapers you couldn't miss it
everyone knew it's a huge issue
my wife and I were went down number of
times and Erica we had friends who
people who have college degrees
you know educated people who assumed
that we were visiting the countries the
reason is that the u.s. supports
governments and they know we're these
kind of crazy types of funny ideas so we
must be visiting the gorillas you know
this is the lead issue in their
newspapers may know which side the US
government was on just imagine if people
who join barely know where Asia is
they're trying to sort out who are the
friends and who were the enemies more
recently there are a lot of Asian
American students on campuses the Stern
School of Business at NYU for example is
5060 percent Asian Americans among their
students and the representation is that
from Asia or from Asian Americans Asian
Americans many of them 1.5 hours yes
yeah and there's a popular
representation especially among
neoconservatives of Asian Americans as
kind of a motto minority used as a way
to point to poor African Americans and
Latinos as well these are examples of a
minority and they've helped themselves
etc etc and you know how would I mean
how would you understand that in the
global context that
and there are striking differences that
they didn't come from the same
experiences Latinos and blacks the and
they ten it's kind of reminiscent of the
Jewish minorities tend to be education
oriented hard-working they're quiet
obedient and you don't pay attention the
splits within the community so who goes
down to the poor neighborhoods where
Asian Americans live but the ones who
make it to NYU do come from a education
oriented upward oriented community so
they can be held as you say as a kind of
weapon against other explain you do it
if they do it but which puts them in an
especially difficult position for living
it's not representative the
asian-american community what many of
them also come from backgrounds that's
in Korea where the the parents actually
enjoyed kind of american-style
education as it was instituted after the
war in South Korea same with Japan same
with Taiwan other places and so many
ways they're already very comfortable
with kind of western-style education and
oftentimes when we came to this country
they they sacrificed quite a bit for the
children because they were at a higher
professional level and then they end up
operating a greengrocer in the case of
many Korean Americans or your child goes
to NYU right now but the crowd goes down
with you and it puts a lot of pressure
as you can imagine on the children too
because the parents are expressing a
wealth you're sacrificing themselves for
the children the children then feel that
they need to honor their parents in that
love at the same time they feel the need
to become a part of American culture
stricka-- to strike out to get some
freedom from that kind of authority many
of these parents are fairly
authoritarian coming from authoritarian
governments and culture and cultures
yeah yeah
so what would you say I mean what would
you say to some students
cuz I can't they'll be level in their
lives I don't give advice to my own
children not if I did that I did they'd
be smart enough not to listen to well
how I mean maybe I should ask it a
different way which is if they're if
they're struggling to try to understand
some of that themselves many of them
will kind of work it out in terms of
this personal you know animosity or
rebellion against their parents but it
seems to me that they've really they've
really come out of a larger historical
moment post-war put post-world war two
Asia wars in Asia and they've got a
difficult relationship with this country
in this culture in many ways it could
turn out to be more difficult because
the the conflicts are simmering and
could blow up again I mean the potential
us-china conflict is right beneath the
surface u.s. planners regard China as a
serious potential enemy there's concern
but fulle Northeast Asia region might
strike out in its own - rich developing
region and those are likely to be
they're going to live with this problem
very likely they may take a more serious
form so I better figure out ways of
resolving them some economists are
projecting that in 2020 Chinese economy
will be the same size as the US economy
if it continues to grow obviously with
the SARS incidentally that's sorry so
actually I think one should see is
reflecting another sort of hidden
problem in China and that is that the
since the reforms are no sort of market
reforms have been taking place the a lot
of the socials of the sport system has
collapsed so the health system is pretty
long actually there's recently a study
done by a Harvard University here group
the Harvard Medical School and the
Beijing University or some university
they are Medical School trying to see if
I could give a realistic analysis of
growth rates in China if they took into
account the loss of support systems so
if you lose your health support system
and you have to do it yourself that's a
cost and it growth declines if you take
that in so they tried it's a tricky
study but they tried to do an estimate
and their figures were not impressive I
mean it by their analysis Chinese growth
rates were very low
if you took into account the collapse of
pension system support system health
systems and so on and I I strongly you
know China so secretly can't really
figure out what's going on very well and
the statistics are probably very dubious
but it's very likely I suspect that the
SARS concerns have to do with the
collapse of a preventive health system I
mean whatever one thinks about Maoist
China it had pretty successful health
outcomes actually there's it's
interesting the way this is dealt with
here the the main person who's studied
the economists have studied the famines
and social policy and their fact is a
March sn1 being Nobel Prize for this
work the very important work half of his
work is known the other half which is in
the same papers is not them what his
main studies so he and his colleague
dres compared China and India which is
good comparison I mean they both
colonized became independent same time
late 40s and they were sent you know
different countries large Pakistan
similar in many ways levels of
development so on well he he
one of his main contributions was
studying the main that terrible Chinese
famine in 1958 sixty when maybe 20
million people died big terrible famine
and he treats that as a political crime
basically an ideological crime it's not
that the center wanted to kill people
it's that they didn't get any
information totalitarian society you
don't get a flow of information up and
back and simply didn't know what was
happening the critical commentary and it
couldn't do anything about in India he
points out which is a capitalist
democratic society they did get
information so there were flows of
information on the back and criticism
and so on and India never suffered to
any such fountains after the British
were kicked out there are plenty of them
before but since independence had had a
major famine and this is the well-known
part of artisans work shows how awful
the Communist story take a look at the
same papers and the other half of the
paper it doesn't different analysis it
compares mortality rates in India and
China since independence burn China they
went way down because they instituted
rural health programs and barefoot
doctors and preventive medicine for the
huge overwhelmingly rural population in
India they did they followed capitalist
principles you know do anything for
people to do it on their own well turns
out that the death rates in India
declined much more slowly and if you
look at the gap I'll just quote their
own conclusion what they say is every
eight years India put as many skeletons
in its closet as China did during its
years of shame meaning during the period
that they studied 1947 the 1979 as a
hundred million extra deaths in India
we're not sprit II serious and that's
also they treat that as an ideological
crime to comes from government policies
and you could have carried out
preventive medicine and rural health
care and so on but they did
that half of the study is unknown
unreported for any sin gutters Nobel
Prize I answer you a single mention of
it and it's hard to miss it's in the
same papers in the same books but it
doesn't fit the requirement that's our
ideological crime even fit our
ideological requirements anyway going
back to China that system has been lost
and in fact their study San Andreas goes
a little beyond 79 and they say that a
very beginning of the reform period 79
the death rate started the decline slow
you know whether that continued I don't
know but if these facts are taken into
account gaiter of a different picture
and I strongly suspect that the Soraa
separate epidemic has to be looked at in
that context and there's concern that if
it spreads to the countryside where the
health support systems of freshly
collapse that could be a catastrophe
a part of which are playing out is that
usual indicators of economic development
don't take into account people's
well-being health care and there is an
effort with Ben BAE Hawk and Sen and
others to and it's now part of the UN
program to construct an annual Human
Development Index which is different
from the growth index and that it's
takes into account a few things like I
think literacy infant mortality maybe
one or two other things and if countries
are ranked in human development works
quite different from economic growth it
growth is a very funny notion that has
much to do with most of the population
and effect take Chinese growth the
Chinese China's growth statistics are
very high but to be serious about it
have to ask how much of it is foreign
owned birth right and it turns out if
you look at the real growth areas of
China plenty of its foreign investment
overseas Chinese Japanese US other
it's also very urban as opposed to more
it's very relieved that most of the
population is like 900 million people
out there who may be devastated if the
big question now in the world trade
system is whether China is going to
agree to open its to open its economy to
agricultural imports from the United
States in Europe well these are highly
subsidized technologically advanced
agribusiness exports which no peasant
Society and possibly compete with in on
the subsidies they're not support and so
on so I'll be right down
right but that means hundreds of
millions of people will be you know
testitude what happens to that they'll
become dependent on these are very good
the economy does whatever the producers
union and peasant agriculture happens to
be highly productive and very effective
but it cannot compete with subsidized
high tech agribusiness that's very
possible the same things happening in
Mexico that you get and in fact all over
the world you know peasant communities
are being devastated by the fact that
they can't although they may be highly
productive and they are in fact very
often when scientific agriculture is at
school comes into some third-world area
a production actually declines because
peasant agriculture which is the product
of centuries or millennia of development
to study
selection and picking developing seeds
and so on and so forth
turns out to be really productive I mean
people know this seeds you plant under
this rock because the Sun hits in the
afternoon and so on and so forth that's
all gone when you have scientific
usually monocrop
agriculture furthermore peasant the
peasant agriculture tradition though
it's very rich is unknown
the reason it's unknown is it's a
women's culture because for mother and
the daughter so you know in the right in
the society people are not what it is
the daughter knows what it is for sure
mother daughter you know and it develops
over long periods extremely rich and
extremely fragile
if you eliminate it it's gone
what there's also a move of let's say us
corporations to take let's say certain
varieties of basmati rice from local and
the traditions and had happen and fought
to modify them slightly force them back
under subsidized exports which destroys
the peasant society actually sometimes
more brutal than that I was in southern
Colombia not long ago or where in fact
chemical warfare is going on they call
it fumigation but just another form of
chemical warfare and what it's just
doing is destroying peasant communities
I'm it's driving peasants off the land
these again are rich at traditional
peasant communities with highly
complicated and rich agriculture but
it's an extremely fragile system one
generation is enough to kill it it's
closely connected to the in Colombia
turns out very rich biodiversity so it's
all integrated with that with the
biodiversity you'd also be destroyed by
chemical warfare and other operations
and you know you drive the peasants off
the land or what's called fumigation
they joined them several million people
rotting in urban slums mining companies
come in and strip-mine the mountains
once the these are indigenous people
campesinos afro-american I for
Colombians once they are away that
mining companies can come in freely the
drilling companies come in you can put a
dams flooding big areas for
hydroelectric power for
mythical free export sounds foreign
industries and the peasant society is
gone the lot of the biodiversity is
destroyed you end up with you know
violent a tremendous violence as you'd
expect that twenty political
assassinations a day by now and then as
far as the agricultural areas are
concerned what either the alternative
ranches for cattle or easing or anything
or else monocrop Agri export using the
monsanto genetically modified seeds
which will go them somewhere and a
creation of shanty towns and he's
extended or right and if you go after
the urban areas and so in fact the
people it's it's like many countries and
the people most of a lot of the
wealthier part of the population is
completely unaware I mean I've had
Colombian students who learned about
Colombia when it came here and they
heard people you know like me you know
who's giving talks about and they went
back it's very arrogance the other
corner of town I mean you know it's
plenty of people in downtown Manhattan
well exactly I don't know what's going
on a mile away right what do we know
about the homeless but it's not just a
home what's the way people live I mean
I've you know walk through parts of
Manhattan which look at the some of the
where sports or third world you just
don't see him at my same in blossoms in
everywhere on land children you know
didn't see really a poor person in a
serious sense till we happen to take
them to Tirana once and they were kind
of shocked they know people lived like
this well in fact they live like this
just a couple of miles away from where
we live but who sees their right we
recently were doing some teachings
around in Indonesia and looking at the
obviously Indonesia is where the largest
is the largest Islamic you know nation
in the world but also it's clearly a
kind of a an ongoing hot spot in terms
of us
global conglomerate interest so there's
gas and oil there's also the natural
resources of the forestry and their
indigenous which is a devastate and it's
being destroyed actually that most about
Asian exporters Thai others are just
wiping out the forest illegally other
words after the word of any quote
something like that it's illegal but now
Indonesia has laws about imprimatur
nobody's enforcing them and that kind of
act that's kind of like the destruction
of the Amazon you know it's very
dangerous they're being sold a pure one
and other places like that in the name
of kind of meant being able to have
middle-class access to liquor that
there's a kind of a background there
which is also it's amazing that it's
well striking that it's not known here I
mean the the the United States relations
to Indonesia pretty complex Indonesia
was a central focus of u.s. tension back
in the late 1940s in fact
Planning Commission's called of the
major issue in Asia in 1958 this is kind
of on public information but nobody
knows it the u.s. carried out the the
Eisenhower administration carried out
the largest clandestine subversive
operation in post-war history to try to
destroy Indonesia to break it up to
separate the outer islands they
supported a military role to strip the
outer islands away from Indonesia the
outer islands were most of the wealthy
resources and the reason was that the
Indonesian government was becoming too
independent which pillar the non-aligned
movement which was aided and also to
democratic the Indonesian government of
sort of an autocracy was allowing a
political party of the poor to function
and it was picking up support if you
look at the now be classic declassified
US records they're very concerned about
that they thought they were going to get
dominant support winning on quasi
democratic political system so therefore
that system had to be destroyed and
there was an attempt in 1958 to split it
up by force that didn't work us then
turned the supporting the generals by
1965 there was a military coup so hard
that crude which killed and nobody
noticed but maybe a million people in a
couple of months you know hundreds of
thousands certainly a huge massacre CIA
called it the one of the worst mass
murders of the 20th century comparable
does Stalin and Hitler
it was greeted with complete it was
reported accurately pretty accurately I
was greeted with total euphoria I mean
the Time magazine had a an issue which
had on the front cover something like
boiling bloodbath and then it just
reveled in this wonderful massacre of
hundreds of thousands of people I mean
it mostly landless peasants destroyed
the one political party mass based
political authority and opened the
country to foreign robbery for an
investment after that General Suharto
ranek compiled Martha must protest human
rights records in the world he was held
here as a wonderful person Clinton
administration described them as our
kind of guy they invaded East Timor with
enormous US support
carter administration that since wiped
out maybe a third of the population
they're pretty much depressed you know I
mean figured out if he looked but the
most nobody knows and that goes right on
to the 1999 finally the US has Suharto
lost his usefulness
he began dragging his feet on IMF orders
and he was sort of losing control of
population that was properly revoked
brewing a lot of it by students actually
a lot of it using the internet so one of
the first internet revolutions because
they could communicate around you know
the official system by 1998 the US was
giving up on support to
and you got a phone call from Madeline
Albright secretary of state saying the
u.s. believes it's time for a democratic
transition four hours later he resigned
and it's not cause and effect but it
does reflect the power relations try to
find some comment here's asking why they
hadn't had a democratic direct
democratic tradition since 1958 well no
that's part of history wiped out why did
why do you for you about one of the
biggest massacres and fitness in the
twentieth century which is insanely
entirely open you know it's a relative
you know all of that and what it means
is gone so when you thought about
Indonesia yes a lot of complicated
things and it's a little like the
Philippines a lot of Indonesian don't
know that this incorrect that because
there were hundreds and hundred thousand
political prisoners you know the major
writers in the country were in prison
and they couldn't where we could talk
about it you know it's and it's you know
you have to recover your own history and
historical understanding and put it in
the context of world affairs which is
not so simple yeah part of the pattern
of Asians in the US has been when the
u.s. is involved in a foreign policy
intervention of one kind or another then
and in some cases it's people who were
suppressed and actually are important
intellectuals you know coming here but
in any case arriving here and their
children settling here and arriving here
and then their children are really cut
off from any kind of understanding well
they were cut off in their own countries
because of the repressive regimes
sometimes really brutal ones when they
come here they find that history's going
they have to recover it but just like
young students here if they want to
understand anything about US history
they're going to have to discover it
it's not gonna be taught to them
squeezed right we really have about five
minutes left but I thought it'd be
useful to talk about one holding a
little bit in this context because in
many ways he's an example of that he's a
very successful kind of model minority
in a certain sense who who who came as a
foreign student married here had
children here became a naturalized
citizen became quite successful loving
mathematics really worked on nuclear
arms you know in Los Alamos but then
what happened to them in some ways I
think it's been quite a rude awakening
for a lot of professionals Asian
Americans in this country so that these
racist and other factors are often
intermingled with political internet
international political conflict or
Rangpur the service doesn't take much
for them to emerge I mean oh look there
I would be if they let's take a
hypothetical situation closer to me
personally if the United States turned
against Israel which it could it could
be a major wave of anti-semitism in the
United States that hasn't existed for
maybe thirty years but for years but it
could come back it's just all these
things are barely below the surface
well when the US by plane got shot over
China yeah all of a sudden in this
country there are involved boycotts of
Walmart because they're selling goods
made from China and boycotts of Chinese
restaurants and one suppose that China
does begin to take what looks like an
independent course there's a lot of
concern US military planning is oriented
towards a potential Chinese threat so
what's called missile defense which is
nothing to do with defense but it's
understood by both the Chinese and by
the US to be a first strike weapon aimed
at China not anybody else
yeah and of course part of concern I
mean even if let's say Chinese Americans
were pro US and they never care about
what is pro u.s. mean and interact unpro
US but against the US government you
know it's a depends what you mean think
you Reza's right that the population is
it the culture of the society state
policy and it's a very interesting
concept so it's really a totalitarian
roots this whole concept of
anti-american or pre-arrest and so on
it is presupposes that the society the
culture
it's people should be identified with
state policy and that's something that
should be dismantled yeah so for us is
to like to use okay yeah yeah you know
there are a lot of Asian Americans who
really come out of more kind of
conservative backgrounds and they're
supporting us point policy and but they
find the contradiction when they're here
in terms of their being entirely
vulnerable to to racism but also feeling
quite vulnerable I mean many Chinese
Americans believe that if there was a
war with China or China was declared in
excess illegally today would have
interned yeah and just like the Japanese
America yeah yeah I'm I'm going to
duplicate it but the other the hysteria
over China has been extreme the red
Chinese were the super demons in the
1950s what kind of fantasies concocted
about what they're planning to do to
Americans you know Perriman to drug
addicts so that particular thing was
particularly ironic because it's the
West that churned China into drug
addicts by force but that's been
forgotten
now there were fantasies about them
going to turn us into drug addict and
that could easily come back just like
these stories about the Hispanic narco
traffickers were stimulated and built up
in the late 80s mostly for domestic and
international political reasons and
doesn't take long from these population
very susceptible to that kind of
propaganda that's it's worth bearing in
mind that for whatever reason I don't
know what the reason is speculate but
the United States happens to be a very
frightened society and has been for a
long time an act it goes back to
colonial history but in the modern
period it's dramatic I mean I remember
children in school background 9th early
sixties being taught to hide under desks
tuck in covering out protect themselves
from atom bombs which are going to come
from China but would later share some
place there's no other I don't think
there's any other country in the world
with any kind of such lunacy took place
but it's a strain that learns right
through the culture and as always
apparently below the surface the large
part of the gun culture is based on that
I mean plenty of people really think
they need guns to protect themselves
from and you should see who they're
protecting themselves from other parts
of the country where people are
protecting themselves from the United
Nations which is sending black
helicopters over to carry out their
plans of genocide of Americans or aliens
and the sphere of aliens and of course
the Communists river the current enemy
happens to be but these are strains that
are just beneath the surface and they
can show up in very ugly ways right ok
we're going to need to wrap up this
segment but let it open up for questions
and in comments so
No name is Charles Ehlinger I want to
ask if you could expand on two things in
China one being I understand that while
is the rapid growth it's going to
investors and the communist party
operatives but not so much to the
peasants to the extent that I've been
told that there have been some physical
uprisings in the country and that it
might actually be a forbearer of a
revolution this is according to a group
called China study in New York City and
then the other question would be our
move into Afghanistan and seems to be
people say we're trying to control oil
and perhaps other resources in that area
where does China fit in as far as its
needs for oil does it have its own
support or will it be possibly a problem
with America over control of that area
well what's going on in the interior of
China people really don't know much
about but there have been reports there
is there have been some speculation that
China might go back to a period of mass
peasant revolts mass peasant revolts
against the central authority that's a
large part of Chinese history sort of
quite big one it's conceivable because
the peasant population is in a serious
situation a lot of people being driven
off the land already they're becoming
highly exploited labor and very ugly
circumstances in the growth areas the
industrial areas which are split Chinese
growth has benefited a large part of the
population but it is also a devastate
it's a very large part through and how
this is going to play out nobody knows
the big effect is likely if they open
themselves up to Agra export from the
West the United States and Europe that
could lead to a very serious problem and
this decline of support services could
be pretty severe too so I don't think
these speculations are wild we don't
know that they could be happening
actually China has been carrying up
quite repressive policies in many areas
inkless gets to Afghanistan including
the Muslim areas in the in western China
where there were connections to things
happening in Central Asia even people
moving up in the back and that a
repression which is pretty severe has
been supported by the United States
since September 11th
on September 11th gave a kind of a gave
free rein to repressive governments all
around the world to become more
repressive so Russia and Chechnya and
China and Western China with
authorization from Washington now they
call it counter terrorism but that
actually is a link I mean China was
involved in Afghanistan China and Iran
were involved in the 70s against the
domestic moreless by the late seventies
Russian backed government as part of
their whole international games even
before the u.s. got in serious I was
sort of like late 70 and the connections
have continued China has great interests
in Central Asia naturally borders on
them and the the energy sources are a
crucial issue the US has always since
the second world war that committed
itself to controlling Middle East oil
because it's the main resource in the
world and it's kind of a leader of world
control on the other hand the eastern
Siberia has a substantial mainly gas but
also all resources which China needs and
so South Korea that's a large part of
the North Korean problem is that it's
right in the middle of all of this these
areas Russia because of its eastern
Siberian Resources China big developing
society with resources of its own Japan
and South Korea huge industrial
countries they're all integrated and
they could the resources of the area
could yield independent the degree of
independence may be high independent
then comes the question of who picks up
but you know the Central Asian resources
which are not on the scale of the
Persian Gulf that are substantial
so yes this is is a major concern for
planners and could be large parts of
future evolving policy it certainly as
far as Afghanistan is concerned the u.s.
didn't go in there because it wants a
little there's nothing much in
Afghanistan you know they could use a
pipeline but it's a secondary issue I
think too much it was made of that the
u.s. those weren't military bases there
and also in Central Asia but that's
because of Central Asia and the Persian
Gulf it seems a common theme in an
oppressive situation whether it's in a
family or whether in a society is the
the power of silence certainly in a
family unit if there's some type of
abuse going on or whatever there's that
strong network of keeping people quiet
and then it spills out could you talk
about the power of silence a little bit
is that from humaneness is that from a
societal thing where does that come from
well it certainly is pervasive I mean
the domestic abuse issues are sort of
remarkable example of it and I I didn't
myself in raining much about it until
very recently what happened to have
learned about it and I've just been
shocked by what I've discovered I mean
in my own town which is a professional
educated relatively wealthy town
everybody's terms um wondered what the
police doing that down there's nothing
to accept chase lost cats or prevent
black kids from coming in in a
dilapidated car there kind of got
weirder please but it turns out that
they have two or three cases a week
we're actually called to you know by a
nine one one call it gets them to a home
for domestic abuse cases I would never
guess the biskits have happened here
and yes it's silent it silence within
family the inside silence among friends
I have a close friend who happens to be
a radical woman lawyer
who works in a radical war office a lot
of it on feminist issues one of her
colleagues was coming in Bruges and they
suspected that some problems taking
place which had nothing she was killed
sort of right in the middle of the most
you know sophisticated to conscious area
and I think I can remember that from
childhood - we said I was an immigrant
community we happened to be the only
Jewish family in a mostly Irish and
German Catholic neighborhood was in
1930s very anti-semitic
street life for myself and my younger
brother - Jewish boys was a tricky issue
you know because because the
anti-semitism was extreme we never told
their parents about it
I don't think our parents ever knew till
there until they died and they never
knew what life was like in our own
neighborhood you just didn't talk to
your parents about those things and they
didn't talk to you of that things and
and this is inside families you know
closely knit families when you go beyond
well you know the things we've been
talking about silence about crime
stories that aren't ideologically
acceptable and so on it's overwhelming
in fact one of the workers you know when
the women's movement began in serious a
serious way in the late sixties early
seventies a lot it was just telling the
truth about herself you know let's face
the truth better own lives because we've
been silent about it we talked about
it's just accepted as the norm if you
bring out what actually what your life
is actually like to yourself
it can be revolutionary
we we only have just a minute left
unfortunately but one of the quotes that
you referred to is John Dewey in your
miss education book and I'll just read
it the ultimate aim of production is not
production of goals or goods I'm sorry
but the production of free human beings
associated with one another in terms of
equality could you just maybe end with a
few comments about that well John Dewey
was the leading American social
philosopher was also by our standards
pretty radical I mean he I think his
positions correct
Bertrand Russell took very similar
positions and yes a decent education
ought to be creating free independent
creative human beings it doesn't have to
be developing them has to be allowing
them to follow those natural instincts
those are natural among children the
educational system has to beat it out of
them and make from obedient and
subordinate and so on but a decent
educational system would be would allow
these natural aspects of human nature to
flourish and encourage them and it would
be part of developing a free and
democratic society of real participation
but of course that runs counter to elite
interests the worth remembering that the
United States was not founded to be a
Democratic Society and elites do not
want it to be a Democratic Society it's
supposed to be what political scientists
sometimes call a polyarchy
system basically they leap decision and
public ratification and if you had the
kind of educational system that do we
spent his life committed to he wouldn't
be able to sustain that now people would
become active involved engaged and we're
trying to create a truly functioning
democratic society which would as do we
also pointed out require
industrial democracy that means
democratizing production Commerce and so
on which means eliminating the whole
structure of capitalist hierarchy those
positions were he's very mainstream Main
Street America but radical from the
point of view of prevailing doctrine and
I think he's quite right about that in
fact it is to go to politics or do we
also pointed out that until that's done
unless that's done politics will remain
what he called the shadow cast by
business over society and the
educational system will be a system of
indoctrination and control I was lucky
as a kid to be sent to a do at school
and I was quite quite an exciting
experience on that note we have to wrap
up but thank you very much
Oh
you
