good evening I'm Phil Donahue I'm
Vladimir Putin and we are pleased to
welcome you to this edition of Posner
and Donohue on CNBC where we have
Vladimir as our guest if there is an
intellectual walking around today and we
might wonder and have some doubts about
that this is most certainly that person
embarrassed as he might be about his
media constantly referring to him as
arguably the most important intellectual
today Noam Chomsky nevertheless has got
to grin and bear these the insistence on
media's the media's insistence on
calling him perhaps on occasion the
smartest man on earth well he is the
tenured professor of linguistics at MIT
he is one of the world's leading social
critics and do I understand that you
have some information suggesting that
he's also in the column with Mark sit
well yes according to what we've read he
is among the eight most quoted thinkers
ever including people like iris totally
Plato and what have you
I'm the ninth incident well I'm the
tenth actually the number one believe it
or not as Marx and the number two is
lemon but I think the reason for that is
that in the old days in the Soviet Union
they were quoted in every newspaper
every day so if you count up all those
quotes that puts them way ahead but
seriously speaking yes that's that's
what we've learned that actually Noam
Chomsky is number eight in that
staggering list of people well we want
to talk about professor Chomsky sir we
want to talk about a full-length
documentary playing in the main big
screen in selected theaters around the
country and on the world and around the
world Canada to be sure which is titled
manufacturing consent and we will talk
about that may I may I ask you to bear
up or be patient with our interest in
having and soliciting from you your
commentary on some very important
contemporary
events Bosnia the former Yugoslavia what
might professor Chomsky want to share
with us about this agony today and
united in the united states is
responsibility about it yeah well
actually I don't think that's been
primarily a u.s. responsibility it's
been tragic the way it's been handled
the situation's problem has reached a
point where it's not easy to think of
the constructive solution anymore a few
years ago there were options at this
point I think the so the way in which
the being is lobbying breakup was
handled was almost guaranteed to lead to
extreme conflict
I think that's primarily a European
responsibility in this case Germany
insisted on a very rapid breakup without
any preparation in fact insisted that
they were going to go through it alone
which means you're opposed to go along
if Europe in agree and the rest of the
world and agree as I recognizing the
entire thing it was different yeah I
mean Lavinia was pretty straightforward
I mean that just pulled out became
independent of great strife the
insistence on Croatian independence
however was done without recognition of
the fact that there's a substantial
Serbian minority and that was a
guarantee of war you know I mean in fact
then there was a bitter war Bosnia was
recognized without any preparation again
big Serbian mine are
in Croatian minority and the spillover
from the Serbian Croatian war
immediately brought them into it and it
was just done in such a fashion as to
maximize everything going wrong and it
did you're wrong
now at this point when you ask for
constructive proposals at this point
it's pretty hard to suggest I mean there
are things when you know I think that
probably our palliate is and one can
imagine improvements but a substantial
to deal with the problem in a really
constructive fashion is not easy I don't
yeah I've yet the Euro series would you
would you agree with the view that it
seems to be pretty much predominant in
world media today that it's really are
the Serbs who are that you know the
killers the the rapists the murder is
its own you know in these conflicts the
ones who commit most of the atrocities
are the ones who have most of the guns
if in fact they have most of the guns so
they're committing most of the
atrocities I mean it's not they have
different genes or anything like that
ah I am struck by your humble confession
here or statement of helplessness it
comes from one of the most manic minions
feel courageous social critics of our
time your you almost went to jail in
your protests of the Vietnam War
you have been thunderous in your
denunciation of United States foreign
policy in Central America and elsewhere
you are the person who has reminded us
most often of the probability of power
and violence expressed by just about all
governments and here you are saying boy
I don't know what to do in Bosnia as I
say there were things that could have
been done right but I weren't done but
what did you know what are we doing now
we have babies being right well I think
there are as I say there are probably
palliative for example I think the
embargo on
arms embargo should have been lifted a
long time ago it's based in affecting
unilateral embargo if you know versa let
them feed the children is that your
point on whether or not have our that
let let my Ma's as a community have arm
there's an arms embargo which in in
effect is unilaterally on Bosnia because
that's you know that's the only no one
else is paying attention hand out the
guns and let them shoot each oh no I
think there's more than that I mean I
think it's it should be possible I mean
their technical problems that one
shouldn't underestimate you have to know
that the PAS graffia and you have to
know where the you know who is going to
shoot from which direction and so on but
it's hard to imagine that there isn't a
way to with a show of force and maybe
even a threat of possibly the use of
force to at least improve delivery of
humanitarian aid and the silence the
guns shellings re a vote now those are
we shouldn't underestimate the
seriousness of that that's a technical
problem
have to know how to do that you know you
can't just say well let's send out the
planes and do it but but I imagine that
would be possible on the other hand if
you talk about serious intervention
chances are it would cause a lot more
problems than it would it could have
quite unpredictable consequences so say
take the take the possible reaction
inside Russia I mean it's no big secret
that there's a an old tradition you can
read other false toys novels you know
about orders yes you got to save the
circ you know to save the Serbs from
from the Turks or whatever's right you
know that's an old tradition in Russia
there's a lot of concern in especially
nationalist circles and military circles
in Russia about the breakup of the
system the humiliation and so on it's
entirely possible that in fact there
already are Russian violent so-called
volunteers fighting with the Serbs you
say so-called you don't think they're
really volunteers I think they are maybe
they are I think there are I not a few
Russians ooh yeah but I know the fight
but supposed to know what segments of
the military really become involved
suppose they go down there with you know
tactical nuclear weapons on their backs
which you can think of a lot of ugly
possibilities and those course opposed
that the some sort of international
would stimulate the Serbs to carry out
the kind of desperate and violent acts
that are not uncommon in small states or
communities that feel themselves in
battle for example they might decide to
move on Kosovo bringing in the bringing
in the Turks infect which is not
impossible you could have a Balkan war
not you know all of these are possible
consequences of direct intervention and
not to be treated lightly we are in New
York's we are in Fort Lee New Jersey
with Professor Noam Chomsky MIT we'll be
back to Justin
as I just expected a man of your
tradition to have something to call for
a moral response you are a philosopher
you make the point that we have a
responsibility to shape a moral
conscience and take courageous stands so
just for the sake of the slow learners
myself included you will the difference
this is ethnic cleansing
these are premeditated killings based
upon the ethnicity of the person on the
other end of the rifle including women
and children and old people the
difference between this and what Hitler
did is what the different the different
in what's happening in Bosnia and what
it's not I mean what Hitler did was
through it was try to carry out total
extermination and in fact succeeding
with the Jews with gypsies or so they're
trying to drive them out and kill the
ones who won't stay and there's plenty
of examples of that in the world plenty
of examples in 1948 in Palestine that
was similar examples it's ugly it's
extremely ugly and what's going on there
is very ugly when you talk about immoral
response you're correct however we have
to think what a moral response is an
action is a moral agent you're carrying
out you know you're thinking in moral
terms if you ask what are the human
consequences of the actions that I
proposed which would why would that not
have been an appropriate question for
the Allies to ask in advance
following invasion of Poland by Hitler
well first of all following the invasion
of Poland there was what happened in
fact after the invasion of Poland is
that Britain and France declared war but
at that time remember Hitler was not
carrying out an extermination policy
very few people assumed that he would be
that may had less evidence then to send
their loved ones and they built blooded
they did but they did France and England
declared war honouring a treaty that
they had with Poland and then they sat
there and they do any fight you know I
was a trying I'm trying to just I'm
trying to understand the moral
distinction the Martin any first of all
during the Second World War there were
Oh moral action no one entered into any
actions for moral grounds and in fact
states states are not moral agents they
don't pact with moral goals humans do
but not States okay now if we want to we
can pressure our states to stay served
instruments of violence people are moral
agents they can press their state and
very especially in democratic states
with some effectiveness sometimes to
either mute their violence or to carry
out you know even right relatively
benign actions but you have to ask
yourself what actions am i proposing now
if you're if you do want to think in
moral terms you say what are going to be
the human consequences of the actions
I'm proposing I am a message you there's
nothing moral about condemning
atrocities that's trivial
you can condemn the atrocities of
Genghis Khan you can't do anything right
but I'm still can somewhat confused as
to why the questions that you pose which
no doubt honorable people could ask many
did in advance of our participation in
world war two would come up with a yes
we are morally obliged to commit our own
blood and our loved ones to the
arresting of the Nazi Dennis we did
nothing in the ceremony declared war on
us
I didn't declare war on that's Jerry
well generally declares war on us was
never one more lies you a big Germany
declared war on us well and the Russian
I didn't fight the Germans yet I mean
this is all these are all but they're
but you're already declared war on us
but they were just a geographically
distant from us to give us at least the
option to make these judgments about
whether or not we want to send our but
we did not enter the Second World War in
order to stop Jeremy I see the
difference look at the stick we have a
record of this I mean up until the late
1930s the State Department was saying we
have to support Hitler because he's a
moderate who's standing between the
extremes Livie Stuart I know but I so if
Milosevic declares war on us then no I
look are you if you're suggesting that
we should go to war against or not I'm
trying to figure out what's the
difference and you're telling me them in
what and what but the difference between
our commitment which I'm sure you
support in
fighting Hitler we thought now first of
all the war against Hitler we fought
because a US military base on a colony
was attacked by Japan that's how we got
in while the Muslims in Bosnia we should
hope for a some kind of L look if we not
going to work I beg your pardon sir
you're used to this this is called media
and we'll be back in just a moment well
that's all no well I am instructed by
your review of 20th century history I
also accept your commentary that these
issues are complex but if you're going
to argue that the complexity of the
circumstances in the former Yugoslavia
at this moment give you the ability to
in good conscience essentially pray for
God's blessing here and hope that
something good happens then you can't
really consistently condemn other people
who might likewise bring for example
their own hesitation as many did in the
30s about whether America Firsters
Charles Lindbergh Joseph P Kennedy the
former ambassador to the court of st.
James oh you know you can't you can't
stand the on a high moral mountain and
suggest that somehow shame should come
down to them because they are likewise
hand-wringing because of the complexity
that existed for trying to America's
involvement World War two I'm sorry but
no no one proposed going to war against
Hitler no one in high places and in fact
the State Department right up until 1937
was saying yeah we are sport Hitler as
the mater we can talk you know we can
say talk about what should have happened
but let's separate it from what did
happen all right
not and in this case or in the case of
Hitler or in much more crucial cases
like the case of Vietnam or Central
America much more crucial because we
could do something about it
what you ask is are there policies that
I can incontinence and because of their
beneficial human likely beneficial human
consequences that's what Amaro
does if he's going to be consistent now
in the case of saved yet no in the case
of atrocities carried out by our own
state or client states there are almost
always things to do straight off in the
case of atrocities carried out by some
enemy state or some you know as let's
say Sri Lanka some places that we just
had no serious connection with very
often there just isn't a lot that you
can do you can put you can pontificate
about it but you can't suggest things
that will help now in the case of
Yugoslavia what you have to ask if you
care about the people if you care about
the human beings not your own you know
sort of preening your feathers then you
ask what are the likely human
consequences say for the people of
Yugoslavia or the region if we do X
right and you have to ask well what are
those consequences so let's say suppose
somebody proposes an American invasion
of Serbia okay then we ask well what are
the likely consequences or let's say a
UN invasion then we say well what are
the likely consequences well I mentioned
some of the possible ones and they're
not very pretty in fact they might end
up and are likely to end up harming the
people much more so therefore if you
want you can pontificate you can say
look what a great moral figure I am I
think we should do XY and Z but that's
not being a moral human being a moral
human being is someone's what are the
consequences of what I'm recommending
mmm-hmm so you separate yourself from
for example Anthony Lewis of the New
York Times and if he had a proposal I
would want to among other things provide
helicopter air-to-surface artillery
against against gun emplacements
surrounding Surrey able you want to
provide arms to the Balkans I believe
well I think allowing that you've all
given the green allowing of understand I
mean I think that's a plausible proposal
right weather helicopter gunships could
silence the guns is something that
Anthony Lewis doesn't know and that I
don't know and you have to find that out
before you make the proposal see it's
all very well to say well let's call in
helicopter gunships to stop the gun will
it do it well I don't know and he will
it escalate it to the next level in fact
is it even technically possible I mean
there are who doesn't know an I don't if
they shoot down the gun
the helicopters then what are you going
to do I'm out with the fellas that are
suppose that they are suppose that that
does incite a segments of the Russian
military to simply move down there in
force is that what you want well if I if
you know if I were if I were shepherding
my grandchild across an open area of
downtown Sarajevo where all the trees
have been chopped down so that my loved
ones can have some heat at night and
bullets are whizzing by me and other
mortar shells being launched at me a
civilian and my child from a hill in
Sarajevo I'd be a little impatient at
the at the propensity on the part of
otherwise very leading courageous social
critics to sit around and wonder what
the consequences of this will be really
if we sat around and wondered what the
consequences would be really for example
a low you're going to take I mean as
opposed to suppose the crystal of people
in sorry EV are not calling for armed
intervention secondly suppose that they
have they think it through is not very
hard to think and say well their
missiles being shot at me well the
answer is they wouldn't and we have to
ask whether the actions that are
sometimes mindlessly being proposed
might have that consequence well I do
thank you for your patience and my
effort to explore I think it's
worthwhile explore how it is not we
always tend to go for the easy answers
bomb them let's nuke them I know get
them let I know that yeah and if we want
to do the Washington and stop lots of
atrocities sure yeah I'm sure you're in
the with 22nd we won't start this new
subject
we should tell you once again that
manufacturing consent is the title of a
full-length documentary on the work of
Noam Chomsky
yes does speak r1 as one of the world's
leading social prints we'll be back in
just a moment you know our manufacturing
consent which incidentally was
co-produced with the oversight
cooperation and I presume funding of the
Canada's Film Board Film Board of Canada
tional film boy or something like that
huh
so Canadians public funds of Canada went
to help support the people who worked so
very hard in the construction of this
well they're Canadian producers of Korea
all right we presume there were no about
corporate American money that went to
fund this yes then professor Chomsky was
it was introduced I forget where
Cambridge somewhere I'm not sure I mean
as the the introducer called
a quote of the New York Times as
referring to professor Chomsky as
arguably the most important intellectual
in the world in the world yeah
to which to which professor Chomsky
responded the line about the arguably
the most important intellectual in the
world and so on comes from a publisher's
blurb and you also always got to watch
those things because if you go back to
the original you'll find that that
sentence is actually there this is in
the New York Times but the next sentence
is since that's the case how can you
write such terrible things about
American foreign policy and they never
quote that foot but in fact if it wasn't
for that second sentence I would begin
to think that I'm doing something wrong
and I'm not joking about that it's true
that the emperor doesn't have any
clothes but the emperor doesn't like to
be told it and the Emperor and the
Emperor's lapdogs like the New York
Times are not going to enjoy the
experience if you do I have to ask you
something on for many years in the
Soviet Union that expression lap dog
wasn't the Emperor's lap dog was the
Imperius lap dog
dog whatever to them where they're
referring to
booze wine newspapers which would of
course include the New York Times and
The Washington Post and all the others
um it kind of jars me to hear that same
terminology used by men like yourself
now you obviously you you use your what
you think about what you're saying you
should qualify that when you call the
New York Times a lap dog of the Emperor
at the Emperor who L for example is I
would not compare the New York Times to
the party hacks who wrote for Pravda
certainly on for various reasons for one
thing it's more diverse and it's more
independent and certainly not under
anything like the same government
pressure on the other hand if you look
at the output it's they're often
remarkable similarities and in fact one
of the differences between totalitarian
States and free societies is that in
totalitarian States when the commissar
class you know shines the shoes of the
people in power they can at least Pete
plead fear they can say look I'm afraid
I can't do anything else
increase the size you can't plead fear
you can only plead cowardice that's the
difference - okay well let me only just
in in in the Soviet Union um the media
were controlled and nobody we all knew
it there was a department in the Central
Committee of the Communist Party called
the Department of a agitation propaganda
later just a propaganda department and
you got your orders this is what you're
going to say about this how you say it
is your business but this is the line
and every single publication in the
country every single television every
single raid they followed this line they
were all controlled but the way you tend
to portray the press in this country at
least the the mainstream press seems to
be pretty similar it looks like they're
all doing the same thing they're all
controlled well message they all you
have to distinguish this in fact they're
all doing the same thing pretty much but
they're not controlled the same way I'm
there many different mechanisms that can
lead to similar consequences first of
all again let me stress the consequences
aren't
I mean the variety in the United States
is considerably greater and the
independence is certainly greater the
mechanisms of control are totally
different I mean the mechanisms of
control if you want to call it that in
the United States are not very our kind
of guided free market you know people
are they're responding to pressures that
have to do with concentration of power
and concentration of resources and need
for advancement and so on and so forth
but the and you can spell these things
out they're not very subtle
but what's interesting is the uniformity
of the consequence so you say that in
let's take say take two invasions the
Russian invasion of Afghanistan and the
American invasion of South Vietnam now
in the Soviet Union incidentally it was
recognized as a Russian invasion of
Afghanistan even in the press but it was
defended because he had to go into
Afghanistan the word invasion was never
you know actually there was one of the
famous initially but by the early 80s
was very being used in fact it was a
famous young okay not so a couple of
years within a few years I mean it was
being used however the main the line
that was coming down from the agitprop
euro is it's a defense of Afghanistan
against terrorists supported by the CIA
and the Imperial asked to compute all
the total limited force now let's take
the United States the United States
invaded South Vietnam attacked South
Vietnam and certainly no later than 1962
that's when John F Kennedy sent the US
Air Force to start bombing South
Vietnamese villages authorized the use
of napalm a sent American forces into
combat situations and so on that's an
invasion okay then the invasion built up
into a huge attack on all of Indochina
all right that's now what 31 years I'm
waiting to find some Freight one phrase
in the American press one not asking for
a lot one phrase in the whole mainstream
press that refers to such an event as
the US invasion of South Vietnam I can't
find it what you find is uniformly the
American defense of South Vietnam may be
unwise against terrorists supported from
the outside word by word paraphrase of
what the edge of crap you
now nobody told them that in the United
States why they didn't get an order from
the government saying that's the way you
got to describe it but nevertheless
that's what the output is of the own you
take a look I mean take you mentioned
Anthony Lewis before he was a critic of
the war by 1969 or so he never called it
an invasion
he said that the United States in 1969 a
year after Wall Street turned against
the war and told Johnson to cut it off
Anthony Lewis was writing about how the
war began with blundering efforts to do
good but by 1969 it had turned into a
disaster mainly for us well you know I
mean I'm sure there were people in the
Perot who were saying that after a
couple of years started out with
blundering efforts to do good in
Afghanistan but within a few years we
saw I was in disaster I mean it wouldn't
have been a difficult thing for someone
to write in Pravda by you know 1984 say
now we're talking about 1985 I can
easier by 85 after Gorbachev came not
sure yet but so now here the mechanisms
are radically different instead of I
don't I mean I only mention at the Lewis
because you mentioned it meant
scholarship was the same so for example
in in the scholar in the academic world
it would have been hard to find someone
more critical of US policy in Asia than
John King Fairbank the Dean of American
Asian scholars he was considered
virtually a communist you know well he
was president of the American Historical
Association in 1968 and in December he
gave his presidential address which of
course was partly about Vietnam and he
said that it we got into Vietnam in an
excess of the center of benevolence and
the disinterested the kindness or
something like that but we misunderstood
the relation to China and it was
the analytical error American business
community has turned against the world
what about in the years after that there
was just support for but these are not
people speaking because they've been
told to say it they believe it
exactly I'm saying the mechanisms are
totally different right it's the output
that is astonishingly similar now what
are the mechanisms well then you want to
look at them always give you a chance to
the mechanisms might include General
Electric yeah the multinational
corporation that owns the cable channel
on which Professor Chomsky shares his
views with us today we presume that our
program will may to the airwaves without
Center and hopefully we will be back and
we'll be back in Justin
well one more time professor Chomsky and
you are as I've reviewed not only the
documentary which shows you speaking
around the world and talking to just
about seemed to me every reporter in the
northern and the southern hemisphere
you're remarkably patient with these
similar questions one more time
for the highly regarded Posner and
Donahue's program here you are the
highlight of your career as a
communicator on our program report
America gets a mainstream media gives
essentially the same message because why
why think yeah well we have to look what
the message is first of all the message
is one of remarkable subordination to
power now power in the United States
doesn't happen to be in the state it's
not the it's not a centralized military
bureaucratic state like in the Soviet
Union
power in the United States primarily
lies in corporations in the corporate
world the there's very a narrow
concentration of control over resources
over investment decision is and so on
and so forth and that affects everything
can't help affecting everything it
affects the government because this
means that there's a very close link
between governmental power and corporate
power furthermore just the ability to
make investment decisions and financial
decisions places bounds on what any
government could do yes
furthermore it now let's go to the major
media for what are the major media well
they're huge corporations ok the New
York Times Washington Post NBC they
first of all are large corporations
quite profitable ones in fact secondly
there are parts of even bigger
conglomerates like you know Westinghouse
and GE and so on now like any
corporation they sell a product on a
market this is a market roughly a mark
that kind of a state guided market
society what's the product and what's
the market well the markets advertisers
that is other businesses so they're
selling a product to other businesses
corporations are selling a product other
businesses what's the product well the
product is audiences now for the major
media the ones that kind of set the
and they're selling a lead audiences
privileged audiences New York Times say
is targeting privileged elite sectors of
the population that's their audience and
they're trying to sell that audience to
other businesses not so we have to begin
with just on you know the most
elementary grounds we have it we look at
a system suppose we're Martians you know
we're looking at this system we say okay
here are huge corporations selling
privileged audiences to other businesses
well what picture of the world do you
expect to come out of that then we'd be
in that other factors if you're let's
say you're the chief diplomatic
correspondent of the New York Times or
you know a pundit on the op-ed page and
you want to really have important you
know insights into the government well
we all know how that's done you have
lunch with the Secretary of State he
tells you the lies that he wants to
appear tomorrow you write them and you
say a high source in Washington my
intrepid reporting has discovered that a
high source in Washington said so and so
in fact if you compare the internal
declassified record you know say people
like Dean Acheson z-- decisions and you
look at say James Reston's columns
they're pretty close and the same will
be true about James Baker and Thomas
Friedman and furthermore this is an open
secret we know that this is the way it's
not a big secret in the journalism
profession that this is now in order to
maintain those contacts you better
present the world a certain way or those
contacts are going to be cut off you'll
you'll lose your opportunity to have but
to appear to have special insight to
have leaks you know to be able to come
across with a story you know two hours
before the next person and so on plus
you'll now in order that there's a
there's an interplay here which requires
power in order to maintain your own
power that's another factor over and
above the just structural institutional
go along you get along even but to those
to those wounded mainstream people Jeff
Greenfield of ABC News said you were
from Neptune you're wacko
not only that but it the majority of
people in Soviet Union by the late 1980s
in fact before that would say to you
well we know that these papers are
control absolutely we know we a whereas
most Americans would say to you
professor give me a break this isn't
true I have a free press I get all the
information I need the New York are
Americans less intelligent we were born
on the pollution of major corporations
see report on all these things and here
you are dropping this and but on you
give me a chance to answer your matter
but this is a video this you're not
allowed to cut us off I want to impress
professor Chomsky they won't cut us off
if I won't let him watch this yep from
the documentary manufacturing consent a
very protracted look at professor
Chomsky speeches around the world his
statements and his social criticism
comes forward now a part of an interview
that bill moyers conducted with none
other than Tom Wolfe the author who
responds to the question that follows a
professor Chomsky everywhere he goes
variously stated it essentially boils
down to who the hell do you think you
are Tom Wolfe this is the the old cabal
theory that it's somewhere there's a
there's a room with a bay is covered
desk and they're a bunch of capitalists
sitting around and they're pulling
strength these room tone exist I mean I
hate to tell Noam Chomsky this you don't
you don't feel it'll share that he is
the most absolute rubbish I've ever
heard this is the current fashion in
universities you know it's patent
nonsense and I think it's it's nothing
but a fashion it's a way that
intellectuals have of a feeling like a
clergy and there has to be something
wrong well I actually agree with that
comment I mean the idea that there would
be a high cabal running things in the
country like the United States is
idiotic that would say it is like the
Soviet Union it's totally different
which is precisely why I say the exact
opposite what I mean is what I'm talking
about it's it's it's like saying the
corporation's try to maximize profit and
market share that's not a conspiracy
that's the institutional structure of
the system individual decisions lead to
that consequence of trying to maximize
profit and market share you don't do it
you're out of business that's not a
conspiracy and it's not a hike
now why does whoa forever it was here
this is being a conspiracy the point is
that any analytic commentary on the
institutional structure of the country
is so threatening to the commissar class
they came here the would be part of the
commissar crosstown rules yeah I mean
you can't he can't even hear the words
so if I say there is no high cadet all
what he hears is there is a high but
don't you think the reason he can't hear
the words is because he believes
profoundly in the things he's been
taught that this is democracy that there
is freedom it's like a lot of people
like myself we used to be members of the
Communist Party you know the family
believed in the ideals and very
painfully let go don't you think there
are a lot of honest people Tom will
being one of them who profoundly
believes and is not a member the
commissar class he just has a deal yeah
but you see what you were when you're
threatening you threaten those always
see what you're describing in the Soviet
Union is what I would call the commissar
class that is the people who profoundly
believe I'm sure you know I don't know
people which the average people but also
all the way up to the editors of Pravda
if you did if you did an in-depth
analysis with with them how many of them
would be total cynics no I mean yeah
that's right because most of them
completely believe that's the way
systems work in fact if you have the way
belief systems form really if you think
about it is you know even though this
from our personal lives you sort of
decide to do something for whatever
reason then you create a system of
beliefs that justifies it and says yeah
I was right well the end effect of this
is that people who function within a
system of power and authority whether
it's a an editor of profit or a an op-ed
writer for The Times or a concentration
camp guard or you know pick across the
board they're usually quite sincere
about it and they have worked up a
system of police who says yes this is
Justin right and I'm completely free
independent if they couldn't have that
system beliefs they couldn't continue
now the point is when but I think when
you point out that I agree with you when
you say it's a tight closed system of
beliefs it's a kind of fundamentalism
which means you simply cannot hear
critical analysis and it's interesting
to see what in the United States can't
be heard ordinary institutional analysis
which says this is the way institutions
function and a
itid free market system given the
distribution of power without any
control no control you know nobody's
given orders and so on this is the way
it functions because of the way power is
distributed that's much too threatening
to listen to just as it's too
threatening to hear the words the United
States tax Offit not or the United
States orchestrated the monstrous
atrocities in Central America for the
things not allow get very emotional
because it's because there's there are
fundamentalist beliefs involved yeah
well I can we talked about we have only
about three minutes left East Timor and
Cambodia may I ask you to briefly make
your case there the case is pretty
straightforward there were I mean it's
it's a it's as if history set up a
controlled experiment there were two
major atrocities going on at the same
time same part of the world roughly
comparable in scale one of them was an
Indonesian invasion and annexation of
another country's team or the other was
Pol Pot atrocities internal to Cambodia
the coverage the coverage was
dramatically different coverage of East
Timor declined sharply as the atrocities
continued they'd be covered to be
steamer was pretty high before the
Indonesian invasion it then declined and
hit zero in night in both the United
States and Canada in 1917 most of the
world Western world in 1978 when the
atrocities really reach tennis idol
proportions and Cambodia on the other
hand there was huge publicity within a
few weeks after the Khmer Rouge takeover
the new york times are announcing
genocide when probably maybe a few
hundred or thousand people had been
killed well what was the difference the
difference was in one case the United
States was directly behind it it was
providing 90 percent of the arms
it was providing a crucial diplomatic
invasion invasion of his team u.s.
provided critical diplomatic support
Daniel Moynihan took pride in the fact
that he prevented the UN from it doing
any action he writes about it with great
pride the u.s. gave them new offers of
arms as the attack peaked Carter sent
more arms in Cambodia was an enemies it
you can be very moral about the
atrocities committed by an enemy may I
call your attention to
speaking of East Timor less than three
years ago Amy Goodman and
Allan Nairn two reporters with whom you
are familiar miss Goodman with Pacifica
Radio and NPR public solicitor supported
radio station and Alan Karen of The New
Yorker are beaten by troops who are
firing on civilians around them as they
assemble and march for one of the
princes less than three years ago here
is part of that report on radio I want
you to listen to some come in and just
take a moment to Marie's in an instant
we're down torn apart by the bulletins
Street was a covered with bodies covered
with blood and the soldiers just kept on
coming they poured in one rank after
another they leaped over the bodies of
those who were down they were aiming and
shooting people in the back I could see
the limbs being torn their bodies
exploding there was blood spurting out
into the air the pop of the bullets
everywhere and it was very organized
very systematic the soldiers did not
stop they just kept on shooting until no
one was left standing a group of
soldiers grabbed my microphone and threw
me to the ground kicking and punching it
at that point
Alan threw himself on top of me
protecting me from further injury the
soldiers then used their rifle bucks
like baseball bats beating Alan until
they fractured his skull the point with
only seconds left is as is made in your
documentary this got coverage but it
wasn't much anomie much it was wrong
because let's look at what happened
right after that which has not been
covered the immediate consequence of
that is that Western oil companies under
the with the following the lead of their
governments entered into agreements with
Indonesia to rob T Murray's oil that's
exactly as if Libya had entered into an
agreement with Iraq to rob quaity oil
after the clay tea and they reported so
what determines what the Western media
covers we'll be back next time with Noam
Chomsky
