Noam Chomsky is a world-renowned
political activist writer and professor
of linguistics at MIT the New York Times
Book Review said of him judged in terms
of the power range and novelty and
influence of his thought Noam Chomsky is
arguably the most important intellectual
alive to which he adds yeah nobody ever
quotes the next sentence
how can he write such terrible things
about the u.s. foreign policy or
something like that that that edition
kind of made your day didn't it oh yeah
it made me feel it wasn't doing
something wrong tell me a little bit
about your background you grew up in
Philadelphia your parents were Hebrew
teachers I believe it was a basically
first-generation immigrant family they
were very much immersed in the local
Jewish community Hebrew education this
is the 1930s so it's early Zionism
pre-state Zionism that was the midea my
own life was soon became my own life but
that was the background that I came out
of and you went to camp as I recall you
later on when I was a young teenager 11
12 we went to Hebrew speaking camps and
then I first as a camper then later is
counselor help you were proficient in
Hebrew very early and reasonably
proficient but it's matter of measuring
but yes I could get by and I read read
very easily had read a lot of I grew up
immersed in Hebrew literature Bible and
so on in Hebrew you got part of I guess
your political education on a street
corner in New York in a sense you had an
uncle who this is again the 1930s and
early forties so the whole family
was mostly unemployed unemployed
seamstresses working people and so on
but there are a few vet jobs and one
uncle had a severe disability and he was
able to get a newsstand under one of the
New Deal type programs that were around
in those days so the newsstand was the
place which supported half the family
but he was also very he himself had
never gone through school but he was
very well educated more so than almost
anybody I met and the newsstand became a
center for a lot of emigres
intellectuals from Europe who would hang
around there and evenings and have
fascinating discussions and a lot of fun
to just be serving newspapers and
listening so you would might jump on the
train from Phil as soon as I was old
enough to take the train by myself at 12
or so I head off to New York soon as I
had a chance stay with my relatives who
were a very lively bunch of Jewish
working-class left all involved in
intellectual culture so a mixture of
strange Marxist groups and the Budapest
string quartet and so on and so forth
and although very few of them had had
anything in the way of formal education
except very elementary it didn't matter
and then I spent my time
wandering up and down something that's
long since disappeared but the fourth
Avenue below Union Square used to be
full of little secondhand bookstores
again a lot of European exiles would
have their own particular slant you know
Spanish anarchism or some other thing
that was fascinating to they're very
eager to talk to some young person
coming in was that usual so got special
treatment and picked up a lot a lot of
literature too in fact when I started
writing about these things years later
used a lot of primary documentation that
I'd picked up around that time which
wasn't available elsewhere what kind of
stuff they talk about the newsstand
there was a lot of many of the anti
grades were happened to be psychiatrists
like German Jewish psychiatrist so
there's a lot of Freud Steckle
that sort of thing and then every
variety of left-wing politics you can
think of these were very lively days and
political discussion was common and just
part of everybody's life and how did you
discover linguistics as you were field
through politics actually yeah this is
back in Philadelphia met zellig harris I
was about I guess 16 or 17 and pretty
bored with college I was thinking of
dropping out but I happened to meet him
through political contacts he himself
was was a very influential figure among
young intellectuals mostly Jewish but
not completely much more so than is
known in write much but many people
passed through his influence who many of
them well-known and I was one of the
younger ones and he was his interests
were sort of independent left sort of
anti-bolshevik left and what was then
called Zionism now it would be called
anti-zionism commitment to a future by
national Jewish Arab working-class based
community in what was in Palestine which
was part of the nines movement at the
time now it would be considered
different and I was already interested
in that so meeting him was a
exciting became an influence I later
discovered he was professor of
linguistics at at Penn and in fact one
of the leading figures in the world got
drawn into his courses and back into
college right you have come to change
your views about Israel Israeli politics
over the years not that much still
believe pretty much what a now of course
it's different now than when I was 12
years old but I basically the same point
of view I'm in these circumstances have
changed but the my own position hasn't
changed very much what is your position
and how the circumstance has changed
well remember that was pre state right
and so of course everything changed when
the state was established although I
maintain my involvement and interest if
I came pretty close to living there my
wife and I spent some time on a kibbutz
we might have gone back it was
questioned but I was opposed to the
establishment of a Jewish state which
again was part of the dynasty at the
time not a huge part but there was a
element of it the thought of Jewish
state is a bad mistake I thought so then
still thinks it a Jewish state as
opposed to a democratic state it the two
are inconsistent I mean people can try
whatever manipulation they like but if
the United States were a Christian state
in anything but symbolism it wouldn't be
a democratic state I mean taking Sunday
office okay but if there's real
discriminatory legislation and practice
that distinguished Christians from
non-christians or whites from non-whites
to that extent it would be a flawed
democracy almost by definition and
that's intrinsic in in the form of the
Jewish state that was established I mean
the high court in Israel actually
declared it to be the state of the
Jewish people in Israel in the Diaspora
so my state but not the state of a
Palestinian Arab
citizen of Israel and this shows itself
in all kinds of ways but it became much
more all of these problems became far
more exacerbated after 1967 when the
military occupation began it's now in
its 36th year and then all sorts of
things happened I mean in 1971 Israel
really had to make a what turned out to
be a fateful decision they received an
offer from Egypt through the UN mediator
Gunnar tre to have a you've offered full
peace treaty if Israel would withdraw
just from Egyptian territory not nothing
about the Palestinians no West Bank it
was discussed internally in Israel in
the now we know it from released cabinet
records but then in the Hebrew press
they knew that it was a possibility of
peace and integration into the region
the choice was that or expansion which
means permanent confrontation dependence
crucial dependence on the United States
and they chose the latter course and a
lot of things have followed from that
which are in my view very harmful to the
society and extremely dangerous and
leading to the constant threat of very
serious war plus 35 years of persecution
of an oppressed population that has
changed things enormously do you see any
end to that
yeah very simple and in fact everyone in
the world knows what it is
and has known for years the end is a
diplomatic set Ani it gets more remote
the longer you delay it but the end has
been for since the 1970s a political
settlement on the internationally
recognized border that pre pre-war
border pre June 67 with mutual and minor
territorial adjustments and other
arrangements about other matters
the crucial matter is territorial that's
been the international consensus since
the mid-1970s the US has unilaterally
blocked it and still does and as long as
that continues there won't be a
political zone
what about Jerusalem Jerusalem you can
finesse one way or another I mean
theoretically it's both under the
original UN resolutions are supposed to
be internationalized city okay that's
not going to happen
but Jewish and Arab neighborhoods could
be except mostly Jewish mostly Arab
neighborhoods could be separated two
capitals could be set up side-by-side
but the Palestinian one would have to
have access to the Palestinian state
that's the crucial issue and many people
have pointed out I think correctly that
the Jerusalem is a problem you could
probably settle in 15 minutes the main
problems are the territorial boundaries
as we speak the White House has
announced that it will declare an end to
the war in Iraq tomorrow in your opinion
what was that war all that well we can
be certain about one thing the White
House made it very clear that nothing it
said could be taken seriously so we know
that the reasons they gave can't be the
reasons the way we know that is because
they are contradicted every day I mean
one day the single question as they put
it is Iraq's weapons of mass destruction
if they get rid of the weapons of mass
destruction it's all over the next day
it turned out that didn't make any
difference what they did about their
weapons we were going to we had to
impose it on regime what's called regime
changing and the third day it was some
other stories so we can put aside the
official explanations they made it clear
to us that they're not to be taken
seriously so then we have to speculate
what was it about and I think
it's some pretty clear plausible
explanations I mean first of all there's
a background issue which doesn't account
for the timing of the war but it's
always in the background and that is
that Iraq has the second largest oil
reserves in the world it's always been
clear that one way or another the US
would regain control over them or seek
to do so it does dominate the US does
dominate the Gulf energy producing
region which is by far the largest and
richest in the world and will be for
another couple of generations that's
been policy since the Second World War
the Iraq was kind of an anomaly and that
it broke out of it and it would be an
effort to get it back in that was
certain what about the timing well the
timing is kind of striking if you look
at the propaganda about invasion of Iraq
it really begins last September I mean
it was sort of simmering in the
background but in September that's when
Condoleezza Rice told us about the you
know the mushroom cloud and the massive
government propaganda disseminated
uncritically by the media was produced
about Iraq being a threat to our
survival and intimations that Iraq was
behind the September 11th attacks and
was planning new ones and that showed up
very quickly in the polls by the end of
September of majority of the population
actually believed that Iraq was a
serious threat to u.s. security and over
the months the number of people who
believed that Iraq was involved in the
September 11th attacks has reached
something like 50 percent probably
there's nobody in the world who believes
anything like this including CIA but it
did come to be public opinion and those
opinions are very strongly correlated
with support for the war not
surprisingly but why September well
couple other things happen
September one thing that happened was it
was the opening of the midterm election
campaign and as Karl Rove campaign
manager had already informed Republican
activists they cannot go into the
campaign with social and economic issues
being prominent or they'll get smashed
they have to be security issues which
will lead people to they hope correctly
to suppress their concerns about jobs
pensions and Enron and so on in favor of
safety which will flock the power and it
worked
barely the Rove has already said the
confer to the next the same for the
presidential campaign and in fact that
ran right through the 80s when the same
people were running Washington pushing
the panic button every year or something
or other the other thing that happened
which I think is even more significant
is that they announced the national
security strategy in September which
calls for it sent plenty of shutters
around the world including the u.s.
foreign policy elite this was a
substantial change in official policy
there are precedents but it's never been
official policy before there was a
policy of openly announced intention to
rule the world by force and to prevent
any potential challenge to that
domination
it's called pre-emptive war but it's not
pre-emptive it's preventive and even
that's an exaggeration we'll just tack
anyone is in the way well when you
announce a doctrine you have to
illustrate otherwise nobody takes it
seriously
to illustrate the doctrine of preventive
war you have to pick the appropriate
target first of all it has to be weak
and defenseless
there's no point attacking anybody who
can fight back that's ridiculous so has
to be weak and defenseless on the other
hand that can't be say you know Burundi
because that's worthless who wants it
has to be weak defenseless and important
okay that spells Iraq and that was a
perfect petri dish is the New York Times
called a test case for to illustrate the
new norm of preventive war to get the
world understand we mean and I think
those factors probably account for the
time in the background is the long term
interest but as I say you can't these
have to be speculations because there's
no official information it means
anything it's all self contradictory
what do you expect will follow in Iraq
do you expect democracy to blossom
they're a special kind of democracy we
have a hundred years of experience in
our backyard to go by the US has
dominated Central America and the
Caribbean for a century it's had plenty
of influence in other places and it has
tolerated even foster democracy but on a
condition
the Democratic decision has to conform
the US policy if country's democratic
choices go in opposition to US policy
the government's overthrown either by
coup or invasion or economic
strangulation or something about and in
fact this is extremely explicit in
policy formation it takes discipline not
to see it so for example in the case of
Cuba the u.s. international terrorist
attack on Cuba and that's what it is
I began within months after Castro's
takeover was very sharply escalated by
the Kennedy administration we now have
the internal documents that discuss
describe what they had in mind then it's
the same as everywhere else bottom
I ran everywhere what the state is that
the very existence of the Castro regime
is successful defiance of US policies
going back 150 years policies are that
the region has to be subordinated to us
power and this is successful defiance of
that doesn't matter what they do they've
got to conform the wars in Central
America in the 1980s were to impose a
form of democracy which would be quote a
leading specialist top-down forms of
democracy in which traditional elites
mean who have been associated with the
United States retained power Jim quoting
Thomas for others it's a leading
historian but also writes from the
inside he was part of reagan's so-called
democracy enhancement programs in the
State Department and that's a correct
characterization and that's what will
happen in Iraq I mean if the majority
the population happens to be Shia
suppose they call for a you know Islamic
state to link to Iran United States and
never tolerate that fact has already
said - you can have a democracy as long
as you do what we say you have felt that
politics are driven by the economic
interests of what you call the
privileged elite you tell me about that
and who these people are
first of all that's not my opinion
that's the opinion of a hundred percent
of people who work on foreign affairs
it's an opinion with which you agree I'm
it's almost a truism it's true of every
country not just the United States I
mean there's an internal distribution of
power in every country you know it's not
that everybody is equal and the internal
distribution of power reflects itself in
decision-making in the state system in
different ways I mean if a country has a
powerful union movement for example
a labor contribution to policy United
States doesn't have that we have
basically business parties and there's a
there's a concentrated sector of
economic power corporate sector linked
to linked closely to government and they
tend to set the basic framework for
policy choices it's not mechanical again
deduce that this or that policy is going
to come out but it's a very powerful
framework from which there's very little
deviation actually the media don't even
tolerate any discussion of anything
beyond it except very much of the
margins even if the population happens I
mean there are many striking cases where
the population is pretty strongly
opposed to policy but if there's a split
between a lead opinion and popular
opinion the these issues just don't even
show up in elections
I mean international economic
arrangements are a striking example the
population is almost put by substantial
majorities opposed to most of the
arrangement there's near elite consensus
as a result they just don't show up
except very marginally in a political
debate and political campaigns and other
things actually what I said about the
Middle East is another example roughly I
think about two-thirds of the population
has it supports the general
international consensus that I mentioned
but the USA lead opinion does not as a
result the issue just doesn't come up
the writer Tom Wolfe calls this the old
cabal theory and implies that it's kind
of nutty
I guess that sort of criticism if you
think it's nutty for people with wealth
and power to use their influence about
as nutty is the fact that the Sun rises
every morning couple of years statements
I will quote now the Japanese bombing of
Pearl Harbor saved tens of millions of
lives how did that happen it's not
supportive it it's just saying you
cannot evaluate an action by looking at
the range of consequences actually
probably in India alone it saved tens of
millions of lives also kicking the
British yeah one of the results of the
jet wasn't the intention of the bombing
of Pearl Harbor but if you look at the
events that unfolded one of the things
that happened is that the Europeans
mostly left Asia not easily but so the
French fought a brutal war the Dutch
fought a war they finally left and the
effect of that in Asia was dramatic I
mean if you look at the demographic
patterns and say India there haven't
been any major famine since the British
left there were terrible famines before
in fact India you know they barely
developed during the British period
hundreds a year it had been the
commercial and one of the commercial and
industrial centers of the world when the
British took it over the British turned
it into an impoverished agricultural
society with a wealthy elite and some
infrastructure you know based on their
dominance but there's a miserable
situation if people like neighbor who is
an Anglophile described the British is
like the Nazis after independence it's
not a wonderful place by any means but
at least the massive famine stopped and
some development picked up and it's much
the same throughout Asia I said so an
indirect consequence of the Japanese
aggression and violence happened to be
the liberation of a good deal of Asia
that's incidentally why plenty of Asian
nationalists supported the Japanese
for example sukarno and Indonesia
support of the Japanese all the way
through is anti-fascist but supported
the Japanese because they were going to
kick the Dutch up and it's the same
throughout so you know actions have all
kinds of consequences but you cannot
justify Japanese atrocities an
aggression on the basis of the fact that
inadvertent consequences happen to lead
the deliberation of a page that was the
context in which that comment was made
and it's I don't think there's any doubt
of the historical accuracy of the
comment the US bombing in Afghanistan
was silent genocide no what I said is
that if they that the assumptions they
were making were that that could well be
a consequence remember the bombing of
Afghanistan was taken on the assumption
that it might well lead put millions of
people at risk of starvation that
assumption was very widespread you can
read it and Harvard's a major
International Journal international
security The New York Times for example
estimated after a month that the number
of people at risk of starvation had
risen by 50% from 5 million to
seven-and-a-half million and in fact
right after September 11th even before
the bombing of the US ordered Pakistan
to terminate food supplies that were
keeping a good part of the population at
the edge of survival so that policy
under the assumptions in which the
policy was being conducted could well
have led to silent genocide that's one
of the reasons why rational people
should oppose policies like that you
said that if the Nuremberg principles
were applied every post World War two
president would be
indictable probably true can we run run
down them real fast what Eisenhower do
it you would indict him for Eisenhower
overthrew the conservative Nationalist
government of Iran with the military
coup he overthrew the first and last
democratic government in Guatemala by
military coup and invasion leading to
years of in Iran it led to 25 years of
brutal dictatorship finally overthrown
in 79 in Guatemala led to massive
atrocities which are still continuing
that's after almost 50 years in
Indonesia this wasn't known until
recently but he conducted the major
clandestine terror operation of the
post-war period up until Cuban Nicaragua
in an effort to break up
Indonesia's strip off the outer islands
where most of the resources are and
undermine the what was then considered
as a threat of Indonesian democracy
Indonesia was too free and open it was
allowing a political party of the poor
to participate they were gaining a lot
of ground so that the Eisenhower
supported and helped instigate a
military rebellion in the outer islands
this is just for starters these are all
indictable offences owned by Kennedy
Kennedy was one of the worst Kennedy
first of all invaded South Vietnam
during the Eisenhower administration
they had blocked a political settlement
in 1954 and instituted a kind of a Latin
American style terror state which had
killed maybe 60 or 70 thousand people by
at the end of the Eisenhower period and
had instigated a response reaction
Kennedy recognized that it couldn't be
controlled internally so he simply
invaded in 1962
about a third of the bombing missions
who were carried out by the US Air Force
in South u.s. planes with South
Vietnamese insignia the u.s. pilot are
the author he authorized napalm he began
the use of chemical weapons to destroy
food crops they began programs which
drove millions of people into what
amount of the concentration camps
that's aggression in the case of Cuba it
was just a massive campaign of
international terrorism which almost led
to the destruction of the world led to
the missile crisis and we can continue
again these are all indictable offences
Johnson
well Johnson expanded the war and into
China to the point where ended up
probably leaving three or four million
people dead he invaded the Dominican
Republic to block what looked like a
potential democratic revolution there
supported the Israeli occupation in its
early stages again we can go around the
world but make you take them takes a
quarter I'll get there but Nixon's next
next thing we don't even have to talk
about we can we can skip that one okay
but Ford then Ford well for it was only
there for a short time but long enough
to endorse the Indonesian invasion of
East Timor which became about as close
to genocide as anything in the modern
period they pretended to oppose it but
secretly supported effect not so
secretly the u.s. immediately after the
invasion the u.s. did join the rest of
the world in formally condemning it at
the Security Council but ambassador
Moynihan
was kind enough to explain to us in his
words that his instructions were to
render the United Nations utterly
ineffective in any actions it might take
to counter the Indonesian and great
invasion and he says proudly that he did
this with considerable success his next
sentence says in the next few months it
seems that about sixty thousand people
were killed and then he goes off to the
next topic
that's the first few months went on to
probably hundreds of thousands Sigma
formally the u.s. announced the boycott
of weapons but secretly it increased the
supply of weapons including
counterinsurgency equipment so that the
Indonesians could consummate the
invasion that's just a short period in
office but that's indictable seriously
in fact that's a major war crime Carter
Carter increased as the Indonesian
atrocities were increasing they peaked
in 1978 Carter's flow of weapons to
Indonesia increased when Congress
imposed a human rights restrictions by
then was a human rights movement in
Congress to block the flow of advanced
weaponry to Indonesia Carter arranged
through Mondale Vice President to get
Israel to send us Skyhawks to Indonesia
to enable Indonesia to complete what
turned out to be near Jenna's killing
may be quarter the population or
something in the in the Middle East
Carter just won the Nobel Prize his
great achievement was the Camp David
agreements the Camp David agreements are
presented as a diplomatic triumph for
the United States in fact they were a
diplomatic catastrophe at Camp David the
United States and Israel accepted
finally Egypt 1971 offer
which they had then read us it rejected
at the time except that now that was
worse from the us-israeli point of view
because it included the Palestinians in
order to accept get Israel to accept
Egypt's 1971 offer after a major war in
atrocities and so on Carter raised aid
military and other aid Israel to more
than fifty percent of total aid
worldwide Israel used it it once in
exactly the way they said they were
going to do as every sane person knew as
an opportunity to attack their northern
neighbor first in 1978 then in 1982 and
to increase integration of the occupied
territories and that's for starters we
can continue Reagan I don't think we
have to talk about that one either
I mean Reagan is the first president to
have been condemned by the International
Court of Justice for what they called
the unlawful use of force meaning
international terrorism in the war
against Nicaragua again that's just for
starters they also the Security Council
endorsed it in two resolutions both of
which were vetoed by the United States
Bush one well we can begin with the
invasion of Panama the invasion of
Panama which according to the
Panamanians killed about 3,000 people
since it's never investigated know if
that's true or not this was done in
order to kidnap a disobedient thug who
had been supported by the United States
right through his worst atrocities
Noriega Noriega who was brought to
Florida and tried for crimes that he
committed mostly on the CIA payroll
okay that's aggression we could go into
the details of the war in Iraq but there
were plainly opportunities for they
might not have worked we don't know but
there were opportunities for diplomatic
settlement which the Bush administration
refused to consider and incidentally the
press would not report with a single
exception in Long Island Newsday which
did report the whole story throughout
accurately and is the only newspaper in
the country to have done so the Bush
administration then did it to act and
the attack was carried out and in a
manner which is criminal under the laws
of war they attacked infrastructure and
if you attack New York City and you
destroy the electrical system our system
the sewage systems and so on that
amounts to biological warfare and that's
the nature of the attack then came a
sanctions regime which it's mostly
Clinton that began with Bush which is by
conservative estimates killed hundreds
of thousands of people while
strengthening Saddam Hussein that takes
us off to Clinton which that's the
beginning that's by no means the end to
clem through it well we can run through
that one case of Isis all right but
there plenty of others Bush - let's take
scoring with Clinton okay I'm one of
Clinton's minor s with minor escapades
very minor with sending a couple of
cruise missiles to the Sudan to destroy
what they knew to be a pharmaceutical
plant there was no intelligence failure
according to the only estimates we have
from the German ambassador and the
director of Regional Director of Near
East foundation does field work and
Sudan both of them estimates several
tens of thousands of deaths from one
cruising synthetic pretty serious
somebody did that to us we'd regarded as
bad news and again we can continue
during in the Middle East for example
the Clinton began by declaring past UN
resolutions the words of his
administration obsolete and
anachronistic
because we're finished with that no more
international law
then comes Apollo a period called a
peace process except that during the
peace process Israeli us at Israeli
settlement which means settlement paid
for by the US taxpayer and supported by
US military aid and diplomacy
continually increased the most extreme
year was Clinton's last year the highest
level of settlement the highest since
1992 meanwhile the territories were
canonized broken up into small regions
with infrastructure projects and new
settlement I don't know what you call
that but it's under military occupation
and if anyone else was doing it we'd
call it a worker and again we can
continue wish to I don't think we have
to discuss your call okay
how does well I want to get back to one
thing he said news day apparently got
off the reservation is somehow what
happened there had a no idea but one
particularly one reporter knew Troy's
kept reporting everything was happening
I have a guess I mean what was going on
was that he was reporting leaks from the
government the government the US State
Department was leaking reports from
August August 90 right up to through
December planning for the war leaking
report saying that Iraq was making
offers that the State Department
regarded as serious and negotiable
maybe not acceptable but negotiable now
you know no one in the state department
leaks reports to a suburban newspaper
what I assume was happening was that
they were leaking into the New York
Times which was refusing to print them
and then they leaked them the Newsday
which appears on every newsstand in New
York City with a big full front-page
headlines saying
RAC offers this and that I mean can you
think of any other explanation if you
were in the State Department would you
leak documents to Newsday well but it's
a it's a part of an immense cooperation
those day times merely location and
somehow that newspaper alone and this
one reporter and Fay who I don't know
but he was doing a very good job that
kept reporting but and what typically
happened is that Newsday would report it
big front-page story and a couple of
days later in The Times and the sort of
back pages you'd see a phrase saying
well reports claim that the Iraq made an
offer but the White House denies it so
very few people in the country knew
about this we've got a few minutes left
before we're going to open this for
questions from me from the people here
in the studio you've said either the
general population will take control of
our destiny or there will be no destiny
for anyone to control why is that so I
think we think we are in a situation
with I mean the human species has
developed a capacity to destroy itself
and everything else that's been true
since the Second World War and we are
edging very close to the possibility of
that happening it's come very close in
the past I mean during the Cuban Missile
Crisis which Arthur Schlesinger
described as the most dangerous moment
in human history we just learned last
October how dangerous it was last
October it was revealed at the
retrospective conference of participants
and that American Russian and Cuban that
the world was literally one word away
from terminal nuclear war Russian
submarine commanders turns out had
nuclear-tipped missiles and they were
under attack by American destroyers at
the edge of Kennedy's quarantine zone
they assumed the nuclear war was going
on two of the commanders ordered the
missiles sent that would have led to a
devastating response picking up Moscow
in comes New York and were over one
commander countermanded that was a
consequence of a international terrorist
war aimed at regime change those notions
are right in the headlines and that's
we're coming very close to that now I
mean the preventive war doctrine last
September it's just the instructing
people in the world that you better
develop weapons of mass destruction or a
means of terrorism in order to deter the
United States or secondly or take
another domain nobody really understands
in any detail what's going on with a
climate that's a complicated issue but
there's a near consensus among
scientists that were playing with fire
could be it's kind of like Afghanistan
you you're risking the possibility of
very severe destruction if anything goes
wrong these are sort of nonlinear
processes I mean a slight change could
have a big effect you know what's going
to happen
you know maybe in Ice Age in Europe or
some other thing well you know we're
very near the edge in nuclear weapons
development and other weapons of mass
destruction and policies that are
creating international chaos in
destroying possibly destroying an
environment in which decent survival is
possible nobody you can't none of this
is predictable it's just all too close
for comfort and it things are tending in
that direction I mean and it's been it's
it's not particularly new it takes a the
history of Europe now for hundreds of
years the Europe was the most savage
place in the world
the main activity of Europeans was
slaughtering each other
meanwhile on the side conquering most of
the world in 1945 they called it off why
well very straightforward reason it was
understood by French and Germans and
British that the next time they play the
centuries-old game of slaughtering each
other some be the end of the world
because they had developed means of
destruction so enormous that you just
can't do it anymore
so now Europe is a peaceful region but
unless that extends to the world same
problems arise what's the good news the
good news is that there's lots of good
news part of it is that as a result of
the activism of the last 40 years which
has been extensive the United States is
a much more civilized country than it
was in the past and the same has
happened all over good parts of the
world there's now extensive other there
are all kinds of things that we didn't
even exist before women's rights
minority rights an environmental
movement anti-nuclear movements
international solidarity movements
global justice movements and none of us
existed 40 or 45 years ago most of it is
post 1960s that started at all they kind
of took off it's changed hasn't changed
institutions but it has changed
consciousness of awareness and it's true
of a large part of the world actually
much of the initiative for these
developments is coming from the south
and there's a good reason why the world
Social Forum meets in Brazil not in
Paris or New York that's because that's
where the leading edge of the activism
is for significant social change
throughout much of the south
the north is joined to an extent and
these are hopeful possibilities for
popular movements reversing a course
that's a very dangerous one on that note
of optimism we'll take questions now
from
people here in the audience I noticed
that you mentioned that when US
government tries to pick up a target to
attack they usually pick up a weak
defenseless and important target so
since the Iraqi issue has now has been
Rena announced to be officially a end
and also it is also said as a zero
several possible targets that US
government my pick up so one example
might be and the the North Korea but it
is recently it recently it has been said
that the US Army stationed in North
Korea have retreated to to to Japan
sorry excuse fish in South Korea I also
sorry in South Korea sorry has has
retreated to Japan but it seems that not
it seems that the war will break out I
mean according to some people's belief
but it seems that North Korea is a
country with almost no resources but
it's also quite defensive and it has it
is said that has nuclear weapons so I
wonder whether you have any opinion on
this issue and what kind of benefits
will be brought to America if you know
the war breaks
well first of all the visit about
attacking defenseless enemies I actually
happen to be paraphrasing a leaked
intelligence document from the bush one
administration when they came into
office like every administration they
call for an intelligence survey of the
world usually we don't find out about it
for 30-40 years until it gets
Declassified but in this case someone
leaked a paragraph from it and it was
published by Maureen Dowd in the New
York Times her column is considered a
kind of gossip column so people don't
read it very carefully but she actually
did publish in 1990 or so the paragraph
that was leaked from that document and
what it said is that in the case of
confrontation with much weaker enemy
which it's tacitly assumed that the only
ones you're going to attack in the case
of confrontations with much weaker
enemies of the United States must defeat
them decisively and rapidly because
otherwise political support will erode
it's not the 1960s when Kennedy could
carry out a war for years and Johnson
could escalate it with no protest now
you got to build up the enemy to look
like a massive force and then destroy
him decisively and rapidly and you got
to pick a much weaker one and that's a
sensible you may not like it but it's a
rational doctrine and if you look at the
Wars of the 90s that's what they are the
North Korea case is a complicated one
the what the United States has been
telling the world loud and clear for the
last couple of months is that if you
want to prevent us from attacking you
you'd better have a deterrent I'm an
Iraq had no deterrent so there we in
smash it North Korea had a deterrent not
nuclear weapons incidentally massed
artillery they have massed artillery
aimed that Seoul and that the American
forces there and unless the Pentagon can
figure out a way to take them out with
precision guided munitions before
they're used it could just be
devastating
actually the predictions in the Clinton
years from the Pentagon were that if the
US was to go to worthy as one general
put it they better have a hundred
thousand body bags ready
so North Korea has a deterrent which is
conventional nuclear weapons they may
have a couple of years from now but
that's not the issue now and that held
off an attack well why is North Korea
important you're completely right as no
resources it's one of the poorest most
most horrifying countries in the world
but it's right in the middle of a
crucial area this whole region is a
rapidly developing economic region it
has tremendous resources in Siberia
you know lots of gas and oil and other
resources has huge countries that are
industrialized and need the resources
particularly Japan and South Korea but
now China too which is now a resource
importer and there's a good reason to
expect that that whole region is going
to go off in its own independent
direction the United States does not
want that it wants that region to be
subordinated the u.s. power and North
Koreans are right in the middle of if
there's going to be pipelines from you
know Siberia through with South Korea
and off to Japan that's where they're
going to go so it itself has no material
significance but its position in one of
the most rapidly developing regions of
the world definitely does
I appreciate your emphasis is on hope as
whereas activism is being a source of
hope and as a academic and training and
a political organizer in the last two
years I've I've experienced an inertia
in the academic class so to speak that
I've never experienced before and I've
been organizing for a number of years
including the first Gulf War and so the
first part of the question is why do you
think it is that at absolutely the most
critical time the most you know the mask
has been removed in a lot of sense of
this of this push an expansion of empire
so to speak that that's the time that
the such extreme inertia has set in and
that people feel so impotent and then
the second part of the question is how
do you recommend breaking through that
particularly an academic class because
they have such resources and I'm
wondering if something like the French
based attack organization may be
somewhat of a model and I just want to
get your opinion on that well if first
of all your age is significant the
academic world has never been a source
of a rarely been a source of activism it
usually comes from somewhere else
there's a brief period in which it was
true in the late 60s late 60s not in the
earlier period when parts of the
academic world
these students incidentally very few
faculty did become actively engaged in
elite universities and elsewhere then it
kind of died down in the 1980s happening
an extremely activist period but it was
not coming from the academic world it
was coming more from churches in the
Midwest and places like that the Central
America solidarity movement was
extremely significant didn't get a lot
of attention because it was not coming
from a lead centers but this is the
first time in the history of imperialism
hundreds of years that people from the
Imperial country actually went to live
with the victims to try to help them and
protect them I mean nobody in France
went to live in Algeria during the
Algerian war living in Algerian village
or ever the Vietnam War was never even
thought about and the whole history of
European and US imperialism never
happened that happened on a very
substantial scale in the 1980s that's
the reason why you now have volunteers
in many parts of the world including
these really occupied territories so all
an outgrowth of this but the academic
world is almost completely not involved
same is true in the 1990s hasn't been
the academic world
I like the global justice movements
which are the biggest ones that they
didn't commit
I mean there's students involved you
know couple of faculty here and there
but it's mostly coming from elsewhere I
didn't mean to imply that actually I
didn't apply to academic we haven't be
in the academic world so rightly we
should be concerned about what goes on
there you know you and I aren't going to
organize Steelworkers but we can do
things where we live so that's just the
right question and what can change it is
what's always done in the past you know
people working hard to educate to
organize to raise issues and we have
tremendous privileges on most parts of
the world people try to do things like
this they face torture assassination
rather we don't face anything you know
we're completely free we have a legacy
of freedom that's unparalleled we have
enormous resources and privileges get
every opportunity we can think of what's
lacking is will I said one of the things
that's common in a kind of a youth
culture student culture like the
academic world is a very short attention
span you know you figure things have to
be done soon and if they don't work in a
week you know we quit like I went to a
demonstration and nothing happened okay
now I'm going to quit if you want
anything to change it's got a it means
work over a long time lots of defeats
occasional victories ultimately you get
somewhere you think of any popular
movement has ever done anything
yeah abolitionism women's rights
anything you think of that's why it
works that was what was different in the
working-class culture that I grew up in
as a kid these came from movements that
thought you're gonna have to work hard
for a long time to try to achieve
something and that's yes that's what
happens it's not going to be any quick
victories but there are plenty of
opportunities and just have to keep
attack oh yeah well attack is an
interesting group and it's done
important things it's fairly elite
outfit but it's one of the groups that
was instrumental in setting up the world
Social Forum and they're pretty narrowly
focused on a few crucial issues like one
of their big issues is Tobin tax you
know tax on financial interactions which
is probably a good idea there's other
possibilities like it and it's it's been
a very influential and important group
and it's starting in the United States
incidentally so they're subgroups here
it's international based in France and
it's the kind of thing that could be
part of a serious u.s. organizing effort
but only part I think yes sir
given human rights violations by
corporations I was wondering how you
make your purchasing decisions and if
there are any products that you don't
purchase well plenty of things I don't
purchase but not really for that reason
I mean these are questions of tactics I
mean do you affect Human Rights but
let's take coca-cola which is a big
thing around here Anderson Coca Cola is
has just been it's narrowly scraped by a
district court case in Florida that was
brought by the Steel Workers in support
of Colombian workers in a subsidiary of
a coca-cola plant which is one of those
vicious anti-union plants almost
anywhere and the particular case was a
union activist who was murdered by
paramilitaries in the plant and the
steel workers who are pressing these
human rights cases for Colombians they
can't do it themselves are using
provisions of American law which do
exist and have sometimes been applied
and they've brought a case in Florida
which got to the district court and they
sort of have a half victory the district
court severed coca-cola from the case
but kept the subsidiary well you know
Severine coca-cola was a technicality so
does that mean you should stop buying
coca-cola well if you stop buying
coca-cola is that going to help union
activists in Colombia that's the
question you have to ask these are and
you know I don't think there's a simple
answer like if you stop my cocoa let's
not have any effect if there was a
massive boycott of it they'd notice it
in the corporate headquarters and and
might do something like for example Nike
and reap Ceylon Reebok or something the
guys who make sneakers and things like
that have modified somewhat they're
horrendous human rights practices in
plants in Asia as a result of pressure
must have been coming from students and
that yeah that had an effect but these
are questions you just have to answer in
terms of their likely consequences for
people who are suffering there's no
point making gestures sosser Noam
Chomsky thank you very much okay
you
