the US military industry is just high
tech industry in military industry is
indistinguishable from general high tech
industry the military the military's
kind of cover for the state sector of
the economy I mean like at MIT where I
am everybody knows this except the
economists and everybody else knows it
because pays our salaries
you know so the money comes in to places
like MIT under military contracts to
produce the next generation of the
high-tech economy you know they take a
look at what's called the new economy
you know computers internet that's
really yeah come straight out of places
like MIT under federal contracts for
research and development under the cover
of military production and then it gets
handed over to IBM when you can sell
something so like my wife for example in
the 1950s was a program or at a military
lab at MIT which Lincoln laboratories I
was supposed to be top secret and
everything except everybody knew exactly
what was going on just so totally open
and the people flowing up I was in the
electronics lab at MIT and under 100%
military contracts also and every it was
perfectly clear they were working on
what they called an air defense system
so she was programming for an air
defense system it was a total joke no I
mean everybody knew we couldn't defend
anyone against the First World War
bomber piloted by Snoopy or something
like that and besides nobody cared about
bombers anymore because they were going
on the intercontinental missiles but it
what they were actually doing was
changing it was developing computers I
mean in those days in the 1950s a
computer would have filled a single
computer this entire building with the
vacuum tubes blowing up all the time and
paper are going all over the place you
know it's just unwieldy and by the end
of the decade around 1960 they had
succeeded in reducing a computer to a
mainframe
like you know half the size of this room
at that point you could start selling
them so the head of the project that
pulled off and founded the first
mainframe firm deck I mean while IBM had
been ripping off the research at MIT and
Harvard on government contracts and they
were kind of figuring out how to make
smaller computer to two and then they
went on through the early 90s developing
computers under government contract for
the Pentagon or the National Security
Administration and so on uh finally they
got to the point where they could sell
them and then you you know you have
computers same with the internet the 30
years it was in the government system
started at places like MIT and the same
with everything else you go across the
board now if you take a look at MIT now
Graham the around surrounding area used
to have small electronics firms now it
has small biotech firms the reason is
because the next cutting edge of the
economy is going to be biology based so
funding from the government for biology
based research is vastly increasing and
if you want to have a small startup
company they'll make a huge amount of
money when somebody buys it someday you
do it in genetic engineering or
biotechnology and so on and ultimately
it'll make profits for somebody and
that's military industry so yes military
industry wants it but so does industry
because it's the same thing you know
they're just one component of it in fact
there's almost no element of the economy
doesn't work like this that's and that's
why in fact it goes right through
history you know that's yeah it's
usually dynamic state sector that gets
the economy is going so military
industry wants it and not only for this
reason but you know they want one of the
reasons they want to control the oil
they don't want access to the oil that's
a mistake it's kind of commonly
discussed but the u.s. didn't care about
access to the oil they expect to use
Atlantic Basin sources which are much
more
you know like West Africa you know
Venezuela and so on but they want to
control it and you control it because it
first of all the profits flow back and
and they flow in a lot of ways I mean
it's not just oil company profits it's
also military sales so the biggest
purchaser of arms of us arms at least
probably British I mean you're it's
either Saudi Arabia or the United Arab
Emirates
that's one of the rich oil producers
they they draw most of the arms and
that's profits for high-tech industry in
Britain in the United States and they
are just money goes right back to the US
Treasury and Treasury securities in
various ways this helps prop up the
primarily British and US economies and
Britain I was formatic
I mean in Britain I don't know if you
ever looked at the records but probably
have but in 1958 when Iraq Brooke the
anglo-american condominium oil
production they pulled out of the system
Britain went totally crazy I mean so
when Lloyd it was in foreign secretary
flew to Washington and that these are
out in both the British and American
records and they you know discussed what
to do to prevent I said Riddick that
time maybe still were very reliant on
quaity
profit the quaity Investment Corporation
was in London I mean under British
control and Britain was getting you
needed the petrol dollars for supporting
British economy and it looked as if what
happened in Iraq might spread the quake
so at that point Britain and the u.s.
decided to grant queit nominal
independence up till then it was
complete just a colony and they say okay
you can run your own post office and
pretend you have a flag and that sort of
thing but of course Britain will run it
and they said you know Lloyd said if
anything goes wrong with this we will
ruthlessly intervene to
ensure maintaining control and the u.s.
agreed and said yeah they do the same
thing in Saudi Arabia and the Emirates
and but that's control that's not access
I mean at that time North America was
the biggest producer in the world you
know they didn't use it one drop of
Saudi oil
