well the military is somewhat under
misunderstood i think actually i'm a
pretty good
position to know it i've been at mit
for i don't know 65 years 60 years i
guess
and mit is a good example of
one crucial function of the military
system
for many years right into the 1970s
mit was almost 100 percent funded by the
pentagon
it was also the main academic center of
resistance against the vietnam war
my lab in fact was one of the main
academic setters
i was up for a long jail sentence and
the pentagon didn't give it down
if you want to overthrow the country
that's your business they don't care you
know
but what they did give a damn about is
the creating the next phase of the
high-tech economy
the pentagon was and remains to a large
extent a kind of a funnel
but into which taxpayers poor funds
are diluted into thinking you know we're
defending ourselves from
whoever it may be and the money goes
into developing the
next phase of the high-tech economy so
if you use a computer or you
use the internet you know you fly an
airplane which is a modified bomber
and so on you're taking advantage of the
role of the dynamic state sector the
economy
i mean a lot of the what's called
entrepreneurial initiative and so on is
coming straight out of the state
sector i once wrote an article a couple
of years ago after alan greenspan had
given one of his orations about the
marvels of the
free economy entrepreneurial initiative
consumer choice he made the mistake of
actually listing
about a dozen examples
every single one of them with one
exception
was a textbook case where the work was
almost entirely done in the state
sector no consumer choice no
entrepreneurial initiative just a lot of
it paid for by the pentagon
actually there was one exception which
was even more enlightening
it was uh transistors he pointed out
correctly that transistors were
developed in the
private sector at t we didn't explain
why it was because a t had a
government guaranteed monopoly so
therefore they could
charge monopoly prices and they could
use those
that benefit to establish a very good
lab build labs we
used to go up and back there all the
time in the 50s and 60s
so the great lab did a lot of things
you know feeding at the public trough
like everything else is
they were using wartime technology which
came out of the government of course
they couldn't sell advanced computers
because they were too expensive
so the government bought them a hundred
percent
of the advanced transistors put out by
western electric around 1960
were picked up by the government and in
fact if you look procurement
is one of the major means for
subsidizing
a private industry it was done with
computers it's done with all kinds of
things until they can get to the point
where they can
sell things on the market somebody's got
to buy it okay
that's the government usually the
pentagon so that's
one major aspect of the pentagon and it
continues right to the present in fact
it was kind of funny around 1970 if you
were in this racket
under pressure from the popular anti-war
movements
congress passed legislation it's called
the mansfield amendment
which required that all pentagon
funded work at
universities has to be military related
it's a good project for somebody which i
suggest if you want
uh take a look at the darpa which you
know advanced
research project agency the one that
does the fancy stuff
if you look at the i've looked at a
couple of them but i suspect it's
uniform if you look at the
darpa report you know the the what
people wrote about what they're doing
you know you've got to put in a
description every year of what you've
been doing before the mansfield
amendment people just said what they
were doing
after the mansfield amendment the
reports have two parts
the first one is some begins with some
fakery about military applications which
don't exist
and the second part which they figure
the generals will never get to
is about what they're actually doing you
know but that's
one major uh uh component one major
function of the pentagon
and you can do it because you can dilute
people you know people
think we gotta defend ourselves so we'll
pour money into this
the other one is just beating people up
you know it's not a small thing
just one or two more minutes yeah okay
if you want to run the world
you've got to have force there's a
reason why the united states is the only
country in the world that has
roughly a thousand military bases around
the world has
missile systems nuclear systems which
aimed at anybody in sight who might
someday be a problem and so on
so that's important there is what
dean baker called the nanny state for
the rich and one large part of it is
making sure that the rich are protected
okay so that's the other function of the
military system
