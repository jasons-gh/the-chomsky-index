we go up to 2008 and something quite
interesting happened and there was a
rocket fire in both directions most of
it comes from Israel fact by June
2005-2006 about 8,000 shells Israeli
shells that Gaza is you know the
proportions are proportional to the
power naturally but there was Hamas
rocket fire in June 2008 a ceasefire
agreement was reached between Hamas and
Israel Israel didn't live up to the
ceasefire its commitment was to end the
siege they didn't do that but Hamas did
live up to the ceasefire we have that
from official Israeli authorities look
up the official Israeli website
government website it says the other
with no rocket fire after this after the
agreement until November of 2008 in that
month Israel invaded Gaza killed half a
dozen Hamas militants Hamas Rockets
followed many more Israeli Rockets there
were casualties all on the Palestinian
side in December Hamas offered to
reinstitute the ceasefire the Israeli
cabinet considered it and rejected it
they preferred to use violence and they
invaded jazim now that that's the
december two thousand eight january 2009
invasion which was quite brutal and
destructive in the west that's almost
universally regarded as a legitimate act
of self-defense
which was disproportionate even the
human rights groups say that Goldstone
report and so on that's totally false
Israel of course has a right of
self-defense but the issue is does it
have the right of self-defense by force
that's always the issue everyone has a
right of self-defense that doesn't
justify violence even in criminal law
international law did they have a right
to use violence in self-defense answer
certainly not because there were
peaceful means and they knew there were
purse peaceful means they could simply
reinstitute the ceasefire and the
Rockets just as it had done before but
the US and Israel preferred to attack
and given their ideological power they
could establish that as the framework
for interpretation then comes it
continues until today I mean essentially
just by now this some relaxation of the
bitter seeds but still the supplies
going into Gaza about a third of the
level of what they were before the two
thousand seven seas was instituted
barely enough to keep people alive and I
should say that in the area of the West
Bank that Israel completely controls
Area C sixty percent of the West Bank in
that area living conditions are even
worse than chasm not pretty well that's
basically where we stand now going back
to options
to one option is moving toward the
International Settlement the other
realistic alternative is that the US and
Israel continue doing exactly what
they're doing basically what I described
in Gaza the West Bank and there could be
some small Palestinian additi
established somewhere would have
certainly not even minimal conditions
for a decent survival that would survive
maybe at the as long as the European
Union is willing to pour money into it
so that around Ramallah young people can
live quite well elegant restaurants and
theaters and so on like any third world
colony those are the real options now
what does that leave for us well final
word there's a lot of discussion in
recent years about the analogy between
Israel and South Africa much of that
discussion I think is quite dubious so
for example within Israel itself there
is discrimination but it's not apartheid
ouch it's much more like what we've been
familiar with here for centuries but I
even
experience myself years ago little worse
but like that and common around the
world unfortunately within the occupied
territories it's much worse than
apartheid it's not apart right Ariel
Sharon described the Canton's being left
to the Palestinians as banter stands but
that was unrealistic the South Africa
needed to black population that was
their workforce eighty-five percent of
the population that's the productive
workforce so therefore they had to take
care of them just like slave owners had
to take care of slaves it couldn't let
him die that's their capital investment
so South Africa in fact provided some
benefits to the Bantu stands Israel in
contrast does not want the Palestinians
they're happy to have them go back in
1967 moshe taeyeon again was one of the
more sympathetic of the leaders towards
the Palestinians he explained to the
cabinet to his associates his proposals
he was in charge of the West Bank he
said we have to tell the Palestinians in
the West Bank that we have no solution
for them they're going to live like dogs
and those who want to leave can leave
and we'll see where that goes you know
that's the proposal and that's what's
being implemented that wasn't true in
South Africa they needed the black
population so the analogy to apartheid
is completely inaccurate
I think in both areas but it's worse
than apartheid in the occupied
territories it's not as bad in Israel
itself however there is an analogy which
is significant and which isn't much
discussed but which tells us I think
what we are to do back in nineteen sixty
the National South African nationalists
white South Africans recognized that
they were becoming an international
pariah a a lot of opposition to
apartheid was developing that was big
Massacre there's a lot of protest and so
on at that point the South African
foreign minister called in the American
ambassador and told him look we know
we're becoming an international pariah
pariah everyone's voting against us in
the UN and so on but you and I both know
that there's only one vote in the United
Nations yours the rest doesn't matter
which happens to be pretty accurate and
in fact history played out just the way
he predicted through the 60s and the 70s
opposition to apartheid increased there
were sanctions there were pressures if I
un past sanctions in the 1980s Congress
was passing sections the US government
continued to support South Africa Reagan
had to evade even congressional
sanctions to increase support for South
Africa both South African violence
repression internal to the country but
also South Africa's attacks in the
neighboring states angola and mozambique
which were no small business they killed
over a million people in those two
countries us continued to support it as
latest 1988 Washington condemned the
African National Congress Mandela's and
see condemned that is one of the more
notorious terrorist groups in the world
in fact Mandela just was taken off the
terrorist list two years ago now for the
first time he can come to the United
States without a special dispensation so
this is part of the famous war on terror
there a terrorist group we have to
support white South Africa no matter
what the UN says no matter what Congress
is and that continued and by the late
80s south africa looked impregnable they
didn't want everything they were getting
everything they wanted they're very
granthan with a next two years US policy
shift and a couple of Mandela was let
out of Robins Island
a couple years later apartheid collapsed
it's very it's not pretty not at all
fact in many ways it's worse than under
apartheid for much of the population but
it was nevertheless a major victory
major victory for justice to get rid of
this horrendous system and it turned on
one point what would the Godfather
decide soon as the u.s. decided will
join the world partly collapsed and I
think that something similar holds in
this case if Washington's position
shifts if the u.s. joins the world there
is a short-term settlement which is much
better than what exists now my own hope
would be and I think they didn't
probably feel the same way that if I
read it correctly that if the cycle of
violence declines if there is a formal
political settlement if the occupation
ends then other processes will begin to
take place anyone who's ever been in
that area knows that the dry to draw a
line through the area west of Jordan
makes absolutely no sense it just can't
be done and I suppose that commercial
and cultural and other relations will
develop and it might move towards what
at least in my view is a more sensible
longer term settlement but that's for
the future what's on the table right now
is which choice are we going to make
the occupation with exactly the way I
described or a political settlement as
has been the international consensus for
35 years okay
