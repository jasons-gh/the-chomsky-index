professor Chomsky could we start by
listening to explain what the propaganda
model as you call it is for many people
the idea that propaganda is used by
democratic rather than nearly
authoritarian governments will be a
strange one well the term propaganda
fell into disfavor at the around the
Second World War but in the 1920s in the
1930s it was commonly used and in fact
advocated by leading intellectuals by
the founders of modern political science
by wilsonian progressives and of course
by the public relations industry as a
necessary technique to overcome the
danger of democracy the institutional
structure of the media is quite
straightforward we're talking about the
United States it's not very different
elsewhere the the major there there are
sectors but the agenda-setting media the
ones that sort of set the framework for
everyone else like the New York Times
and The Washington Post and so on these
are major corporations parts of even
bigger conglomerates like other
corporate institutions they have a
product with an ax market their market
is advertisers that is other businesses
their product is privileged relatively
privileged audiences more or less that
selling audiences they're selling
privileged Audion these are big business
big corporations selling privileged
audiences to other corporations now the
question is what would a rat what
picture of the world would a rational
person expect to come out of this
structure then we draw some conclusions
about what you'd expect and then we
check and yes that's the picture of the
world that comes out and does this
anything more than the idea that
basically the press is relatively
right-wing with some exceptions because
it's owned by big business which is a
truism is well-known well I would call
the press relatively liberal here I
agree with the right-wing critics so
especially the New York Times and The
Washington Post and which are called
without a trace of irony the New York
Times is called the establishment left
in say major foreign policy journals and
that's correct but what's not recognized
is that the role of the liberal
intellectual establishment is to set
very sharp mountains on how far you can
go
this far and no further give me some
examples of well let's take say the
Vietnam War the probably leading critic
and in fact one of the leading dissident
intellectuals in the mainstream is
Anthony Lewis of the New York Times who
did finally come around to opposing the
Vietnam War about 1969 about a year and
a half after corporate America had more
or less ordered Washington to call it
off and his picture from then on is that
the war as he put it began with
blundering efforts to do good but it
ended up by 1969 being a disaster and
costing us too much so what was that on
the criticism what was the non
propaganda model have told Americans
about Vietnam war at the same time the
same thing that the mainstream press was
telling them about Afghanistan United
States invaded had first of all in the
1950s that set up a standard Latin
American style terror state which had
massacred tens of thousands of people
but was unable to mean to control local
a local uprising and everyone knows at
least every specialist knows that's what
it was and when Kennedy came in in 1961
they had to make a decision because the
government was collapsing under local
attack so the u.s. just invaded the
country in 1961 the US Air Force started
bombing South Vietnamese civilians
authorized napalm craft destruction then
in 1965 January February 1965 the next
major escalation took place against
South Vietnam not against North Vietnam
of the sideshow
that's what the honest press would be
saying but you can't find a trace of it
now if the press is a censoring
organization tell me how that works is
that you're not suggesting that
proprietors phone one another up or that
many journalists get their coffee spiked
as we say it's a tea or well you may
recall has an essay called literary
censorship in England which was supposed
to be the introduction to Animal Farm
except that it never appeared in which
he points out look I'm writing about a
totalitarian society but in free
democratic England that's not all that
different and then he says unpopular
ideas can be silenced without any force
and then it gives to sudden
a two-sentence response which is not
very profound but captures it he says
two reasons first the press is owned by
wealthy men who have ever interested not
having certain things appear but second
the whole educational system from the
beginning on through just X gets you to
understand that there are certain things
you just don't say well spelling these
things out that's perfectly correct I
mean there it's the first sentence is
what we expand it this is what I don't
get it suggests that I mean I'm a judge
could like me are self censoring no not
self centering your there's a filtering
system that starts in kindergarten
it goes all the way through and it's not
the work 100% but it pretty effective it
selects for obedience and subordination
and especially I think that says stroppy
people won't make it don't be influenced
behavior problems or if you read
applications to a graduate school you
see that people will tell you he's not
doesn't get along too well with his
colleague you know how to interpret
those nice I I'm just interesting this
because I was brought up like a lot of
people probably post the Watergate film
and so on to believe that journalism was
a crusading craft and that there were a
lot of disputatious stroppy difficult
people in germany and i have to say i
think i know some of them well i know
some of the best and best-known
investigative reporters in the united
states i won't mention names but they're
like whose attitude through the media is
much more cynical than mine
in fact they regard the media as a sham
and they know and they consciously talk
about how they try to play it like a
violin if they see a little opening
they'll try to squeeze something in the
ordinarily wouldn't make it through and
it's perfectly true that the mature
you're speaking for the majority of
journalists who are trained have it
driven into their heads that this is a
crusading of Creta
profession adversarial we stand up
against power very self-serving you on
the other hand in my opinion I hate the
neck a value judgment but the better
journalists and in fact the ones who are
often regarded as
the best journalist of quite a different
picture and I think a very realistic one
how can you how can you know that I'm
self censoring how can you know they
just entering I'm sure you believe
everything you're saying but what I'm
saying is if you believe something
different you wouldn't be sitting where
you're sitting
