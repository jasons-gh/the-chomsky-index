which is more serious is that it's
factually completely wrong there's
plenty of evidence that won't mention it
for a movement that yields no over
phenomenon associated with it so it
can't be right empirically so has two
serious problems and we ought to look
for a different account actually there
is a way of thinking about it that may
be right that derives from one of the
most interesting cases of movement that
leaves no physical evidence behind
that's based on work by Howard laz Nick
mainly a couple of others on what was
used to be called raising the object the
has to do with sentences like I expect
John to be intelligent where John
semantically is this belongs and the
clause John intelligent but it's
possible to show that it actually
appears in the higher clause which
doesn't make any semantic sense and it
gets there by a double movement
operation neither of which which don't
leap doesn't leave any effect namely
this of the downstair subject John and I
expected John to be intelligent John
moves over the verb and then the verb
moves up to the small V that heads the
phase and it leaves things looking
exactly as they were well that looks so
crazy that for quite a few years I work
pretty hard trying to find counter
evidence or some alternative analysis
and you see the residue of this in
various papers but it didn't work the
evidence looks solid so we're left with
this extremely strange phenomenon
there's a whole variety of semantic and
syntactic consequences to a movement
that makes note a double movement that
makes no sense at all because it leaves
things exactly the way they started from
the point of view for a year well that
reigned as a paradox until it was
noticed that you could get us
to this problem if you assume that the
properties of the head of the phase C in
the small V were actually inherited by
the element had selected it would be
tense and the verb in this case I won't
go through the you know the details but
if you assume that then these two
movements take place and you get the
array of syntactic and semantic
properties on the assumption of
inheritance of the feature now that the
inherence itself was pretty weekly
motivated with some motivation but not
much however it was pointed out by Mark
Richards that the inheritance is
actually entailed by the phase
impenetrability condition the condition
on transfer of the Interior and that
itself is very well motivated
conceptually and empirically so in fact
have a line of argument which goes from
the empirical and computational
motivation for the transfer operation
which yields the consequence inheritance
which yields as a consequence this array
of semantic and syntactic features the
properties that seemed to make no sense
but are clearly there well that's a good
result the kind of result you want and
if you'd make one more step you
generalize the inheritance of features
to the question element the cube that
call it that's determines that something
that C is a question not a declarative
if that too is inherited then you get
the vacuous movement hypothesis you can
think it through I won't run through it
but in fact it's true so without
stipulating a new principle which is
furthermore wrong you can get the
vacuous movement hypothesis with all of
its consequences including the case I
mentioned about so-called ecp case just
on the basis of pure third third factor
properties well
that's the kind of result one wants and
I won't go on but these are the sorts of
directions that I think it would make
sense to pursue that is chipping away as
much as you can at stipulated properties
of universal grammar technologies that
are proposed to deal with particular
problems try to see how closely you can
show that language does approximate to
the perfect design that would be rather
natural expectation in the light of what
appears to be its evolutionary history
so we have time we have time for just a
couple questions so yes sequential one
additional what are not any inflections
of caregivers and what as I understand
your questions well it has to do with
parallel grammars well I mean this is
what I was describing is a parallel
grammar so when you do repeated
construction of something by merge it's
all happening in parallel two
dimensional I think there's good reason
for thinking that I didn't go into it
that there is at least two
dimensionality this has to do with the
nature of adjunct as distinct from
arguments I think there's some evidence
that they're actually on a third
dimension these are actually proposals
to go back to ideas of chem sapphire and
others back in the 80s but I think you
can get a better formulation of them
which would mean if it's true that
there's actually two kinds of merge one
is just set merge takes x and y and
forms the set X Y and the other call it
peer merge takes x and y and gives the
pair XY where which builds in and a
symmetry and adjuncts having a symmetry
so the adjunct phrase behaves like as if
the agilent wasn't there you know
behaves like the thing to which it was a
joint two and i think there's it's
complicated but i think there's some
evidence for that however any further
complication that's introduced has to
have empirical motivation okay I mean
just you know elementary methodological
considerations you pick the simplest
possible theory unless you shown that
it's wrong because the facts are more
complex okay I think we have time for
one more question
yes Josh how does the current guidance
principle of perfection relates to the
classical original idea of simplicity in
the early days
yeah it's an interesting question i mean
theory yeah the fridge is a question is
how does the lost josh box user hat how
does the notion of simplicity in the
early days of generative grammar relate
to this notion of perfection or
perfectibility in the current sense well
if you go back to the early days the 50s
there were two concepts of simplicity
one is just the general concept that
holds for science altogether and nobody
can figure what it is but everyone
working in the sciences uses it as a
guiding principle so you look for
symmetries instead of a symmetries and
you try to have fewer principles instead
of more principles and so on and there's
all kind of work on this like Herman
vials book on symmetry and so on and so
forth but there's some kind of guiding
principle that works in the sciences
that's just accepted everywhere but
never formulated that says we're looking
for the simplest possible solution
that's a general methodological
principle it's no more relevant to
linguistics then to physics or history
or anything else that's one notion a
second notion was an internal notion of
simplicity and now that's an empirical
assumption remember that in those days
the assumption was that language
acquisition is sort of what charles
sanders peirce called abduction its
discovery of a theory on the basis of
data now it's perfectly well understood
and has been you know for hundreds of
years that there's no way to do this
that you can't do it by induction and
there's no generalizations and nothing
else it has to be something like what
purse described namely there's got to be
some built-in principles we would now
say genetically determined principles
that in his words limit available
hypotheses okay they just say well
here's the only set of hypotheses you
ought to look at so it eliminates you
know huge masses of others and that can
guide inquiry in a particular direction
now purse was thinking about development
of science
you know how do people discover quantum
of the early or something but the same
conception has to hold for acquisition
of language if indeed language as a
matter of theory construct language
acquisition is a matter of theory
construction which it was assumed to be
and it's in this context that the
internal notion of simplicity develop
can it was called an evaluation measure
can we find some measure that we can
assign to the possible grammars internal
languages that will pick the best one so
that's been some sharp limitation person
and type limitation on the set of
admissible grammars been your pick one
and inside that came the notion of
simplicity so that's where you get you
know notational devices like brackets
and parentheses and counting features
and stuff like that but notice that
that's an empirical hypothesis okay it
says this is the way languages are
picked okay all that sort of went out
the window when the principles and
parameters approach was formulated back
around nineteen eighty this was a really
sharp change in the way language was
looked at I mean maybe it's wrong but it
looks right in any event it changed
things perspectives radically it said
there is no evaluation procedure and
there's no abductive principle and
you're not discovered child isn't
discovering theory there are principles
which are fixed unchanged and if the smt
is correct may in fact follow from
general natural law to a large extent
but there are principles that are fixed
and then there's a set of choices called
parameters and the child just has to
find the values for the parameters well
it's going to be finally many of these
that we finally many languages and most
of the work on language acquisition
since then has been studying very
productively what kind of data would
allow a child to fix parameter and you
know it turns out you can't do it one at
a time a lot of complexities arise and
so on but with that approach you
eliminate the notion of evaluation
procedure and what we're left with is
just the general notion
complicity or how does that relate to
the present case it's a sort of a way of
trying to take the methodological
principle of simplicity that's used for
all ank worry and see if we can give it
a instead of an epistemological
interpretation give it a metaphysical
interpretation say okay this is a real
property of nature okay it's not just
some mythological principle we use but
it's a property of nature that it that
it has confidence seeks computational
efficiency it's a natural law if it is
it ought to show up in you know
distribution of determining the neural
wiring of a nematode to pick one example
where it seems to work it should show up
in foraging strategies for you know for
ants let's say and in all sorts of
places should just be the way nature
works so it's a shift from viewing
something as an epistemological
principle of some vague kind to a
metaphysical principal at a physical
presence if you like something that's
really true of nature which you can
explore in many different ways so to
take a concrete example it's always been
assumed in the actual study of language
that if you have redundancy in a system
it's probably something wrong so for
example Mars how is famous argument
against phonemes back whatever it is
almost 50 years ago I guess was based on
the structuralist phonemes on the
observation that if you postulated this
level you had to duplicate rules one in
forming the level and one in mapping the
level on to the next stage and the same
rule so was redundant well just on
epistemological grounds that was taken
at least by sensible people like me as a
proof that the level doesn't exist but
you could reinterpret that as saying
that's just not the way nature works you
know the way nature works is
smt and optimal neural wiring and so on
and so forth so it's a and if you take
it that way it shifts from a
methodological principle to an empirical
principle that you can investigate like
you could say well doesn't eicher really
work this way let's try other cases and
that's a step forward that's but that's
the relation smt is an empirical
hypothesis about the way nature works
