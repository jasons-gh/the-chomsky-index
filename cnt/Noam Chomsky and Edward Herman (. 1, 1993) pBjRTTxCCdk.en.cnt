Herman taught for many years at the
University of Pennsylvania at the
Wharton School prior to that he taught
at Penn State University he's written
many books some of which I look are
listed on your program there's many
others that you're probably aware of
he currently edits the magazine called
lives of our times which he brought us
some sample copies anybody would like to
take one he also writes regularly for Z
Magazine one of the one of the better
magazines in America and he's currently
or last year or so he's taught some some
courses on media analysis at the
Annenberg Center at the University of
Pennsylvania and and and maybe best of
all he's also a member of our group
which was always nice to happen so first
we'll have dr. Anne Herman to accept the
award and give us a little message here
tonight
[Applause]
I'm a tall guy or I need this I need
this loose
thanks very much Bob and I'm very
pleased to be the recipient of the ward
and to be getting it here with my
esteemed colleague Noam Chomsky my talk
tonight was addressed to the question
that does socialism have a future
socialism has suffered some very severe
blows as you are all aware in the last
few years virtually all the world's
regimes and experiments that have called
themselves socialists have been defeated
or removed from power by external or
internal political and military
processes this has been a very serious
setback for socialists Social Democrats
and leftist everywhere
it has terminated experiments that
whatever their weaknesses many of us had
hoped might strengthen over time it's
weakened the barriers to the great
capitalist powers military economic
assaults on socialist and Social
Democrat Democratic outcroppings in the
third world and it's badly damaged
socialist and left morale and spirit of
hope this set of defeats raises three
questions that I want to discuss briefly
here one was it socialism that was
defeated our systems so far removed from
socialism that the word is not at all
applicable to why were the really
existing socialism's defeated and
finally is socialism finished or does it
have a future to answer the first
question in fact to answer although we
must first answer the further question
what is socialism most socialists would
agree that socialism cannot be an
authoritarian or totalitarian order that
it must include
fully Democratic mode of political
governance it must also include
community and worker ownership and
control of major producing assets and it
must embody a strong policy thrust
toward both equalitarian ISM
inclusiveness and libertarianism the
really existing social isms have
generally not met the first and parts of
the second and third conditions they
have been bureaucratic and centrally
controlled by a self-appointed Vanguard
and not libertarian their versions of
socialism has involved mainly state
ownership and control and an
equalitarian thrust plus some socialist
rhetoric that was often hypocritical and
Orwellian so the answer to the first
question question is that a case can be
made that socialism has never been tried
the defeated socialism's were at best
imperfect socialism's at worst they were
perverted versions they were also
however under steady pressure and
sometimes fierce attacks from the West
which weakened the possibilities of
improvement which brings me to my second
question why did the really existing
socialism suffer such defeat of course
and very important factors were the
conditions under which they arose almost
all the social isms of the world came in
rather poor countries they came
frequently after Wars there were
countries that were not particularly
well developed they were economically
there were countries that had traditions
that were not democratic traditions and
so when they then these governments came
into power these socialist governments
came into power they were always in
distress circumstances they were always
having to recover to try
to mobilize the population to to
development and to simple recovery and
they had very little managerial talent
and of course all these things were
badly exacerbated by the fact that the
West Was was hostile to them from
beginning to end the force of that
hostility I think has been greatly
underestimated in fact in the West it's
a print a principle idea that has been
fostered for many years is that the West
has been on defense against socialism
socialism has been a threat that we are
containing the West it is it presented a
challenge to which has required us to
defend it in fact professor Chomsky and
his book deterring democracy has a very
nice chapter on the Cold War where he
has an excellent discussion of the
literature in which it is established
that the Soviets by coming into
existence challenged us they presented a
new idea they had a potential threat and
therefore many intellectuals and
officials have argued that that caused
us to have to defend ourselves so
everything we did against them including
invading them immediately upon their
arrival was strictly defense by
definition we were only on the defense
that is straight out of George Orwell
and in fact the case I am making right
at the moment is that this the the
socialist world has been under
unremitting attack at all levels that
was under unremitting military and
terroristic attack from the beginning
the Soviet Union itself was invaded
before it even existed and it was
attacked subsequently by Hitler in the
post-world War two period as you know
was it was encircled it was under
constant military threat it was under
steady military pressure and in fact the
on the arms race was to a very large
extent an American effort that was
explicitly designed to impoverish the
Soviet Union to put it under economic
pressure
supporter country and take it take all
the other grew socialism China it was
attacked after immediately after the
Civil War the United States funded the
Nationalists who were on the Burmese
border they of course protected Zhang
kai-shek we almost had a bomb China
during the Korean War period
so China was under steady warfare
effectively the Vietnam War itself was
considered by China quite plausibly to
be a very serious threat to its national
security the great power across the
ocean was attacking its neighbor it was
it was a national security threat we
have had the most marvelous capability
of seeing national security threats
everywhere to us but whatever we do
surrounding other countries attacking
their neighbors and this is not
plausibly a threat to them they should
understand that we are people of
goodwill
they're also of course has been
condemned and continuing efforts also at
subversion use of black propaganda
buying politicians and military
personnel the most famous cases are the
ones that I've always been most fond of
are Brazil and Chile in Brazil the
United States practically took over the
country buying newspapers buying
politicians on a huge scale before 1964
buying the army and the police and
ultimately succeeding and getting the
subversion but realized in a military
coup though that we were really
essentially part of the same thing was
true in Chile
we've also carried out continuous
economic warfare against all the
socialist hours Soviet Union China
Vietnam Guatemala Cuba Nicaragua
the design of these efforts by the West
had been to force increased arms
expenditures to weaken these countries
economically and to force them into the
Soviet bloc to create fear and to
curtail Liberty the in effect what we've
been we were trying to do all the time
was to engage in a self-fulfilling
prophecy we prophesied that these
countries were were non libertarian we
were going to darn well help make them
non libertarian and they were we were
wanted them to be Marxist Leninist so we
would force them into the Soviet camp by
boycotting and then we would be proving
that they were had these Marxist
Leninist tendencies and were affiliating
with the Soviet Union we did that time
and again very important to understand
that these efforts of the United States
in reference to countries like Nicaragua
or Cuba or Guatemala were never to
democratize they were always to
destabilize and destroy we just did not
want social democratic and socialist
countries so while we might be attacking
Nicaragua for years on the ground that
we wanted a more democratic Nicaragua
nobody with any sense whatsoever could
possibly fall for that nonsense we had
supported Somoza for forty five years
the same government was proclaiming a
deep interest in in democracy in
Nicaragua was kindly supporting Saudi
Arabia Pakistan anybody you might name
so that hypocrisy was absolutely
mind-blowing the and the reality was
clearly that the Sandinistas represented
some what is what so of Oxfam study
called a threat of a good example it was
an alternative way of organizing
economic life it was not even really
socialism but social democracy we
couldn't bear it so we used all the
means at our power disposer disposal to
eliminate that threat
admittedly the leaders and the
bureaucrats of the Soviet bloc countries
performed poorly and lost the respect of
their own people and much of this
happened independently a Western policy
but the West exacerbated the worst
tendencies of these efficient
socialism's and when they showed signs
of some positive changes the West took
advantage of these in the case of the
Eastern Bloc with the assistance of
significant parts of the old Jurek
bureaucracies in the soviet union in
eastern europe to destabilize them and
pull them quickly into the western orbit
in cases like vietnam Nicaragua
Guatemala under Arbenz Chile under IND
and one Bosh's Dominican Republic even
Republican social democracy was never
given a chance but was actively
destabilized or attacked I think it is
very greatly underrated the extent to
which the triumph of the market and what
Clinton is now calling market-based
democracies which are not very
democratic dependent on sheer force
violence and terrorism to achieve their
final ends the social doesn't have a
future it's hard to be very optimistic
given the recent defeats and the power
of the global market system and its
enforcers but there are these several
important threads of hope one is that
the market-based democracies are
increasingly serving a small elite and
marginalizing the majority of people
they're creating what we might call a
global reserve army of labor and uncared
for people they are our market and we
have to be prepared to serve them
furthermore the fundamental principles
of the triumphant market economy that is
possessive individualism competition the
profit motive is the dynamic of the
system and its basis on enlarging
consumption and growth continuously are
incompatible
and ecological and environmental reality
and human survival as they fail and this
in these regards our market will swell
further in an important sense therefore
the triumph of socialist values is a
condition for human survival this should
give us an additional incentive to keep
our ideas in play it even constitutes a
kind of moral imperative thank you very
much
[Applause]
our next speaker like our first
recipient as I forgot to mention is a
native of Philadelphia
dr. Noam Chomsky received his PhD in
linguistics from the University of
Pennsylvania many of us first learned of
him and his work during the Vietnam War
when he was a very early and very
outspoken activist and critic against
the war in Vietnam as the author of many
many books only a few of which are
listed here I mean let me not be
spreading disinformation dr. Chomsky has
never appeared on Nightline I'm not sure
if it has to do something with Ted's
toupee or not but I think it's more of a
matter of principle he was asked to
appear and he declined he's known
throughout the world for his work in
language and has made contributions to
linguistics and psychology and also
course to political and international
rights human rights and we're very
pleased to have him here tonight to
accept the maoist humble work
[Applause]
thank you very much I guess I should
explain to you why I what is this okay
yeah why wasn't that a nightline uh I
actually was asked once there was a
study done by fair was it fair do study
on Nightline asking it just a long
analysis of who had been on and who
hadn't been on the results that you can
imagine and that day I got a call from
the creature's Nightline saying
goodnight you know could I be on the
next day and I said well I'm gonna be
out in Wyoming next day I can't make it
they said don't worry we'll send a team
out to Wyoming a lot of these conditions
I mean I know what you're up to do you
know what you're up to
they also asked me one other time and
this tells you what all of these guys
are really about they asked me it was
right after the fall of the Berlin Wall
and they wanted me to be on it was
perfectly obvious setup I knew exactly
what was coming and I said no I'm not
going to be young and a little later I
got a call from my friend Alex Coburn
whom you all know and he said he'd just
been asked to be on Nightline what I
think and I said you crazy if you go on
he said oh well they would go anyway
alright and he went and I don't know if
you saw that he actually wrote an
article about it afterwards they had him
sitting there in a room and you know
part of the deal and Nightline as you're
not you can't see Ted Koppel he can only
see you that's supposed to give him a
psychological advantage or something
like that
so he was sitting there in whatever room
he's in and they showed a picture of the
Berlin Wall falling and
people cheering and so on and so forth
then they went over to him and they said
well mr. Coburn what do you have to say
about that you know wait a minute you
know tried to get a sentence in your a
lot about two sentences and after his
two sentences they said thank you mr.
Cober and then they went over to the you
know head of the Communist Party that's
the head and I have been working
together for years at a joint book
published 20 years ago succeeded in
putting the publisher out of business
when the corporation didn't like it and
close down the publisher to prevent it
from being distributed and a lot of
water under the bridge since then and we
kind of divided the turf more or less he
was talking about the future of
socialism so I guess I had to talk about
the future of capitalism and democracy
or the future of capitalist democracy or
for that matter past with capitalism I
think speaking about the past of
capitalism could be an extremely short
talk because it has no past it's been
tried occasionally in the rich countries
their brief experiments with capitalism
there would be very quickly called off
by the business community because no one
in the business community wants to
subject themselves to the ravages of the
market so the only places where so they
call in a powerful state intervene and
protect them and so on there are a few
places where capitalism indeed has been
tried for example in the last ten years
there are 76 countries that have
undergone structural adjustment programs
that's real capitalism every one of them
is a complete disaster
there's the constant property that all
of them have is that Labor's share in
the economy the share of working people
and and economic product is declining
rapidly and in fact that's the point you
know to the extent that market systems
are applied it's in weak countries weak
defense defenseless countries and it is
imposed essentially to make them even
more defense defense was these market
experiments that are imposed on the poor
countries 76 of them in the last decade
they go right back to Britain in the
18th century the first first major such
experiment was in Bengal which was
conquered by Britain in the mid 18th in
1757 they imposed an experiment in
market economies with total disaster
this was one of the richest areas in the
world at the time competitive with
England within a 50 or 60 years it was
destroyed now it's Bangladesh and that's
that's what happens when capitalism is
tried and since rich people understand
that they know perfectly well it's not
for them any lingering illusions that
capitalism might be a viable system
we're finished by the 1930s and since
then there has been no experiment with
it in in the rich countries or with
markets except when you can get
temporary advantage then you know
they'll be brief periods when people
will talk about market well what about
the capitalist democracy it's supposed
to have a big future in fact that's one
of the shibboleths of the day so the
chief diplomatic correspondent of the
new york times otherwise known as the
state department spokesman at the New
York Times Thomas Friedman right after
the Gulf War had an article talking
about the grand future ahead of us and
he said that America's victory in the
Cold War is a victory for a set of
principles democracy and the free market
the world is coming to understand that
the free market is the wave of the
future
a future for which America is both the
gatekeeper and the model that word
gatekeeper
kind of an ominous ring to it and I want
to say a couple of words about how we
keep the gates and who we let in and
what kind of a model we intend to offer
for the world or for that matter for
ourselves which is interesting I think
the that all this has come moved from
front pages of the New York Times to
national policy in the last couple of
days this week there have been there
were the announcement of this new
Clinton doctrine every president has to
have a doctrine and the Clinton doctrine
was announced the five or six days ago
it was a week ago I guess by Anthony
Lake the National Security Advisor in a
major address which was written up all
over the press and the it starts like
this I'll just read the first sentence
throughout the Cold War we contained a
global threat to market democracies and
now we should seek to enlarge their
reach so up until now it was containment
of a threat to global democracy now its
enlargement of capitalist democracy of
market democracy well that's pretty
impressive
instead in fact the headline in the New
York Times said vision of foreign policy
reversed not just changed but reversed
so really big story well if a rational
person wanted to know what to say let's
say an enemy Soviet Union was trying to
do in the world what they were trying to
do in the world
suppose you're rational what you would
ask is what what in fact did they do in
places where they could influence things
that's the obvious question you know
ten-year-old can figure that out
similarly if you want to find out what
we try what the u.s. tried to do in the
world during this past period of
containment
the obvious question placed the question
I ask is what didn't the US leadership
do in places where they had influence
now that's a much bigger region to test
than the Soviet Union which was a small
power but the obvious place to look is
where the influence was greatest and in
of course greatest in Latin America
Latin America's - one place where the
United States was able to impose its
image and its vision literally without
impediment especially after the Second
World War when the rivals of the United
States Britain and France were
unceremoniously kicked out of the
hemisphere and the u.s. took it over for
itself and we can see what has happened
is a much longer experience in the
Caribbean region but let's just take
since the Second World War
well according to this thesis which we
are supposed to admire throughout the
Cold War we contained the global threat
to market democracy in Latin America so
it therefore follows for example say to
take Ed's example that when the Kennedy
administration organized and laid the
basis for the destruction of
parliamentary democracy in Brazil in
reflected soon to be replaced by a
neo-nazi regime of generals and
torturers in 1964 that was an example of
our containing a global threat to market
democracy in Latin America well in fact
it was indeed described that way I
should say Kennedy's ambassador Lincoln
Gordon described the imposition of Nazi
style terror the world word is not
exaggerated as a democratic revolution a
great victory for the free world the
single most decisive victory of freedom
in the mid 20th century which becomes
the punchline which should create a
greatly improved climate for foreign
investment so there's at least the sort
of a partial truth to the statement that
we defended capital market democracies
and contained a threat to them namely
there was a threat it's true an
indigenous democratic threat to improve
profits for foreign investment and
therefore we overthrew a parliamentary
regime and
instituted fascist terror now Brazil is
a particularly interesting case actually
first of all because it's the richest
and most advanced country in Latin
America with enormous advantages there
will be one of the richest countries in
the world enormous resources no foreign
enemies had the benefit of American
guidance and in fact control virtually
since 1945 and indeed it is described or
was until about two years ago described
as a great success story for American
capitalism I did an interesting book on
it by the senior historian of the CIA I
didn't know there was such a position
until I read the book highly regarded
the monographic study of how the United
States took over Brazil in 1945 and was
going to make it a testing area for
scientific methods of capitalist
development and then it describes how we
did it and fantastic it was and how it
worked out and writing in 1989 he says
this is a success story for American
capitalism that we really worked it
there and so it's not described that way
anymore
now it's described as a failure of
socialist state ISM you know because
what happened is the whole thing which
was horrible enough at that time became
a total disaster so now it's a failure
of interference with the market up till
then over for 50 40 years over 45 years
it was a success of the capitalist
development and indeed it is a very
interesting case people talk about this
whatever you think about the Soviet
Union my opinion is they eliminated any
any socialist tendencies by about 1918
but whatever we think about it take your
choice if you want to ask whether it was
it successful or was it a failure again
if you're a sort of semi rational what
you the question you'll ask is how does
it compare with other countries that
were roughly like that say in 1950 same
with East Europe in general I mean to
ask the question that's constantly asked
in the West you know how to
look look how lousy East Europe is
looking a great we at Western Europe is
that shows how wonderful we are awful
they are I mean that's question that
doesn't even rise to the level of idiocy
these regions haven't been awake for six
centuries East Europe is the original
third world started declining relative
to the West even in pre-columbian times
by the early part of this century was a
deeply impoverished service area
providing typical third-world services
to the West there were countries that
you might compare it with you know
history never gives perfect examples but
there are plausible comparisons that can
be made well it might be not
unreasonable to compare say Russia and
Brazil for example or say you know
Bulgaria and Guatemala that sort of
thing
and if in fact if you carry out those
comparisons which are the ones that
would make sense it's not really a fair
comparison because remember Brazil had
no enemies was never under attack had
huge capital flow had the benefit of
American tutelage dopher yet for 50
years it's now in fact in some respect
if you look at Brazil today or tomorrow
or for that matter for the Philippines
or any of the other countries you might
want to compare with Eastern Europe what
you find is about the same everywhere
Brazil is a good case you find about 5%
of the population who in fact are living
extremely well Western European
standards super-rich maybe even better
maybe eight percent something like that
you find about 80 percent of the
population that's living like Central
Africa and then some in between in fact
Brazil one of the richest countries
potentially one of the richest countries
in the world with very nice
macroeconomic statistics you know if
they think one of the biggest growth
rates in the 20th century
ranks 80th in the UN Development indices
right next to Albania
that's the success of capitalism in fact
if you compare say Guatemala
it's another showcase of democracy and
capitalism we called it when we
overthrew the parliamentary government
in 1954 as part of our containing a
global threat to market democracies it
was going to be a showcase of democracy
and capitalism for money and and so on
it's a country which ever since then has
been run by guys who could have easily
rubbed shoulders with Himmler and
gurbles always with our support if you
compare it with say well the area are
Hungary or whatever or you compare say
Brazil with Russia what you find is that
for maybe five or ten percent of the
population the countries the countries
that we regard as showcases for them
they would regard Eastern Europe is
awful for about 80% of the population
they probably regarded as a paradise
well is this a success or is this a
failure well you know that's a value
judgment depends whether you care about
the five percent of the very rich people
or whether you care about the 80 percent
who are living at the level of Albania
or less because remember that's the
average well in fact that's the that's
the rational question across the board
and indeed more general analyses show
exactly the same thing let me just
continue with it Brazil incidentally is
not you might argue Brazil's a bad
example we didn't do too well there so
you go to Chile or Guatemala or you know
Philippines you when does he take your
choice it's always the same I can't find
an exception for this this is the
pattern throughout that's the way we've
been containing global threats to market
democracies and the bottom line is
exactly what Lincoln Gordon Kennedy's
ambassador said we are trying to create
a greatly improved climate for a foreign
investment that's the issue I mean if
they can do it with parliamentary
systems great if they
can have to do have neo-nazi murders
it's okay to in any event that's the
kind of market democracy we want to
preserve now if you look at Latin
America as a whole and remember Latin
America is the place to look at if you
ask a rational question about what we've
been trying to do you find some
interesting things the World Bank in
fact had a study that just came out
about three or four days ago which on
latin america pointing out that latin
america had the worst inequality of
income in the world in fact the World
Bank is worried about it they're not a
bunch of radicals as you may have heard
they were afraid that Latin America is
heading for what they called chaos
because the distribution of income is so
unequal so radically unequal and poverty
and misery are so extraordinary that the
place is going to go and fall into chaos
meaning even foreign investors may
suffer and that's of course what counts
why is the distribution of income more
unequal in Latin America than any place
in the world is that related to the fact
that it has been completely under our
control for 50 years and much of it for
much longer well if you look at the
record you get some answers to this
question you won't find them in the
press for sure
or even in a scholarly literature but
you can get some answers you can go back
to the period when we were designing the
New World Order that the last New World
Order back around 1945 when we took over
Latin America kicked out arrivals
kicked out the British and the French
and took it over there was a us remember
at the time was extremely powerful I
mean able to control and dominate much
of the world and
Latinamerica do basically what I wanted
and there was a debate at that time
about how to organize Latin America very
sharp conflict really I'll just give it
to you from the point of view of the
State Department we now have the
Declassified record the State Department
described the conflict as follows
they said the Latin American countries
are are dominated by what they called
the philosophy of the new nationalism
the for economic nationalism as it was
sometimes called according to the
phenomena the economic nationalism the
dominant idea in these countries
conservative governments and so on but
the dominant idea there was that there
should be a broader distribution of
wealth a raising of the stamp quoting
now raising the standard of living and
the commitment to the idea that the
first beneficiaries of a country's
wealth should be the people of that
country okay that's the economic
nationalism the philosophy the new
nationalism well the United States was
flatly opposed to that and there was a
hemispheric meeting in February 1945
where the issue came to a head this is
planning the New World Order the u.s.
presented what it called an economic
charter for the hemp for America of
which the fundamental idea was and these
were the words to end economic
nationalism in all its forms
meaning give up the idea that the first
beneficiaries of countries wealth are
the people of that country because the
first beneficiaries of the country's
wealth are foreign investors if the
people the country can get something
from it but what's called trickle-down
that's okay you don't really insist
we're not outright Nazis like we no I
insist that they suffer it's just that
that can't be the first priority as for
equality forget it that's not even a
goal and you end up with the World Bank
report earlier this week they are
supposed to follow market principles
that was made explicit Brazil for
example was allowed to develop but in a
way which was complementary to us to the
US economy meaning then I lied
in any fashion that might compete with
us they're supposed to do things that we
don't want to do like or can't do like
produce coffee or maybe you know cheap
cheap labor of a simple kind that we
don't feel like doing or something of
that kind
they have to be complimentary to our
economy and and there's good reasons for
that anyone who's taken an economics
course can sort of spill it out you can
prove a theorem basically that says yeah
this is gives you the optimal optimal
efficiency we do the things we're good
at they do the things they're good at
happens that what we're good at is you
know manufacturing and finance and
investment and banking and high-tech and
so on and what they're good at it is
picking coffee beans and you know maybe
doing some simple manufacturing the ones
we don't feel like anymore and that's
the way it has to work that's a market
economy based on the holy principle of
comparative advantage well you find that
another short there are reasons why the
situation is the way it is now in a
minimally rational person I mean a
person who is capable of analyzing
Soviet behavior and what they were up to
by asking well what did they do in
Eastern Europe such person would have
something to say about the thesis that
in the past throughout the Cold War we
contained a global threat to market
democracies well so far I haven't really
talked about the-- I've only talked
about the democracy and a little bit
about the market part let me go on with
that one might argue maybe this has
changed in the last couple of years like
maybe the last decade which is supposed
to be a decade in which we struggle for
democracy things were different I won't
give you my judgment on that let me
quote from a more interesting source one
of the people who's done the best most
intensive historical work on this last
decade as an interesting person actually
he's Thomas Carruthers who's the State
Department State Department official who
was involved in who was in charge of
Latin American Latin American affairs
and has recently written both
and articles looking at our attitude
toward democracy in Central America in
Latin America in the 1980s the period
when he was in the State Department and
they're good and careful articles and
well reviewed and so on and so forth
and indeed he finds a correlation
between US influence and democracy in
this decade correlation is negative that
is where US influence was least
democracy did best so in the Southern
Cone of Latin America where US influence
was least there was some progress in
democracy which the Reagan
administration was strongly opposed to
incidentally though finally they kind of
accommodated to it in places where our
influence was greatest the achievements
of democracy of active they were the
decline of democracy was the greatest
that's his conclusion and he goes on to
make a more credit crucial point I think
not just the correlation he says that
the u.s. did try to support democracy
and here's the way it did it I'll quote
him the u.s. adopted pro-democracy
policies as a means of relieving
pressure for more radical change but
inevitably sought only limited top-down
forms of democratic change that did not
risk upsetting the traditional structure
of power with which the United States
has always been a lie okay so in other
words democracy is fine as long as it
comes out the way we demand which means
that rich sectors allied to Western
investors are running the show and
everybody else is out of a game if
democracy can lead to that result it's
fine if democracy doesn't lead to that
result we destroy it because we have an
outcome in mind and the outcome has to
be achieved well that's an accurate
description not just for the last ten
years but for a long time and that's the
sense in which we have been supporting
containing threats to market democracies
incidentally what about the threat so
like was there a communist threat in
Latin
America says they take Brazil in 1945
when we took it over there's a lot of
talk about a communist threat but as the
senior historian of the CIA points out
US intelligence could not find any
evidence of any Russian interest in
Brazil if even if they had been able to
get in somehow it is unimaginable they
weren't trying and so the story
continues the only time and the only
place where the Russians were ever in
Latin America is when we virtually
invited them in so if if we decided to
attack and destroy a country likes a
democratic capitalist Guatemala in 1954
they did quite often turn to somebody
for help under air attack and the place
they were going to get help was the
Russians and then you know the Russians
became a threat they were interfering
with our attempt to overthrow a
government saying the same way we were a
threat to the Russians when we supported
the resistance in Afghanistan when
Russia invaded it and I suppose some
equivalent of Thomas Friedman and
Anthony Lake and so on under in
communist Russia would in fact have said
that we were the threat to them because
we were defending targets of their
attack
well that's foreign communists what
about indigenous communists were they a
threat I hear an interesting question
arises a general question well suppose
they were you know we're interested in
democracy what follows from that however
we need not ask that question because
there's a preliminary one and that is
what's a communist well here the
internal US record is quite illuminating
if you look at the Declassified secret
record of you know discussion they talk
about this it sort of tells you the
answer and it tells you that there were
plenty of communists so for example
Eisenhower and Dulles back in the 1950s
we're deploring the successes of
Communists all over the place and
Eisenhower was particularly concerned
about these are all quotes about the
fact that they can appeal directly to
the masses and Dulles says yeah they
have an ability to get control of mass
movement something we have no capacity
duplicate the poor people are the ones
they appeal to and they have always
wanted to plunder the rich so that's the
Communists they these guys who appeal to
the poor who have always tried to
plunder the rich the big problem in
world history
and we can't duplicate it somehow we are
finding it very hard to sell our idea
that the rich should plunder the poor
you know some kind of for some reason
which we understand they always seem to
beat us in this game some public
relations problem we haven't yet
overcome well from this point of view
there's plenty of communists around so
for example if a priest is organizing a
Bible study group and El Salvador in the
1970s which is becoming a self-help
group or something he's helping the poor
plunder the rich taking what's
rightfully ours and our clients there
and therefore he's a communist and if we
send in the death squads and in that
sense it's quite true that we have been
containing a global threat to market
democracy where you remember that market
democracy means a climate favourable
climate for investors that's market
democracy top-down if you can get away
with it Nazi murderers if you can't and
containment means stopping these people
who are plundering the rich now without
continuing because you can add thousands
of examples and this is really very
systematic there is an interesting fact
about our own intellectual culture that
comes from considering these questions I
mean all of this is sort of like
trivialities I mean these are things
that ought to be you know there's
nothing here that would tax the
intelligence of a ten-year-old the these
are the questions that we at would be
asked by any intelligent ten-year-old
who hears that throughout the Cold War
we contain the global threat to market
democracies or who hears some say some
pre Gorbachev Russian saying throughout
the Cold War we contain the threat to
people's democracy seeking freedom first
question to ask is questions like these
well what did you do where you had
influence
and the answer is very clear what you
did do where you have influence and
what's interesting about our own society
is that nobody can ask that question
that question appears nowhere it is
assumed that it is taken for granted
even more than it would have been
installing US Russia that the doctrine
must be true we were containing global
threat to to market democracies even
though the evidence is virtually a
hundred percent against it the question
can't be asked now you know that's an
achievement it's an achievement of our
educational system event of our
ideological institutions and so on in
fact of our whole intellectual culture
and achievement which I don't think
could be Mack matched in a totalitarian
state if you look at it comparative
level it can't be matched and that's
impressive and it's worth thinking about
and it suggests something about the
future of market democracy incidentally
well let's start stop the drivel about
democracy and have a look at the market
the idea that we've been defending a
market is at least partially true we
certainly have been defending a market
for countries we intend to rob and
plunder we do much better if they have a
market system that means the third world
and now Eastern Europe returning to its
third world past but what about us well
big story but let's start with something
that's right on the front pages now the
last couple of days the business
sections not the front page of The Wall
Street Journal you know business section
of the New York Times there's been an
announcement of another new Clinton
policy in addition to the Clinton
doctrine this is a new national export
strategy the new national export
strategy that Clinton announced with
great fanfare says that now the
export-import bank is going to subsidize
exports of US product separate from that
there's a side one that says a three
billion dollar subsidy is going to be
given the purchasers state subsidy
meaning
we pay for taxpayer subsidy through
purchases of American ships they say of
course things like this have been done
in the past but this goes far beyond the
less coordinated efforts of the bush
Reagan administration now we're going to
have a massive program of state subsidy
of exports okay now they didn't mention
that the less coordinated Bush Reagan
program was already in violation of the
GATT rules and was condemned and it was
conceded by the head of the
export-import bank to be in violation of
the GATT rules not a secret but that
wasn't enough yeah you know they traded
free trading original story supposedly
now we're going to go beyond that and
the new export strategy is going to be a
much more well organized an extreme
violation of the principles of economic
liberalism the violations under the
Reagan administration or conceded we're
part of their general assault on profit
on economic liberalism to which they
were radically opposed virtually every
industrial country has become more
protectionist in the last decade or so
but the United States led the way in
many respects with regard to barriers to
imports we in fact did lead the way Jim
wasn't a big secret James Baker
secretary my name is Secretary of
Treasury announced proudly that the
administration had done more to impose
protectionist barriers in favor of
American industry than any previous
post-war administration which is quite
true in fact they imposed more
protectionist barriers than all post-war
administration's put together side
that's just a marginal part of the state
intervention and the violation of the
market the Pentagon for example is a
huge violation of the market system
that's a major system by which the
taxpayer subsidies high subsidizes
high-tech industry which wouldn't exist
unless it was for this enormous subsidy
and we can go on and on but that's not
enough
now we have to go on with a new export
strategy that violates it even more
dramatically now the government then say
the New York Times can see all of this
they concede the quote the times that we
oppose the policies we are now in
lamenting which to continue to with the
times these policies were implementing
in which we opposed amount to government
subsidies that distort international
markets and therefore we oppose them
because we're committed to free trade
but we're implementing well sounds a
little complicated but you have to
understand the subtleties which are
explained in the next paragraph it's
right for us to violate these principles
because that increases that's a
contribution to market principles here's
the reason which was actually given by
the promoting the president of the
export-import Bank he says by creating
such a program
you know governments up to the program
of government subsidies which interferes
with international markets by creating
such a program in the United States
meaning expanding the already GATT
violating program the Clinton
administration will have more influence
in seeking international limits on such
programs so by by interfering even more
radically than in the past with market
principles already violated principles
but by doing even more radically we can
we have more influence on getting others
to stop doing it now that's a familiar
logic which you've heard all the time
you know war brings peace you know arms
production brings the elimination of
arms wall crime brings law-abiding
behavior and so on standard now we see
it applied with regard to principles of
the market and there's a simple way of
putting it if you're not a subtle type
the simple way of putting it anything
goes as long as there's a good answer to
the question what's in it for us now
that phrase I also stole from the new
Clinton administration actually from the
New York Times report of another aspect
of the new Clinton doctrine just a few
days ago namely their report of of a
White House panel on intervention along
with the new
word strategy and the new Clinton
doctrine there was a White House panel
on intervention that met last that has
been meeting but gave its report last
week and The Times report on this has
you know the highlighted words are what
is in it for us the conclusion of the
panel on intervention is from now on any
time there's going to be intervention we
ask what's in it for us okay idea is
that there's not going to be any more
altruism no more of this good guy
business in other words we're going to
the kind of altruism that we
demonstrated when we turned large areas
of the world into graveyards and deserts
and Central America and Southeast Asia
and so on that's over none of that nice
stuff from now on we just ask what's in
it for us just as with the new export
strategy where the Secretary of Treasury
Lloyd Bentsen nice of Kennedy liberal
said when it was announced I'm tired of
these level playing field
from now on we're going to tilt the
playing field towards us so no more a
nice guy I should continue with the
report on the lake doctrine which I gave
part of us vision of foreign policy
reversed here's its essence as described
in the New York Times Thomas Friedman
with the Soviet nuclear threat gone
where and how we intervene abroad is a
matter of choice in other words as long
as the Soviet threat was around there
was deterrent we had to be careful where
we intervene now we're going to kind of
intervene anywhere we feel like that's
the essence of the new doctrine we will
do it an answer to the question what's
in it for us and with regard to
interventions in the market no more
filling around we always violated those
principles but now we're going to tilt
the playing field even more in our
direction
there is actually a technical name for
all of this it's called the politics of
meaning
those of you who follow this stuff well
actually there's nothing new in any of
this except greater freedom to do what
we've always done in the past namely
radically interfere with market
principles and destroy democracy except
for top-down forms that leave they're
the guys who do our business in charge I
mean that's history you know that's the
way it works that's what we've been
doing for a long time in fact since the
origins of the american republic i we're
not much more able to do with them in
the past with the soviet deterrent gone
according to the clinton doctor and we
can now do it anywhere in the last 50
years we've been able to do it globally
at being a huge power earlier you know
you can only do it around the caribbean
and so on or on our own you know what
became our own territory when we
exterminated the native population now
it can be global that's the new doctrine
with these principles let's say another
word about our attitude toward markets
which is also where we also get kind
instruction from places like the new
york times as you all know there's being
fuss about NAFTA and the times the
corporate press in general is virtually
a hundred percent in favor of what's
called a North American Free Trade
Agreement I should say I can't use the
words because the only thing that's a
North American Free Trade Agreement
about the agreement that's proposed is
that in fact it applies to North America
it's not free with trade and it
certainly isn't an agreement most of the
populations of the three countries are
against it but what they call a North
American Free Trade Agreement they want
to ram through this time talk about it
and they know there's a lot of popular
objection to it in fact overwhelming so
The Times kindly presented us ignorant
peons with a Primmer the other day
front-page primer with I think 300
economists endorsing it explaining to
the
with masses why it's important to have
free trade let me stress this is not
what the agreement is about but let's
pretend that is for a moment why is it
important to have free trade well you
know they explained it to it free trade
as they said they pointed out their
economics correspondent soviet nasser
wrote the article with 300 economists
behind her all the big shots you know
books you read in college and so on who
pointed out that for two hundred and
fifty years it has been understood that
free trade leads to a more efficient
employment of productive forces and who
but a lunatic could opposed that okay
well since it's been understood for 250
years it's been understood for 150 years
that's logic so therefore it all applied
say in the 1820s at the time say when
the united states was beginning to
develop a textile industry which is the
first industry than anybody forms so we
started building a textile industry and
of course by these principles which were
well understood we should do it by free
trade because that's the most efficient
employment of productive forces and
indeed if we there would have been a
possibility i mean economic historians
have looked back at that say if we had
accepted free trade it would have
bankrupted fifty percent of new england
industry instantly and most of the rest
a little down the road the reason was
that British exports were already were
much more efficient British production
at that time as much more efficient
their their comparative advantage
principle of comparative advantage would
have then produced the textiles not us
but very high protectionist barriers
were raised to allow American industry
to take off to begin that instantly
vastly under states the point King
Cotton you know the source of the
Industrial Revolution was based on
cotton production in the South which
involved a number of other rather
radical interventions with the free
market one of them the massacre of the
indigenous population which made the
lands available and second slavery well
you know that's what set off help set
off the end
revolution in England and of course here
and that's the way we got started
textile industry has spin-offs like you
know I have to produce things for the
textile industry so you get a little bit
of manufacturing and so on and we
gradually got a manufacturing industry
so the story continues without a break
latter part of this century of the 19th
century you move to manufacturing and
steel and so on Andrew Carnegie was able
to set up the first billion-dollar
corporation surely not by following the
principles that have been understood for
250 years according to that primer in
fact it was done again behind high
protectionist walls to keep out much
cheaper British steel and with ample use
of state force notably in Pennsylvania
where the state militia was called in to
the National Guard was called in to
smash up and destroyed workers and
unions to knock down the cost of labor
so that behind the protectionist
barriers it was possible to become a big
philanthropist Andrew Carnegie whose
full of philanthropy ever since without
running through the details everything
else is the same in the post-war period
the reason we have high technology you
know computers electronics they are
analytical industry huge industry all of
the things that flow off at the Lazer's
pharmaceuticals and then you take your
choice every single one of them was
considered was developed and maintained
with radical interference with market
principles through public subsidy
funneled through the Pentagon or in some
other fashion and state guaranteed
markets and ample use of state power the
force markets open elsewhere to conquer
to destroy to block people who overcome
barriers like the philosophy of the new
nationalism and so on that isn't one of
the invariant I mean with one of the
most obvious histories of economic
lessons of economic history it doesn't
just apply to the United States it
applies a universal
from England up till South Korea and
Taiwan if there's an exception to it I
have been able to find it and no
economic historian has been able to
propose it in the last decade as I
mentioned the rich countries became even
more protectionist for all kind of
reasons which there's no time to go into
the Reaganites often leading the pack
well coming back to what any lunatic
should understand any lunatic should
understand that in the say the 1820s the
United States should have followed these
principles that the third world and we
are now supposed to observe and the
result would be that we would be
exporting fur and India would have
developed an industrial revolution
they're way ahead of us and textiles and
ship manufacturing and so on at that
time in fact they probably would have
led the way in the Industrial Revolution
if it hadn't been for British state
power so we ought any lunatics should
understand that we ought to today have a
world in which say India and maybe Egypt
and other places are being developed
would have led the way to Industrial
Revolution and the United States would
be exporting furs and you know maybe
yeah maybe manufacturing some will make
Mac's if they let us do it and so on
that's what any lunatic should
understand according to the Primmer
signed by the three hundred economists
for some reason that conclusion wasn't
drawn although it follows quite
straightforwardly and you may ask
yourself why well it didn't quite happen
say take India and us India was Indian
industry which was substantial in the
18th century was destroyed by British
colonialism by force and by
protectionist barriers and so on that
got Britain's industrial revolution
going the British were quite aware of it
you know you read all the liberal
historians in the early 19th century
they say yeah we don't like it but we've
got to do it otherwise it'll close down
all the Middle's and Manchester and so
on
India D industrialize became a deeply
impoverished agrarian country England
the leader of the amount of the
Industrial Revolution and then other
countries followed the same course some
of them the ones who were able in a
position to radically violate market
principles were able to become developed
the ones who are forced to observe them
usually by violence became the third
world so to take India there are oh
they're there you could say their
advantages to this that is the lesson
taught by the 300 economists is in many
respects true and modern India shows it
the last seven out of ten diamonds cut
in in the world are cut in India the
reason is that there's very cheap labor
available super cheap labor it's become
even more cheap in the last ten years
because India has been undertaking
so-called structural adjustment policies
which drive wages down even further and
cut down nutrition even further and so
on so by now you know cutting diamonds
is extremely cheap and that has a bright
side it's described by one of the main
diamond importers it says we passed some
of the benefits on to our overseas
customers so the miracle of the market
is that workers and their families
starve to death in India in the New
World Order of economic rationality but
diamond necklaces are cheaper in elegant
shops in New York and that's the way
it's supposed to work and we should have
no confusions about that well let me add
one qualification everything I've been
saying is a serious mystification in one
crucial respect I've been talking as if
nations are the agents in world affairs
and of course they are not in any really
existing state to borrow the famous
terminology there's some internal
distribution of power and wealth and
state policy reflects that radically
reflects it so the agents of world fair
the agents in world affairs are not
nations but those who have power
internally within nations highly
concentrated almost without exception
certainly here and policy of course
it's their interest now this I'm
essentially paraphrasing very closely a
famous Marxist revolutionary Adam Smith
who pointed out 200 years ago that
although the policies carried out by the
British had rivas impacts on the
colonies and were very harmful to the
people of England they were very
beneficial to the principal architects
of policies and his day the merchants
and financiers and his point was if you
want to understand anything you carry
out what later came to be called class
analysis
well that's true true then as it's true
now all right so to continue with the
lesson of Adam Smith again one of the
ones they thought when you read Adam
Smith this truism that he pointed out
remains the case and it therefore is a
mystification to talk as I have been
talking as if nations are agents and as
it vague ain't like the United States
doesn't gain from policies that are
called American policies a sector gains
the principal architects of the policies
and the interest they represent they
quite typically gain the general
population may indeed suffer and in fact
that's not that's a that's a point which
is becoming more and more significant
very significant and in fact it tells
you a lot about the future that's coming
along well let me give there's only a
few minutes but let me mention just a
few of the major things that are
happening in international affairs which
have a lot to say about the future of
capitalist democracy anything remotely
resembling it in fact I think what it
shows is that capitalism is even less
like markets are even less likely to
function than they ever have in the past
and democracy which has indeed extended
over the years is probably reversing and
maybe seriously reversing since around
1970 and around 1970 of the US which
runs the show basically dismantled the
international economic system we're the
tough guys that we set the rules and the
rules weren't benefiting us anymore so
they threw him out throughout what was
called the Bretton
there have been a number of major
consequences of that and related
developments at about that time one of
them is an enormous increase in
unregulated capital throughout the world
enormous another World Bank study about
a week ago estimated now out of being
about 14 trillion dollars I confess I
have no sense what that number means but
it's enough so that national powerful
countries like European countries can't
defend their currencies in fact the
European Economic Union was just wiped
out because it couldn't withstand
attacks from huge quantities of
unregulated financial capital which
swamped national or even you know so for
national economies probably the United
States couldn't withstand it so that's
one fact that's that one factor that's
taken place a second is that as you all
know there's been a huge acceleration
since 1970 kind of related to this and
what's called the internationalization
of production meaning you know you're
produced in one place and you have your
bank in another place and that's by now
another a UN study on transnationals
again came out a couple of weeks ago
estimates that foreign sales just
foreign sales of transnational
corporations meaning like sales of
us-based corporations abroad now are
considerably larger than all of world
trade okay that's not these are not
small factors we're talking about
furthermore what is called world trade
is for the most in large measure not
trade at all about maybe a forty percent
of it or so is intra firm transfers
movement from one branch of Ford Motor
Company to another which happens to
cross a national border but it's not
trade in a serious serious sense these
are centrally managed interactions by
huge entities which which are fascist
essentially there's nothing more fascist
than a corporation control is totally
from above orders go down nobody has a
voice outside anybody on the outside
first ones not allowed to know what's
going on
and if they didn't know there's nothing
they can do about it that's a matter of
law on principle so it's like an extreme
form of totalitarianism
they now have assets which generate more
overseas sales by a large measure than
trade and the trade itself is to a
significant extent maybe like a third or
40% or so just movement in among them
finally this unregulated capital has
shifted in its use quite radically one
of the leading international experts on
Finance a Cambridge University economist
John Eatwell estimated recently that
around 1970 when this whole story began
or you know except changed its course
is going on for a long time but when it
really changed its course he estimates
that about 90% of foreign exchange
transactions were devoted to essentially
things that are more less productive
like long-term investment than trade and
so on that's 90 percent around 1970 10 %
speculation and he now estimates that
those figures have reversed it's
something like 10 percent long-term
investment and trade and about 90
percent speculation which becomes a lot
easier now because with
telecommunications and so on you can
shift capital you know two seconds from
one place to another which is lot more
than the economies of big national state
well all of these things have been going
on for some 20 years for all kind of
reasons one of them being the breakdown
of the Bretton Woods system by Nixon
several others and they've had
consequences one consequence is a sharp
decline in economic growth all over the
world which is not too surprising if
capital is being used for speculation
then not for production and that's
happened all over the developed world a
second consequence is that national
economic policy is becoming difficult if
not impossible simply because of the
force of unregulated capital
it's mass and the size of the
transnational corporations and their
operations a third is and this comes
back to Adam Smith's point and why it's
so much more relevant today a third
consequence is that the third world
model is coming back to the rich
countries a consequence of all of this
in particular for not subtle reasons if
you know if Western say the if American
corporations can produce in if they can
shift the production to higher
aggression low-wage areas that means
that the people who used to produce here
can't I'm gonna get jobs or it'll have
to work at the same level and that means
that gradually not so gradually in fact
we pick up the third world model as
production becomes internationalized and
finance becomes internationalized as
it's happening very radically the third
world model comes home the third world
not was Brazil you know sharply
two-tiered society with a small sector
of very wealthy and a huge number of
superfluous people well we're a much
richer country than Brazil's so it's not
going to be like five percent than 80
percent then some in between but
different proportions but the model is
very clear and you can see you don't
look at statistics to see it you take a
walk in any city and it strikes you in
the face
there is now American cities have a
definite third world character so two
rural areas and that's increasing if you
look at the numbers and the statistics
you can see it there but as I say you
know it's obvious anybody with their
eyes open and the reasons are obvious a
large part of the domestic population is
now superfluous just as it's superfluous
in a third world that is it plays no
role in advancing the sole human value
and the sole human value is profit to
investors profit to the rich anything
else is non-existent that's the
principle and much of the population is
now becoming superfluous with regard to
that value just as it is in the third
world which is why a rich country like
looks like Albania the there's perf
Lewis for production because you can get
cheaper and more repressed workers
elsewhere and it's possible that they're
becoming superfluous food consumption I
mean I think that you know jury's out on
this one but back in the days of a
national economy say Henry Ford who
pioneered this understood that you had
to pay a sort of a living wage if he
wanted to sell Ford cars it's not so
obvious that that's true anymore because
production in a less in a less national
economy that's less true we don't know
how little true but it may be that
production can be produced by highly
repressed you know like these nine and
worker cutters in India
and workers in Mexico and so on and the
production can be for the International
wealthy it's at becoming an
international third world remember with
two-tiered societies you know big
sectors of relatively wealthy in the
rich countries tiny sectors in the poor
countries but the split internationally
is now becoming much more important than
hence this Adam Smith observation more
important that's very possibly the case
and it's noticed in the business press
so The Wall Street Journal the other day
had a week ago had a front-page story
which was very enthusiastic it described
an event of as they called it
transcendent importance not small the
event of transcendent importance was
that wages in the United States were now
lower than anywhere else in the
industrial world except for England
where Margaret Thatcher had done even
better than Ronald Reagan and smashing
up the poor and so on and so forth but
they said that's still above South Korea
and Taiwan but we are improving you know
pretty soon wages here will be even
lower for reasons of the kind I've
described and that's of transcendent
importance now and of course it brings
about the third world model the end of
the Cold War has accelerated this
crucial fact about it the Cold War was
basically an effort to draw
of this former part of the third world
back where it belongs and now it's back
there
so the economies have been in freefall
ever since 1989 and they're roughly back
to where they were pre-world War one
relative to the west the and that offers
new weapons against working people in
the West and that is very well
understood if you read again the
business press they're full of it and
very enthusiastic so GM for example so I
let me go in two minutes and I'll shut
up
GM is closing down about two dozen
plants in the United States they're
already the largest producer employer in
Mexico where they're taking advantage of
what's called the Mexican economic
miracle meaning the driving down of
wages by about 60 percent of the in the
last decade to turn it even more into a
radical radically two-tiered third world
society than it was before that offers
lots of advantages but they're also
recognizing that they may be able to do
as well or even better in Eastern Europe
so they opened last year GM a big plant
in East Germany where the Financial
Times which is you know the biggest and
best International Business Journal had
a nice big upbeat front page story on
how this huge 700 million-dollar GM
plant very high-tech where they can get
workers for 40% of the wages of the
pampered West European workers okay but
that's not good enough because if you go
over the border to Poland you can get
workers for 10% of the wages of the
pampered West European workers and I
have another article later I'm very
enthusiastic about this called
green chutes and communism x' ruins okay
bad over there some green shoots the
green shoots are that as the capitalist
economic reforms are imposed and
remember the third-world does have
capitalism they're going to get it down
their throats you know as the capitalist
reforms are imposed they say the
pauperization
of the working class on the massive
degree of unemployment are plus the fact
that the government is extremely harsh
you know tax labor organizers and so on
that has created a situation where you
have 10% the wages of the pampered
Western European workers so there are
green shoots over there
BusinessWeek adds its little version
they say Western workers have to
understand that we have but the West is
going to have to abandon the luxurious
social programs by which the pampered
West European workers and American
workers have been you know allowed to
live these to plunder the rich and tell
us is words that's over now the supreme
value namely wealth to investors and the
rich that can be that can become it
won't be interfered with any longer by
idiotic ideas about people's rights and
so on and so forth we can put out all
that aside have more economic efficiency
in brief you can put screws on the poor
those screws on the poor at home and
abroad
much more efficiently and it's done in
part through big international
institutions like transnational
corporations and huge banks and so on
but in part by a structure of governing
institutions that they themselves are
spawning I mean the structure yoke over
history you know the structure of
governing institutions coalesces around
actual power so the last couple of
centuries you get national states
coalescing around domestic economic
power well economic power
a lot more international so you getting
international institutions and again the
financial press is quite aware of it the
Financial Times describes what they call
the de facto world government that's
developing and what they call this new
year of imperialism the they're very
happy about it of course the the fact
the world government includes new
governing institutions like GATT and the
IMF the World Bank and g7 in other
richer seven countries meaning the
executives of the rich seven countries
that's where the NAFTA fits in this
array of institutions has a lot listy
factor world government has a lot of
advantages one big advantage is is
completely secret you cannot know what's
going on inside the World Bank you know
I mean even if you are willing to spend
your life on it and put out the effort
that's you can't find much and surely
for most of the population it's five
years they do what's plan certainly you
can't find out what's going in a
transnational corporation I mean that's
in principle they're protected from that
kind of knowledge or action so what
you're getting is kind of a very major
step forward in a long-term goal of
destroying democratic institutions
democratic institutions have always been
regarded as a pain in the neck
ever since the British the first English
democratic revolution the problem has
always been how do you control the
rabble they seem to be getting rights
well
there's new ways to do it now you can
move decision making up to the point
where people cannot influence them do
not know about them and do not know that
they don't know about them the
importance of NAFTA in my opinion has
enough
to do with arose great sucking sound
which is probably all total nonsense but
it has a lot to do with an attack on
democracy I mean this particular version
of NAFTA which is not free and and not
trade by any means highly protectionist
which is one reason why US corporations
like it that happens to have the nice
advantage of locking into place a
particular form of arrangement locking
it in by treaties so very hard to change
which happens to be geared specifically
and with exquisite detail for the rights
of investors with protectionist devices
of all sorts and so on and says
essentially nothing about the rights of
the general population labor rights or
the rights of future generations the
environment and so on are they packed on
these so-called side agreements but if
you read them I have you know really
Clinton's health plan first away can't
figure out what they're about but when
you sort of decode it it's clear what
they're about namely nothing you know
they're about setting up boards of
businessmen and corporate lawyers who
will you know spend 20 years
adjudicating some claim and then I'll
say okay business wins well that's this
that create this this is a new step
forward a massive step forward to
eliminating the threat of any form of
democracy of course it's another radical
interference with market principles as
is trade itself when it's centrally
managed and those are directions in
which things are going and there's a
very good question how long it can
continue and what elite do it's for
these reasons that I think there is in
fact a decline of democracy after many
centuries of extension of democracy in
the rich countries and the market which
has always been rather marginal for the
rich is much less of a factor than it
ever was and there are new ways to
attack
to protect the rich from market
discipline while imposing it on the poor
that's the another part of the
two-tiered society well how far can it
go can you construct an international
economy on basically the third world
model sort of islands of great privilege
sea of misery that kind of model with
essentially totalitarian controls with
regard the decision-making under maybe
some kind of facade of electoral
democracy or will Popular Resistance
which will have to be international in
character if it's going to deal with
this these phenomena
can it somehow dismantle these new
structures of domination and violence it
seems to me these are the big questions
of the future that one has to think
about when we're asking what the likely
prospects for democracy are or for even
a survivable existence
[Applause]
we are containing the West it is it
presented a challenge too which has
required us to defend it in fact
professor Chomsky and his book deterring
democracy has a very nice chapter on the
Cold War where he has an excellent
discussion of the literature in which it
is established that the Soviets by
coming into existence challenged us they
presented a new idea they had a
potential threat and therefore many
intellectuals and officials have argued
that that caused us to have to defend
ourselves so everything we did against
them including invading them immediately
upon their arrival was strictly defense
by definition we were only on the
defense that is straight out of George
Orwell and in fact the case I am making
right at the moment is that this the the
socialist world has been under
unremitting attack at all levels that
was under unremitting military and
terroristic attack from the beginning
the Soviet Union itself was invaded
before it even existed and it was
attacked subsequently by Hitler in the
post-world War two period as you know
was it was encircled it was under
constant military threat it was under
steady military pressure and in fact the
the arms race was to a very large extent
in American effort that was explicitly
designed to impoverish the Soviet Union
and put it under economic pressure as a
border country and they can take all the
other goo socialism's China it was
attacked after immediately after the
Civil War the United States funded the
Nationalists who were on the Burmese
border they of course protected Zhang
kai-shek we almost atom bomb China
during the Korean War period
so China was under steady warfare
effectively the Vietnam War itself was
considered by China quite plausibly to
be a very serious threat to its national
security the great power across the
ocean was attacking its neighbor
it was it was a national security thing
we have had the most marvelous
capability of seeing national security
threats everywhere to us but whatever we
do surrounding other countries attacking
their neighbors and this is not
plausibly a threat to them they should
understand that we are people of
goodwill
they're also of course has been
condemned and continuing efforts also at
subversion use of black propaganda
buying politicians and military
personnel the most famous cases are the
ones that I've always been most fond of
are Brazil and Chile in Brazil the
United States practically took over the
country buying newspapers buying
politicians on a huge scale before 1964
buying the army and the further question
what is socialism most socialists would
agree that socialism cannot be an
authoritarian or totalitarian order that
it must include a fully democratic mode
of political governance it must also
include community and worker ownership
and control of major producing assets
and it must embody a strong policy
thrust toward both equalitarian ISM
inclusiveness and libertarianism the
really existing social isms have
generally not met the first and parts of
the second and third conditions they
have been bureaucratic and centrally
controlled by a self-appointed Vanguard
and not libertarian their versions of
socialism has involved mainly state
ownership and control and an
equalitarian thrust plus some socialist
rhetoric that was often hypocritical and
Orwellian so the answer to the first
question question is that a case can be
made that socialism has never been tried
the defeated socialism's were at best
imperfect socialism's at worst they were
perverted versions they were also
however under steady
pressure and sometimes fierce attacks
from the West which weakened the
possibilities of improvement which
brings me to my second question why did
the really existing socialism suffer
such defeat of course and very important
factors were the conditions under which
they arose almost all the social isms of
the world came in rather poor countries
they came frequently after Wars there
were countries that were not
particularly well developed they were
economically there were countries that
had traditions that were not democratic
traditions and so when they then these
governments came into power these
socialist governments came into power
they were always in distress
circumstances they were always having to
recover to try to mobilize the
population to to development and to
simple recovery and they had very little
managerial talent and of course all
these things were badly exacerbated by
the fact that the West Was was hostile
to them from beginning to end the force
of that hostility I think has been
greatly underestimated in fact in the
West it's a print a principle idea that
has been fostered for many years is that
the West has been on defense against
socialism socialism has been a threat
police and ultimately succeeding and
getting the subversion but realized in a
military coup though that we were really
essentially part of the same thing was
true in Chile
we've also carried out continuous
economic warfare against all the
socialist powers Soviet Union China
Vietnam guatemala cuba nicaragua
the design of these efforts by the West
had been to force increased arms
expenditures to weaken these countries
economically and to force them into the
Soviet bloc to create fear and to
curtail Liberty the in effect what we've
been we were trying to do all the time
was to engage in a self-fulfilling
prophecy we prophesied that these
countries were were non libertarian we
were going to darn well help make them
non libertarian and they were we were
wanted them to be Marxist Leninist so we
would force them into the Soviet camp by
boycotting and then we would be proving
that they were had these Marxist
Leninist tendencies and were affiliating
with the Soviet Union we did that time
and again very important to understand
that these efforts of the United States
in reference to countries like Nicaragua
or Cuba or Guatemala were never to
democratize they were always to
destabilize and destroy we just did not
want social democratic and socialist
countries so while we might be attacking
Nicaragua for years on the ground that
we wanted a more democratic Nicaragua
nobody with any sense whatsoever could
possibly fall for that nonsense we had
supported Somoza for forty five years
the same government was proclaiming a
deep interest in democracy and Nicaragua
was kindly supporting Saudi Arabia
Pakistan anybody you might name so that
hypocrisy was absolutely mind-blowing
the and the reality was clearly that the
Sandinistas represented some what is
what some of Oxfam study called a threat
of a good example it was an alternative
way of organizing economic light it was
not even really socialism but social
democracy we couldn't bear it so we used
all the means at our power disposer
disposal to eliminate that threat
admittedly the leaders in the
bureaucrats of the Soviet bloc countries
performed poorly and lost the respect of
their own people and much of this
happened independently a Western policy
but the West exacerbated the worst
tendencies of these efficient
socialism's and when they showed signs
of some positive changes the West took
advantage of these in the case of the
Eastern Bloc with the assistance of
significant parts of the old Jurek
bureaucracies in the soviet union in
eastern europe to destabilize them and
pull them quickly into the western orbit
in cases like vietnam Nicaragua
Guatemala under Arbenz Chile under IND
and one Bosh's Dominican Republic even
Republican social democracy was never
given a chance but was actively
destabilized or attacked I think it is
very greatly underrated the extent to
which the triumph of the market and what
Clinton is now calling market-based
democracies which are not very
democratic dependent on sheer force
violence and terrorism to achieve their
final ends the social doesn't have a
future it's hard to be very optimistic
given the recent defeats and the power
of the global market system and its
enforcers but there are these several
important threads of hope one is that
the market-based democracies are
increasingly serving a small elite and
marginalizing the majority of people
they're creating what we might call a
global reserve army of labor and uncared
for people they are our market and we
have to be prepared to serve them
furthermore the fundamental principles
of the triumphant market economy that is
possessive individualism competition the
profit motive is the dynamic of the
system and its basis on enlarging
consumption and growth continuously are
incompatible with in ecological and
environmental
reality and human survival as they fail
and these this in these regards our
market will swell further in an
important sense therefore the triumph of
socialist values is a condition for
human survival this should give us an
additional incentive to keep our ideas
in play it even constitutes a kind of
moral imperative thank you very much
[Applause]
our next speaker like our first
recipient as I forgot to mention is a
native of Philadelphia
dr. Noam Chomsky received his PhD in
linguistics from the University of
Pennsylvania many of us first learned of
him and his work during the Vietnam War
when he was a very early and very
outspoken activist and critic against
the war in Vietnam as author of many
many books only a few of which are
listed here I mean let me not Armand
talk for many years at the University of
Pennsylvania at the Wharton School prior
to that he taught at Penn State
University he's written many books some
of which are look are listed on your
program there's many others that you're
probably aware of
he currently edits the magazine called
lives of our times which he brought us
some sample copies anybody would like to
take one he also writes regularly for
Zee magazine one of the one of the
better magazines in America and he's
currently or last year or so he's taught
some some courses on media analysis at
the Annenberg Center at the University
of Pennsylvania and and maybe best of
all he's also a member of our group
which is always nice to have
so first we'll have dr. Ann Herman took
SEP the award and give us a little
message here tonight
[Applause]
I'm a tall guy I need this I need this
loose
thanks very much Bob and I'm very
pleased to be the recipient of the ward
and to beginning it here with my
esteemed colleague Noam Chomsky my talk
tonight was is addressed to the question
that does socialism have a future
socialism has suffered some very severe
blows as you are all aware in the last
few years virtually all the world's
regimes and experiments that have called
themselves socialists have been defeated
or removed from power by external or
internal political and military
processes this has been a very serious
setback for socialists Social Democrats
and leftist everywhere it has terminated
experiments that whatever their
weaknesses many of us had hoped might
strengthen over time it's weakened the
barriers to the great capitalist powers
military economic assaults on socialist
and social democrat democratic
outcroppings in the third world and it's
badly damaged socialist and left morale
and spirit of hope this set of defeats
raises three questions that I want to
discuss briefly here one was it
socialism that was defeated or systems
so far removed from socialism that the
word is not at all applicable to why
were the really existing socialism's
defeated and finally is socialism
finished or does it have a future to
answer the first question in fact to
answer although we must first answer the
