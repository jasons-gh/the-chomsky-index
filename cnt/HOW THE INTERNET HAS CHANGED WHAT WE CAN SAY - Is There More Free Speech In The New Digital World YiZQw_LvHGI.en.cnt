when the internet came about were you
expecting that because we could bypass
the mainstream media that would there
would be finally the democratization of
free speech I mean were you expecting
that because when I look at it now it
seems like in some ways the opposite has
happened it'll be do you have a strange
impact technically they should be
increasing freedom of speech but in fact
what's happening I think is that people
are direct being directed into bubbles
where they never hear anything except
their own the views report and so it's
kind of technically freedom of speech
but effectively it's probably reducing
it yeah it's strange by law that has to
be changed by practice understanding
change of consciousness yeah you're
right because we we end up creating
these echo chambers that feedback what
we want to hear we banish the views we
don't want to hear and then even these
days it seems like it becomes so
populist where there's this canceled
culture when anyone says something
unpopular they just get relegated off
the platform so in some ways freedom of
speech has almost been lost by
democratizing it we have to remember
that Kancil culture and the platforming
are very old I could give you many
examples from my own personal experience
but it was always against the left so
therefore it wasn't considered a problem
you didn't even notice it I mean there
are cases that are so extreme they're
almost hard to me Illumina could be a
real case my friend Ed Herman for late
ed Herman and I published many books
together one of them is on the median
manufacturing concern the first book we
published together was in 1971 the book
called the counter revolutionary
violence it was published in a by small
publisher flourishing small publisher
was owned by a major conglomerate
published 20,000 copies ready to
distribute them an executive in the
conglomerate saw the ads for the book
didn't like it asked to be see a copy
had a tantrum ordered the publisher to
stop the distribution they with some
negotiations up and back they basically
refused so he put the whole publisher
out of business destroyed all their
stock all the entire stock to prevent
the distribution of one book he didn't
like did anybody think that was a
violation of freedom of speech no not
the ACLU not civil libertarians cooks it
was private corporate censorship which
goes on all the time of course but
that's and it was targeted against the
left so therefore it was clear right I
could give you just my own personal
experience case after case of what's now
called be platforming Council culture
breaking up meetings by violence on
University campuses have to have police
protection if you're talking about
something critical never considered a
problem it's now considered a problem
because somebody else's ox is being
gored as well so it's right it shouldn't
exist but it's very hypocritical
