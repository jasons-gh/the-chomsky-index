[Applause]
well I'd just like to begin by saying a
word about what a privilege and honor it
is to be able to participate in the
celebration of the remarkable success of
democracy now for these many years and
in particular the quite astonishing
achievements of Amy Goodman Juan
Gonzales their colleagues in showing us
how we might aspire to achieve democracy
now it will be a long struggle and again
it's an enormous pleasure to be able to
share this occasion with people like
Harry Belafonte has been such an
inspiration and being in the forefront
of this endless struggle for many hard
years then for the young people among
you special word you will be facing
problems that have never arisen in the
two hundred thousand years of human
history are demanding problems it's a
burden that you can't ignore and we'll
all you in particular and all the rest
of us will have to be in there
struggling hard to save the human
species from a pretty grim fate well my
wife and I happened to be in Europe on
November 8th that fateful day in fact in
Barcelona
where we watch the results come in that
had special personal resonance for me
the first article I wrote or at least
that I can remember that was in February
1939 at the it was about the fall of our
Salona
to Franco's fascist forces and it was
the article which I'm sure was not very
memorable was about the apparently
inexorable spread of fascism over Europe
and maybe the whole world old enough to
have been able to listen to Hitler's
speeches the Nuremberg rallies not
understanding the words but the tone and
the reaction of the crowd was enough to
leave indelible memories and watching
those results come in did arouse some
pretty unpleasant memories along with
what is happening in Europe know which
in many ways is pretty frightening as
well well the reaction to November 8th
in Europe was disbelief shock horror it
was captured pretty eloquently in the on
the front cover of the major German
weekly there Spiegel it depicted a
caricature of Donald Trump presented as
a meteor hurtling towards Earth mouth
open ready to swallow it up and the
headline read that thus ended their
veldt at the end of the world small
letters below as we have known it there
might be some truth to that concern even
if not exactly in the manner in which
the the artists the author's the others
who
echoed that Concepcion had in mind that
had to do with other events that were
taking place right at the same time
November 8th events that I think we're a
lot more important than the ones that
have captured the attention of the world
in such a astonishing fashion events
that were taking place in Morocco
Marrakech Morocco there was a conference
there of 200 countries the so-called cop
22 their goal at this conference was to
implement the rather vague promises and
commitments of the preceding
international conference on global
warming cop21 in Paris in December 2015
which had in fact been left vague for
reasons not unrelated to what happened
on November 8 here the Paris conference
had the goal of establishing verifiable
commitments to do something about the
worst problem that humans have ever
faced the likely destruction of the
possibility for organized human life
they couldn't do that they could only
reach a non verifiable commitment
promises but not not not not fixed by
treaty and a real commitment and the
reason was that the Republican Congress
in the United States would not accept
binding commitments so where they were
left with something much weaker and
looser the Morocco
it's intended to carry this forward by
putting teeth in that loose vague
agreement the conference opened on
November 7th normal way November 8th the
World Meteorological Organization
presented an assessment of the current
state of what's called the Anthropocene
the new geological epoch that is marked
by radical human modification a
destruction of the environment that
sustains life November November 9th the
conference basically ceased the question
that was left was whether it would be
possible to carry forward this global
effort to deal with the highly critical
problem of environmental catastrophe if
the leader of the free world the richest
and most powerful country in history
would pull out completely as appeared to
be the case that's the stated goal of
the president-elect whose regards
climate change is a hoax and whose
policy if he pursues it is to maximize
the use of fossil fuels and
environmental regulations dismantle the
Environmental Protection Agency
established by Richard Nixon which is a
measure of where politics has shifted to
the right and the past generation
and in other ways accelerate the race to
destruction
well that was essentially the end of the
Marrakesh conference it terminated
without any issue
so that might signal the end of the
world even if not quite in the intended
sense and in fact what happened and
Marrakesh was a quite astounding
spectacle of the hope of the world for
saving us from this impending disaster
was China authoritarian harsh China
that's where hopes were placed at the
same time the the leader of the free
world the richest most powerful country
in history was acting in such a way as
to doom the hopes to total disaster it's
an astonishing spectacle and it's no
less astounding that had received almost
no comment you can something to think
about well the effects are quite real a
cop21 the Paris negotiations could not
reach a verifiable treaty because of the
refusal of the Republican Congress to
accept binding commitments the follow-up
conference cop 22 ended without any
issue we will soon see in the not very
distant future even more dangerous
horrifying consequences of this failure
right here to come to term to address in
a serious way this impending crisis so
say take the country of Bangladesh
within a few years tens of millions of
people will be fleeing from
low-lying coastal plains simply because
of the rise of sea level with the
melting of the huge Antarctic glaciers
much more quickly than was anticipated
and the severe weather associated with
global warming now that's a refugee
crisis of a kind that puts today's
crisis which is more immoral crisis of
the West and an actual refugee crisis
they will put this current crisis into
it'll seem like a footnote to tragedy
and it's the leading climate scientist
in Bangladesh has reacted by saying that
these migrants should have the right to
move to the countries from which all
these greenhouse gases are coming
millions should be able to
United States and indeed the other rich
countries that have grown wealthy as we
all have while bringing this new
geological epoch bringing about this new
geological epoch epoch which may well be
the final one for the species and the
catastrophic consequences can only
increase just keeping the South Asia
temperatures which are already
intolerable for the poor are going to
continue to rise as the Himalayan
glaciers melt also destroying the water
supply for South Asia in India already
300 million people are reported to lack
of water to drink and it will continue
both for India and Pakistan and at this
point the two major threats to survival
begin to converge
one is environmental catastrophe the
others nuclear war another threat that
is increasing right before our eyes
India and Pakistan are nuclear States
nuclear weapon states with nuclear
weapons they're all already almost at
war any kind of real war would
immediately turn into a nuclear war that
might happen very easily over water
short over struggles over diminishing
water supplies a nuclear war would not
only devastate the region but might
actually be terminal for the species if
indeed it leads to nuclear winter and
global famine as many scientists predict
so the threats of survival to survival
can
right there and we're gonna see much
more like it
meanwhile the United States is leading
the way the disaster while the world
looks to China for leadership it's an
incredible astounding picture and indeed
only one piece of a much larger picture
the u.s. isolation at Marrakesh is
symptomatic of broader developments that
we should think about pretty carefully
they're of considerable significance
u.s. isolation in the world is
increasing in remarkable ways maybe the
most striking is right in this
hemisphere now what used to be called
our little region over here
Andres Timpson Secretary of War under
Roosevelt our little region over here
where nobody bothers us if anybody gets
out of line we punish them harshly
otherwise they do what we say that's
very far from true during this century
Latin America for the first time in five
hundred years has freed itself from
Western imperialism last century that's
the United States the International
Monetary Fund which is basically an
agency of the US Treasury has been
kicked out of the of South America
entirely there are no US military bases
left of the International Organization
[Music]
we hemispheric organizations are
beginning to exclude the United States
and Canada in 2015 there was a summit
coming up and the United States he might
have been excluded completely from the
hemisphere over the issue of Cuba that
was the crucial issue that the
hemisphere on which the hemisphere
opposed US policy as does the world
that's surely the reason why Obama made
the gestures towards normalization that
were at least some step forward and
could be reversed under Trump we don't
know on a much more far-reaching scale
something similar is happening in Asia
the as you know of one of Obama's major
policies was the so-called pivot to age
of Asia which was actually a measure to
confront China transparently one
component of the pivot to Asia was the
TPP the trans-pacific partnership which
excluded China tried to bring in other
asia-pacific countries well that seems
to be on its way to collapse for pretty
good reasons I think
[Applause]
at this at the same time there's another
international trade agreement that is
expanding and growing namely China's the
region what they call their regional
comprehensive economic partnership which
is now drawing in US allies from Peru to
Australia to Japan
the US will probably choose to stay out
of it
just as the United States virtually
alone has stayed away from China's Asian
infrastructure Development Bank and if
counterpart to the World Bank that the
US has opposed for many years but has
now been joined by practically all US
allies Britain and others that's at the
same time China is expanding to the west
with the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization the China based silk road's
then the whole system as an integrated
system of energy resource sharing and so
on it includes Siberia with its rich
resources includes Indian Pakistan Iran
will soon join it appears and probably
turkey this will extend all the way from
China to Europe the United States has
asked for observer status and it's been
rejected not permitted on one of the
major commitments of the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization the whole of
the Central Asian states is that there
can be no US military bases in this
entire region another step towards
isolation may soon take place if the
president-elect carries through his
promise to terminate the nuclear weapons
the nuclear deal with Iran other
countries who are parties to the deal
might well continue they might even
ignore mainly that means ignoring US
sanctions that will extend us isolation
even from Europe and in fact Europe
might move under these circumstances
towards backing off from the
confrontation with Russia actually
brexit may assist with this because
Britain was the voice of the United
States and NATO the harshest voice now
it's out gives Europe some opportunities
there were choices in 1990-91 time of
the collapse of the Soviet Union Mikhail
Gorbachev had a recalled a vision of a
common European home
a an integrated cooperative system of
security commerce interchange no
military alliances from the Atlantic to
the Pacific of the u.s. insisted on a
different vision namely Soviet Union
collapses
NATO remains and indeed expands right up
to the borders of Russia now we're very
serious threats are are evident at daily
well all of this these are significant
developments they're related to the
widely discussed matter of decline of
American power there are some
conventional measures which however are
misleading in quite interesting ways of
just a word about it because there's no
time but it's something to seriously
think about by conventional measures in
1945 the United States had reached the
peak of global dominance nothing like it
in history it had perhaps 50% of total
world's wealth other industrial
countries were devastated or destroyed
by the war severely damaged the US
economy had gained enormous ly from the
war and was in the u.s. in general had a
position of dominance with no historical
our alone well that of course couldn't
last other industrial countries
reconstructed by around 17th 1970 the
world was described as tri-polar three
major economic centers a German base
Europe us-based North America and the
North East Asian area
at that time Japan based now china has
moved in as a partner conflict and
partner by now by that time us share and
global wealth was about twenty five
percent and today it's not far below
that well all of this is highly
misleading because it fails to take into
account a crucial factor which is almost
never discussed though there's some
interesting work on it that's the
question of ownership of the world
economy take a look at the corporate the
multinational corporations around the
world
what are they owned well that turns out
to be a pretty interesting matter in
virtually every this increasingly during
the period of neoliberal globalization
of the last generation
well corporate wealth is becoming a more
realistic measure of global power than
national wealth corporate wealth of
course is nationally based supported by
taxpayers like us but it the ownership
has nothing to do with us
corporate ownership if you look at that
it turns out that in virtually every
economic sector the manufacturing
finance services retail and others US
corporations are well in the lead in
ownership of the global economy and
overall their ownership is close to 50%
of the total that's roughly the
proportion of u.s. national wealth in
1945 tells you something about the
nature of the world in which we live of
course that's not for the benefit of
American citizens but of those who own
and
these private publicly supported private
quasi totalitarian systems if you look
at the military dimension of course the
u.s. is supreme nobody's even close no
point talking about it but it is
possible that Europe might take a more
independent role it might move towards
something like Gorbachev's vision that
might lead to a relaxed relaxation of
the rising and very dangerous tensions
at the Russian border which would be a
very welcome development well there's a
lot more to say about the fears and
hopes and prospects the threats and
dangers are very real there are plenty
of opportunities and as we face them
again particularly the younger people
among you that we should never overlook
the fact that the threats that we know
we now face are the most severe that
have ever arisen in human history
they are literal threats to survival
nuclear war environmental catastrophe
these are very urgent concerns they
cannot be delayed they became more
urgent on November 8 for the reasons you
know and that I mentioned they have to
be faced directly and soon if the human
experiment is not to prove to be
disastrous failure
[Applause]
we're going to Juan and I are just going
to have a brief conversation with these
two lions I think of them like outside
the New York Public Library the Lions
that protect our knowledge
[Applause]
now I just want to start off by saying
you have just witnessed an historic
moment is this the first time Harry
unknown that you have met it's not the
first time we've met but it's the first
time we've shared a platform together
it's a bit overwhelming a little
intimidating just isn't so much
knowledge and sensitivity anyway
it's nice to be with all of you so we
have this opportunity to talk with the
two of you at this critical juncture in
US history and the world Harry back in
40 before you went off to war you were
banned from the Copacabana as an African
American you come back in your
headlining there as one of the world's
great entertainers and musicians you
marched in Selma with dr. King and one
if it were one of his closest confidants
known you marched against the Vietnam
War you thought you'd be spending years
maybe decades in jail even as you were
rising in your academic career at MIT
willing to give up everything you two
giants of many movements your thoughts
today in the age of Donald Trump
I must admit that I and far more
commitment to the belief that in the
final analysis no matter how extreme
things might be in America that
eventually our citizens rise up and
righteously stop the enemy at the gate
if not in fact with them in retreat and
each time certain events took place we
met the horror and the terror of not
only I referenced before the Sun I
noticed when I mentioned the fourth
right wasn't quite sure what I was
talking about for just for clarity as
you know that the last great global
torment was the Nazi era was called the
Third Reich and I thought that we had
thoroughly cleansed ourselves of that
encounter and that we would be much more
resilient but I think to a degree we do
make reveal some resilience but the real
test has not yet come until the
inaugural transference has taken place
and what concerns me is that beyond the
mischief of Trumbo and all those in his
cabinet and the people that he's
appointed into roles of leadership
I have never quite understood that we
had another signior unattended enemy
in our midst and that was our species
commitment or weakness in the face of
absolute greed I think we had failed to
come to certain solid conclusions
because we have been so contaminated
with possessions and power that we have
forgotten that we ever destroyed our
children or set the tone for that I
would welcome professor Chomsky's
portably what I hope he says something
that'll make me dance out of here
well I should say that I was somewhat
immunized
to the Trump electoral college victory
of course not popular victory as you
know by the fact that my wife was the
only person I knew who even before the
Republican primaries that predicted that
Trump was not a win looking at the
country somewhat from the outside she's
from Brazil and felt that somehow she
had her finger on the pulse of a large
part of the country and was confident
that this was going to happen so I
wasn't all that surprised or I think
it's extremely dangerous in many ways
like the ones I mentioned and others
that you're quite familiar with on the
other hand there's plenty of
opportunities we should bear in mind
that the country has become much more
civilized in the past 50 or 60 years a
meeting like this could not have been
conceivable in 1960 in 1970 the kinds of
commitment and engagement that you and
many others like you are committed to is
something quite new and there have been
many advances in achievement women's
rights civil rights generally rights of
gays opposition to aggression wave
environmental concerns didn't even exist
at that time there's been tremendous
progress that means that struggles today
start from a much higher place
than they did not many years ago at the
time when Harry was marching in Selma it
was a much harsher world than it is
today
the reason is that plenty of people did
commit themselves to constant dedicated
struggle and there were plenty of
achievements and that goes back in
American history no need to review it
but the earlier period is one of total
horror I mean after all the country was
founded on two incredible crimes
unbelievable crimes that one expert
virtual extermination of the indigenous
population
it's kind of an migrant crisis of the
kind we don't think about today and a
form of slavery which was the most
vicious in history and is in fact the
basis for a large part of the wealth and
economic development of the United
States England France and others that's
history
that when Donald Trump talks about
making the country great again for many
people it wasn't that great quite the
opposite
[Applause]
but the point is there has been plenty
of progress because people people facing
much harder conditions than we do didn't
give up that's an important lesson
furthermore even the election itself
suggests major opportunities for one
thing as you know the Democrats actually
had a considerable majority to vote and
if you look at the younger voters the
people who will shape the future
they were overwhelmingly antitrump and
even more overwhelmingly fro Sanders
we should also bear in mind what a
remarkable phenomenon the Sanders
campaign somebody unknown came from
nowhere quickly no one in the country
knew who he was he was using words like
socialism which used to be a real first
word no no corporate support no media
support no support from the wealthy
everything that has always been crucial
to winning elections mostly we have
bought elections had none of it and
practically took over one of the two
major parties that could have taken it
over it hasn't been
[Applause]
it was primarily driven by young people
all of these are very hopeful signs
means there are plenty of things that
can be done there are opportunities that
can be grasped and no time to run
through them but there are plenty of
them and it's really very much in our
hands and among the younger of you in
your hands to carry us forward in this
long path long arduous path towards
trying to create a civilized society and
a decent world I'd like to ask both of
you there's been a lot of discussion in
recent weeks about the role of workers
or the working class in this election of
trumps supposed appealed to white
workers and Harry you know that the
civil rights movement as it was as it
was growing and developing needed and
was a fueled as well by progressive
unions like 1199 and the Auto Workers
and others that gave it strength and
organization and resources I'm wondering
how you're looking at this issue because
you know Matt you mentioned all the
young people the problem is that the
young people the so-called creative
classes are increasingly concentrating
in the big cities there in Seattle and
there in Chicago and their New York and
and then the issue then is what happens
in the rest of the country you know back
in the 60s and 70s we used to say you
got to go back out and organize
organizing the communities from which
you came from how do you see this whole
analysis of the loss of the
working-class to sort of progressive
politics that we're hearing in the
commercial and the corporate press well
take a look again at these last few
elections in many of the Trump voters
among the white working-class voted for
Obama they were deluded by the slogans
of the
and you may recall that the 2008
campaign was based on the slogan hope
and changed well many people voted and
rightly for hope and change the working
class has suffered not disastrously but
severely from the neoliberal policies of
the past generation pretty much from
1979 so if he looks say just take the
two thousand seven the peak of what
economists were calling the economic
miracle right before the crash 2007
American workers had real wages lower
considerably lower than in 1979 before
these policies were instituted they lost
it listen to Alan Greenspan who during
the height of the euphoria over the
economy was called Saint Alan in the
greatest economists of all time he
testified to Congress explaining the
basis for the success of the economy
that he was running he said it was based
on growing worker insecurity growing
worker insecurity meaning if workers are
beaten down enough intimidated enough
and if their organizations their unions
are sufficiently destroyed that they
can't ask for higher wages and for
decent benefits then that's good for the
economy creates a healthy economy by
some measure we know
the measure well all of this has
happened and the working class has
suffered from it they had a real need
for hope and change well they didn't get
hope and they didn't get changed
I don't usually agree with Sarah Palin
but I think she she nailed it when she
asked at one point where's all this hopi
changing business well you know there
wasn't any so no hope no change already
it showed very quickly in midterm and
future elections this election a con man
came along and offering hope and change
and they're voting for suppose that
people like you the people who form the
Sanders movement would present an
authentic constructive program for real
hope and change it would win these
people back I think many of the Trump
voters
many of the trope for Trump voters could
have voted for Sanders if there had been
the right the right kind of activism and
organization and those are possibilities
it's been done in the past under much
harsher circumstances organizing white
working people in Indiana is a lot
easier than what the Freedom Riders
tried to do in the south 60 years ago
much easier takes work but it can be
done my feeling is that a core part of a
progressive program is to rebuild the
organized structure of the labor
movement which all throughout modern
history has been in the forefront of
progressive change and that's not
impossible either it's been beaten down
pretty severely in the past generation
but it's been worse before they go back
to the 1920s a period which is not
unlike today in many ways the the Gilded
Age you know the the labor movement was
virtually destroyed Wilson Woodrow
Wilson's Red Scare practically wiped it
out there had been a militant activist
labor movement there was nothing left of
it in the 1920s by the 1930s it revived
the militant labor action organization
of the CIO overcame racist conflicts
laid the basis for the New Deal programs
which were highly beneficial to the
extent that they remained they remain
beneficial that can happen again no
reason why it can't
in a moment Patti Smith is going to be
coming out on the stage to share her
talents but I wanted to wrap up with
Harry you know democracy now originally
came out of Pacifica radio which was
five stations WBAI in New York among
them and KPFT in Houston and KPFT is the
only radio station in the country whose
transmitter was blown up it was a few
weeks after it went on the air in 1970
blown up by the Ku Klux Klan and when
they got back on their feet and rebuilt
the Klan blew it up again strapped 15
times the dynamite to the base of the
transmitter and it took months to get
back on the air after that and I can't
remember was the Grand Dragon or the
exalted Cyclops because I often confuse
their titles but he said it was his
proudest act because he understood how
dangerous pacifica how dangerous
independent media is for people to speak
for themselves that's a story of history
though who would have thought in 2016
we'd be talking about the Ku Klux Klan
today when President when Donald Trump
was asked whether he would disavow David
Duke support you know he hesitated he
said he'd have to find out more from
David Duke or the Klan which you know
exactly who it was who is supporting him
maybe the only time he hesitated before
he spoke you know what was it which Klan
chapter he wanted to know in the United
States it was to make a decision but
what about this what about
Donald Trump the Ku Klux Klan and
messages that he is constantly putting
out to lure more voters and support I
believe in Trump and bringing a new
energy to the realization of the the
vastness of the reach of the Ku Klux
Klan is not something that has been out
of the our basic purview of thought the
Ku Klux Klan for some of us is a
constant it has a constant existence it
is until it touches certain aspects of
white America that white America all of
a sudden a wakes up to the fact that
there's something called the Klan and it
does its mystery
what causes me to have great thought is
something that's most unique to my
experience and as I said earlier tonight
at the doorstep of being 90 years of age
I have thought I'd seen it all and done
it all only to find out that in 89 I
knew nothing but the most peculiar thing
to me has been the absence the black
presence in the middle of this
resistance not just the skirmishes that
we've seen in Ferguson and black lives
matter and I think those protests and
those voices being raised are extremely
important
but we blew this thing a long time ago
when they started the purge against
communism in this country and against
the voice of those who saw hope in a
design for socialist theory and for the
sharing of wealth and for the Equality
of humankind when we abandon our visual
of his vision and visuals on that topic
I think we sold out ourselves a group of
young black students in Harlem just a
few days ago has to be what at this
point in my life was I looking for and I
said what I've always been looking for
where resides the rebel heart without
the rebellious heart is about people who
understand that there's no sacrifice you
can make that is too great to retrieve
that which we've lost we will forever be
distracted with possessions and trinkets
and title and I think one of the big
things that happened was that when black
people began to be anointed by the
trinkets of this capitalist society and
began to become big-time players and
began to become heads of cooperations
they became players in the game of our
own demise
[Applause]
and although I believe that Professor
chompy's Chomsky's evaluation is a valid
and a basis for great thought I am
looking at the victories that we're
having like a wanting just who sees a
few days ago Native American brothers
the fact that our Native American
brothers and sisters are stomped the
engine for a moment
[Applause]
he's really a call for us to be reminded
that the engine can be stopped
and they're in I find solace there and I
find the capacity to really do things
and create things that will make a
difference to real it appears that we
appear to be headed I think people have
to be more adventurous the heart has to
find greater space for rebellion so
[Applause]
we pay a penalty for such thought
because I was just recently reminded of
Florida Goodman and Chaney they sit
together ly close to my own feelings and
thoughts because I was one of the voices
that was raised in recruiting those
young students to participate in our
rebellion David Goodman Andrews brother
is here today I'm sure that he's always
at the right places but I think that
there are those kinds of extremes that
will be experienced in the struggle but
the real nobility of our existences are
we prepared to pay that price and I
think once the opposition understands
that we are quite prepared to die for
what we believe in
that death for a Cause does not just sit
with Isis but since of people workers
people who are genuinely prepared to
push against the theft of our nation and
the distortion of our constitution and
that for many of us no price is too
great for that charge
and we have great history to call upon I
mentioned a few before but we still got
a few left and I wanted to take this
opportunity because I know we're winding
down to just say dua me and you John
that I've been through much in this
country I came back from the Second
World War and while the world rejoiced
in the fact that Hitler had been met and
defeated there were some of us who were
touched by the fact that instead of
sitting at the table feast at that great
victory we were worried about our lives
because the response from many in
America was the murder of many black
servicemen that came back and they were
considered to be dangerous because we
had learned the capacity to handle
weaponry
we had faced death in the battlefield
and when we came back we had an
expectation as the victors
we came back knowing that yes we might
have fought to end his lover we also
fought for our right to vote in America
and that in the pursuit of such rights
came the civil rights movement well that
can happen again we just have to get out
our own coats dust them off stop
screwing around and just chasing the
good times and get down to business
there's some ask and I hear to be done
fear on which the hemisphere opposed US
policy as does the world that's surely
the reason why Obama made the gestures
towards normalization that were at least
some step forward and could be reversed
under Trump we don't know on a much more
far-reaching scale something similar is
happening in Asia the as you know one of
Obama's major policies was the so-called
pivot to age Asia which was actually a
measure to confront China transparently
a one component of the pivot to Asia was
the TPP the trans-pacific partnership
which excluded China tried to bring in
other asia-pacific countries well that
seems to be on its way to collapse for
pretty good reasons I think
[Applause]
at this at the same time there's another
international trade agreement that is
expanding and growing namely China's the
region what they call their regional
comprehensive economic partnership which
is now drawing in US allies from Peru to
Australia to Japan
the US will probably choose to stay out
of it just as the United States
virtually alone has stayed away from
China's Asian infrastructure Development
Bank kind of counterpart to the World
Bank that the u.s. is opposed for many
years
but has now been joined by practically
all US allies Britain and others that's
at the same time China is expanding to
the west with the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization the China based Silk Roads
then the whole system is an integrated
system of energy resource sharing and so
on it includes Siberia with its rich
resources includes Indian Pakistan Iran
will soon join it appears and probably
turkey this will extend all the way from
China to Europe the United States has
asked for observer status and it's been
rejected not permitted on one of the
major commitments of the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization the whole of
the Central Asian states is that there
can be no US military bases in this
entire region another step towards
isolation may soon take place if the
president-elect both for India and
Pakistan and at this point the two major
threats to survival begin to converge
one is environmental catastrophe the
others nuclear war
another threat that is increasing right
before our eyes
India and Pakistan are nuclear States
and if their web states with nuclear
weapons they're all already almost at
war any kind of real war would
immediately turn into a nuclear war that
might happen very easily over water
short other struggles over diminishing
water supplies a nuclear war would not
only devastate the region but might
actually be terminal for the species if
indeed it leads to nuclear winter and
global famine as many scientists predict
so the threats of survival to survival
converge right there and we're going to
see much more like it
meanwhile the United
States is leading the way the disaster
while the world looks to China for
leadership it's an incredible astounding
picture and indeed only one piece of a
much larger picture the u.s. isolation
at marrakech is symptomatic of broader
developments that we should think about
pretty carefully they're of considerable
significance u.s. isolation in the world
is increasing in remarkable ways maybe
the most striking is right in this
hemisphere that what used to be called
our little region over here Henry
Stimson Secretary of War under Roosevelt
our little region over here where nobody
bothers us if anybody gets out of line
we punish them harshly otherwise they do
what we say that's very far from true
during this century latin america for
the first time in five hundred years has
freed itself from western imperialism
last century that's the United States
the International Monetary Fund which is
basically an agency of the US Treasury
has been kicked out of the of South
America entirely there are no US
military bases left of the international
organizations
[Music]
a hemispheric organizations are
beginning to exclude the United States
and Canada in 2015 there was a summit
coming up and the United States he might
have been excluded completely from the
hemisphere over the issue of Cuba that
was the crucial issue that the
hemisphere on which the verifiable
commitments to do something about the
worst problem that humans have ever
faced the likely destruction of the
possibility for organized human life
they couldn't do that they could only
reach a non verifiable commitment
promises but not not not not fixed by
treaty and a real commitment and the
reason was that the Republican Congress
in the United States would not accept
binding commitments so where they were
left with something much weaker and
looser the Morocco conference intended
to carry this forward by putting teeth
and that loose vague agreement the
conference opened on November 7th normal
way November 8th the World
Meteorological Organization presented an
assessment of the current state of
what's called the Anthropocene the new
geological epoch that is marked by
radical human
modification destruction of the
environment that sustains life November
November 9th the conference basically
ceased the question that was left was
whether it would be possible to carry
forward this global effort to deal with
the highly critical problem of
environmental catastrophe if the leader
of the free world the richest and most
powerful country in history would pull
out completely as appeared to be the
case that's the stated goal of the
president-elect whose regards climate
change is a hoax and whose policy if he
pursues it is to maximize the use of
fossil fuels and environmental
regulations dismantle the Environmental
Protection Agency established by Richard
Nixon which is a measure of where
politics has shifted to the right and
the past generation and in other ways
accelerate the race to destruction
well that was essentially the end of the
Marrakesh conference it terminated
without any issue
so that might signal the end of the
world even if not quite than the
intended sense and in fact what happened
and were Marrakesh was a quite
astounding spectacle the hope of the
world for saving us from this impending
disaster was China Thorat air as an aid
campaign was based on the slogan hope
and change well many people voted and
rightly for hope and change
the working class has suffered not
disastrously but severely from the
neoliberal policies of the past
generation pretty much from 1979 so if
he looks they just take the two thousand
seven the peak of what economists were
calling the economic miracle right
before the crash 2007 American workers
had real wages lower considerably lower
than in 1979 before these policies were
instituted they lost it listen to Alan
Greenspan who during the height of the
euphoria over the economy was called
Saint Alan the greatest economist of all
time he testified to Congress explaining
the basis for the success of the economy
that he was running he said it was based
on growing worker insecurity growing
worker insecurity meaning if workers are
beaten down enough intimidated enough
and if their organizations their unions
are sufficiently destroyed that they
can't ask for higher wages and for
decent benefits then it's good for the
economy creates a healthy economy by
some measure we know the measure well
all of this has happened and the working
class has suffered from it they had a
real need for hope and change well they
didn't get hope and they didn't get
changed
I don't usually agree with Sarah Palin
but I think she she nailed it when she
asked at one point
where's all this Hopi changing business
well you know there wasn't anything so
no hope no change already it showed very
quickly in midterm and future elections
this election a con man came along and
is offering hope and change and they're
voting for suppose that people like you
the people who form the Sanders movement
would present an authentic constructive
a program for real hope and change it
would win these people back I think many
of the Trump voters
many of the truth and Dragon are the
exalted Cyclops because I often confuse
their titles but he said it was his
proudest act cause he understood how
dangerous pacifica how dangerous
independent media is for people to speak
for themselves that's a story of history
though who would have thought in 2016
we'd be talking about the Ku Klux Klan
today when President when Donald Trump
was asked whether he would disavow David
Duke support you know he hesitated he
said he'd have to find out more from
David Duke or the Klan which you know
exactly who it was who is supporting him
maybe the only time he hesitated before
he spoke you know what was it which Klan
chapter he wanted to know in the United
States it was to make a decision but
what about this what about Donald Trump
the Ku Klux Klan and the messages that
he is constantly putting out to lure
more voters and support I believe that
Trump and bringing a new energy to the
realization of the the vastness of the
reach of the Ku Klux Klan is not
something that has been out of the our
basic purview of thought the Ku Klux
Klan for some of us is a constant it has
a constant existence
it is until it touches certain aspects
of white America that white America all
of a sudden a wakes up to the fact that
there's something called the Klan and it
does it's mister
what causes me to have great thought is
something that's most unique to my
experience and as I said earlier tonight
at the doors that would be 90 years of
age I have thought I'd seen it all and
done it all only to find out that in 89
I knew nothing but the most peculiar
thing to me has been the absence the
black presence in the middle of this
resistance not just the skirmishes that
we've seen in Ferguson and black lives
matter and I think those protests and
those voices being raised of the u.s.
insisted on a different vision namely
Soviet Union collapses NATO remains and
indeed expands right up to the borders
of Russia now we're very serious threats
are are evident daily well all of this
these are significant developments
they're related to the widely discussed
matter of decline of American power
there are some conventional measures
which however misleading in quite
interesting ways of say a word about it
because there's no time but it's
something to seriously think about by
conventional measures in 1945 that the
United States had reached the peak of
global dominance nothing like it in
history it had perhaps 50% of total
world's wealth
other industrial countries were
devastated or destroyed by the war
severely damaged the US economy had
gained enormous ly from the war and was
in the u.s. in general had a position of
dominance with no historical error law
well that of course couldn't last other
industrial countries reconstructed by
around 17th 1970 the world was described
as tri-polar three major economic
centers a German base Europe us-based
North America and the North East Asian
area at that time Japan based know China
has moved in as a partner conflict and
partner by now by that time us share and
global wealth was about 25 percent and
today it's not far below that well all
of this is highly misleading because it
fails to take into account a crucial
factor which is almost never discussed
though there's some interesting work on
it that's the question of ownership of
the world economy take a look at the
corporate the multinational corporations
around the world
what are they owned well that turns out
to be a pretty interesting matter in
virtually every this increasingly during
the period of neoliberal globalization
of the last generation
well corporate wealth is becoming a more
realistic measure of global power than
national wealth corporate wealth of
course is nationally based supported by
taxpayers like
but it the ownership has nothing to do
with us
corporate ownership if you look at that
it turns out that in virtually every
actually based supported by taxpayers
like us but it the ownership has nothing
to do with us
corporate ownership if you look at that
it turns out that in virtually every
economic sector the manufacturing
finance services retail and others US
corporations are well in the lead in
ownership of the global economy and
overall their ownership is close to 50%
of the total that's roughly the
proportion of u.s. national wealth in
1945 tells you something about the
nature of the world in which we live of
course that's not for the benefit of
American citizens but of those who owned
and managed these private publicly
supported private quasi totalitarian
systems if you look at the military
dimension of course the u.s. is supreme
nobody's even close no point talking
about it but it is possible that Europe
might take a more independent role it
might move towards something like
Gorbachev's vision that might lead to a
relaxed relaxation of the rising and
very dangerous tensions at the Russian
border which would be a very welcome
development well there's a lot more to
say about
the fears and hopes and prospects the
threats and dangers are very real there
are plenty of opportunities and as we
face them again particularly the younger
people among you we should never
overlook the fact that the threats that
we know we now face are the most severe
that have ever arisen in human history
they are literal threats to survival
nuclear war environmental catastrophe
these are very urgent concerns they
cannot be delayed they became more
urgent on November 8 for the reasons you
know and that I mentioned they have to
be faced directly and soon if the human
experiment is not to prove to be
disastrous failure
' if the leader of the free world the
richest and most powerful country in
history would pull out completely as
appeared to be the case that's the
stated goal of the president-elect whose

world even if not quite than the
intended sense and in fact what happened
and myrrh Marrakesh was a quite
astounding spectacle the hope of the
world for saving us from this impending
disaster was China authoritarian harsh
China
that's where hopes were placed at the
same time the leader of the free world
the richest most powerful country in
history was acting in such a ways
doomed the hopes the total disaster it's
an astonishing spectacle and it's no
less astounding that had received almost
no comment you can something to think
about well the effects are quite real
the cop21 the Paris negotiation
could not reach a verifiable treaty
because of the refusal of the Republican
Congress to accept binding commitments
the follow-up conference cop 22 ended
without any issue we will soon see and
not very distant future even more
dangerous
horrifying consequences of this failure
right here to come to term to address in
a serious way this impending crisis so
say take the country of Bangladesh
within a few years tens of millions of
people will be fleeing from the
low-lying coastal plains simply because
of the rise of sea level with the
melting of the huge Antarctic glaciers
much more quickly than was anticipated
and the severe weather associated with
global warming in history it had perhaps
50% of total world's wealth other
industrial countries were devastated or
destroyed by the war severely damaged
the US economy had gained enormous ly
from the war and was in the u.s. in
general had a position of dominance with
no historical our alone well that of

[Applause]
we're going to Juan and I are just going
to have a brief conversation with these
two lions I think of them like outside
the New York Public Library the Lions
that protect our knowledge
[Applause]
now I just want to start off by saying
you have just access of democracy now
for these many years and in particular
the quite astonishing achievements of
Amy Goodman Juan Gonzalez their
colleagues in showing us how we might
aspire to achieve democracy now it'll be
a long struggle and again it's an
enormous pleasure to be able to share
this occasion with people like Harry
Belafonte has been such an inspiration
and being in the forefront of this
endless struggle for many hard years
then for the young people among you
special word you will be facing problems
that have never arisen in the two
hundred thousand years of human history
are demanding problems it's a burden
that you can't ignore and we'll all you
in particular and all the rest of us
will have to be in there struggling hard
to save the human species from a pretty
grim fate well my wife and I happened to
be in Europe on November 8th that
fateful day in fact in Barcelona
where we watch the results come in that
had special personal resonance for me
the first article I wrote or at least
that I can remember it was in February
1939 at the it was about the fall of our
Salona to Franco's fascist forces and it
was the article which I'm sure was not
very memorable was about the apparently
inexorable spread of fascism over Europe
and maybe the whole world old enough to
have been able to listen to Hitler's
speeches the Nuremberg rallies not
understanding the words but the cone and
the reaction of the crowd was enough to
leave indelible memories and watching
those results come in did arouse some
pretty unpleasant memories along with
what is happening in Europe know which
in many ways is pretty frightening as
well well the reaction to November 8th
in Europe was disbelief shock horror it
was captured pretty eloquently in the on
the front cover of the major German
weekly I just want to start off by
saying you have just witnessed an
historic moment is this the first time
Harry and Noam that you have met it's
not the first time we've met but it's
the first time we've shared a platform
together
it's a bit overwhelming I'm a little
timid a need to sit with so much
knowledge and sensitivity anyway it's
nice to be with all of you so we have
this opportunity to talk with the two of
you at this critical juncture in US
history
and the world hurry back in 40 before
you went off to war you were banned from
the Copacabana as an African American
you come back in your headlining there
as one of the world's great entertainers
and musicians you marched in Selma with
dr. King and one of the were one of his
closest confidants Noam you marched
against the Vietnam War
you thought you'd be spending years
maybe decades in jail even as you were
rising in your academic career at MIT
willing to give up everything you two
giants of many movements your thoughts
today in the age of Donald Trump
I must admit that I had far more
commitment to the belief that in the
final analysis no matter how extreme
things might be in America that
eventually our citizens rise up and
righteously stop the enemy at the gate
if not in fact with them in retreat in
each time certain events took place we
met the horror and the terror of not
only I referenced before the Sun I
noticed when I mentioned the fourth
right wasn't quite sure what I was
talking about for just for clarity as
you know that the last great cobalt
torment was the Nazi era
