there is a brand of what's called
anarchism in the United States and to an
extent in England which is a very sharp
departure from the whole libertarian
tradition it's called a narco capital
capital ism that's what's called
libertarian here if you take a look at
it
it's advocacy of the most extreme form
of autocracy and oppression that has
ever existed what it's supported the
policies whatever the proponents may
believe the policies very quickly turned
into concentration of power in the hands
of unaccountable private institutions
the worst kind of autocracy political
states are at least partially
accountable private concentrations of
power aren't the idea that you have
voluntary agreements that goes back to a
famous comment of Anatole France that
under conditions of perfect freedom at
both the poor man and the rich man have
equal rights to sleep under the bridge
yeah that's what voluntary agreement is
if you're if you have no means of
support and somebody who has all the
powers willing to give you a couple of
pennies you can make a voluntary
agreement saying okay I won't starve
I'll be your slave voluntary agreement
and in fact some of the more honest
advocates of this position like James
McKenna and Nobel Prize laureate argued
at one point that every human beings
highest aspiration is to ensure that
everyone else in the world is his slave
that's the kind of people we are that's
our nature we want to make sure that
everyone is enslaved to us and these
policies basically are are based on that
conception of human nature another
well-known advocate Marie
Rothbart is strongly opposed to laws
that require children to parents that
feed their children the why should
parents be forced by the state to feed
their children
that's the consent and if you accept
their conception of Liberty and that's
true why should you be it's radically
different from the libertarian tradition
that's pretty striking to see how
different it is so if you go back to sit
back to say Adam Smith who's supposed to
be advocate of classical liberalism take
a look at his actual views everyone's
heard the phrase invisible hand very few
people have bothered to look at how Adam
Smith used the phrase I've used it twice
once in wealth of nations once in his
companion book Moral Sentiments in Moral
Sentiments here's the way he uses it he
says suppose it's in agricultural
societies talking about he says suppose
some land owner accumulated almost all
the land and everybody else had to
depend on him for survival he says well
this wouldn't really matter very much
because because of the natural sympathy
of the land owner for other people which
is kind of the core of human nature he
would make sure that the goods of the
his possessions are distributed fairly
equally so it would end up with a fairly
egalitarian society as if by an
invisible hand
that's Adam Smith and not what you
learned in school actually the other
place he uses it in Wealth of Nations if
you take a look it's pretty much an
argument against what's nowadays called
neoliberal globalization that what he
says is he says suppose that in England
is what he's concerned with the
manufacturers and merchants sold their
goods abroad manufactured abroad
and imported from abroad they make money
but the people of England will sit would
suffer however he's is probably not
going to happen because they're gonna
have enough concern for their own
society that they'll be willing to
sacrifice profit for the general good so
as if by an invisible hand we'll be
saved from the ravages of what's now
called globalization that's Adam Smith
so it's not a different conception of
human nature it assumes that the basic
enlightenment conception that the core
of human nature is sympathy concern for
others mutual support and so on not hate
everyone else get as much as you can for
yourself make everyone else your slave
and we'll call that freedom
