you've talked about the the stakes of
this election are you someone who's
worried I mean I know I don't want to
put you in the prediction business but
are you worried at all if we nominate a
centrist like Biden or Buddha judge that
that just sort of could be a 2016
election do-over and reelect Trump well
I think it's imperative in this election
the trunk not really almost anybody
first guy I mean on the street reelected
we know what's gonna happen there will
be an acceleration of the kinds of
destructive and threatening programs to
which he is committed maybe worse
because the second terms of president
usually he's an option to be more free
and what they do there's no indication
this is going to change incidentally
it's not only global warm there's
something else that nobody's talking
about almost it's just a series and
that's the dismantling of the arms
control regime the threat of nuclear war
is quite serious and that's really
essentially permanent the country that
carries out a first strike in a major
nuclear war will itself be destroyed
simply by the effects of nuclear winter
and that's coming closer now there were
there was a series of treaties which
somewhat reduced the threat of nuclear
war which has always been extremely I we
look at the record it's kind of
miraculous of meat escape but there were
some treaties that reduced the threat
one was the ABM Treaty was dismantled by
two
w bush second is the INF treaty for
which banned short-range nuclear
missiles in Europe very significant that
was signed by Reagan and Gorbachev in
1987 that's just been dismantled by the
u.s. cut by Trump in ministry just last
August time did very nicely day or two
before Hiroshima day and plainly they'd
been planning this done of course been
planning it that's were extractant Lee
right after about dismantle dismantling
the treaty the Pentagon launched a
missile which why they did the tree
virtually pleading with others come
along and find ways to destroy us we've
opened the door another the next one on
the table is the Open Skies treaty
initiated by that terrible left-wing
radical Dwight Eisenhower that's going
to go that's reduced the threat that one
of the major powers Russia the United
States would misunderstand what's having
launched missiles that the last one is
the New START treaty 21 Trump
administration's already indicated I'm
saying that fact the preparatory steps
to do so haven't been taken that ends
the arms control regime essentially and
it says let's develop the most
destructive weapons that we possibly can
and be happy about the fact I destroy
ourselves some people are happy about
this you can read the literature of the
arms the arms in the district military
industry they're delighted you're
ecstatic
getting huge contracts to develop
weapons to destroy everything also
thinking that little way
down the road they'll get even bigger
contracts to try to figure out ways to
defend against the monstrous weapons
that you're developing now so it's just
a perfect world that's just a serious
global warming and there's virtually not
a word this is not just my opinion
insolently so take the William Terry
former Secretary of Defense the leading
specialist on nuclear weapons political
life to it and a pretty conservative guy
not given to federated rhetoric he said
this he's not only terrified he's doubly
terrified one by the growing threat to
who by the failure to notice why do you
think that is the it's interesting you
mentioned that because I know during the
later years of the Obama administration
they approved some nuclear modernization
program that would have cost a few
trillion dollars under the pressure of
was there too sometimes when I've
brought that up with people they say you
know oh well we also had really old
computer systems on the nuclear weapons
and this actually made things more safe
is that is that a legitimate argument
you should take a look at the record I
mean there's been a shifter case we're
failure of the automated systems firstly
led to war when it came within minutes
of launching
whether the terminal war and when human
intervention blocked so for example in
1970 not my national security adviser
Zbigniew Brzezinski was just about
picking up the phone to call President
Carter to tell him that were under a
terrible missile attack when the
information came in saying was a
technical error Nagi this goes back to
the first establishment of this system
is back under Eisenhower the first as
soon it was first immediately it warned
of the 99% probability of a deadly
Russian missile attack turned out some
regard that stuff the moon in some way
they didn't expect and this goes all the
way through if we had time I could go
through details right literally a
miracle that we escaped
