in our cause it's that when having
dialogue and trying to talk about things
that you readily talk about are just the
facts thank you all around the world and
things like that people will say well if
the corporations in our country don't
have power and the money is not
concentrated in our country and we don't
have the strongest military power and we
don't do what we're doing someone else
is going to get the power and then are
they going to be any better than we are
and then they're going to use their
power to then exploit people you know
violate human rights and so forth and
that well as bad as the United States is
they settle in a way and say that okay
well at least we're not too bad look at
other people who are killing we're not
killing our own people and this and that
maybe they would and I've responding to
those people I I find it's like well I
don't know what would happen if they had
the power I mean other places have had
the power and they have exploited that
power and heard a lot of people so
trying to accurately how would have
liked how would you respond to that
question like what would you do if we
didn't have the power and I then the
fact that as we go to become more and
more egalitarian like if the people of
our country and actually exercise
democracy educated what like you were
educated and exercise democracy in the
world in the next say ten to fifteen
years started to move towards some more
social quality how would we couple that
and protect ourselves essentially the
question from a power a dictator or any
force that could violate human rights on
a mass scale how do those two how can
they fit well together I mean first of
all them the initial assumptions or I
don't think most people would accept
that the we have to keep on torturing
and killing people because if we don't
they might torture and kill somebody I
mean Hitler could have given that
argument so we don't want that one
but I think the basic question you ask
is a good man how can we if we if we
were to withdraw Aaron beating people
over the heads with clubs would it
necessarily follow that somebody else
would take that role or are there other
alternatives oh yeah there are other
alternatives for example the
alternatives that are favored by the
overwhelming majority of the population
in the United States I mentioned one
piece of it let the UN function the UN
isn't perfect it's a lot of things wrong
with it just like the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights isn't
perfect a lot of things wrong with it
but one step would be to let to pay some
respect to the decent opinion of mankind
the quote a famous author and let
international institutions function so
as to reduce the likelihood that anybody
will use force after all the remember
the UN Charter in 1945 I which
unfortunately most people don't know
just like don't know the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights it was
formed it starts off by saying that the
goal is to save the human species from
the curse of war which twice in their
generation had led to vast destruction
and which has everyone knew in 1945 was
if it went on was going to kill
everybody because this was right after
the how moms it's interesting that
everyone knew that but nobody could say
it because of us power so if you look at
the Charter long charter there's a lot
about the curse of war but the words
nuclear or anyone like them don't appear
but that was what is on everyone's mind
we're at the point where we have now
developed a technology that can destroy
the world okay so therefore we have to
save ourselves from the curse of war and
institutions were constructed to try to
overcome just what you're pointing to
the core principles of the UN Charter or
that the use of force is illegal it's
criminal it's the supreme international
crime from which all other crimes follow
unless where it is used under extremely
narrow conditions one condition is
authorization of Security Council okay
you can ask whether that's the right way
to do it or not but it's least some step
towards the right way to do it the only
other condition was if a country is
under attack then you can use force and
self-defense now interest in us come
back to ourselves today in the United
States the elite intellectual culture
the one we're part of flatly rejects
that and says that the United States and
alone maybe we can delegate it to our
clients but essentially the United
States alone has the right of what's
called anticipatory self-defense meaning
we attack anyone we want because we
claim that maybe there'll be a threat to
us someday that's flatly in violation of
the Charter it's the bipartisan
consensus it's the media consensus it's
the elite intellectual consensus not a
hundred percent but you know
overwhelmingly and then people just
argue about well you know is this or
that the right place to do it but the
and of course nobody else allow that
they're right I mean that's not landish
you know like that nicaragua's they
would have had the right to carry out
terror in the United States and
legitimate self-defense is unthinkable
so the but we have that right just for
ourselves we can delegate it to clients
but I'll say the same thing I said
before the overwhelming majority of the
population rejects that you take a look
at the unpublished almost always
unpublished major studies of public
opinion these in fact were released
right before the election when they were
crucially important for a Democratic
Society but suppressed show that large
majority of the public accepts the basic
principles of the UN Charter against the
use of force and if we're in a better
position to implement those principles
than anyone else because we're way more
powerful than anyone else so if we join
the rest of the world
trying to implement those principles
then there's hope that no other power
will take the place that the powerful
states now have us in particular and
there are many examples of this just
take one examine other example from last
November which also didn't get reported
and we should ask why and there is a
fissile material cutoff treaty as a
treat international treaty that tries to
prevent the to put there are technically
you know the trees blocking it but there
but this one would put some enforcement
procedures into preventing the
development of materials for nuclear
weapons okay you read on the front pages
of the New York Times this morning lead
story of the US wants to prevent its
enemies like Iran from even getting the
rights they now have with regard to
making these materials but there is a on
the agenda a much broader one which
tries to prevent to cut off the
production of material which can be used
for nuclear weapons which are very
likely to destroy a soul well it it's
been negotiated for years
internationally it came to a vote at the
center of what amounts of the General
Assembly disarmament Commission of the
General Assembly the whole General
Assembly came to a vote last November
and the vote was 147 to one with two
abstentions 147 to one is very typical
of international votes not this
administration going way back or maybe
150 22 or something like that because
the US does insist upon rights that it
denies everyone else like the right to
use force the right to commit genocide
and so on and so forth in this case the
united states voted against aunt was the
only country to vote against the
measures to enforce the restriction on
production of weapons of material for
nuclear weapons which is likely to
destroy us all well what about the two
states that abstained one of them
abstains reflexively Israel has to
abstain because it's relying on the
United States forex doing so that's
reflexive the other one is a second
client state Britain and Britain
abstained which it usually does in fact
have stained them the Security Council
resolutions on Nicaragua two and many
others and in fact the British
representative if you look at the
General Assembly proceedings explained
why he had to abstain he said we were
very much in favor of this treaty and
you know we're going to work really hard
to get enforcement procedures and so on
but the particular proposal that was
voted on he said is divisive which is
true it divided the world 147 to one so
therefore he had to abstain well you
know these things are in direct control
we could change all those policies and
the overwhelming majority the population
doesn't want to change but in order to
change them we have to do something
about it and that's in direct reaction
your question we do not want nobody sane
wants any country to be developing the
kinds of weaponry which will destroy all
of us and one way to prevent that is by
putting enforcement mechanisms into the
vague treaties that bar but the US won't
allow that and it is allowed to get away
with it because nobody in the country
knows it but if you do a poll at the you
know say Harvard faculty club or
wherever educated people are Union
unless it's somebody is involved in you
know disarmament programs nobody'll have
ever heard of this and it's it's like a
death sentence and it happens all the
time
