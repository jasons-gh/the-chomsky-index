good morning professor Thomson I'm a
biologist the nation's the question I
have is a ravallo up to this one when a
biologist looks at something as complex
as the FLN the recursion device
ostensibly is the first question to
questions you ask is what is it for and
what is it from that is what it evolved
from and you suggested that maybe it
didn't evolve or at least that's not the
right way to look at it it evolved but
the way it's with hoppitty molecules
getting into the syllable
so it's properties in other words on
that view are more contingent on its
function it's it's contemporary function
rather than its evolutionary origin even
that's misleading because there's a
factual question about what the function
is under the usual assumption about
language has been that its function is
to facilitate communication right this
I've never believed that and this point
of view takes a very different approach
it says the function if you want to use
the word of language is to link
interface conditions and when you look
here it's just an empirical question and
when you look closely at the structure
of language I could mention some cases I
think what you find is that the
computational system is optimal is
apparently optimal with regard to
linking the interface but it's very non
optimal with regard to communication I
see
so but I actually have a specific
question about its origin so it there is
a case to be made that animal Minds
evaluate contingent circumstances and
control their most purposeful motion in
response to those that those systems are
in fact hierarchically nested in
combinatorial there's actually an
argument to be made that that's true
that looks remarkably like the FLN that
looks remarkably like the recursion
device and if that's true in turn then
it means that the properties of the
recursion device perhaps including some
that looks suboptimal for its function
are in fact like the bones in a bird's
wing they are historical accidents
rather than functional properties of the
system could you perhaps explore that
just for a moment whether you like or
dislike that because the difference
between hierarchical structure and
recursion there's all kinds of the texts
of the birds and you know the bones and
I got five fingers
like a randomized three you know and so
on that's hierarchical structure but
it's not recursion
there's no recursive process that gives
you an arbitrary number of fingers each
stage of which has particular
significance remember this recursion is
not like you know walking I mean you
take one step and then in two steps and
then three stripes every stage in the
process has particular significance
determine significance at two interfaces
and that's something completely
different than hierarchical structure
yeah I was actually referring to things
like Biederman's view of perception for
example that it's that it's inherently
combinatorial in hierarchically nested
do you like yeah that's fine I mean in
fact maybe we could have gone into this
like I mention it that the could be that
the recursive systems and not only maybe
they're connected with insect whatever's
involved in insect navigation but they
could also be involved with what a lot
of perceptual psychologists call the
rules of vision you know the rules that
make you see some object some
presentation as a three-dimensional
object in motion there's a very pretty
well understood by now computational
procedure that determines that from very
few presentations like three estes copic
presentations they get you to see a
rigid object in motion okay there's some
kind of principles involved in that and
it wouldn't be outlandish to assume that
those were all rules of seeing you know
are similar in some way to whatever is
going on here yeah I think this didn't
come from nowhere you know the question
is where it came from
and in my view and exciting and not in
clause achill conclusion is that it just
comes from the way nature works with
computational systems and therefore you
going to find it all over the place yes
if there's there's one more question I'm
really against as a biologist struck by
why linguists are I'm not sure the word
is hostile but apparently indifferent to
this question of what language is for a
biologists look at that and say that
look at language look at its
sophistication
it's it's Paley's and watch on a Heath
it's a complex thing that can only
ultimately be produced as a result of
its adaptive consequences the only
apparent adaptive consequences are the
ones we think that leap immediately to
mind that is exchange of information
cooperative change that's what leaps to
mind it's just a mistake I mean just
look at the I mean what if you want to
well it leaps to the mind of almost
every biologist in the world about
Saturday and when the motion of function
is a very you know loose and vague
notion we all know that so what's the
function of the skeleton I mean just to
keep you from falling into a puddle on
the ground there is it to store calcium
or it's not narrow what to ask what the
function of a bird wing is is a well
focused question maybe but you know if
you actually look at the history of it's
not so well for the evolution of it it's
quite complicated a lot of exaptation
and so on and so forth but the notion of
what a function is is a very vague
notion however what is usually assumed
plausibly is you can get some guide to
what the function is by looking at the
characteristic use okay let's take the
characteristic use of language
characteristic use of languages for the
thought not for communication almost all
language use close to a hundred percent
is internal my understanding was that
that's controversial that is in
particular that most thought is in fact
not linked oh that's another question
yes there could be plenty of thought
that's not linguistic but I'm asking a
different question what's the use of
language statistically speaking it's
almost all internal if you want to check
that just introspect for a couple hours
well it's but that's bait but that's
based on that's based on introspection I
can make my own observation but
introspection is a kind of observation I
mean if we had an outside way of looking
at introspection we'd find the same but
an equivalently plausible interpretation
of that is that that appears to be true
subjectively because the purpose of
language is to prepare our thoughts for
the ultimate purpose of social
communication control phase and say this
if you want but that's now we're off way
and I know those are equal district
competing models should be set them in
desk all we know is all we know is the
following that the overwhelming use of
language close to a hundred percent is
internal and when you think about what
that internal stuff
is it has very little to do with
communication like you can spend half
your life obsessing because somebody
criticized you 10 years ago you don't
expect to communicate it but that's kind
of thing it was on your mind all the
time oh you can even think about
ostensibly you were preparing from an
for an invert into meeting with that
person maybe maybe it's an argument I
need I you know I mean it's just not you
know it's just factually on that correct
it's it straight is arguable it's true
that look everything's arguable but the
overwhelming evidence is that internal
thought is playing some function for us
yeah you know planning agonizing
whatever we do it right and some tiny
piece of it ends up as being
communication incidentally plenty of
other things are involved in
communication too now it could you can
always make up a story that's one of the
things about evolutionary fairytale
manufacturing about all of science
there's notes there about stories yes
they're not testable sorry so Alliance
just so stories are particularly
prominent in this domain but if you want
to use plausible arguments but like
characteristic youth tells you something
about function then I think you'd have
to say that the function of language in
this loose sense is a forethought
some of it ends up being communication
very small parts in fact even the part
that is externalized is communication I
mean a very odd sense I mean like if you
meet somebody it's very hard for people
to be next to each other and not to talk
to each other yeah it's kind of you know
it's like dogs looking at another's eye
you just have to talk to each other so
if you meet some you're standing with
somebody a bus stuff it's just
uncomfortable if you're not talking to
them so you talk to them about the
weather or the baseball game or that's
not communication that's just it's
sometimes called Phatak communication
it's just a way of establishing human
relations social the human but that's
not communication in the sense of
transmitting information or anything
if by communication you just mean
interacting with other people
yeah okay then it would turn out if you
do it descriptively I think it would
turn out like this overwhelmingly
language is internal I mean it's
literally close to a hundred percent
some of it is externalized of the part
that's externalized a lot of it is just
fatik communication and we want to be
part of a group or we don't want to feel
hostile to each other like right you
don't look at it personally you don't
this like gaze is always off to the side
or you stay at a certain distance from
somebody that's rightly a lot of it just
needs to be like that and some very
small part of it is communication and
some independent sense of the word
communication say well you can make up a
story saying that it's that very small
part that drives the system but we have
no evidence for it furthermore if you
look at the mechanics of the system now
we're getting into more technical
aspects I think you can show that a lot
of the mechanics of the system are badly
designed for communication and
well-designed for linking the interfaces
actually one important asset which is if
you if you if any of you are writing
parsing programs you know programs where
you're trying to do automated parsing
there's one overwhelming problem that
you always face and that is a word comes
along like a WH word you know what or
something like that and you know because
of the way language works if there's
going to be it's going to be linked to
some position in the sentence but that
position has to be have not heard to get
so you have the problem of taking word
who and figuring out what unexpressed
there's no space there's no break
there's no nothing but what point in the
utterance is it connected with just
think how easy it would be if you
repeated it so if you didn't say what
did you see but what did you see what
okay then the problem is trivial however
that's computationally more difficult if
you look at the way our beliefs about
the computational systems if they are
recursive is in the way we think that
would involve more computation for
linking the interfaces so here's a
pretty striking case and they're quite
more where the system seems to be
mechanically designed so that it reduces
computation and increases the problem of
perception and I think there are a lot
of cases like this thank you thank you
