mr. Noam Chomsky thank you for taking
the time to meet with us very pleased to
be with we had to come all the way to
Amman Jordan to talk to you you get a
free trip yeah
well I was thinking that you should send
the flowers to the Board of Control
official who said that you can go into
the territories actually Birds a
tortoise and the thanks since it
publicized the talk which otherwise no
one would have ever heard of I mean I've
talked it was it before and nobody ever
knew we were meeting you after the talk
the conference talked the video talked
that you gave tubers ate was there
anything in that talk that might have
talked about you it was mostly but it
was about the United States it was US
foreign relations so of course the
Middle East came up and I talked about
Israel Palestine but I mean it doesn't
compare that talks that I've given in
Israel
you know the Ministry of Interior
apologized and claimed that it was a
simple misunderstanding
that's certainly false it was perfectly
well understood the the border official
was in constant contact with the
ministry and he was he played a role he
was simply referring questions and
comments from the ministry and I
understood everything and there were
reasons were very clear and explicit why
what do you think the reasons were them
they're the ones that kept coming back
from the ministry that he kept asking
over and over one was well he did
mention well they they don't like your
you know they don't like your views the
government so I said yes it's try to
find one government in the world it does
like my views has it happened to many
other country in the world
well there's one case of a country which
wouldn't allow me in that was
Czechoslovakia under the Russians in
1968 it's hard to think of the case and
outside of totalitarian states where
someone has been refused entry because
they've been invited to give a talk at a
particular University and so I guess
you're gonna use this I can hear your
lectures from now and them US campuses
that could
and intended to say anything about it if
I'm asked told and why didn't you try to
come in after the after the ministry
apologized well I just got on time I
have a short trip several countries to
visit I'll go on to the next country so
you were here in Jordan there's eight
you were planned to go to birth date and
tomorrow you're leaving for Beirut and
there's simply another time - and is it
intentional the fact that you haven't
been to Israel in what 1213 years is it
no more intentional than the fact that I
haven't been to Brazil for the same
number of years or Argentina or that
I've never been to countries that I
constantly invited to I'm gonna have a
very intense series of requests for
visits I can't think of it's just just a
matter of a timetable mainly the matter
at the timetable in what's high on the
agenda so by the way we could have
conducted this interview in Hebrew right
you speak fluent Hebrew I'm rusty if it
was fifty years ago
yes your father was a Hebrew professor
yeah and I lived in Israel for a while
and my Hebrew was you know obviously an
American accent but it was fun I can
still read perfectly well but I wouldn't
trust myself to speak I have to think
too hard to get the words out you know I
think it emphasizes the complexity of
the issue because on the one hand you've
I mean you speak Hebrew and you come
from a Jewish family and you talked
about anti-semitism when when you were
young and you you lived on a kibbutz and
you actually considered staying and
living in Israel and on the other side
you were the most outspoken critic of
Israel and I mean you undermine Israel's
existence
that's great force if I don't regard
myself as a critic of Israel as I regard
myself as a supporter of Israel the
people who are harming Israel in my
opinion and so I've said many times are
those who claim to be supporting they
are driving helping drive Israel towards
a moral degeneration and possible
ultimate destruction I think support for
Israel should
support for policies which are to its
benefit you talk about the fact that you
don't support the right of Israel to
exist as a Jewish state I don't report
and we support the Israeli public saw
you should go and shake hands with his
bylaws leader and I swear a lot just a
couple of days before he started the
bombing Israel and a couple of days
before and furthermore they saw pictures
of me meeting nasrallah but they didn't
see pictures of me meeting his main
animate with whom I spent much more time
Wally Jim blood what's happening is that
when I went to Lebanon as in any other
country I tried to find out as much as I
can about the country if I have a little
time so I met with the head of Hezbollah
it's a major political force and Lebanon
in fact in the last elections the
coalition that it's also this this
leader who's calling the demolition of
Israel and actually what Hezbollah's
position has been is that any position
that the Palestinians accept they'll
accept he doesn't think Israel should
exist ok I mean he has so many missiles
which are aiming Israel and now he's
aiming to bomb Tel Aviv but you know
even there should I'm sorry he has
missiles but there is true deterrence
not let's go back a step you said I'm
calling for the destruction of Israel or
some words like I don't think it should
exist as a Jewish state yeah I don't
think the United States should exist as
a Christian State I don't think that
Pakistan should exist as an Islamic
state but there's a big difference
because the United States and Pakistan
there is no nation in the world calling
for their destruction and having a
nuclear weapon like Iran for example
like Iran does not have nuclear weapons
it's not calling for the destruction
it's calling for so many John is very
specific in saying that these are
quotations that are appearing Israeli
press I heard him say that have been his
voice that would hear what he said is I
don't approve that he said in the
quoting Khomeini during a period when
Israel was very close to here and I
didn't mind home a nice saying it he
said in the end of time
Israel will disappear words like that no
he was very specific in and look see
Israel isn't a position of security well
beyond that of many other states which
do not and if insofar as do they call
themselves not states of their citizens
but states of a particular category of
citizens objective in principle so what
should I understand from your words but
are you telling Israelis go back to
Europe live as a minority here in Israel
take a chance disregard history sit on
the beach what we understand from here
what exactly were action tomorrow
exactly what I write a thousand times
though I was opposed to the existence of
a Jewish state and that was part of the
Zionist movement remember as a as a
Zionist youth leader yes I was opposed
to the forming a Jewish state once it
was formed 1948 my position has
consistently been that Israel should
have all the rights of every state in
the international system no more and no
less
now Israel demands more and I don't
agree with it now their ship it's you
know I two weeks ago I interviewed
ership it's on on this show and he said
that quote you are our enemies biggest
assets are Israeli - and Jews like
professor home ski that's a problem for
Dershowitz I have no interest in what he
said he's a I mean if you want the truth
he's a dedicated liar who's been exposed
over and over again
he didn't quote me you notice he didn't
because he knows better than to quote by
the way he offered to come to birthday
to debate you do you think that they
would invite a person like their Shiva
to come and talk and be right you have
to ask that doesn't make any difference
to me
but I mean I've agreed to debate him
reluctantly because he's extremely
dishonest but I'd do it but but this
issue is there's nothing to debate
I mean Israel should have the rights of
any state period it wants more because
it's right to exist is questionable on
other many other states in the world but
no state the United States doesn't
demand that Mexico
except the right of the United States to
exist sitting on half of Mexico because
there isn't a threat when you hear and
listen what Hamas leaders say what Iran
leaders says with his Malala leaders say
you understand that there's an immediate
threat you don't understand that in
1970s when this claim was made for the
first time as far as I know it was when
Egypt in 1971 offered Israel a full
peace treaty full peace treaty nothing
for the Palestinians 1971 Israel
rejected it because it would have meant
withdrawal from the Sinai it's the only
state I know of which wants recognition
of its right to exist is there any
relevance to the fact that you're Jewish
do you think when you make these claims
when you when you union region is right
since I'm Jewish and since I have a
special relationship with Israel since
childhood and since I care about it I
think it should take positions that are
moral realistic and appropriate for its
own decent survival aren't you afraid
that even you if you feel that you're
working for Israel your arguments and
your the very articulate and making your
arguments and are well heard because of
your world reputations aren't you afraid
that these arguments will be misused
from the academic boycott to to the
nuclear weapon in Iran
well actually the academic boycott if
you bother to read is one that I've
opposed that's true it's true that my
statements will be misused for example
by Dershowitz who is very dangerous for
Israel but yes he he's dangerous for
Israeli and he distorts and
misrepresents my statements in ways
which help his cause of supporting
Israeli aggression and expansion which
is very dangerous for Israel but even if
I could understand or try to understand
the academic philosophical approval of a
person like you for the freedom of
speech even if Holocaust deniers not
even specifically its person
specifically for views you detest that
for which you call for a certain point
not certainly because history has proved
otherwise
you're taking a lot of responsibility I
believe in freedom of speech for Alan
Dershowitz even though the record of his
exposed lies is incredible
