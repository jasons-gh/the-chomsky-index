I think that they are religious fanatics
that they happen to believe in the state
religion which is much more dangerous
with other religions for the most part
so there both of them happen to be
defenders in the state religion namely
the religion that says we have to
support the violence and atrocities of
our own state but because it's being
done for also some wonderful reasons
which is exactly what everyone says in
every state and I don't regard that's
just another religion like the religion
that market so bad it doesn't happen to
be a religion the great whoever here
once a week but it's just another
religion is very destructive
