ladies and gentlemen we were all very
welcome to the hist and the GMB and many
of you in the audience are familiar with
our Wednesday night debates but for
those of you who aren't I just like to
put some context on the event and the
gold medal and what this means to the
society spanning for centuries now the
hisses tried to facilitate this course
through the medium of debate and it
holds that it's very poor the ideals of
free speech and intellectualism
and a commitment to a serious and
respectful engagement with all ideas
that are brought to the table and it was
at the meetings of this society first
wolf down the revolutionary Wolfe Tone
articulated his vision for for a free
Ireland where Douglas ID addressed is
that pride in the Irish language as an
undergraduate and with the life karna
Cruiser Brian to develop his skills in
oratory and there's a fundamental
acknowledgement in this society does
that enlightens discussion can only be
brought away through discussion
engagement with all ideas that like the
broadest spectrum of ideas in society
and public discourse takes what the hist
does and it brings it to a mass audience
but and although this heightens the
capacity to see like to change minds
through discussion it also can in some
ways undermine at the true the process
and compromise the integrity of that
spectrum of debate Hey not only has Noam
Chomsky improve in bringing about argues
arguments and crucial dissent against
him against the mainstream narrative
through his analysis of things such as
American foreign policy perhaps more
importantly what he has done is he's
brought about a fundamental awareness of
half that blade after spectrum of
discussion and transformed people's
awareness of what political and public
discourse in society really is today
what seems to drive professor Thompson's
work is the belief and defense in that
rudimental democratic value after
maintaining a check on Peres and its
capacity for abuse in a world focused on
the demerit of democracy professor
Chomsky is perhaps one of the most
important intellectuals a lot alive he
ranks with Marx grants with Shakespeare
and the Bible as the most quoted sources
in the humanities and it is a great
privilege that I welcome to the College
Historical Society and to Trinity
College - and it is with honor that I
presented with his gold medal for
outstanding contribution to public
discourse
I understand correctly my assignment is
to explain why I can't say a few words
about yesterday Irish Times there was an
article one of thousands of articles on
the critically important event that
we're commemorating and celebrating in
November next week and the liberating
Eastern Europe from its Russian master
the Irish Times article was about a very
important meeting that took place in
Berlin of the three presidents who were
critical critically involved time George
Bush number one Helmut Kohl Gorbachev
meant and discuss what the newspaper
calls the burning issue now the question
who was Texas who gets the credit for
breaking down the Berlin Wall opening up
to the west and they debated Bush people
of East Berlin Eastern Europe who should
get the credit they finally achieved the
rights that their their god-given rights
and Gorbachev the United States should
have a period of perestroika the topic
and cold ended up by saying only yes II
agree it's really the people not us
important that I read it and this is
there's a raft of such articles in fact
the New York Times has open competitions
with people who tell where they were
when it fell which is okay this is a
critically important event we should
commemorate the first thing that came to
mind when I read it was the grand
inquisitor
chapter
Brothers Karamazov story it's in Seville
the height of the Inquisition and
there's the streets
turns out Jesus Christ appeared he was
immediately picked up by the security
forces brought to the grand inquisitor
and the grand inquisitor explains to him
the why he's gonna have to execute
because he has to put an end to the evil
works of Christ who's just bringing
misery to the masses by trying to bring
them freedom and the masses of people
don't want freedom so I make them
miserable they may think they want to
lead on what they want is worship
complete submission inquisitor
submission to Authority well but it
relates even more closely to a non-event
an important non event that took place
about the same time
what happened is pretty much anyone
comes with Christ's message edges in the
early sixties there was an effort to
revive with the Christianity of the
Gospels theology especially in South
America elsewhere to the bishops under
what was called the preferential option
for the poor they bishops and laypeople
part of this was the lay people should
participate directly went out
there's no the nearest thing to the
grand inquisitor around so actually
there to US government of the Vatican
and they come I put an end to the Harris
the Vatican and in this case we don't
have to ask the school of the American
School of the Americas
scold I think confession confession they
changing the name but it's the same
School of the Americas which drains
Latin American killers one of their
talking points advertising point is it
the US Army helped defeat the bravery
theology which is quite true the Vatican
helps buddy
taking out the dangerous radicals who
were daring preach the gospel
the US Army is killing that episode from
the early sixties ended on November 16
1989 that's when the judgment of the
Grand Inquisitor was apply every 16
which is already killed six we need
Latin American intellectuals the
massacre of November 16th
I have a painting Jesuit priests which
is a symbolic representation Archbishop
Romero 1980 by pretty much the same
substantial measure of workers the
church he was killed six Jesuit priests
and they're an interesting who knows
what it is well it turns out from the
United States from America in the early
exactly this but I love how they came to
the United States talk to a joint
session of Congress and he got a
standing ovation growling when he
praised the United States
if reading this is right after they had
murdered six of his counterpart putting
finishing off the taking place in
between just imagine the situation
community first and that gives you a
sharp indication of what's an event and
what's a non-event colleagues have been
murdered by a Russian train tens of
thousands of checks and at the same
things were going
after this suppose that he had gone to
Moscow and spoken by calling the Russian
defenders retreat
we'd know we might not
that's their 20th anniversary these two
historic events break down Russian
control over Eastern Europe and the
destruction
acquisitive and we know which one's the
United States as far as I know there's
only one commemoration of the
anniversary at the Boston Boston collar
we're one of the surviving Jesuits young
Sabrina but if there's a reference in
the press
one story in the collection of essays
and he starts off the review by saying
he learned interesting one of the things
you learn is that when Columbus came to
the Western Hemisphere
we no longer discovered
when they encounter Columbus in the
Western Hemisphere
he found the hemisphere that was
essentially him from the steamy tropics
to the part of North were maybe million
people stragglers
that there were major cities making
civilization about the only difference
between them was they're much healthier
they didn't have his name weather so
they were exterminated a century
genocide denial this is the major major
the British colonists in Massachusetts
city on the hill
the sermon of Massachusetts in 1630
praising our mission of the year before
the Massachusetts Bay Colony had gotten
its charter from the king of England and
the Charter was given so that they could
carry out the mission of saving the
pagans from their miserable fate Great
Seal Massachusetts that shows an Indian
with his spear and out of his mouth is
coming a scroll and on the scroll that
says come over and help us so that's
what they were doing they were coming
over to help the native people
we might intervention and in the process
terminates has strange waves
somehow they faded away is the superior
race that's the way history recorded
accepted
[Music]
Thank You noon now I'm gonna ask none to
tell you a very good story which I
stopped him telling at lunch today he
thinks it might be true and it's about
George W Bush and the prophet Ezekiel
and I stopped him telling it because I
was sure it would be worthy of a wider
audience I haven't heard it and I
couldn't believe it so it's true that's
here's the story I received a letter an
article from Belgian theologian the
article was a learning district ation on
a very obscure passage in Ezekiel which
nobody understands it's the passage
about I mean nobody knows whether Gogan
my other people but it enters into
evangelical Christian theology or
whoever your enemies so when Reagan and
they were coming down this is January
2003 saying
presumably coming down Israel least
Armageddon
souls that have been saved rise to
heaven everyone else the Christian
evangelical tradition in which this is a
part is very strongly pro-israel the one
of the main pro-israel blocks but they
are also the most anti-semitic element
in the world there in the history their
picture is all the Jews would be killed
I mean unless they happen to convert
can't get anything better than that
anyhow Bush was meeting with Jacques
Chirac the president of France he was
trying to convince sure act to join in
on the war against Iraq fortunately I
didn't have that problem 10 Downing
Street didn't have to quote physique you
but the course of the discussion with
Chirac he started going on can you
explain what this maniac is raving about
they didn't know so they approached this
Belgian theologian who explained what it
was all about that's what we've survived
it's kind of amazing that we survived a
world in which finger on the button that
can destroy us all in five seconds
often some world where the same reagan
fact in the same for the last 50 years
on for years the large part of the fate
of the world that's been in the hands of
one lunatic who's waiting for the second
coming waiting for the 12th imam
human sir if somebody was watching this
on mars they would think that humans
survived it was a miracle since we're
talking about god we must move to down
in the street
tony blair obviously has a special
relationship with god Bobby the curse
does not give him any advice and he
didn't say you know turning this Iraq
thing may not be such a good idea
I wonder if you could tell us know why
statesmen either want to be close to God
or why they want to be Winston Churchill
and Roosevelt there seems to be a world
war two fascination with these people
you don't have to explain Tony Blair to
us but I'd like that as well
the Irish did too for example just given
one example he was sometimes
refreshingly honest
so in fact right before the First World
War he gave a speech and in the
Parliament which he later published but
editing out all the parts later
discovered and it explains why we have
to rule the world he says we've gained
control of vast amounts of territory by
violence and terror and now it's ours
and we've got us to maintain it and we
have a right to protect he went on later
in history the Second World War to say
that we are like rich men living in
their ample habitations we just want to
be left in peace so leave us alone he
then went on in 1934 to ordered the army
to the army command to develop a plan
which he called to implement in May 1944
they wouldn't do it it was called
operation unthinkable operation
unthinkable it was a plan to you he
wanted them not to destroy
too much of German because we need them
to employ the bare mouth and the RAF and
the American forces to attack and
destroy Russia
this is 1944 when the Russians are
fighting the overwhelming bulk at war
against the Nazis was planning an
operation to destroy them using the
German army that's been pretty well
hidden it was finally be classified a
couple of years ago but I don't know if
it's been reported anywhere you find it
in the histories of British intelligence
so he's an interesting character a lot
of interesting things so why do people
either want to be close to God or close
to Churchill over seven churches easy
they want and you want to be close to
the people why did he post a god well
you know that's a yeah that's a
british-american
perversion goes back very far it goes
back to England which was a providential
us culture you know God guides us in the
United States that the colonists came
over from England mostly religious
fanatics they were kind of extremist
religious elements and they carried with
them the providential was streaked in
British culture and it lasted for a
glance right in the present
same thing we're fulfilling God's will
God has strange ways sometimes it turns
out that the the native population fades
away before our glory but it's we're
still fulfilling God's will and since
were the shining city on the hill we go
wrong even for the occasional nation
states so it's really good to be close
to God it justifies everything you do
this was combined in the United States
with another British lunacy the
anglo-saxon racism revival which took
place around the Reformation passages
Germani know in which he describes how
the Aryan race developed ran is and they
were kanuda species pull along the
grains courageous intelligent just
totally new species they migrated that
they migrated to the German forests
there they became two tons
they then migrated farther west and they
conquered the British Isles and then
they in the later version they migrated
across the Atlantic they became the
Americans Thomas Jefferson for example
is a great believer of this some of them
made a mistake some of the Aryans
intermarried with the populations they
conquered and that led to racial
degeneration so you get the
Mediterranean
sort of 30 and inefficient and so on so
forth but the pure areas never get her
married this exterminated everybody so
they they kept anglo-saxon purity
that's why Britain was such a fantastic
place and then right through the 19th
century in the United States the
anglo-saxon mythology was very
widespread when the u.s. conquered the
Philippines
General MacArthur in charge of talking
to Congress this is about a century ago
early 20th century he explained to
Congress this was a philippine killed a
couple hundred thousand people that was
again in order to civilize them and he
explained to Congress that we had to do
this because we're following and because
we're we are the anglo-saxon race the
pure anglo-saxon race and we have to
follow the tradition from the German
forests through England ourselves to
benefit the rest of the people of the
world by exterminating they'll be
happier when they're exterminated and
the anglo-saxon race takes over and this
is all God's will because we're
following the will of Providence that's
kind of unbeatable it's a good democracy
in 2006 the Palestinians have a fair
election and stupid enough people
then in June which I had to do this
pleasure of witnessing Ahmadinejad was
elected by a impossibly high vote as
president of Iran when I was asked to
ask him the question immediately
afterwards I called him mr. Ahmadinejad
sir which was my slimy way of avoiding
calling him president but nonetheless
after lots of so sulking we kind of
accepted it then we have the elections
in Afghanistan of which were obviously
fortunate and the Americans insisted on
Iraq because they didn't believe Karzai
was necessary a legitimate president
then his opponent refused to participate
in the runoff which would of course cost
a lot of Western lives we don't care
about the Afghan ones and then yesterday
we learned that the election tribunal
which is run by one of the Karzai's
apparatchiks said that he is now the
president that won't be a runoff and he
got the congratulations of Gordon Brown
and your President Obama who had earlier
said that this was a complete fraud so
they're now congratulating utterly
fraudulently elected president and
presumably were to send 40,000 can you
rather this for me he's a stunning
emilyschutt even recognized by
scholarship so democracy promotion is
one of those slogans that everyone's in
favor of actually we have now a lot of
Russian archives when the Communist
apparatchiks decided to become a third
world elite back in 1990 one of the
things they did is sell everything
including the archive
whole scholarly industry called Cold War
history which is pouring over the
archives to see if they can find
something that'll justify but the u.s.
did during the Cold War's some of the
stuff in the archives is interesting
that's about this I mean you have these
gangsters talking to each other
internally not for any public users
Gromyko and they're talking very sincere
about the need to protect democracy in
Eastern Europe from the fascist attack
led by the United States which is trying
to undermine and I'm sure it's perfectly
sincere no indication that the KGB is
listening that's what they believe and
it's the same here Western diplomats
talk about their dedication to democracy
promoting now this has been studied the
best scholarly study of this look at it
is by Thomas brothers who incidentally
is a neo Reaganite he's very much in
favor of democracy promotion because
it's a wonderful thing he writes both
from the inside he was in the Reagan
State Department and as a scholar he's a
careful scholar is head of the Carnegie
Endowment democracy
I was writing this these things here are
several books on the history of
democracy promotion they're going way
back right through the Reagan years
during the Reagan years what he knew
from the inside service commitment
democracy promotion he points out that
democra there was in fact progress
towards democracy is about Latin America
is progress towards democracy in Latin
America namely in the South where the US
had very little influence and he said
the Reagan administration tried to
prevent it but it couldn't and
nevertheless there was progress there
democracy in the surrounding region
where the US had much more power and
influence they said there was no
progress because he says because the US
would support only particular forms of
democracy that left in power traditional
elites that would be act in conformity
with US interests so that's kind of a
paradox about the Reagan administration
but then he extends it
he said the paradox experienced appalled
administrations he said in every
administration the United States
supports democracy if and only if it
conforms to strategic and economic
objectives yes and he says all leaders
are some house gets a friend
you know they need psychiatric care they
don't see that there's something strange
about their puzzle they're supporting
democracy think of another reason but
that's his conclusion but he does record
the facts correctly it goes
the second Bush administration and and
it's a great surprise to anybody who is
purposely blind about history and policy
like the fading away of the indigenous
population when we came to save
Christianized history is full of such
puzzles last question - no I'm preceded
by a memory of mine when I first went to
Israel in 1976 I thought it was a very
European country good phone system nice
food democracy Parliament everything
when I go there now and see the
settlements and the wall lot of security
fence please a wall I wonder if it will
survive and it was a Jewish friend of
mine in California when I was about to
give a talk some months ago who were
looking at the wall of the hall where I
was to speak Jewish philanthropists are
extremely generous in the United States
and of course most of the names on the
wall were Jewish and I said to Jeffrey
my friend I said you know do you think
what do you think if you were in Israel
would you live there would you live here
and he said I think Robert this might be
Israel and that place to the south of
Lebanon where you live is a small
colonial project which may or may not
work and I recall how I used to think
when I first went to Yugoslavia long
before the war I believed in the other
Slavic the Yugoslavs did not was relate
to discovered will Israel survive
even in the days very attractive place
as late as maybe 15 20 years 20 years
ago I consider if we had to leave the
United States for some reason to
probably go there and it changed I mean
there was a dark side very dark side I'm
it's a settler colonial society a
settler colonialism is the absolute
worst form of imperialism because you
have to act like the Aryans and the two
tons and the in the minute that Sarah
Anglo Saxon origin you have to
exterminate the natives or get rid of
them something that's a part of settler
colonialism so it's absolutely the worst
kind of it you want telling the history
it's true that the part of the society
that we would run into that I would see
that you would see was a very civilised
West Western artists society in the best
sense
it was like a Scandinavian social
democracy and that's changed now it's
very much like the United States it says
very high inequality this social system
is collapsed a lot of well very advanced
high-tech economy with tremendous
amounts of poverty and that's even
excluding the settlers of the wall which
is just an annexation of all the other
cars there so will it survive my feeling
actually I wrote about this shortly
after the occupation of the West Bank in
Gaza that the worst enemies of Israel
were those who were supporting it what
they're in fact supporting is Israel's
moral degeneration and ultimate
destruction and I increasingly think
that that's true in fact you could see
it very quickly so in 1971 President
Sadat of Egypt offered Israel a full
peace treaty in return for a withdrawal
from occupied territories that he didn't
care one way or another about the West
Bank what he cared about was Egyptian
territory so in return for a withdrawal
from Egyptian territory they could had
full peace well you know peace with
Egypt means major security problems are
over
that's the only meaningful military
force in the region there's nothing for
the
it's early seventies Palestinians
weren't an issue so nothing for the
Palestinians full fees in return for
withdrawal from the Sinai well at the
time Israel was carrying out substantial
there was planning substantial
settlement programs in the Northeast to
sign on which they were driving out tens
of thousands with Bedouin farmers
driving into the desert destroying town
putting up a lot of settlements in one
big city they were planning a city meet
million people on the Seacoast that was
the civilized period and had a choice at
that time very clear choice do we choose
security or expansion they chose an
expansion they rejected the offer now
the critical question as always is
what's the boss gonna say watch what he
says and there was a internal to the US
government there was a conflict between
the Secretary of State William Rogers
and the National Security Advisor Henry
Kissinger a Kissinger had his primary
enemy in the world was William Rogers
because the second way down somewhere it
was the Russians the reason was he
wanted to become Secretary of State in
which case he would run everything not
have divided Authority so if Roger said
it's raining Kissinger would tell Nixon
the Sun is right well Rogers was in
favor of accepting so that's proposal in
fact is pretty close to
so Kissinger had to be against and
Kissinger had a policy which he called
stalemate no negotiations just
so he he succeeded in winning the
bureaucratic battle Secretary of State
they backed Israel's rejection of
Saddam's offer that led directly to the
1973 Brewer said I kept saying
repeatedly okay 1973 war came home was a
very close thing for Israel they were on
the verge of destruction they apparently
loaded weapon Kissinger called a nuclear
alert in the whole world destruction
well you know they managed to carry it
off at the end and it's one thing
Kissinger understands its force maybe
that's why I got the mobility so he
recognized I can't just write off Egypt
as a basket case then it comes the
reconstruction of history that academics
in the media responsible for what
followed after that was what was called
shuttle diplomacy Kissinger they grant a
diplomat is flying on them back
everywhere you know getting people to
talk to each other
carrying out
finally in 1978 they Israel in the
United States and Egypt made an
agreement Camp David agreement which
which essentially accepted so that's
1971 offer now that goes down in history
as a very diplomatic triumph Kissinger
gets the Nobel Prize in fact it was a
diplomatic catastrophe I mean what
happened is that they rejected in 1971
the offer which could have ended the
conflict and in 1978 in 79 they were
forced to accept it okay diplomatic
that's and since then it's just been
downhill you cannot carry out a military
occupation becoming occupiers and
maintain your elementary moral values
you can't be robbing people killing them
stealing their land stealing their
resources without being becoming racist
if you're crushing somebody you've got
to have a justification and the only
justification can be their evil nature
universes right through the history
chocolates their evil nature you know
this way better than I do like after the
Irish Famine British figures were coming
here and saying that it's the evil
nature of the Irish I remember one
English historian whose name describe
how awful it was here after the famine
which of course the Irish were
responsible for he said when you get to
Ireland what you see is human
chimpanzees but of course we see that
all over the world Africa Southeast
Asian but what's particularly awful
about in Ireland is that the human
chimpanzees have white faces that's
black faces brown faces or something but
it's their fault
yeah and everything we do is therefore
to another star for the universal and
another one is that there's a category
of people intellectuals are supposed to
make make this
I think we better have some serious
questions just a few but anyone want to
ask a question of Professor Chomsky
there's a gentleman over speak up
political debate in the United States
seems to be very detached
why do you think that is same reason it
is everywhere do you know the place
where political debate isn't detached
from reality and in fact there's a kind
of correlation the more powerful the
country is the more detached the more
crimes it's committing that's almost
automatic and hence the more detached
from reality discussion has to do
there's less to conceal there's less to
delude people
grayza manufacturing consent to in fact
that plagiarized and he says the wrong
notion it should be manufacturing
deceived i should add that the the
column began with the words professor
Chomsky is right and it ended with the
words professor Chomsky was wrong which
is why he's bringing it up now
anybody else lady over here just speak
up now
but I don't think you can but you can
have countries beginning of the sixties
engaged active changes so the activism
of the sixties began in part of this
reaction to disillusionment with
Jonathan Tanana the candidate came in
with the same kind of charisma instead
of giving up they became civil rights
movement in the early sixties was mostly
students
it began with black students and black
colleges in the South sitting at a lunch
at counters later riding freedom buses
they were joined by pretty soon there's
a mass movement it compelled Kennedy to
back off support we service education
legislation very relaxed at least the
formal right to participate in society
for the first time that was a big step
okay that led to that was a major factor
that led to the
and for five years after the Kennedy
started the war there was a substantial
and a war movie and it was significant
and in a much more opposition to the
aggression today than there was any
that's one reason why Bush couldn't use
the tactics enough in Iraq could not use
the tactics that were freely Littlejohn
intended the saturation bombing the kind
of warfare there's a constraint in the
70s again it was always there for
centuries the activism of the 60s
including quite interesting things if
you look at the internal dynamics so the
the leading edge of the anti-war
movement in the 60s was the resistance
these were young men mostly were taking
serious risks it's not fine under 18 to
say okay I'll go to jail for five years
or leave
that's what they were doing and they
wanted to feel morally upright about it
but if you look at the inner workings of
the resistance I was writing a little
insurgency it had the standard one of
the strains that led to the youth
element and the feminist movement of the
70s we just expanded all over the place
so like say my own university MIT if you
walk down the hall in 1960 it was white
males will dress thysen jackets
deferentially
you walk down the halls today looks like
this and that's a big change
it's a change that it reflects the
society more Souls and later you get
things like the International which is
unique in the history of materialism why
should it stop and Kenny
just one more question general the
spectacles yeah
it's hard to get away from those
opportunity series areas like
where can you come to the questioning a
good time yeah
is there any chance of humanitarian
intervention which doesn't have an
ulterior motive I think that's basically
the question humanitarian intervention
between the scholar series scholar found
three examples of humanitarian
intervention miscellanies invasion of
Ethiopia Japan's invasion of Manchuria
he didn't mean that they were real
humanitarian ever venture what he meant
is those are the three cases where a
strong case was made that it's
humanitarian that's pretty typical there
are other studies that go way back
sometimes they find one example of the
French intervention in Syria 1860 or
something but then if you look at the
details it was just part of France
trying to establish its power
maybe the British intervention in Sierra
Leone the ads conceivably you know it's
like Gandhi is alleged answer to the
question what do you think about Western
civilization and he's supposed to have
said well it might be a good idea
yeah that's like what you were saying
you mentioned the Congo yeah it's kind
of interesting case the Congo is
absolutely the worst catastrophe going
on anywhere has been for years any dark
is a huge save committees that's pretty
awful no doubt but it isn't a fraction
of what's going on in the Congo
so why of course nobody talks about
doing anything just let's shrink about
the figure in Darfur you can blame it on
enemies the errors the enemy so they're
doing so terrible if you look at the
condo it's a little harder for one thing
the worst atrocities are carrying out by
Rwanda which is Washington's closest
ally so that before except the other
thing is that the multinational
corporations are all over the eastern
Congo for the fighting is going on
they're using the militias who are
slaughtering everybody to gain control
over the rich resources of the eastern
Congo and you should all be apply at
least all of you who have cell phones
the same with much else so you know
talking making a big fuss about the
eastern Congo is kind of difficult it's
a little bit like this January 2006
election and the pre-election in
Palestine it's the only free election in
the Arab world it's not nice to talk
about that while we're creating about
democracy promotion since we u.s.
instantly moved in to punish the
population partially for voting the
wrong way I think I'll end with a tiny
historical anecdote that Professor
Chomsky may not know he referred to as a
French involvement in Syria which of
course was the civil war between
Christians and Druze in Lebanon was
called the anti Lebanon and then the
malevolent Federation but in fact the
French went in to protect Christians the
British arrived on warships which they
moored in Sidon and went to defend the
Druze and they said that if the Druze
would accept British protection they
would have a particularly unique offer
for Druze tribal leader
leaders and that is that the British
would arrange for their sons to go to
English public schools
I just like to wrap up I am once again
at thanking the guests for coming baked
professor Chomsky and Robert Pearson
have taken the time out of their
schedule free of charge they don't
charge anyone for doing this and that's
why we were able to do what we do and so
just on behalf of the committee and the
college is ours but I just like to once
again thank you
and I don't think we really have time
tonight and I just want to give a
rundown of what the a few what events
will be happening over the next few days
and tomorrow as always there has to be
having it's Wednesday night debate and
it was touched on today in the Indian
terview and that this house would
negotiate with Hamas
so it'll it and address the legitimacy
of Hamas as a political organization on
Thursday night Robert Fisk who is
another gold medalist of the society and
and gave an address last year which is
phenomenal if you want to get another
taste of that that will be on Thursday
at half seven he'll be being interviewed
by John Bowman and if you want to get
tickets they're available on seminars ie
for us I think you can get them at the
National Concert Hall when you go there
I'm I'm not sure but I'm pretty certain
from having woman Brad their website up
there is a student price available
so it's quite affordable and if you'd
like to get involved
there are plenty ways to get involved
with the hist first of all there's the
Orang l committee so if you want to kind
of do the things that we do and get some
dinner guests in some of us just email
sensor at the his calm and always check
out our facebook page you don't need to
be on facebook to check it but it's
always got information about the events
that we're doing and and then finally
our next week's debate the week after
that will be a student show debate on
the motion don't you have to 4ms pro
patria mori so with that I just like it
thank everyone for coming along
[Applause]
