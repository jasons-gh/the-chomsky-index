is there an alternative to institutional
means of production and I think are
there other ways of arranging production
yeah I mean you sort of seem to be
hinting that the way to go is to sort of
impose regulations that would ensure
more democratic institutions and the
means of production is that well I think
it's not so much impose regulations that
would ensure it I think absolutist
institutions should not be given legal
status I don't think we should give
legal status to organic entities that
stand over and above the rights of
individuals whether they're called
fascism or Bolshevism or corporations or
whatever so I I do think that human
rights come from nature are sort of
rooted in human nature really and that
these collectivist institutions are not
persons it shouldn't have right how
should the production be organized well
you know I don't think that's a trivial
question the answer you have to sort of
experiment but the principles ought to
be I think pretty much the ones that
were expressed by mill hands in Lowell
century ago those who work in the mills
or own them and they ought to carry out
to democratic decision-making about how
they work in conjunction with
communities who play a role as consumers
and families and participants and so on
there are a lot of modalities in which
that could be worked out but I don't I
mean there are people who in fact have
sketched out detailed proposals
personally I'm a little skeptical I
don't think anyone's smart enough to
design a society at least I don't know
how but I think you have to sort of try
you know try various things see how they
work and so on
