the world and you come back still
further this was understood even better
it was understood for example by Adam
Smith and David Ricardo the founders of
modern economics it's interesting to
look back at what they said Adam Smith
understood the dangers of neoliberalism
wasn't called that Ben but the pretty
much insane what he he recognized again
was concerned with England he wrote that
if in England the merchants and
manufacturers no masters of mankind than
his day if they decided to invest abroad
and to purchase from abroad they would
profit but England would decline however
he said he doesn't think this is going
to happen because the merchants and
manufacturers will be influenced by
what's called a home bias they'll prefer
they'll be concerned with the welfare of
their own country and they'd prefer to
invest at home and buy at home and
therefore he said as if by an invisible
hand England will be saved the ravages
of what we now call neoliberalism that
passage and wealth of nations is pretty
hard to miss it's the only occurrence of
the famous phrase invisible hand in the
whole book that's not what you're taught
in school so the one occurrence is a
critical attack on basically what's now
called neoliberalism the hope that won't
apply to England that required us at
exactly the same thing that he
recognized that his famous principle of
comparative advantage it wouldn't work
if pretty of course also concerned with
England English investors that chose to
do everything somewhere else yeah not
exit but he said he hoped that they
wouldn't do this he didn't use the
phrase invisible hand but he said
they'll be influenced by home bias and
therefore England will be spared market
ravages and he says
this is a feeling that will remain won't
be won't disappear well the instincts of
the classical economists were quite good
the predictions are another matter the
there's more to say about this I don't
want to go on going on too long haul
stuff the let me just say another
something else about elections which is
obviously once coming out so it's pretty
crucial the two thousand eight election
was essentially brought by financial
institutions they got their rewards the
rest of us the rest of the population
you've got a blow to the solar plexus
but that's in accord with Smith's Maxim
and what about the next election well
the next election is I should say you
probably know this but if you don't all
say it that the Masters understand
exactly what's going on so after the two
thousand eight election obama won a
prize from the advertising industry
public relations industry he wasn't they
give an annual award for the best
marketing campaign of the year and obama
won the award in 2008 he beat out apple
computer and if you look at the business
press the business executives were you
for it they said this is you know they
said we've been marketing candidates
like toothpaste there wasn't reagan and
this is the best we've ever done it's
going to change the atmosphere in
corporate boardrooms it was incredible
what happens in 2012 well you know ever
since the seventies the cost of election
has been rising very fast and that has
an effect it drives the worth of the
parties that deep into the pockets of
corporate america that's what the money
is for the republicans that's like
reflexes not even a problem the
democrats have a somewhat more diffused
constituency not that different but by
now the Democrats so cold or what used
to be called moderate Republicans if you
read say eisenhower that he would be
similar way out on the left today
literally but the Democrats are wood
used to be called moderate Republicans
they've disappeared and they're
following the same path actually Obama
is exactly the same he's he's got a big
concern right now how to get reelected
the next election is predicted to cost
about two billion dollars that's
monstrous and there's only one place
where he can find you know a billion
dollar now do you look at his
appointments that's exactly what they
reflect I mentioned earlier than in his
economic team they were almost all
people who created the crisis there was
in fact one exception a poll Folker
Folker was reagan's Secretary of
Treasury but the spectrum that's shifted
so far to the right that he was the
leftist in the Obama administration he
was the one person who was calling for
some sort of regulation you know
breaking up the big banks and stuff like
that well about a couple months ago he
was dismissed replaced by Jeffrey Immelt
the CEO of General Electric amounts job
the job assignment for him was to create
jobs there's something others have to
understand about the English language if
I can go off into the other part of my
brain there's a unpronounceable word an
obscene word in English I have to spell
it there might be children in the crowd
it's a PR 0 F I TS you're not allowed to
say that the way that words pronounced
is jobs so when you ever hear literally
you hear a political leader saying you
know this is a job-killing bill or we
got to get jobs and so on you have to
translate it you can't say it
I've seen translate so a melt has put in
there to get jobs how is he going to get
jobs yge well Obama pointed out look
this is the biggest corporation in the
US but it happens that more than half of
its workforce is abroad and most of its
profits coming from abroad and by now
it's mostly a financial corporation and
it does still make light bulbs but most
of what it's done is is financial it
does its financial manipulations and of
course when it collapses as it does
periodically and the crises you bail it
out so that's where we're going to get
the jobs not from folker the residue of
the left-wing Reagan administration
which we now have to dispense with well
you know there's one general point about
all this which I I'll finish with is
there's a if you studied and took an
economics course you learn that there's
couple of things you learn that one
thing you learn is that markets which
are a marvelous thing are based on
informed consumers making rational
choices most of you have say looked at a
television program I guess and you've
seen ads I mean is an ad trying to
create an informed consumer will make a
rational choice I mean just ask yourself
you're not supposed to notice this when
you take your economics course if we had
a market system anything like it then an
ad would be a description of the native
the characteristics of the product it
would be like what you read and
consumers report consumer report that's
obviously not what an ad is it's trying
to delude you into making an irrational
choice based on lack of information and
in fact the goal of one of the major
goals of business is to undermine
markets by creating irrational consumers
will make uninformed uninformed
consumers will make irrational choices
well when the same institutions
want to destroy democracy they do
exactly the same thing when they run
elections which are now run by the PR
agencies they want to make sure that you
have uninformed voters making irrational
choices and you take a close look at
electoral campaigns and you can see that
that's exactly what's happening same
techniques are used to undermine
democracy that are used to undermine
markets now there's another thing you
learned in an economics course their
fundamental market inefficiencies you
learn iment every for first course that
one of them is what's called
externalities the things that are not
taken into consideration when you make a
transaction so like if say you sell me a
car and we've got our eyes open we make
a deal that's okay for ourselves but we
don't take into consideration the effect
on other people and there's an effect
like this more congestion there's more
pollution you know other things and that
multiplies a lot considering the number
of people so that's a negative
externality we disregard it I suppose
you're an investment banker say for
Goldman Sachs you make a transaction you
try to make sure that it works for
Goldman Sachs you don't take into
account something that's called systemic
risk that is the likelihood that your
transaction will crash the whole system
there is such a likelihood it's constant
but it's underestimated because it's an
externality to footnote well you know
that's bad that's what leads one of the
things that necessarily leads to crises
and it's understood you can read it in
major economic books well you know
that's not the end of the world when the
system crashes again if it was in a
capitalist economy there'd be
self-correcting because they do out of
business but in our kind of state which
is designed by and for the Masters of
mankind the taxpayer comes in rescues
you however that's not lethal necessary
harmful but not lethal however there are
other cases of externalities where
nobody's going to come to the rescue and
one of them is very much on the agenda
right now I'll end with that that's
destruction of the environment if you
destroy the environment nobody's going
to rescue you and that is an externality
if you're a CEO let's say that your task
is to ensure that the calm that the
environment is destroyed that's not an
exaggeration you must act so as to
maximize short-term profit and market
share if you don't in fact that's a
legal obligation in the anglo-american
system but furthermore if you don't do
it you'll be kicked out and somebody
also come in who will do it so it's kind
of like an institutional fact about the
system well what does that mean that
means you may very well know that the
acts you're carrying out will lead to
destruction of the environment you
cannot take that into consideration if
you can't if you do you're out somebody
else is in it does it and that's not a
that's an externality the externality in
this case is the fate of the species but
nobody is going to come in and take care
of that and that's exactly what we're
seeing right now there are big major
campaigns being carried out by the
Chamber of Commerce because business
lobby by American Petroleum Institute
and others that to convince people that
global warming is a liberal hoax and
it's effective by now probably
two-thirds of the population either
denied thats taking place our doubts it
and that's showing up in Congress the
new Congress just about maybe ever close
to all maybe all of the new Republicans
in the House our global warming deniers
for what we're still a lot of them are
true believers like the head of one of
the House committees on the environment
has informed the world that it can't be
a problem global warming because God
promised Noah that there wouldn't be
another flood
well you shouldn't laugh I mean if this
was happening in some tiny remote
country somewhere okay good laugh when
it's happening in the most in the
richest and most powerful country in
human history you can't laugh because if
and furthermore these guys are acting on
those assumptions of the Environmental
Protection Agency was instituted by
Richard Nixon he was the last liberal
president that wasn't feeling I'm not
kidding and it's now being destroyed
it's being underfunded it's being
prevented from looking at greenhouse gas
emissions and so on and so forth that's
a sign of the shift that's taking place
consistent with everything else that I
described that's part of the vicious
cycle and it's going very far and if if
this continues its nobody's going to
rescue us that's it's going to be the
end well when we laugh at the
congressman who's talking about God
talking to noah we are qualified that
laughter by recognizing that the current
economic crisis is also the result of
fanatic religious belief belief and the
religion that markets know best so
therefore the Fed and the economics
profession didn't have to notice that
the economy is going totally out of
whack eight trillion dollars of nothing
was bolstering the economy since we have
efficient markets I have a theorem to
prove it then who cares no well crashed
fortunately you could be rescued that
time not this time so we really have a
choice we can either passively observe
what's going on and or try to do
something about it and if we passively
observe you can predict the outcome
there will be a major destruction and
those who survive will be able to
contemplate the outcome well
you've been listening to a lecture by
professor Noam Chomsky speaking at the
University of Oregon in Eugene the title
for this lecture is global hegemony the
facts the images in a moment we'll
return to the question and answer
session from the presentation Noam
Chomsky was considered the father of
modern linguistics his work in the field
has had far-reaching consequences
ranging across the disciplines of
psychology mathematics philosophy and
cognitive science his political writings
imbued with an unrelenting moral force
and documented exhaustively and with the
precision of the most rigorous
scholarship has had an equally
revolutionary impact he has written
dozens of books primarily focused on
u.s. foreign policy in regions
throughout the world from Vietnam
Cambodia and Laos to the countries of
Central and South America to Palestine
and Israel East Timor and Indonesia to
Afghanistan and Iraq and beyond his most
recent books include failed States the
abuse of power and the assault on
democracy hegemony or survival America's
quest for global dominance
hopes and prospects and with co-author
Ilan Pappe Gaza in crisis reflections on
Israel's war against the Palestinians to

RG
and now we return to the question and
answer session from the presentation
no'um Chomsky spoke at the University of
Oregon campus in Eugene Oregon on april
twentieth two thousand eleven the first
member of the audience with a question
referred back to the speaker's reference
to the role of the public relations
industry in the politics of the United
States he asked if professor Chomsky saw
any irony in the fact that today on the
University of Oregon Eugene campus there
was an annual event in the journalism
school discussing ethics and journalism
and yet this very same journalism school
awards many degrees in journalism to
students majoring in public relations
this member of the audience asked if the
speaker saw any inconsistency in the
combining of journalism with public
relations well you know business ethics
is a little bit like the famous jokes
about military music that's I mean it's
something inconsistent about it not just
public relations but business is based
on principles not not you know laws of
nature again but in our system Adam
Smith was right business leaders must
pursue the vile Maxim of the Masters of
mankind all for myself and nothing for
anyone else there are qualifications for
example in the public pressures can
impose qualifications that's what the do
deal regulations were but if you
dismantle the external effects and you
just let the market reign of course with
the qualification that the taxpayer will
bail you out when it crashes we'll put
that aside if you let that happen then
you can't isn't the question of ethics
doesn't arise I mean you simply have to
follow those rules if if the CEO of some
corporation decides
let's say to plan for the future to put
a supposed let's let's imagine that we
have say three car companies as a GM
Ford that will eliminate the foreign
ones for simplicity suppose the CEO of
one of them decides to plan for better
to put resources into planning for
better cars in the future okay his
competitors won't they'll put them into
selling cars today which means that
he'll be out of business so he has to
act for the short-term gain now that's
been sharply escalated in the modern
phase of state capitalism when you don't
care about the future at all you only
care about the bottom line in the next
quarter then you just have to do these
things so ethical issues just normalize
I'm there are some like you know don't
cheat too openly or something like that
but if you just live by the rules I mean
it's just out of the world of out of the
domain of ethical ethical adjustment
that actually ever been found I was once
asked to give a talk to journalism
Association Midwest Association of
journalists they wanted me to talk on
ethics and journalism I told him you
don't want me to talk about this I told
him look what I'm going to say is
there's only one problem tell the truth
about important things but that's not
what they want then believe me so they
invited me anyway and I told him that
and they were pretty upset because what
they wanted to hear was a discussion
about the big problems like you know
suppose a journalist comes in somebody's
office and sees a letter on the table
and happens to be able to read what it
says is the journal is allowed to cite
it that's a big ethical problem telling
the truth about what's important you
know that's not our business so that's
not an ethical problem and that's pretty
much the same so I don't know what goes
on in the school here but that's the
basic problem I think and the same is
true of public relations
its goal is to manipulate and control
and it's very straight and open about
that you just take a look at the major
PR manuals the way back where did the
public relations industry come from it's
kind of interesting look at its origins
it developed to the freest countries in
the world in England and the United
States roughly a century ago and it
developed for a very simple reason
enough rights had been won by popular
activism so it was getting harder to
control people by force and that was
understood which Conservative Party
understood it the progressives here
understood it you can't control people
by force anymore you have to control
them so you have to turn to some other
means and the other means were called
the engineering consent that's the
slogan of the Guru of the modern public
relations industry Edward Bernays who's
incidentally a not a right winger he was
a Wilson Roosevelt Kennedy liberal you
know highly admired by Cambridge liberal
elite you have to engineer consent out
of just out of the goodness of your
heart because it's a fact necessary fact
that only a small sector of the
population what he called the
intelligent minority everyone who writes
these things is included in that so the
intelligent minority are the only people
who know what's good for the country
it's Madison you know the educated
minority we're the Roman the noble Roman
senators we know it's good for the
country the ravel out there don't
understand if we let them have a voice
everything all go wrong you know this
was the position of the progressives
walter Lippmann the leading public
intellectual of the last century again a
Wilson Roosevelt Kennedy liberal the he
called it manufacture of consent the
same time they said the the responsible
men like him have to control policy
because they
have to make sure that the ignorant and
meddlesome outsiders that don't trouble
them as he put it we have to be free we
responsible men have to be free of the
trampling and the roar of the bewildered
heard that's all you folks out there and
how do we do this well we used to be
able to control them by force and can't
do that anymore have to control their
attitudes and beliefs and for their own
good you know it's always for their own
good because we understand how things
are done you know fact of the matter is
they're just the tools of the Masters of
mankind but that they can't perceive or
admit but so we have to do it for their
own good and out of that comes the
public relations industry how can you
raise questions of ethics you know it as
begins with it's based on premises so
outlandish they just can't talk about it
it's like asking how could the Kremlin
be more ethical under Stalin when I
suppose maybe they shouldn't steal from
each other or something but that's not
the question all right professor Chomsky
thank you so much for coming to Eugene
we're really really proud to have you
here my question has to do with the the
structural crisis of capital and the
role of agencies to clarify that when
we're organizing our society around the
principles of capitalism canvas types of
structural inequalities that you point
out in your talk be reformed away or are
there in eight contradictions internal
to capitalism that perpetuate these
inequalities such as the drive for
unlimited accumulation if this is the
case what should we be doing to fight
against this for a society that is based
on human need and not on free market
greed and if you could put that in the
context of Wisconsin the Arab world I
would be fantastic well the first thing
we should do is recognize reality we
don't live under capitalism we do not
have free markets and maybe they'd be a
good it kind of reminds me of famous
quote attributed to Gandhi right
wrongly he's supposed to have been asked
once at what he thought about Western
civilization and he was supposed to a
city maybe it would be a good idea but
that's the same with free markets we
don't have them the business of powerful
would never permit them I mean I've
given a bunch of examples but there are
many more actually here's an interesting
case at that time I was talked about but
i'll mention it since you bring it up
right now there's a very interesting
enter interaction between two countries
that are quite different in development
the United States and Egypt in Egypt
there are and that's the answer to your
question about what we should do what
they're doing in Tahrir Square and Egypt
there's a major popular struggle going
on to try to gain right that everyone
should have and are blocked by the
us-backed dictatorships at the very same
moment fortuitously there were major
demonstrations in Madison Wisconsin to
try to protect rights that were won over
a long struggle that are being lost and
taken away so the trajectories are
intersecting but doing in opposite
directions Egypt towards democracy
you're against democracy well it happens
not to be the first time the the victors
like to throw history into the trash can
okay the victims remember and we should
follow their example this is not the
first time that Egypt and the United
States were in similar situations in
going in opposite directions and the
first time has a lot to say about your
question the first time was in the early
19th century both Egypt and the United
States were sort of poised on the edge
of an industrial revolution and they
were in pretty comparable situations
both had rich agriculture both had a lot
of cotton which was you know the oil of
the early Industrial Revolution
as a difference the United States in
order to get cotton had to exterminate
the indigenous population and bring in
slaves that you didn't have to do that
but other than that they both had it
they had developmental state you know
plans to industrialize there was one
difference and it's the difference that
makes the distinction between what we
call the first in the third world and
affects us internally to the United
States had gained its independent Egypt
patent the United States was there for
free to totally ignore the laws of sound
economics like free markets they were
handed down by Adam Smith he greatest
economist of the day he instructed the
colonies that they should keep to what
was later called their comparative
advantage the comparative advantage of
the colonies here was produce you know
primary goods fish for so on don't try
to produce industrial goods because
England does it much better so import
advanced manufacturers from England you
keep to producing you know fish and fur
and so on and crucially don't try to
monopolize your resources the main one
was cotton that's like oil today so
don't try to monopolize cotton and he
said if you don't do that you know the
laws of exiled economics show that it
will be harmful to everyone essentially
neo liberal principles that's what's
rammed down the throat of poor countries
today well the United States is ones
independence so was therefore able to
totally disregard the laws of economics
and to do exactly what England had done
England developed also by disregarding
what the United States did was impose
very high tariffs to block superior
British manufacturers and first in
textiles later and steel take other
measures to state intervention to create
an industrial economy it did try to
monopolize cotton came pretty close to
it
Texas this is related to the immigration
crisis today the Texas and Mexico Texas
half of Mexico along with Texas was
conquered in order primarily to gain a
monopoly over cotton the idea was as the
Jacksonian presidents put it to bring
other nations to our feet especially
Britain Britain was the main enemy at
the time because you know the military
power deterrent so we can bring Britain
to our feet by monopolizing cotton and
notice what the United States came close
to doing was what Saddam Hussein was
accused of doing ridiculously in 1990
the tail then was he was trying to
monopolize oil you know bring us to his
feet the total fantasy but wasn't
fantasy when we did it we did it you
know we monopolize pregaming pretty
close to monopolize of cotton
industrialized by violating all the
rules and became a rich country but what
about Egypt Egypt was not independent
was under the control of Britain and the
British said they are never going to
permit it Lord Palmerston said expressed
his hate for the ignorant barbarian
Muhammad Ali is trying to invest
realisee gypped and Britain and deployed
its military force and its financial
wealth to prevent Egypt from developing
it's kind of a microcosm of what's
happened all over the world since the
18th century it still is the u.s. took
over from Britain after the Second World
War we became the dominant power and
followed exactly the same policy Egypt
was instructed that it's not going to
get any aid unless it drops all barriers
to us import highly subsidized us import
at the same time the u.s. set up high
tariffs to bar Egyptian cotton that's
what drove Egypt further into disaster
and that's the way market principles
work fine for you but not for me I need
the nanny state so we should stop
talking about free
Martin's maybe they would be a good idea
maybe they wouldn't maybe capitalism
would be a good idea maybe it wouldn't
put its fantasy and the rich and
powerful would never allow it well what
should we do we should ask what goals
were trying to achieve um do we want to
achieve a society in which people his
needs are satisfied that do we want to
achieve the kind of society that working
people in the 19th century we're calling
for whereas they put those who work in
the mills should own them but nobody
should be a slave of anyone else or
rented to anyone else that we want to
have a democratic system which is under
popular controlled we want to make sure
that if people in need get the care they
need well if we want to do it we know
how to do it in fact there's been a lot
of progress in that respect over the
years and it's being done right now in
front of our eyes in the Arab world and
we do it we have every capacity to do it
it's not a big secret mr. Chomsky thank
you for your knowledge tonight um some
believe that the largest issues with
developing or third world countries are
attributed to a stark disconnect between
public policy of those governments and
the needs of the public as our country's
public policy continues to stray farther
from the public need how do you suggest
we strengthen the voice of our public
need and if we are not heard what do you
predict will happen on an international
scope so how do we change the systems of
the public policy reflects public needs
you know how to do it I mean it you know
there's a lot of problems in the United
States a very free society we're not
faced with the kind of violent
repression that Egyptians are when they
demonstrate in Tahrir Square in fact
we've reached the point where the state
has very limited powers to coerce
fortunately that's why they have to turn
the things like manipulation and deceit
and so on so okay we can overcome that
we can figure out what's going on in the
world not too hard it's not quantum
physics we can it work with others to
educate them we can organize politically
in other ways we can carry out
activities ranging from civil
disobedience to electoral politics to
you know educational activities at the
organization and that's the way you
improve the world and it works that's
why we're a much for your society and
more civilized society than we've been
in the past and there there aren't any
magic keys you know it's a matter of
getting down to work and doing it's
being it's been done by our forebears
that's why we have the legacy we do they
struggled for it we can give it away if
we want but we don't have to and it's
being done by people elsewhere we see it
right in front of our eyes like in the
Arab world today many other places so
that isn't there's no magic keys it's
just hard work that's the kind of work
we do easily no not like in the past dr.
Chomsky it's always an honor to have you
here always an honor to wait and hear
your voice you may remember thee
Muhammad I interviewed you exactly five
years ago could you step back a little
from the mic nothing of easier here oh I
interviewed you five years ago always an
honor there are three recent factors
that's leading many people to predict an
economic collapse this summer when the
next reports by corporations come out
one is the debt ceiling we're reaching
the debt ceiling again but this time
waiting it would mean America can't even
afford to pay the interest on the debt
number two last week the World Bank
rated the American economy as unstable
for the first time in the history of the
dollar and is already publishing
articles about starting a new world
currency and the last factor i want to
mention today is
in today's global economy where Japan is
a third yeah okay so 20 seconds what is
what is the question the question is do
you think the global economic collapse
may happen before the next election and
what would be the repercussions on
America and maybe how to prevent it
Thanks yeah nobody knows I mean there's
going to be another fiscal crisis that's
almost certain that's why paurav ski and
others pointed out what they did the
exact timing we don't know there could
be a crisis soon it could be delayed
there are a lot of ways of patching up
the system to stretch it out but it's
not worth speculating about frankly well
which is been doing doing something
about it and that can be done like we
don't have to accept the situation in
which Goldman Sachs is giving massive I
just picked them because there must be
just the most important that everyone
else is saying giving them themselves
huge compensations and for having tanked
the economy and at the same time watch
Congress cut back everything that's
needed for the population to survive we
don't have to agree to that we can
refuse in that case the economy can turn
to stability I'm i already mentioned
what we can do to deal with the deficit
it's very straightforward anybody really
first of all is again it's question
serious question which you should ask
yourself whether that's a priority I'm
there plenty of very good economist like
say stiglitz new Gloria to think and I
think they're right that's not a
priority now you can grow yourself out
of a deficit the important thing is a
huge joblessness I mean joblessness
today is is at the level of the Great
Depression for most people really you
count in the number of people who've
fallen out of the workforce because
they've given up it's like the Great
Depression that's pretty serious first
of all it's a terrible human tragedy for
the people but even from a strictly
economic
view it means productive resources are
not being used okay human beings are
productive resources and there's plenty
of capital around there and they're not
being used so I think it's the priority
shouldn't be the deficit but if we want
to pay attention to the deficit we know
exactly how to deal with it one thing to
do is to cut back the bloated military

institute a health system of a kind that
is not utopian it's the kind they have

other issues this will we don't have to
it's just pointless to sit around and
speculate about when the next collapse
is going to be and it's this stage is
being set for it what's important is to
do something about it we can thank you
