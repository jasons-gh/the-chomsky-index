welcome to the first speakers forum
event of the year my name is Todd
Burnham I'm the president of the
speakers for this year and first for
some details on can everyone hear me
like this is this good yeah okay
it's in terms of it more in terms of the
structure of the evening
first he professor Chomsky is going to
speak to us and then we're going to have
a question-and-answer session depending
upon how the evening goes that's going
to be up to him he'll choose the point
for that and in terms of doing that if
people would just go up around the back
and over we only have one microphone for
that so over here on your right if you
go down to their lineup for questions
and the speech will get over
approximately around 9:30 and then we'll
have a reception in Tilton Hall so and
this will all be freestyle in terms of
the timing we'll see what happens but
again I like to welcome everybody here
I'm really really excited about this
evening speakers forum for those who you
don't know as a group here on campus
that's run by students and basically our
agenda is to bring speakers to campus
that cover topics that are of concern to
students and the society at large and we
try and get people that have that are
inspirational and informative on some
important topics and professor Chomsky
is definitely that I think it's really
important because this is everyone here
for the students I can speak as I think
is on a path of discovering a little bit
more and more about their studies in a
more detailed manner
I think that this journey is something
that Professor Chomsky has done with a
great rigor in his life and I think that
that's very commendable so I'm very glad
to have him here professor Chomsky is
the professor of linguists at
linguistics at MIT he's an
internationally recognized social critic
we've studied relations of language in
politics and has done quite a bit in
that field concerning linguistic
he's done quite a bit to reveal the in
justices concerning national power and
and arbitrary government policies and
those of you know of him have read about
his revealing of certain documents and
information concerning the policies of
our government some of his books are
manufactured consent the political
economy of mass media deterring
democracy and World Order's old and new
I think that will suffice I think maybe
we just saw welcome for mr. Noam Chomsky
[Applause]
what's happening here just want to get
this out of the way can I get it over
there yeah guys we really won the world
of these technicians whoo oh it's always
heavy in line well there's a
conventional doctrine about the new era
that we're entering on the promise that
it holds it's so conventional that it's
pretty much of a waste of time to give
you representative quotes it was
announced again day or two ago by the
National Security Advisor Anthony Lake
and a long article in The New York Times
in which he talked about the current
task which is to in his words
consolidate the victory of democracy and
FreeMarkets this is in the Articles an
elaboration of the so-called Clinton
doctrine which he had himself put forth
he's the intellectual and the
administration he's from around here
incidentally which I guess is why so
smart the the Clinton doctrine which as
he explained it was to move beyond
containment to enlargement that's the
basic theme up until now we've been
containing threats to the values that we
uphold freedom democracy human rights
international law free markets and so on
and now that we've won that battle we
can go on to enlarge the domain in which
we can realize their ideals and this is
accepted as virtually a truism by
commentators so for example the chief
diplomat a correspondent of The New York
Times Thomas Friedman describes here
he's not advocating but just describing
as a matter of fact that America's
victory in the Cold War was a victory
for a set of political and economic
principles democracy in the free market
at last he says the world is coming to
understand that the free market is the
wave of the future a future for which
America is both the gatekeeper and the
model and there's kind of another part
of the refrain sort of counterpoint to
these themes which is that the world is
lucky to have such an angelic power to
minister to its needs and wants
and that we're constantly informed for
example recently in a book by Henry
Kissinger much praised book on diplomacy
in which he explains that the United
States is unique in history and it's
altruism and the nobility of its guiding
ideals which he considers a flaw it's
not good to do that the this per se that
we're leading all the time for democracy
and FreeMarkets and international law
and human rights is harmful for us and
in general we're overdoing our mission
of mercy he and many others believe
another one who agrees with him as the
well-known elder statesman George Kennan
who's one of the founders of the current
world order from one of the design
architects of it Ephraim right after the
Second World War and he argues recently
that it's by example not interference
that a country such as ours can most
benevolently influence world affairs if
we can leave the grubby ER things to
other people who don't share our noble
ideals and the best thing we can do for
other people is to be a good model for
them you possible that that's the
principle that underlies the fact that
we have one of the most miserly aid
programs in the underdeveloped world in
the developed world among the industrial
countries and that would after all
follow if the best way to help other
people is to look after our own welfare
then it would be harmful to them to give
them aid the way other countries do and
so that at least makes sense the
sometimes these ideas are elevated from
near-universal doctrine to pure logic
for that you have to go to really
sophisticated places like Harvard where
they have a professorship called the
professorship of the science of
government and the science of government
is now the professorship is now held by
a distinguished scholar Samuel
Huntington and he tells us that the
science of government teaches us that
the United States is unique among
nations because it is defined by its
commitment to democracy markets human
rights and so on and since that's a
matter of definition facts are plainly
irrelevant so it would be a pretty
stupid person who would do experiments
to try to demonstrate that two and two
is four that's a matter of definition
and so is our commitment so it's really
quite unnecessary look at facts that
makes life much easier incidentally I
don't want to suggest that although
these views are close to universal I
mean you really have to go way after the
margins to find somebody raising some
skepticism about them there are people I
don't want to it would be misleading to
say that nobody looks at facts in fact
people do and sometimes they even do so
fairly honestly even telling the truth
so take the matter of democracy some of
the best mainstream work on this highly
regarded and properly regarded worked on
and particular on our democracy crusade
of the last decade of the 1980s is by a
senior associate of the Carnegie
Foundation named Thomas Carruthers who's
written a book and number of articles on
us contributions to democracy the Reagan
crusade for democracy and he writes he
has advantage of writing both as from
from a scholarly point of view and as an
insider he was in the Reagan in the
legal department of the Reagan State
Department working on democracy
enhancement programs in Central America
so he sees it from the inside as well as
just looking at the results and he
points out he says that the policies
were very sincere but they were a
failure
in fact they were a remarkably system
maduk failure although he doesn't really
comment on that he gives the evidence
but doesn't draw the conclusions the
failure is systematic in the sense that
US influence is negatively correlated
with advances in democracy that is where
US influence was least there were some
advances particularly in the southern
cone of Latin America there were actual
steps forward that's where US influences
least and in fact as he points out
accurately the Reaganites were very
hostile to these developments and tried
to block them but they then of course
took credit for them after they turned
out to be irreversible on the other hand
where US influence was greater like in
Central America and the Caribbean the
results were pretty awful and the reason
he says is that the United States I'm
quoting him now sought only limited
top-down forms of democracy that did not
risk upsetting the traditional
structures of power with which the
United States has been a lie it
maintained the basic order of quite
undemocratic societies avoiding and
blocking populist based change that
might upset established economic and
political order and open a leftist
direction and for that reason the
policies the sincere policies of
advancing democracy were a failure he
doesn't go into saying how they avoided
popular space change but that you're
supposed to know it was with
extraordinary violence and terror and
lawlessness even to the extent of
contemptuously disregarding judgments of
the World Court calling on the United
States to terminate its terror
operations vetoing resolutions in the
Security Council calling on all states
to observe international law blocking
some General Assembly resolutions and so
on so it was through a combination of
extreme lawlessness unparalleled terror
and sadistic violence that the United
States succeeded in blocking any
political change in keeping highly on
them quite non democratic societies and
power and that's the area where we had
some influence down below and Southern
Cone where the influence was less we
weren't able to do that and there was
some democratic change so the policy was
a failure pretty much in the sense that
the Russians failed to achieve freedom
in Eastern Europe kind of curious fed
well with Carruthers and a few others
like and we move from the domain of
rhetoric and ideology towards the world
of reality and in the real world what we
find this pretty much what he describes
it's much broader in the real world
human rights and democracy and
FreeMarkets
are under a very serious attack in much
of the world and that includes leading
industrial democracies to be more
specific effective power that is the
power to really make decisions that
determine what goes on in the world is
concentrating more and more in almost
completely unaccountable absolutist
institutions and the rich and the
powerful who is institutions they are
they're no more willing to accept market
discipline or popular control than
they've ever been in the past in fact
there are now able to resist it these
dangerous tendencies much better than in
the past well these are pretty large
topics and the other ones I want to talk
about so I'll say a few words about them
in in order with touching on several
topics the easiest one to begin with so
let me start on that one it's human
rights because there at least we don't
have to debate much about what it means
there is a universally accepted standard
its codified in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights voted
unanimously by the United Nations in
December 1948 and it actually has the
force of law and US Court there also
related conventions so you can debate
this
that but there is at least a solid
standard that everyone fervently adheres
to and indeed there is a great deal of
impressive rhetoric about how we stand
for the principle of universality of the
Universal Declaration and we defend that
principle against backward third world
people who plead what they call cultural
relativism they say some aspects of it
don't apply to them but we're not going
to take any of that nonsense all of this
reached a crescendo about a year ago at
a conference in Vienna where the United
States was very highly praised by its
own press and its own intellectuals for
leading the defense of the universality
of the Universal Declaration and beating
back the challenges from the south I
stress it was highly praised by its own
press and its own intellectuals
there were also some other voices there
was a counter conference at Vienna
representing the overwhelming majority
of the people of the world organized by
NGOs you know non-governmental
organizations human rights groups
various social groups and they had a big
conference with all sorts of people
there as a counter conference and it was
published in a publication by the
women's our National League for peace
and freedoms geneva-based and since
we're fortunate to live in a free
country we don't have to only read what
a hundred percent of the press and
commentary was saying we can also read
the report of that counter conference
which was published in an edition of 200
copies in Nepal so that's the advantages
of freedom you know you really get
everything available so what's called
the free market of ideas well the and a
pretty typical example of it I should
say the rhetoric about our you know
magnificent stand is very rarely sullied
with any reference to what the Universal
Declaration actually says and you know
in the light of the
great oh and self a claim that elicits
this preps worth taking a look at its
actual content and it's not
uninteresting there a lot of interesting
things to say about it just keep - a few
one core section of the Universal
Declaration has to do with what are
sometimes called anti torture rights
that is the right to be free of torture
mutilation Massacre and so on on the
part of the state authorities that's
like one element of human rights and on
this the u.s. record is very consistent
it is strongly in favor of torture
sadism violence and terror that's
overwhelming in fact there are several
academic studies pointing it out the
leading the place to look of course is
again the place where we have most
influence which is Latin America
although it's not different elsewhere
they're the leading there's a leading
academic specialist on you on human
rights in Latin America a large Schultz
the University of North Carolina did a
study about this around 15 years ago
right at the end of the Carter
Administration and he just ran through
the US record what he did actually was
Carly US aid with torture
and the correlation was very close you
know kind of close correlation you
really get in social sciences he pointed
out in summarizing that US aid tends to
flow to countries that torture their
citizens for the hemispheres most
egregious and violators of fundamental
human rights and that includes military
aid runs right through the Carter years
and the aid is uncorrelated with need
although it is correlated with the
climate for business investment that is
the better the climate for investment
the better the more the aid goes as was
pointed out in another study this one
global not just Latin America by Edward
Herrmann a colleague of mine actually
who's a economist at the University of
Pennsylvania and there's a reason of
course
I mean aid tends to go to places that
yield profit that's what aid is it's a
technique by which the public subsidizes
American investors it's called aid so
naturally
places where they can make more money
where the investment climate improves
and it turns out that it is in the third
world very commonly the way to improve
the investment climate is to murder
union organizers and torture priests and
you know smash up peasants who are
trying to form unions and so on and so
forth
and so you get a secondary correlation
between US aid and torture it's not the
State Department loves torture they
basically don't care one way or another
but you get the second course secondary
correlation from what they do do so with
regard to this central element of the
Universal Declaration the u.s. record is
grotesque now as I say these studies
were mostly at the end of the Carter
years nobody's bothered to undertake
them during the Reagan years because I
like more interesting things to do to
violent this correlation goes through
the roof in the Reagan years and the
thing
well--that's anti-torture rights let me
look at some of the more general
provisions which have to do with the
world order and where there's a lot to
say about specific provisions but not
too much time so I'll turn to the
general purpose may we come back to it
if you like but I'll turn to the general
provisions so take say article 25 which
reads as follows
everyone has the right to a standard of
living adequate for the health and
well-being of himself and his family
including food clothing housing and
medical care and necessary social
services and the right to security in
the event of unemployment sickness
disability widowhood old age and other
lack of livelihood well I mean a side
comment notice this is 1948 hence the
sexist language if it was written today
you'd say a little differently but you
know you get the idea well it's
unnecessary to comment on how that
principle is upheld in the richest
country in the world with absolutely
unparalleled advantages and a country in
which tens of millions of people
literally starve millions of children
are suffering
third world conditions of malnutrition
and disease in New York City richest
city in the world 40% of children are
living below the poverty line that means
deprived of minimal conditions that
offer some hope of escape from misery
and destitution and violence and in fact
the United States is in the leading
ranks of opposition to the universal
declaration for the reason of this
article alone simply to compare it with
other industrial countries the u.s.
poverty level is twice that of twice as
high as England England is in second
place in the race to see who can torture
their own citizens more we're
considerably ahead of them and improved
a lot on this a lot of progress during
the last 10 or 15 years
so that's article 25 turn 8 let's turn
to article 23
everyone has the right to work - Justin
favourable conditions of work and
protection against unemployment with
remuneration ensuring for himself and
his family an existence worthy of human
dignity supplemented if necessary by
other means of social protection well I
won't waste any time on that one
furthermore everyone has the right to
form and join trade unions for
protection of these interests well let's
at least talk about the last one that
one at least we have a formal commitment
to the other part of it we don't even
have a formal commitment to talking
about it so let's talk about the last
one you know you have right to form
trade unions technically that's true
again reality is a bit different in
reality there's a very complex structure
of laws and administrative arrangements
and government practices and so on that
undermines that right which is
guaranteed by the universal declaration
in fact in 1992 rather rare I think
unprecedented event
the ILO the International Labor
Organization in Geneva which very rarely
has a harsh word for its paymaster's
censured the United States for its labor
practices called upon the United States
to conform to international standards
which at that point were violated only
among the industrial countries only by
the United States and South Africa and
with the recent changes in South Africa
I assume we've moved off to splendid
isolation on that one
illegal firings for union organizing
have increased by a factor of six in the
past 25 years mostly in recent years
there's actually kind of interesting
article about this in Businessweek their
cover story last May I'm quite accurate
story
BusinessWeek reports that there are
during the Reagan years there were
thousands of people illegally fired for
attempting to organize and they have no
recourse because it's a criminal state
it's a state committed the criminal
activities and therefore the state won't
prosecute they told the employers you
want to carry out illegal activities
that's fine we approve of it and this
was part of the general advocacy of
domestic crimes counterpart to the
advocacy of international crime and it's
more generally part of the big
enterprise of creating a very powerful
and in fact quite massive expansive
welfare state for the rich grossly
violating US law as well as customary
international law as enshrined in the
Universal Declaration that we so worship
as I mentioned that's part of a much
broader pattern of lawlessness
well this destruction of unions is a
criminal activity as Businessweek
correctly points out and it is very
successful and the reason is it's
supported by a criminal state in the and
here I'm using the term criminal and
they're very narrow
so I mean it metaphorically I mean in a
sense of violating its own laws no and
it shows that country to what you're
taught and sunday-school crime does pay
in particular it pays a lot when the
when the state and private power the two
centers of the power are dedicated to
crime in that case it pays very well and
this is a case in point and this success
of the success of these state criminal
like state corporate criminal activities
has many effects and you read one of
them in this morning's headlines the
elimination of health care programs is
directly traceable to the lack of
democracy in the country that is to the
fact that there is no way for citizens
groups to organize to put forward any
program country most in most countries
healthcare program where you off to the
scale off the spectrum on this is you
know and it's related to the fact that
we don't have unions we don't have
organized working forces the that's a
little misleading to say that health
care reform is off the agenda actually
what happened ends up being worse than
it was before because before all the
talk about welfare and stuff there was a
health care reform there were at least
tax rebates for people who paid health
insurance that's all still there for
employers but not for people so we have
an improvement well that's one of the
effects of the destruction of unions and
in general one of the main effects is
the attack is that increases the very
successful attack on democracy unions
are one of the few means by which
ordinary people can can sort of enter
the political arena and there's a good
deal of history incidentally when they
try if there's some time I'll talk about
it the destruction of unions had a lot
of other effects as the Labor Department
has pointed out and other researchers I
the destruction of unions has been a
major factor in maybe the main factor in
lowering wages now wages are stagnated
since the night real wages since the
1960's but they declined pretty sharply
under the Reaganites and in fact by 1987
they were even starting to decline for
college-educated people which is quite
unusual in fact again unprecedented
apart from you know like Wars and things
like that
the another effect of the useful effect
of the destruction of unions is that it
undermines the general benefits that are
guaranteed by the Universal Declaration
so like health and safety standards in
the workplace for instance they're still
there but they're just not enforced and
they're not enforced because there's no
unions around or other pressures that
all force the decision-making forces the
corporate interests in the state to
enforce them and in fact industrial
accidents have risen very sharply over
the last 10 or 15 years as again
Businessweek points out and apart from
things of that kind there's an important
and hard to measure psychological effect
the effect one effect of the destruction
of unions is to add to the pressure to
privatize aspirations to make everything
for yourself you know it eliminates the
sense of solidarity and sympathy and the
sense that you're supposed to care for
each other and so on and not just
yourselves and that's very important
this is a process that's been going on
for a long time if you go back to about
150 years ago in the early stages of the
Industrial Revolution and that's now
right around here you know Lowell and
Lawrence in those places there was a
very lively working-class press in those
days run by workers a lot of women
incidentally who were in the lead here
but is he you know before they well
before the Civil War and its press was
full of talk about this because this was
an early stages of the Industrial
Revolution you're really trying to
destroy human sentiments you know it's
important to do that and they protested
what they called the new spirit of the
age which is gain wealth for getting all
but self now in fact there was they were
reacting to a major campaign which was
intended to eliminate human sentiments
and the reason is that they're
inconsistent with private capitalism
which has to destroy human sentiments
and raise private profit to the supreme
human value meaning gain wealth for
getting all of itself and destruction of
unions is of course a part of that in
fact it's been a kind of an interesting
transition if you look at intellectual
history from the pre capitalist period
tool today if you look at a pre
capitalist thinker like say Adam Smith
who is very much quoted but never read
if you actually read him you discover
that even attested what's now called
capitalism and that he put a tremendous
stress on things like sympathy and
equality he advocated markets because he
argued that they would lead the perfect
equality if you really had free market
the right to creative work and so on
that's Adam Smith and a pre capitalist
period but we've progressed over the
years to a very different concept of
human nature which in fact is explained
by those who invoke Adam Smith's name
without shame apparently like a recent
Nobel prize-winner neoliberal Nobel
Prize winner in economics James Buchanan
who writes that I'm quoting but each
person seeks in the ideal situation is
mastery over a world of slaves in case
you hadn't noticed that's what you seek
according to prevailing ideology it's
something that somebody like Adam Smith
would have regarded is totally
pathological but that's just part of his
general hostility to capitalism and it
is the new spirit of the age which is
gained wealth for getting all but self
something that's driven into your head
every
time you turn on the television set and
you know sort of you know you're
battered with it from every you know
from early childhood until today well
it's wrong to leave the issue of human
rights without mention of the issue of
sanctions that's just very lively now so
let's say take tech say Indonesia
interesting case one of the worst human
rights violators in the world and as you
would expect one of the major recipients
of US aid and support it has a
horrendous human rights record not only
at home but even more and it's near
genocidal massacres that it's carrying
out an aggressive activities and there
are no sanctions so you know certainly
the US Britain and France are not going
to talk about sanctions on the contrary
they're participating with as much
enthusiasm as they can managed to muster
in these criminal atrocities on the
principle that what you ought to do is
gain wealth because you do gain wealth
from them the atrocities do in fact
contribute to wealth like the slaughter
of maybe a third of the people of Timor
has contributed to the ability to rob
its oil and the right people gain wealth
from that so obviously don't talk about
sanctions in fact that's ridiculous
since we're participating in the
atrocity however sometimes Indonesia
does something that does call for
sanctions and punishment an example
occurred about a year ago the World
Health Organization had despite strong
extreme protest from the US and its
allies the World Health Organization had
approached the World Court with a
request for an opinion on the legality
of the pizzette of the use of nuclear
weapons question are they legal under
international law that would of course
entail that it's not legal to have them
if it's illegal to use them which would
mean you might actually have an
non-proliferation treaty of a serious
kind well as you can imagine the rich
countries went berserk over this
and I've got worse just a year ago when
the non-aligned movement 110 countries
of the non-aligned movement again you
know representing the overwhelming
majority of the world's population they
proposed a resolution to the General
Assembly and the resolution requested
that the World Court give an opinion on
this issue on the issue brought up by
the World Health Organization well in
the face and Indonesia happen to be the
you know the each year that's one
country that's sort of speaks for the
non-aligned movement that year it
happened to be Indonesia well in the
face of that atrocity the guardians of
international morality quickly leaped
into action and the US Britain and
France threatened Indonesia with trade
sanctions and termination of aid unless
it was through this resolution as of
course it quickly did meanwhile its
continuing its terror and repression
with the enthusiastic support of the
very same powers and indeed
participation and it's accompanied by
the usual total silence on the part of
respectable opinion facts have yet to be
reported although again it is a free
society so if you happen to subscribe
say to the Catholic Church press in
Canada you can learn the facts and
there's a few other places where you can
learn I'm greetin's e-magazine you can
learn them but in effect it's the free
marketplace of ideas working again and
of course you do hear something namely
the usual accolades for our nobility and
their support for the universality of
human rights and so on alright well
that's not the only place we're hearing
about sanctions a lot now happens to be
closer to home namely on Haiti and
that's one that's worth looking at
carefully the regular drumbeat of
commentary is that we just had to
intervene because sanctions weren't
working
read that every day in the paper I wanna
bother citing quotes well that is not a
total lie only about 90 percent of a lot
after the coup and that overthrew the
democratic government in September 1990
1991 right after the coup the
Organization of American States declared
sanctions and the u.s. formally agreed
that however you have to stress the word
formally the u.s. also made it clear
that it was not that nobody should take
them seriously it made it clear in the
way that a great power can make it clear
and for example by not bothering to
close the Dominican border which takes
no effort you know held at the minikin
military to close the borders closed
that's the reason we invaded the country
30 years ago to ensure that we don't
have any disobedience and things like
that but that never happened so the
Megane border remains completely open
and porous somehow you know we just
can't figure out a way to close it but
that's a trivial part of it within a few
weeks after the sanctions were announced
President Bush formally announced an
exception to the sanctions namely US
owned factories in Haiti were allowed to
continue their operations and trade and
commerce
the New York Times explained did report
it they said that the Bush
administration was fine-tuning the
sanctions to go after the coup makers
because they felt it would be better for
the people of Haiti if there was at
least some trade somehow they only are
harmed let's say people starve if other
countries trade with but not if the US
doesn't help the and in fact if you look
at the year 1992 the next year you find
that US trade with Haiti well not at the
norm was not that far below it that was
never reported but of course it takes a
lot of work to find that out you have to
make a phone call to the Commerce
Department like
I did and you know after all there's a
limit on the amount of time that
reporters have so trade was
approximately at the you know a little
below normal level the first year of the
so-called sanctions
I then Clinton came in he was going to
change everything and he did at a trade
went up fifty percent the first year of
the Clinton administration so it's not a
total lie
actually there's been a dramatic example
of what all this meant just about a week
ago but it's still under wraps as far as
I can see the most in last week
everything was full of Haiti news you
know from Monday when the troops
actually from Sunday when Carter was
there on Sunday night around midnight
the AP wire started sending stories
interesting stories which have yet to
make the press far as I know the store
and that went through the rest of the
week the stories had to do with oil
shipments to Haiti well anybody who's
been paying attention knew that the oil
companies were continuing to supply oil
you know you just look at the price of
oil to see that you know and say
everybody knew it
but it was supposed to not be happening
because their sanctions well the stories
the AP stories starting this the most
important story of last week by far
starting right before the American
troops landed and then going through the
week these are leaks from a Justice
Department inquiry the Justice
Department inquiry was started about a
week ago this was at the period when the
Clinton administration was starting to
you know grind whip up a little
enthusiasm about intervening and the
press started discovering that they kill
orphans and all that kind of stuff and
part of it was an inquiry some
indication to the Justice Department
they all have a look at how come all
keeps getting in there and they looked
and they quickly found things and since
obviously nobody's going to do anything
about it somebody leaked it to the press
and it got at least as far as the AP
wires but that's where to stop the
stories are essentially this that the
Texaco company the other three
corporations Exxon Shell and Texas
she'll and exxon could get around it by
claiming that their subsidy that they
had subsidiaries in other countries and
those subsidiaries we're sending the oil
and naturally we can't do anything about
that you know so what we're left with is
Texaco Texaco doesn't haven't have any
subsidiaries so within a couple of
months after the sanctions were
announced they got an official cease and
desist order from the executive branch
from the Bush administration telling him
to stop these this criminal violation of
the law
however they were also told on the side
to forget it and that went up as high as
Secretary of Treasury Brady the
Secretary Treasurer in the bushes
Department who said look is not going to
prosecution at that point
Texaco informed the Justice Department
that they were going to set up a blind
trust and it's the blind trust that
would be shipping the oil the Justice
Department informed them that that was
illegal but that nothing would be done
about it
and that's where the issue was left til
the Clinton guys came in and they
further decided to do nothing about it
and in fact the first time anybody even
thought of doing anything about it
apparently was about like ten days ago
or something
that's the sanctions that's oil central
part of the sanctions so the big story
of last week you know big headlines if
there was a free paper in the country
would have been us never imposed
sanctions the government criminally
determined that it would not abide by
its own law to block the shipments of
oil to Haiti not that it's a big
surprise but since it's never been
reported it might might have been useful
to report and I assume it'll get in the
press sooner or later for one thing a
number of congressmen have been very
upset about it
and are calling Gonzalez and Texas
particularly who's quite good has been
threatening an inquiry and sooner or
later it'll break through like you know
like ten years from now or something
somebody will know about so that's
sanctions on Haiti there were there were
of course some kinds of sanctions but
they were target against the poor and
the reasons were very clear for
everybody except the
classes in the united states and
everybody in haiti certainly understood
it the u.s. simply does not want the
democratic system restored what it wants
is what it in to get back to the
situation before the election of
december 1990 which was unexpected
nobody has been paying any attention to
what was going on in the poor areas of
Haiti's like you know peasant areas or
the slums and so on and therefore was
assumed that the US would get its kind
of democracy
you know top-down democracy which
doesn't change the structures of power
and then all of a sudden that turned out
that Haiti actually had a civil society
they had a democratic tradition of a
kind that we don't have so if we want to
learn some lessons and democracy we
could go there say but they actually had
it and they swept the candidate in the
office and ever since then the only
question is how is the u.s. going to get
rid of them well we're now back to the
situation prior to the election going to
the details later if you want but
essentially the situation is now back to
prior to the election we've mentioned
reverses with the big advantage that now
even the popular movements are destroyed
so we don't have to worry about that
kind of problem again next time there's
an election we'll run it properly and
it'll come out like the election last
week in Guatemala which was won by Rios
Montt one of the really major killers of
the 1980s very strongly supported by the
Reagan administration who described them
as a stellar Democrat and so on and a
guy who easily could have been a member
of the Nazi General Staff he'd have had
no problems and he won with about six
percent of the electorate 19 percent
voting the right people you know the
white rich people voted and it's a free
election and everybody's happy we
brought democracy to Guatemala and we'll
set it up so that there's an election
like that in Haiti before too long
there's a lot of things going on but I
won't proceed well there's a lot more to
say about this but I want to talk about
something else so go to if you want but
there's a lot more to comment about
sanctions the Cuba China story
was very interesting one however let's
put that aside time being brief well
let's turn to back to article 23 still
on the human rights declaration everyone
has a right to work under just in
favorable conditions the ILO the
International Labor Organization in
Geneva had a big report that came out
last January in which they concluded
that about 1/3 little under a third of
the world's population is unemployed too
technical notion which means not enough
for minimal subsistence and they
describe it as a crisis like the 1930s
except now it's global and in fact much
worse than the 1930s if you look that's
one crucial part of an enormous human
rights catastrophe over the world
there's according to UNESCO about a half
a million children die every year from
just debt repayment just that one thing
debt repayment
what's debt repayment debt repayment
means that the banks the commercial
banks which happen to be flooded with
money for various reasons in the 70s
lent money to their favored dictators in
the third world and now the poor Pete
these are bad debts and since we don't
believe in capitalism the debts are
socialized so it's the taxpayer in the
United States in one or another form who
pays them off and the poor people in the
third-world country so it absolutely
nothing to do with it you know this is
our dictators borrowing from our banks
but the poor people in the poor
countries and all of us have to pay
these costs because as I say nobody
believes in the free market if you make
a bad debt it's the public's
responsibility that's the system of
socialism for the rich that we live
under and of course for the people who
really suffer or not you and me just
adds direct taxes a little but the
people whose children are dying every
year at the rate of half a million a
year they're from that one thing alone
they're about 11 million children dying
every year according the World Health
Organization from easily treatable
diseases things like diarrhea
five cents to treat it a little salt
water or something that's what the
director of the whu-oh calls silent
genocide and in fact we wouldn't
hesitate to use such a term for the
death of eleven million children every
year if somebody else were responsible
for it then it would be genocide but
since we're responsible for it we don't
talk about it or hear about it this has
now spread to Eastern Europe since 1989
the Eastern European economies as you
know have been in free fall they're now
back to where they were about 70 or 80
years ago and UNESCO recently did a
report on the effect of the reforms as
they're called reform notice is a very
loaded word reforms are good things if
you're opposed to reforms you're bad you
know so if someone thinks like there was
some other way to get out of Soviet
tyranny then you're bad you're a
reactionary and opposed to reform so
we're not talking about reforms
you know this neutral thing reforms have
had their effects UNESCO estimates that
in Russia their effects are about a half
a million extra deaths every year and
similar proportions elsewhere in the
region well that's part of the attempt
to return Eastern Europe back to its
third-world origins from which it tried
to escape early in the century and it's
now driven back cold war was won so it's
now gonna look like you know Central
Africa and Brazil and other places that
are properly run in the United States
they're the same effects peril is a rich
country so it's not half a million
deaths a year there is in fact even a
recovery going on rather sluggish about
1/2 the normal rate of post-war
recoveries that occurred the job growth
of normal recoveries a lot of those jobs
are very high number of more temporaries
that's incidentally considered a good
thing it improves its increases the
flexibility of the labour market it's
full and that's a good thing too
flexibility of the labour market means
you don't know when you go to
at night whether you gonna have a job
tomorrow morning and as any economist
can explain to you that's good that's
increases that's good for the health of
the economy health of the economy is a
technical notion which is define a very
specific way in the ideological
fanaticism that's called economics
health of the economy is defined in such
a way that the economy can be extremely
healthy while just about everybody
starving to death
those two things are uncorrelated so
like health of the economy has to do
with things like GDP per capita but it
doesn't have to do with things like say
the Gini coefficient the measure of
inequality and these are not there's
nothing scientific about this these are
just instruments of class war these
these particular definitions of health
but if you look at the notion of health
we better learn these things like you
want to get ahead in the world you have
to understand the difference between
health of the economy and health of the
population as I say they can be
completely uncorrelated they often are
in fact anyhow flexibility the labor
market improves the health of the
economy is can easily be explained
another thing that's happening is an
increased workload
well again you listen through this
evenings news as I did while I was
driving in here and there's a big GM
strike going on because the workers are
simply being squeezed to death in their
increasing work loads in fact work work
working hours have now increased to the
highest level since the depression and
keep going up they've reached their peak
well that's good too it also increases
the health of the economy may not be
very good for people but as I say that's
a different that's a different measure
the all of this is part of a much
broader development it's what The Wall
Street Journal about a year ago called a
welcome development of transcendent
importance namely a big change from 1985
till the present us labor costs per unit
output in fact wages which were the
highest in the world as you'd expect
the richest most privileged country are
now the lowest in the industrial world
except for England
still ahead if we keep racing them in
1991 we got a low blow England but then
they beat us out again so they're still
first on this race so that's a true
welcome development of transcendent
importance wages keep declining they're
now the lowest labor costs or the lowest
in the industrial world working hours
are going up there's all kinds of
effects like destruction of families you
know especially interested in family
values well you know - - parents are
working full-time maybe four jobs
between the two of them and there's no
daycare because we only believe in
socialism for the rich has a certain
effect on Family Values but you know
that's not an quail's business the or
the Atlantic Monthly which thinks he's
great but these these are other these
are other aspects of these this general
development and you know there's a claim
you know which again you read all the
time that all of this has to do with
kind of laws of nature you know sort of
market forces which are kind of
inexorable you know you just sort of
live under them and several are
mentioned one is automation which of
course drives people out of work and
increases efficiency and so on and the
other is international trades just you
know globalizes the economy and has all
these consequences and those are
supposed to be market forces well you
know if you have a look at them you find
out that both of those forces are real
enough but their relation to the market
is dubious
so take automation say I mean it's
perfectly true
now that automation is driving a lot of
people out of work but the reason for
that is but automation the automation
technology was so inefficient that it
took several decades of development in
the state sector of the economy before
it reached the point where it could
drive people out of work namely it was
developed like most technology through
the military system for decades and it
was developed finally after it was
developed to the point where you could
really harm people properly and increase
profits
then it gets picked up by so-called
private enterprise and that's the market
forces at work
furthermore the technology that was
developed was of a very specific kind it
was of a kind the d skilled workers an
increased managerial power and there's
nothing in here into this technology
that says it's got to work like that
to work the opposite way so these are
decisions in the state sector where most
of the innovation goes on which led to a
certain form of technological
development which now indeed is be
kicking people out of work but that is
more it's only marginally related to
market forces I so take and the same is
true of the other fact that trade in
fact technology relates to that one of
the things that's making trade efficient
for example is new technology like
containerization which the development
again of which again was so inefficient
that it had to be carried out through
the state sector it was developed by the
Navy for years and after you guys paid
for it with you taxes to develop it in a
particular fashion it's now being handed
over to so-called private industry to
drive people out of work and there are
many other forms of public subsidy that
keep trade artificially efficient
outside of market forces so to take only
the obvious example the efficiency of
trade depends on transport costs but
transport is very highly subsidized
through the state sector every form of
transit transport is state subsidized
whether it's roads or airplanes or
maritime industry or whatever
furthermore that's only a tiny piece of
it a part of the reason why if a trade
is inexpensive is because energy costs
are kept within a certain range not too
low because the big energy corporations
which are mostly us have to make a lot
of profit but not too high because that
might cut into the efficiency of trade
and energy costs are kept that way by
the Pentagon in fact a very substantial
part of the pentagon budget is aimed
precisely at that the main intervention
forces have always been targeting the
middle east and for years it was claimed
that that's goes to the Russians but
with the Russians go on that pretext has
been abandoned one nice thing about the
end of the Cold War is you don't have to
waste time arguing about with a lot of
lies anymore because most of them been
abandoned as useless and now it's
officially recognized as the White House
put it right after the fall of the
Berlin Wall when I was calling for its
next Pentagon budget that we need huge
intervention forces aimed at the Middle
East where the threats to our interest
could not be laid at the Kremlin's door
that's nice you know after 50 years of
Lies that mount turns out that wasn't a
Kremlin that was the problem it was the
indigenous population so we still have
to keep the intervention forces which
has the advantage at least of being true
but those are what some of the ways and
I'm putting aside what's called
externalities like you know the costs of
pollution what happens to future
generations and that sort of thing
depletion you know tons of costs if any
if the costs of trade were ever
calculated which they're not it's we
don't know what the number would be but
its efficiency would be well below what
it appears to be today these are not the
effects of market forces all that aside
there's a certain kind of deception even
in the notion of trade so what's moat a
large part of what's called trade in
trade at all in fact not a small part
like around 40% of what's called trade
is actually internal to particular
corporations so like more than half of
US exports to Mexico don't enter the
Mexican market they're just shipped from
some US corporation here to a branch
that it has across the border where they
can get cheaper wages and pollute more
easily and that sort of thing and then
shipped right back here well you know
that's trade in the sense that it
crosses a border but it has nothing to
do with the market
it's just centrally managed commercial
interactions with a very visible hand
and huge market distortions because it's
associated with all kind
techniques of pricing and so on to
undercut market forces and protect the
rich well you know over 50% is not a
small number that's a big number and we
don't know what the actual numbers are
these are the reported ones but a huge
part of trade isn't trade and the part
that is trade is is not reflecting
market forces it's reflecting all kinds
of state intervention so talk about the
inexorable market forces that are
leading to these things is just more
deception it's the kind of thing that
you go to college to learn how to do but
you might as well be aware of what
you're learning the incidentally this
goes all the way back to the origins in
the Industrial Revolution I don't think
that a case on record of any country
that's industrialized through market
forces every single one that I've ever
heard of God made progress through
extensive state intervention that's
certainly true of England
you know the beginner in the racket the
British be industrialized their colonies
by force they protected British industry
from Irish wool ones and you know Indian
textiles back as far back 1700 and they
also did with a lot of violence they
ended up the industrializing both India
and and Ireland then indeed other
colonies where they could manage it this
I should say was bitterly condemned by
Adam Smith over 200 years ago the United
States was exactly and quite apart from
that Industrial Revolution itself was
fueled by cotton after all you know
duster Revolution took off from textiles
that's what the Lowell and Lawrence
Industrial Revolution started with just
like the British and that then spun off
you know machines another thing well how
do you get textiles to be cheap because
you keep cotton cheap cotton was like
the oil of those days and how do you
keep cotton cheap well by exterminating
the native population and bringing in
slaves a little hard to even
and interference with market forces more
than traumatic than that but somehow
that doesn't enter into the discussion
of how market forces led to the
Industrial Revolution England was very
certain made very certain as soon as it
got a step up in this game that it was
going to block industrialization
elsewhere so for example Egypt began an
industrial revolution in the early part
of the 19th century about the same time
the u.s. did but in Egypt Britain was
able to block it and they did Egypt had
sewn continents in elyes India did but
Egypt but you England was able to block
it and turn it back to a deeply
impoverished society because and they
work pretty frank about it they just
didn't want the competition nothing
about market forces and that goes on
after the u.s. took over after the
Second World War it has acted in a very
striking ways to prevent India and Egypt
again to in developed industrially we
had the power to do it then and this
goes on everywhere take a look at US
history
the US was able to start off the
Industrial Revolution behind extremely
high tariff walls it economic historians
estimate that around here you know where
it started about 50% of US manufacturing
plants would have gone bankrupt
immediately if they hadn't been
protected because British Cotton's were
so much British textiles was so much
cheaper not through market forces and
that goes right up to the present
I'm the steel industry was developed
behind high protectionist tariffs if you
come to the modern period you look at
electronics or aeronautical industry or
just about anything that functions it
has a huge state subsidy behind it
wouldn't exist otherwise and that
continues until the present day actually
all this increased under the Reaganites
there's kind of like a law of political
science which says the more people
scream about free markets the more they
violate them something like that I'm not
sure how
that works probably it's not as close as
the correlation between eight and
torture but it's it's high so nobody was
more eloquent about market forces than
the Reaganites who increased the state
share of GNP more erratically than at
any time since the Second World War I
wasn't where they were proud of it when
they were talking to the business
community when they were talking to you
know the rest of us so James Baker the
Secretary of Treasury posted in a
business convinced that the Reaganites
had increased protection for American
manufacturers more than any previous
American administration in the post-war
era he was being a little bit modest it
was actually more than all them combined
they roughly doubled the percentage of
US manufacturing or another form of
tariffs a lot of talking about how the
automobile company the industry
revitalized itself because of American
know-how and so on and also because of
state pressure non-tariff barriers which
is blocked off imports the same is true
of steel and everything else well that's
the Reaganites know the clinton guys are
going even beyond it that's why they're
getting a lot of business support
because they think that we gotta
interfere with the free market even more
erratically and in fact in a way they're
kind of open about it like you may
recall when last November Clinton went
to this Asia Pacific summit in Seattle
and Clinton went there and gave this
dramatic speech about his vision of the
free market future and they call that
the grand vision of the free market
future some big thing you know big
headlines all over and if you look
you'll notice he gave the NEP actually
picked out a corporation which he says
the model for the free market future the
Boeing Corporation is what he picked and
in fact he gave the speech and a hangar
of the Boeing Corporation everyone
applauded the vision of the free market
I mean you couldn't pick an example
that's more comical the Boeing
Corporation is publicly subsidized
corporation couldn't exist otherwise
wouldn't be the biggest exporter in the
United States if taxpayers weren't
painful
well incorporation virtually no profits
before the Second World War during the
Second World War doing its patriotic
duty it was able to rip off a lot of
money and it became quite rich but after
the Second World War you read the
business press it was going to collapse
everybody knew and said that the
aeronautical industry can't survive in
the market so the question is what you
do about it and the answer that was hit
on in fact for the whole economy was
pretend there's a war going on and
therefore will subsidize the
aeronautical industry via the Pentagon
exactly like computers and electronics
and you know everything else and that
was done the Secretary of the Air Force
they were Symington I pointed out that
what we that the word to use is not
subsidy it's security and that's what
we've been hearing ever since the word
isn't subsidy because I haven't sound
right the word is security and that's
why you have the Boeing Corporation in
fact it's military component is going up
again you can't actually measure the
extent that military support because of
the transfer of technology which is
pretty hard to measure from military
production the civilian production but
the aircraft industry which is indeed
our biggest exporter and also a crucial
part in the world's biggest industry
namely tourism which contributes
enormously to us favorable balance and
services that's publicly subsidized and
it was nice that Clinton picked that
example to illustrate so dramatically
his commitment to the free market and
it's kind of interesting that nobody
bothered to point it out again except
the way out of the margins that's what
it means to have a discipline the
intellectual quest well a lot of
rhetoric about free markets but they
have to remember that nobody believes it
except for the poor they are to be
subjected the market discipline so the
poor abroad and the poor at home for
them the market is a great thing but not
for me please
you know we don't want markets for
ourselves certainly no market discipline
we want a powerful state organizing
public subsidies keep us profitable and
beating down anybody who gets in our way
that's
market ideology well returning to the
International economy and the right to
work which is in the Universal
Declaration the fact is that people's
lives are being destroyed on an enormous
scale it's that's just true through
unemployment alone forgetting all these
other things meanwhile everywhere you
look you find work that these people
would be delighted to do if they had a
chance and that would be highly
beneficial for them and for their
communities that is beneficial to people
but not beneficial to the health of the
economy again remember you have to
master that distinction all of this is a
brief way of saying that the economic
system is an absolutely catastrophic
failure you have a combination of badly
needed work vital hands of suffering
people who would be delighted to do the
work and you have an economic system
that can't bring those things together
well that's you know almost a classical
definition of catastrophic failure of
course this catastrophic failure is
hailed as a grand success and that makes
some sense - it is a grand success from
the point of view of the health of the
economy and the technical sense and it's
a grand success for a narrow sector of
people and that sector happens to
include the ones who were writing the
articles and giving speeches and singing
the ODEs to our magnificence and so on
so it all falls together rather well
well a lot more to say about this is not
a lot of time let me just say that there
are major tendencies in the world
economy that are leading to all of this
one of them one of the tendencies not
the only one is the internationalization
of production which everybody knows
about no world economy is getting more
much more internationalized and that has
its effect one effect is that power is
being transferred more and more into the
hands of a smaller and smaller group of
transnational corporations the numbers
are
boggling at this point I have to think
what a corporation is a corporation is
about as close to a totalitarian
institution as humans have ever been
able to devise it's close to pure
totalitarianism in its internal
structure it's a top pouted
decision-making is top-down completely
you can be inserted into it in some
level of which you take orders and hand
them down if you're outside you can try
to rent yourself to it or you can buy
what it produces and that's it apart
from that it's at a latarian institution
and hugely diverse states and if you
look at their interactions and the
relation to banks and so on it's a
degree of concentrated totalitarian
power that is beyond anything that
anyone's ever dreamt though furthermore
its market distorting seriously market
distorting for the return of reasons I
indicated you know the internal
transactions and everything else so it
attacks democracy and its market
distorting and it also has the very
great advantage of increasing global
polarization the gap between the poor
and the rich that's been going up pretty
sharply between the rich countries in
the poor countries but even more
strikingly within every country within
individual countries in fact actually
faster there we're an example in fact in
the industrial world where almost in the
lead England's a little ahead of us
we're back to the levels of pre
depression period England's back to the
levels of the Victorian period in fact
there was actually thanks to Thatcher
who is incidentally the most admired
person among incoming college students
according to a recent poll and that
makes sense she's succeeded in driving
England back to Victorian standards as
well as destroying about a quarter of
British manufacturing capacity but
enriching a small sector of the wealthy
there was just a study by an old
venerable charity in England with the
Queen's patron going back to nineteen
mid nineteenth century and so on which
compared the nutritional levels of
people on benefits what we call welfare
that's probably 25% of children
comparing their nutritional levels with
work houses in the 1870s you know kinda
stuff Dickens is writing about it turns
out that their nutritional they can't
pay for the level of nutrition that a
child had in a workhouse prison in 1870
okay that good reason why she's the most
popular person in the American
ideological system and why incoming
college freshmen who after all know
nothing but what they're taught in the
good schools
that's who goes to college should admire
this not they don't know it it's not
that they admire these consequences they
just admire follow the praise that's
given by people who do know for these
consequences well the United States
hasn't quite gotten that far you know
we're not back to 1870 but we're going
that way it's now back to pre depression
levels of polarization and this is an
immediate consequence of the
globalization of the economy which you
know what it means is that capital is
extremely mobile and label is extremely
immobilize obvious effects there's a lot
of talk about loss of jobs but that's
junk nobody job loss you can't nobody
knows what the effective job loss isn't
doesn't mean anything what it means is
that you can threaten job loss you can
threaten people that if you if you
insist on labor rights if you insist on
decent wages or you know reasonable
working hours or benefits or enforcement
of health standards we'll move elsewhere
at which point people don't ask for them
anymore and you don't get job loss and
the economists say look but no effective
job loss and by their measures there's
no effective job loss but that's just by
an ideological decision to look at
certain things selected so as to ensure
that you benefit the rich you know you
look at other things you get a quite a
different picture but you know divides
the disciplines for their reasons as
part of the university system in
certainly this this description of
highly mobile capital and highly
immobile labor happens to be exactly the
opposite of the assumptions on the basis
of which classical economics was
developed so if you you know you read
and say David Ricardo and so on where
you get all the nice theorems that
you're supposed to
memorize about comparative advantage
that's based on the assumption that
capital is immobile and Labor's mobile
well in those days it wasn't entirely
false labor was mobile you know like
everybody couldn't go to the United
States after the exterminated the
population so labor was very mobile and
on the other hand the capital was
relatively immobile capital men mostly
land you can't move it and if there was
manufacturing investment you know there
were no way to put it in some other
country so it was sort of true capital
was immobile and labour was mobile and
from that you can deduce all the
theorems now the situation is exactly
reversed and you just learn the theorems
because they're useful as ideological
weapons even though exactly the opposite
assumptions are true
well these another advantage of
corporations of course is they operate
in secret you know they're deeply
undemocratic you don't know what goes on
inside these totalitarian institutions
nor do you know what goes on in the
network of quasi governing structures
that they're spawning like the IMF and
the World Bank and so on and indeed this
is the reason why classical liberals
were so opposed to corporations in our
sense like Thomas Jefferson who was you
know live long enough to see the early
stages of the corporate system and wrote
in his last years that banking
institutions and moneyed in corporations
what we call corporations would simply
destroy liberty and would restore the
absolutism that the American Revolution
fought against he couldn't dream of how
far it would go
at an earlier stage half a century
earlier Adam Smith who couldn't even see
corporations in there since this is pre
capitalist but he could envision
envisage it and he also warned against
the stock companies corporations and
their potential power in market
distortion and so on which he said was
very dangerous in particular would
become dangerous he said if they were
granted the rights of persons indeed
immortal persons and that happened in
18th century didn't happen through
Parliament's like Congress never voted
on it this was done by courts and
lawyers and corporate representatives
and lobbyists and so on it was basically
through judicial designs and it created
a form of absolutism that's way beyond
Jefferson's worst nightmares and the
move to transnational economy just
extends this even further the end of the
Cold War just contributes to it means
there's a new third world labor force
that you can use a weapon to be what the
business press calls the pampered
European workers you can beat them over
the head with the idea that you can move
across the border well you'll get ample
protection high tariffs and so on and
that way you can get the Western workers
the pampered Western workers to cut down
on what BusinessWeek's calls their
luxurious lifestyles meanwhile profits
are just assuming you read the fortune
every year the Fortune magazine runs its
fortune 500 thing and take a look at
this year's they're just in awe of the
what they call the dazzling profits even
though sales are stagnating it's not
that there's growth it's just that
profits are dazzling while wages are
going down well that's what the system
is designed for not because of you know
the laws of nature but because of
conscious human decisions and
institutions the so-called trade
agreements just extend that well just to
end there's a kind of an interesting
resemblance almost eerie resemblance I
think between the current period and the
very early days of the Industrial
Revolution now then it was just England
no no it's the world but if you look
back to what was happening then it's had
some similarities to what's happening
now and it may be instructive
this is the period incidentally like the
1820s you know it's the period when the
economic principles that you're supposed
to revere were created what's now called
neoliberalism
classical economics all this stuff was
basically developed in you know by
people like Ricardo and office and so on
and there was a purpose to that there's
something very definite that was going
on it was extremely important to break
down pre-capitalist social arrangements
and pre-capitalist cultural conditions
and psychological conditions all that
had to be destroyed crucially there was
a crucial part of it it was what was he
called in fact the right to live in
feudal society people had a right to
live they had a place in the society
feudal society kind of organized
everybody with a place could muster
mostly it was a pretty rotten place but
it was someplace and they had a right to
live in that place well that's
inconsistent with capitalism capitalism
does not grant a right to live just as
it doesn't grant any other human rights
in fact it denies them it's inconsistent
with them and the main thing that people
like Ricardo and Mullis and the rest of
them were trying to do was to
demonstrate that there is no right to
live as they put it if you don't have
independent wealth and you can't survive
in the labor market which is where you
get your rights then go somewhere else
okay that was the message
Ricardo explained that you deceive the
poor I'm quoting if you make them
believe that they have other rights just
like you deceive welfare mother mother's
not welfare if you let them think that
their children have a right to milk
that's a deception you know it's a
violation of natural Liberty and a great
evil he said it only harms the poor if
you attempt to help them and furthermore
this is true with the certainty of the
principles of gravitation Ricardo
explained you're suppose you have no
right human beings have no intrinsic
rights that's crucial they have the
right so you can get on the labor market
unless you have independent wealth
there's nothing and the choices are
labor market work house prison or go
somewhere else that's it well by the
1830
and that meant breaking down the welfare
system and
you know the whole set of arrangements
and beliefs that went along with it
these things I quoted from the United
States from the local labor press or
examples of this here well by the 1830s
the science as it was called had been
enshrined in the law and they got what
they wanted but there were some problems
one of the problems was the British Army
was spending most of its time putting
down riots
you know because somehow is pretty hard
to knock out of people's heads this odd
idea that they had the right to live I
mean they understood it you know I could
follow logic but somehow it didn't
resonate you know so what they did was
riot and then they did something even
worse they started to organize you get
chart ISM and the labor movement pretty
soon you got a challenge to the right to
rule no all right now it's serious you
know we don't want that
well the science happens to be very
flexible one of the it's not like
physics you know you can adapt it very
easily so the science began to change
and it turned out that actually people
did have a right to live the same
scientists discovered that the new of a
right to live and by the time you get to
around 1850 and you get to say John
Stuart Mill and his principles of
political economy the science is talking
about what sort of the foundations of
the welfare state you know and from that
point on was a fair is actually a bad
word other things were happening to the
rich or it got what they wanted and they
knew they needed a powerful state to
defend their interests so it wasn't too
much resistance to this so the science
changed and it move in response mostly
to public public popular up uproar and
then you go off to a welfare state
period and you know the rest we're now
last ten or twenty years we're going
back to the 1830s it was as if this is
like an interlude you know and except
now it's global so now there's a global
experiment going on which has some
similarity to what was happening in
England and the 20s I think the idea is
that production globally should be by
the super exploited and people in the
rich countries will be driven down to
that level they need not to lose their
jobs they just have to lose their rights
that's all that's required the so you
have production by super exploited
wages go down living standards go down
everything goes down except profits they
go up you know like that you move
towards the kind of international
third-world you know two-tiered
societies small sector a very wealthy
big group of very rich production by the
super exploited market is worldwide now
so it's the rich in the world and
they're a pretty large sector like in a
rich country like say the United States
or something they're a fairly
substantial sector people who can be
part of the market system in a poor
country like say Brazil that's a smaller
sector much smaller in fact you go to
sub-saharan Africa they're very rich
people in sub-saharan Africa but really
small number so the idea is and that's
what's happening in Russia like say
maybe five ten percent of the population
is doing great on the reforms which is
why we're lauding them and most of the
people are kind of thing you read about
in the UNESCO report but we don't care
much about them or as to their
counterparts elsewhere fact the point of
the Cold War was to drive him back to
that level and that was the victory the
so what you have is production by the
exploited for the wealthy and then
there's a side problem you have a huge
massive superfluous people that's the
typical third-world model there's an
awful lot of superfluous people they
don't contribute to profit-making and
therefore they have no rights you know
but they're there so what do you do with
them well like if it's Brazil which
we've incidentally been running for
fifty years so what's going on in Brazil
is what we determine if it's Brazil what
you do is you send out the security
forces to murder them so you send out
the security forces to kill Street
children and that sort of thing
now you can't quite do that in the
United States at least yet so what you
because we're a rich advanced country so
it's done differently
what you do is either lock them up in
urban slums which are kind of
concentration camps and hope that they
kill each other or you put them in jails
and that's exactly why the prison
population is booming it's like
it's a corollary to this two years ago
the United States had the highest
reached the highest per capita prison
population in the world unfortunately
we're still going up but somebody passed
us namely Russia you know we've now
driven them to capitalism so they're in
fact even ahead of us and prison
population per capita turns out but
we'll catch up again you know because we
leave this thing so you and that
incidentally is also a Keynesian
stimulus to the economy like a lot of
construction and you know cheating by
contractors and politicians and a lot of
work to a lot of service work for guards
and stuff so it makes its contribution
to the health of the economy and it also
helps take care of the population in
fact if you look at the statistics the
criminal the crime industry which is
what it is targets the most defenseless
part of the population so if you're if
you have a look there's some interesting
studies of the search that they
basically target black males wealthier
people especially white wealthier people
who are carrying out the very same
crimes are not targeted and it's
dramatic it's really dramatic and that
makes sense too because after all you
you just like the Brazilian cops kill
the street children you know they don't
kill the children of rich people and
it's the same reason you go after
vulnerable people that's our system of
values you go after vulnerable
defenseless people that's of course what
you do if you're going to try to gain
wealth for getting all but self our
guiding value and also as part of this
you have to instill hatred and fear and
so on and it's a very frightened country
for example there's a belief around the
country that crime is just zooming up
and it's a real danger it's about where
it was 25 or 30 years ago and I think
much has changed except for very poor
people for whom it is worse but for most
people people like us let's say there's
no change in crime detect
at least no statistically detectable
change of any significance over the last
20 or 30 years but their big differences
in the beliefs and that's the result of
a major propaganda effort trying to
frighten people nothing new like the
Nazis did the same thing
they created a very frightened
population that's the way you mobilize
people when you're really stomping on
them you know you get them to you hate
each other and be afraid and so on no
real innovations here that makes sense
it's again similar to you know earlier
periods and we going back to the 1820s
and 30s the question is will there be
the same kind of response well you know
this is a lot harder now in a small
national economy like England you could
have a kind of response which is
extremely hard to develop on a global
scale for capitalists very easy
concentrated powerful you know a lot of
communication can move here and there
for people it's a lot harder and nobody
knows the answer to this can it work can
you have a world society in which which
is extremely polarized and increasingly
polarized with production by the
increasingly exploited for the
increasingly wealthy and a mass of
people either taken care of by death
squads or by prisons or by some other
device will that work or will there be
the kind of resistance popular
resistance and organization as there was
finally in early England which forces
changes in these developments well you
know that's kind of thing you can't
really predict all you can do is see the
tendencies these are matters of actual
decision no not the prediction
[Applause]
okay sure yeah we'll have questions now
I can more I can't see people way in the
back plus the light so there's oh yeah
there's a microphone so if people could
just come to the microphone if they want
to say anything make life easier
yeah somebody they alright yeah yeah
yeah yeah if you want to read about it
it's not quite as bad as the women's
international league publication and cut
and undo but it's a little more
available but there's a journal called
multinational monitor and in it in the
summer issue there's an article by one
of the really good reporters one of the
very few reporters it really does his
homework Allan Nairn there's been doing
really good stuff on Latin America for
years and he managed to get the World
Bank report in a sense our state
approved of it but you know he approved
of it the same way you'd approve of
something if you know you had some guide
you know with a gun at your head you
know give me a water torture or
something so he approved of it not that
he had a choice
the World Bank this is actually the
press is now beginning to describe it
they describe it as our steeds program
you know given to the Paris Club the
when the rich lenders by his economists
that's the total fraud it's a World Bank
program being a u.s. program imposed
upon our steed and if you look at it
it's a standard structural adjustment
package except the World Bank official
who is in charge said it won't be as
harsh in Haiti as in other countries
world structural adjustment packages say
all resources have to go to rich
investors foreign investors the domestic
rich and so on you got to eliminate
social services no effect eliminate
everything for the poor like you want to
privatize services that's extremely
important in poor countries thank you
not only Haiti like I have a daughter
who lives in Nicaragua and I kind of
watch this happening there's a lot of
pressure in Nicaragua to privatize
services like say water and that's
extremely important because if you can
privatize services it means most people
will die you know since they're kind of
able to survive because things like
water are sort of provide
but if you can get as much water if you
really eliminate the right to live you
know and you can get as much water for
your children as you can get on a labor
market they'll die you know so it's
important to privatize services and a
limb and and that's what they're doing
so your private and the row yeah the
reason the World Bank official said it
won't be so harmful in Haiti is he said
they don't have a lot of services anyway
so they won't suffer as much as most
countries so it's not really bad you
know so the idea is you privatize that
is eliminate except for the rich just
about everything there is except the
resources will flow to the export sector
which means foreign investors and the
big rich families that back to cool and
so on that's the World Bank program and
it's called very progressive in fact the
way it's kind of interesting to see the
way it's described in the press by the
big thinkers like the language really
you know of the New York Times who tell
us that it's been it's been really
difficult dealing with our Steve have
you been following this stuff you've got
to have noticed how incredibly racist
did all this I mean just mind-boggling
you know but they've got this kind of
erratic you know black kind of stupid
theologian it doesn't understand
anything and is anti-american to boot
but they've been as cheap as Elaine
Cellino put it they've been giving him a
heavy dose of economics okay they've
been teaching him you know the way
things really are like he didn't have
time to go to Clark you know so they're
teaching him rapid dose of economics and
he's now understanding that the real
world the way it works is every all
public resources go to the rich you know
the poor if they can survive in the
labor market fine otherwise they die
that's that's economics in a nutshell
you know you can sort of spell it out in
a lot of formulas but the and that's
what the World Bank program is you want
have a look at the details it's in print
know so you can I
I don't know if the library gets the
journal but if they don't they ought to
it's a good journal it's multinational
monitor the july/august issue Alan there
and has a long report on it and as I
said it is being alluded to in the press
but in a highly misleading fashion yeah
[Music]
can't hear could you move up a little
yeah I mean there's actually direct
connection I mean I think we would have
done the same thing without any Nazis
but the fact is there's a direct
connection how important it is you can
judge but one of the main tasks of the
US forces as they did what was called
liberating Europe was to essentially
restore the fascist order and blah and
and undermine the resistance actually
that was a worldwide project if there
was such a thing as a history of the
post-war world I will wait a long time
for that it's post Second World War its
first chapter would be on the global
effort to destroy the anti-fascist
resistance and to restore the fascist
structures not necessarily with every
single leader like he didn't want him
ler back in there you know but you
wanted the important people I mean all
the people who funded him and organized
it and ran it and so on the they're
called the moderates you know the ones
who kind of try to benefit from the
system and participate in it but don't
actually push somebody into Anna gasps
chamber there the moderates the same
thing in Haiti incidentally it's not a
much smaller scale so you had to get
back the moderates the fascist system
and you had to destroy the resistance
the reason is there's resistance that
all kind of crazy ideas they were
interested in things were called radical
democracy like for example when the
Americas started in Italy when the
America which has been the target of
more CIA operations since then then the
rest of the world combined probably but
certainly most the in Italy deliberately
there was a real resistance
held down six German divisions and it
had liberated most of northern Italy
before the liberators got there and they
you know they had set up popular
committees and they had taken over
factories and they were rebuilding the
economy and they were doing what was
they were doing some really bad things
the British it was a British Labour
Party incidentally the British Labour
Party and us the Roosevelt Democrats
were appalled by what they found
particularly because they were doing
things like hiring excess workers and
carrying out arbitrary dismissal of
bosses most of them fascists so they
were arbitrarily dismissing fascists and
hiring excess workers meaning and I
don't have to translate what that means
but anyway that's not allowed so the
u.s. went in disbanded the resistance
stuck the old bosses back in power
stopped the hiring of excess workers and
suddenly these same reports which are
now all Declassified say yeah hunger is
the worst problem in Italy but hunger is
their problem not our problem our
problem is to make sure that the old
fascist order gets restored then they
can take care of the hunger so it starts
off from there and it was the same all
over the world it so that sometimes very
brutal like in South in Korea for
example the American occupation in South
Korea killed about a hundred thousand
people before what we call the Korean
War you know we call the Korean War 1950
but it started in 1945 and then it was
mostly killing the anti-fascist
resistance and restoring the
collaborators and even using the
Japanese police and the same thing it's
true worldwide there's not an exception
to it as far as I know
well one aspect of this was saving the
people you couldn't keep there so I take
say Klaus Barbie famous when he you know
the butcher of Lyon big Nazi killer when
the American forces moved in the first
thing they did was simply restore him to
his old job and in fact when he was
later you know a couple of years ago he
was picked up and there's a big scandal
about it his commanding officer and US
intelligence actually had an interesting
letter in The Times didn't identify
himself but I
checked out the pit out and he was his
commanding officer and intelligent he
said look it's crazy to criticize US
forces for this Klaus Barbie was an
specialist in going after the resistance
and that's what we needed because we
were going after the same people so why
shouldn't we go after they like we're
taking over where the Nazis left off so
why shouldn't we as the people who know
how to do it this is stupid you know
well okay Klaus Barbie was restored to
his job but there came a point when they
just couldn't keep him on you know I was
too much of a killer so he was spirited
out of Europe through a network it was
called the ratline which involved the
Vatican and all sorts of Nazi priests in
Croatia and so on and they got him off
the Latin America he ended up in Bolivia
where indeed he was involved in narco
trafficking and military cooze as late
as 1980 and that the u.s. was involved
in someone's direct connection actually
the most extreme case was Reinhardt
Galen who was the head of under the
Nazis was the head of in Eastern
European operations meaning and you know
what that means that's the huge
massacres of everybody Jews Slavs
everyone that was his job and he was
picked up right off very fast and
reestablished as the central part of US
intelligence dealing with Eastern Europe
and again for obvious reasons he sort of
knew the ropes you know the job after
and so on and in fact this is all run
out of George cannons office in the
State Department he this is all well
known it's only there's good books about
it a lot of documentation and stuff he
they're very straight books I mean this
is not marginal you know mainstream
books now talk about these things and
one of his jobs for example was to
support armies that Hitler had left had
established in you know the Ukraine and
places like that
and we were supposed to be was supposed
to be supporting them and organizing
them and in fact there were air drops
and CIA actions and so on up till the
early 50s the only reason they stopped
is because it turned out that the
Russians had everything penetrated and
was being exposed and every time they
had an airdrop they just picked up more
guys involved with CIA and so on so they
finally called it off supposedly nobody
knows but supposedly it stopped in the
early 50s with the other another aspect
of this was simply bringing Nazi war
criminals to the United States a lot of
them were scientists and that part is
known but less known as a more
interesting aspect they brought
counterinsurgency specialists guys from
the Vermont and the SS who were engaged
in anti partisan activities and they
were brought over and involved with the
US Army who was then trying to work out
counterinsurgency doctrines what later
became counter insurgency and
low-intensity conflict and if you look
at the history of this it begins with US
Army Studies there now Declassified
based involving ver maka and SS officers
studying how the Nazis tried to put down
the partisan resistance in Europe and
where it succeeded and where it failed
and what lessons you can gain from it
and so on and it's written they're all
written from the point of view of the
Nazis
so the partisans are the terrorists you
know and the Nazis are defending order
and so on you know all the stuff you
read about and everything you read about
Central America and they designed the
techniques and they became
counterinsurgency literature actually if
you want to have a look at this there's
a quite a good book about it by guy
named Michael McClintock who is a
researcher for NSD international for
years and then took off and he wrote a
book called written several books but
this one's called instruments of
statecraft published by Pantheon a
couple of years ago and he has a lot of
details about this stuff I've reviewed
some stuff I've written through but he
has more a lot more details so there are
these various trains they all make
complete sense it's I should say there
isn't much of a gap if you do an honest
history the gap is a few years the US
was very promess aleni
he was that admirable Italian gentleman
as
President Roosevelt called him they kept
supporting him into the late 30s
the US was pro-hitler the British were
even more Pro Hitler I should say this
goes on into the late 30s in the United
States
late 30s the European branch of the
State Department is sending back reports
saying we have to support Hitler and
other fascists because they're the only
barrier to popular forces taking over
towards against the labor movement and
so on which might you know take over
unless somebody is a barrier to this
atrocity and it's just the fascist that
Hitler was a moderate you know standing
between the extremists of right and left
just like the workday and all saw the
door I mean this stuff is just you know
because as far as the British were
concerned I mean even it's amazing but
even after the Battle of Britain you
know like when the Nazis were bombing
London they were still kind of
supporting the Nazis there objection you
know they actually support them but
their objection to the Hitler Stalin
pact was that it gave Stalin too much
power that's his latest 1941 in British
foreign sir office records which are now
out so Hitler was like a secondary
problem even when he was bombing London
and the reason is look it's basically a
class war you know and they didn't
understood this and they were on the
side of the class that happened to be
supporting the Nazis and they reached
and the fascists and they restored them
they started restoring very soon first
place that was liberated was actually
North Africa and there Roosevelt put in
this in late 1942 we put in Admiral
Darlan who was one of the leading VC
fascists in fact the author of these
anti-semitic laws he was put in charge
then when they started liberating
southern Italy the same story I mean
first of all they reinstated the Mafia
for control but also they just began
reconstituting the traditional
conservative order which meant mostly
fascist sympathizers who else it's
exactly look it's just a foretaste of
what you're going to see the next couple
of months in Haiti you know I'll predict
what's going to happen just take a look
at histories happens all the time and it
happens for very good reasons because
that's the way you
you know you satisfy the primary value
of gain wealth forgetting all that self
you know the perfectly rational way to
proceed and every aspect of this
including you know getting Klaus Barbie
out to Bolivia and everything else
that's just one aspect of it
it happens with very great consistency
because it flows from institutional
sources and another thing that flows
from institutional sources is what goes
on and what if we were honest we would
call the commissar culture that is the
general intellectual culture which has -
which has a hard problem it has to put a
kind of a benevolent tech cast on all of
this you know takes a lot of discipline
and a lot of Education before people are
able to do that well you have to
internalize the techniques for not
seeing what's in front of your eyes and
it takes many years of schooling at good
colleges and so on and so forth before
you get that hard enough of your nature
so it comes reflexively it's not simple
no because if you look at what's in
front of your eyes it's you know nothing
you're going to tolerate and that's a
large part of what education is about in
fact but you know but the things you
mentioned I think they sort of fall
within this No
you know that better than I do there's
nothing for me to tell you I mean you
know like for example students have done
lots of things over the years on their
own initiative very effective I mean the
cult that the whole society just changed
radically over the last thirty years and
an awful lot of it is just student
initiatives from the 1960s that just
spread around the rest of the country I
mean I was you know associated the
students who are doing it but it's
nothing that you don't know how to do I
mean you have to start by there's
there's no secret you know it's like the
civil rights movement it's like
everything else it starts with just
getting your head more or less clear
being involved in organizing activities
so you and other people can help each
other and then getting to a scale where
you can begin to have some effect and
bringing in others and so on I mean it's
education and organizing and activism of
various kinds and what you do depends on
the issue there's no general formula I
you know people ask me this all the time
it's never anything to say no because
it's all sort of obvious I mean there
are no secrets like there was no secret
as to how say snake back in the 60s or
to try to break through these horrendous
laws in the South they just did it you
know you thought about it was obvious
how to do it the question is you have
the courage to do it they had the
courage and they did it you know they
need any lessons and nobody was around
to give him any lesson
Paulo if the best way to help other
people is to look after our own welfare
then it would be harmful to them to give
them a the way other countries do and so
that at least makes sense
the sometimes these ideas are elevated
from near universal doctrine to pure
logic for that you have to go to a
really sophisticated places like Harvard
where they have a professorship called
the professorship of the science of
government and the science of government
is now the professorship is now held by
a distinguished scholar Samuel
Huntington and he tells us that the
science of government teaches us that
the United States is unique among
nations because it is defined by its
commitment to democracy markets human
rights and so on and since that's a
matter of definition facts are plainly
irrelevant so it would be a pretty
stupid person who would do experiments
to try to demonstrate that two and two
is four that's a matter of definition
and so is their commitment so it's
really quite unnecessary look at facts
that makes life much easier incidentally
I don't want to suggest that although
these views are close to universal I
mean you really have to go way after the
margins to find somebody raising some
skepticism about them there are people I
don't want to it would be misleading to
say that nobody looks at facts in fact
people do and sometimes they even do so
fairly honestly even telling the truth
so take the matter of democracy some of
the best mainstream work on this highly
regarded and properly regarded work on
in particular on our democracy crusade
of the last decade of the 1980s is by a
senior associate of the Carnegie
Foundation named Thomas Carruthers who's
written a book and number of articles on
us contributions to democracy the Reagan
crusade for democracy and he writes he
has advantage of writing both
as from from a scholarly point of view
and as an insider he was in the regen in
the legal department of the regen state
department working on democracy
enhancement programs in Central America
so he sees it from the inside as well as
just looking at the results and he
points out he says that the policies
were very sincere but they were a
failure in fact they were a remarkably
systematic failure although he doesn't
really comment on that he gives the
evidence but doesn't draw the
conclusions the failure is systemic in
the sense that US influence is
negatively correlated with advances in
democracy that is where US influence was
least there were some advances
particularly in the southern cone of
Latin America there were actual steps
forward that's where US influences least
and in fact as he points out accurately
the Reaganites were very hostile to
these developments and tried to block
them but they then of course took credit
for them after they turned out to be
irreversible on the other hand where US
influence was greater like in Central
America in the Caribbean the results
were pretty awful and the reason he says
is that the United States I'm quoting
him now sought only limited top-down
forms of democracy that did not risk
upsetting the traditional structures of
power with which the United States has
been allied but we're not going to take
any of that nonsense all of this reached
a crescendo about a year ago at a
conference in Vienna where the United
States was very highly praised by its
own press and its own intellectuals for
leading the defense of the universality
of the Universal Declaration and beating
back the challenges from the south I
stress it was highly praised by its own
press and its own intellectuals
there were also some other voices there
was a counter conference at Vienna
representing the overwhelming majority
of the people of the world we're going
to
by NGOs you know nongovernmental
organizations human rights groups
various social groups and they had a big
conference with all sorts of people
there as a counter conference and it was
published in a publication by the
women's our National League for peace
and freedom geneva-based and since we're
fortunate to live in a free country we
don't have to only read what a hundred
percent of the press and commentary was
saying we can also read the report of
that counter conference which was
published in an edition of 200 copies in
Nepal so that's the advantages of
freedom you know you really get
everything available it's what's called
the free market of ideas well the and a
pretty typical example of it I should
say the rhetoric about our you know
magnificent stand is very rarely sullied
with any reference to what the Universal
Declaration actually says and you know
in the light of the great awe and self
acclaim that elicits is perhaps worth
taking a look at its actual content and
it's not uninteresting there a lot of
interesting things to say about it just
keep - a few one core section of the
Universal Declaration has to do with
what are sometimes called Annie torture
rights that is the right to be free of
torture mutilation Massacre and so on on
the part of the state authorities that's
like one element of Human Rights and on
this the US record is very consistent it
is strongly in favor of torture sadism
violence and terror that's overwhelming
in fact there are several academic
studies pointing it out the leading the
place to look of course is again the
place where we have most influence which
is Latin America although it's not
different elsewhere they're the leading
there's a leading academic specialist on
you on human rights in Latin America
Lara Schultz the University of North
Carolina did a study about this around
15 years ago right at the end of the
Carter Administration and he just ran
through the u.s. record what he did
actually was Carly US aid with torture
and the correlation was very close you
know kind of close correlation you
really get in social sciences he pointed
out in summarizing that US aid tends to
flow through countries that torture
their citizens for the hemispheres most
egregious and violators of fundamental
human rights and that includes military
aid runs right through the Carter years
and the aid is uncorrelated with need
although it is correlated with the
climate for business investment that is
the better the climate for investment
the better the more time to give you
representative quotes it was announced
again there two ago by the National
Security Advisor Anthony Lake and a long
article in The New York Times in which
he talked about the current task which
is to in his words consolidate the
victory of democracy and FreeMarkets
this is in the articles an elaboration
of the so-called Clinton doctrine which
he had himself put forth he's the
intellectual and the administration he's
from around here incidentally which I
guess is why so smart the the Clinton
doctrine which as he explained it was to
move beyond containment to enlargement
that's the basic theme up until now
we've been containing threats to the
values that we uphold freedom democracy
human rights international law free
markets and so on and now that we've won
that battle we can go on to enlarge the
domain in which we can realize their
ideals and this is accepted as virtually
a truism by commentators so for example
the chief diplomatic correspondent of
The New York Times Thomas Friedman
describes here he's not
advocating but just describing as a
matter of fact that America's victory in
the Cold War was a victory for a set of
political and economic principles
democracy in the free market at last he
says the world is coming to understand
that the free market is the wave of the
future a future for which America is
both the gatekeeper and the model and
there's kind of another part of the
refrain sort of counterpoint to these
themes which is that the world is lucky
to have such an angelic power to
minister to its needs and wants and that
we're constantly informed for example
recently in a book by Henry Kissinger
much praised book on diplomacy in which
he explains that the United States is
unique in history and it's altruism and
the nobility of its guiding ideals which
he considers a flaw it's not good to do
that the this per se that we're leading
all the time for democracy and
FreeMarkets and international law and
human rights is harmful for us and in
general we're overdoing our mission of
mercy he and many others believe another
one who agrees with him is the
well-known elder statesman George Kennan
who's one of the founders of the current
world order from one of the design
architects of it Ephraim right after the
Second World War and he argues recently
that it's by example not interference
that a country such as ours can most
benevolently
influence world affairs if we can leave
the grubby ER things to other people who
don't share our noble ideals and the
best thing we can do for other people is
to be a good model for them you possible
that that's the principle that underlies
the fact that we have one of the most
miserly aid program
in the underdeveloped world in the
developed world among the industrial
countries and that would after all it
maintained the basic order of quite
undemocratic societies avoiding and
blocking populous based change that
might upset established economic and
political order and open a leftist
direction and for that reason the
policies the sincere policies of
advancing democracy were a failure he
doesn't go into saying how they avoided
populist base change but that you're
supposed to know it was with
extraordinary violence and terror and
lawlessness even to the extent of
contemptuously disregarding judgments of
the World Court calling on the United
States determinate its terror operations
vetoing resolutions in the Security
Council calling on all states to observe
international law of blocking assembly
General Assembly resolutions and so on
so it was through a combination of
extreme lawlessness unparalleled terror
and sadistic violence that the United
States succeeded in blocking any
political change in keeping highly on
them quite undemocratic societies and
power and that's the area where we had
some influence down below and Southern
Cone where the influence was less we
weren't able to do that and there was
some democratic change so the policy was
a failure pretty much in the sense that
the Russians failed to achieve freedom
in Eastern Europe kind of curious
failure well with Carruthers and a few
others like and we move from the domain
of rhetoric and ideology towards the
world of reality and in the real world
what we find this pretty much what he
describes as much broader in a real
world human rights and democracy and
FreeMarkets
are under very serious attack in much of
the world and that includes leading
industrial democracies to be more
specific effective power that is the
power to really make decisions that
determine what goes
the world is concentrating more and more
in almost completely unaccountable
absolutist institutions and the rich and
the powerful who is institutions they
are they are no more willing to accept
market discipline or popular control
than they've ever been in the past in
fact there are now able to resist it
these dangerous tendencies much better
than in the past
well these are pretty large topics and
they're the ones I want to talk about so
I'll say a few words about them in in
order with touching on several topics
the easiest one to begin with so let me
start on that one it's human rights
because there at least we don't have to
debate much about what it means there is
a universally accepted standard it's
codified in the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights voted unanimously by the
United Nations in December 1948 and it
actually has the force of law and US
Court there also related conventions so
you can debate this and that but there
is at least the solid standard that
everyone fervently adheres to and indeed
there is a great deal of impressive
rhetoric about how we stand for the
principle of universality of the
Universal Declaration and we defend that
principle against backward third world
people who plead what they call cultural
relativism they say some aspects of it
don't apply to them welcome to the first
speakers forum event of the year my name
is Todd Burnham I'm the president of the
speakers for on this year and first for
some details on can everyone hear me
like this is this good yeah okay
it's in terms of it more in terms of the
structure of the evening
first he professor Chomsky is going to
speak to us and then we're gonna have a
question-and-answer session depending
upon how the evening goes that's going
to be up to him he'll choose the point
for that and in terms of doing that if
people would just go up around the back
and over we only have one microphone for
that so over here on your right if you
go down to their lineup for questions
and the speech will get over
approximately around 9:30 and then we'll
have a reception in Tilton hall so and
this will all be freestyle in terms of
the timing we'll see what happens but
again I like to welcome everybody here
I'm really really excited about this
evening speakers forum for those who you
don't know as a group here on campus
that's run by students and basically our
agenda is to bring speakers to campus
that cover topics that are of concern to
students and the society at large and we
try and get people that have that are
inspirational and informative on some
important topics and professor Chomsky
is definitely that I think it's really
important because this is everyone here
for the students I can speak as I think
is on a path of discovering a little bit
more and more about their studies in a
more detailed manner I think that this
journey is something that Professor
Chomsky has done with a great rigor in
his life and I think that that's very
commendable so I'm very glad to have him
here professor Chomsky is the professor
of linguistic linguistics at MIT he's an
internationally recognized social critic
we've studied relations of language and
politics and has done quite a bit in
that field concerning linguistics he's
done quite a bit to reveal the in
Justices concerning national power and
an arbitrary government policies and
those of you know of him have read about
his revealing of certain documents and
information concerning the policies of
our government some of his books are
manufactured with consent the political
economy of mass media deterring
democracy and World Order's old and new
I think that will suffice that I think
maybe we can just all welcome for mr.
Noam Chomsky
[Applause]
it's happening here just want to get
this out of the way can I get it over
there yeah guys who really won the world
are these technicians who I was always
having in line well there's a
conventional doctrine about the new era
that we're entering on the promise that
it holds it's so conventional that it's
pretty much of a waste
