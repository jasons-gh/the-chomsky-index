actually comes from Orwell who made a
distinction between what he called
people and unpeople people are those who
count on people are those who are the
not human you do anything to whom you
like actually that came up to me vividly
a couple of hours ago I happen to be in
a video conference in London and the the
moderator of the group there of them the
questions he asked he pointed he just he
brought up the horror in the west over
the beheadings that are taking place for
the headings of journalists there was
another one Algeria there two ago and he
said this is just so hideous that it's
really creating such extraordinary
outrage in the West that we just have to
do something about it he said that is
this was pretty liberal group said that
we recognized that the u.s. British
Israeli atrocities are pretty awful but
even during the Israeli attack on Gaza I
mean you didn't see things like
beheadings didn't you in fact during the
Israeli attack on Gaza if you look at
the sectors of Gaza that were subjected
really vicious murderous attack like
Sofia after the attack kind of relented
that people went in and we're picking up
pieces of bodies to try to identify who
was murdered but all of that was
reported but he was correct that didn't
horrify the West when we carry out
atrocities like smashing people up so
that their body parts are scattered
around then you can't even identify who
they were that's not a crime it can be a
mistake you sometimes allowed to say
it's a mistake that just like the drone
assassination campaign which undoubtedly
does worse things and beheading to this
victims it's a mistake maybe it's a
mistake but it's not a crime on the
other hand if Isis or whatever offshoot
it isn't Algeria beheads people that
offend
us into the heavens and it is horrendous
undoubtedly though it's a tiny fraction
of what we in our clients do but that's
the people on people distinction
