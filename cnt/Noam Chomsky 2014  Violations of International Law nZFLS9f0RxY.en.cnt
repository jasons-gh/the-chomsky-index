violation of international we can debate
this or that the fact that's not yet
accepted and agreed but there are gross
violations of international law which
are proclaimed openly and publicly and
presented with self praise so for
example suppose that when President
Obama or any Western any American
diplomat or journalist says that with
regard to Iran all options are open as
it said constantly what does that mean
all options are open means force is open
means nuclear attack is open those of
you who may recall an obscure document
called the UN Charter might remember
article 2 which bans the threat or use
of force in international affairs the
threat or use of force they're all
violating international law openly and
proudly and the same is true when they
support criminal organizations the US
and Israel don't deny their they kind of
nod their heads about say the
assassination of Iranian scientists or
the the cyber attacks on Iran which are
openly acknowledged and praised all
violations of international law but what
about Iranian nuclear weapons well you
know there are ways to approach the
question of nuclear weapons in fact some
of you may recall who have a long memory
back as far as 2010 when an agreement
was reached between Turkey Brazil and
Iran to settle the issue of Iranian
nuclear developments the agreement was
that Iran would transfer to Turkey it's
low enriched uranium so the Vino issue
of
in nuclear weapons and in return the
Western powers would provide Iran with
the isotopes it needs for its medical
research as soon as that agreement was
reached it was bitterly denounced by the
US government by President Obama but
Congress by the media how dare they do
this the government of Brazil was kind
of irritated and its foreign minister
released a letter from President Obama
to president Lula of Brazil proposing
exactly this presumably proposed it
because he thought they wouldn't around
would never agree well Iran did agree so
then came the attack didn't come all
kind of pretext that's 2010 let's go on
to 2012 okay a little more recent maybe
easier to remember in December 2012
there was supposed to be a conference in
Helsinki organized under UN auspices the
non-proliferation treaty organized
conference in Helsinki to take steps
towards establishing a nuclear weapons
free zone in the Middle East I feel his
own free of weapons of mass destruction
but crucially nuclear weapons that was
December 2012 international conference
everyone waited to see Israel said they
would not attend next question well Iran
say Iran said they would attend with no
conditions a couple of days later the
United States cancelled the conference
pretexts you know this is that reason
but it didn't take place virtually no
mention of this in the US media do a
study tells you something about the
media hardly a mention well that's
another opportunity lots of ways of
dealing with the nuclear weapons problem
and of course recall that there is one
state in the region
which is armed to the teeth with nuclear
weapons
hundreds of nuclear weapons the State of
Israel with us support so there are
things that can be done about the
nuclear weapons issue if anyone's
serious about it but as far as your
point about violating international law
is concerned all the time
openly and proudly
