you
we can ask ourselves what the purpose of
an educational system is and of course
there are sharp differences on this
matter there's the traditional and
interpretation that comes from the
Enlightenment which holds that the
highest goal in life is to inquire and
create to search the riches of the past
try to internalize the parts of them
that are significant to you carry that
quest for understanding further in your
own way purpose of Education on from
that point of view is just to help
people determine how to learn on their
own it's you the learner who is going to
achieve in the course of education and
it's really up to you what you'll what
you'll master where you go how you use
it
how you'll go on to produce something
new and exciting for yourself maybe for
others that's one concept of Education
the other concept is essentially a
doctor nation people have to the idea
that from childhood young people have to
be placed into a framework in which
they'll follow orders accept existing
frameworks and not challenge and so on
and this is often quite explicit so for
example after the in the after the
activism of the 1960s there was great
concern across much of the
educated spectrum that young people were
just getting to free and independent
that the country was becoming too
democratic and so on and in fact there's
an important study on what's called the
crisis of democracy too much democracy
arguing that they are claiming that
there are certain institutions
responsible for the indoctrination of
the young so they're phrase and they're
not doing their job properly that's
schools universities churches we have to
change them so that they carry out the
job of indoctrination control more
effectively that's actually coming from
the liberal internationalist end of the
spectrum of the internet of the spectrum
of educated opinion and in fact since
that time there have been many measures
taken to try to turn the educational
system towards more control more
indoctrination or vocational training
imposing a debt which traps students
young people into a life of conformity
and so on that's the exact opposite of
the what I referred to as the tradition
that comes out of the Enlightenment and
there's a constant struggle between
those in the colleges in the schools in
the schools do you do you train for
passing tests or do you train for
creative inquiry pursuing interests that
are aroused by a material that's
presented you want to pursue either on
your own or cooperation with others and
this goes all the way through up to
graduate school and research just two
different ways of looking at the world
when you when you get to a say a
research institution like the one we're
now in at the graduate level that
essentially follows the
enlightenment tradition effect science
and couldn't regress unless it was based
on inculcation of the urge to challenge
to question the doctrine question
authority search for alternatives use
your imagination
that freely under your own impulses
cooperative work with others as constant
as you can see just by walking down the
halls that's my view what an educational
system should be like down to
kindergarten but there's certainly are
powerful structures in the society which
would prefer people to be indoctrinated
and form not ask too many questions
be obedient fulfill the roles that are
assigned to you and don't try to shake
systems of power and authority those are
choices we have to make either as people
that wherever we stand in the
educational system as students as
teachers as people on the outside trying
to help shape it in the directions in
which we think it ought to go
you
well there certainly has been a very
substantial growth and new technology
technology of communication and
information access interchange it's
surely a major change in the nature of
the culture and society so we should
bear in mind that the technological
changes that are taking place now while
they're significant probably coming
nowhere near having as much impact as
technological advances of say century
ago plus or minus so the shifts as tech
just communication the shift from a
typewriter to a computer or a telephone
to the email is significant but then
begin to compare with the shift from a
sailing vessel to a telegraph I mean the
time that that cut down in communication
between say England and the United
States was extraordinary as compared
with the changes taking place now and
the same is true of other kinds of
technology like just introduction of say
plumbing widespread plumbing in the
cities had a huge effect on health much
more than the discovery of antibiotics
so the changes are real and significant
but we should recognize that others have
taken place which in many ways were more
dramatic the as far as the technology
itself and education is concerned
technology is it's basically neutral
it's kind of like a hammer I mean you
can the hammer doesn't care whether you
use it to build a house or whether a
torturer uses it to crush somebody skull
hammer can do either same with the
modern technology say the Internet so on
the Internet is extremely valuable if
you know what you're looking for
I mean I use it all the time for
research
I'm sure everyone does if you know the
kind of what you're looking for you have
a kind of a framework of understanding
which directs you to particular things
it lets you sideline lots of others then
this can be a very valuable tool of
course you always have to be willing to
ask is my framework the right one maybe
I ought to modify it maybe if there's
something I look at that questions that
I should rethink how I'm looking at
things but you can't pursue any kind of
inquiry without a pretty relatively
clear framework that's directing your
search and helping you choose what's
significant what isn't what can be put
as I thought to be pursued what ought to
be challenged will be developed and so
on you can't expect somebody to become a
biologist say by giving them access to
the Harvard University biology library
and say just look through it give them
nothing and the Internet is the same
except magnified enormous ly if you
don't understand what know what you're
looking for if you don't have some kind
of a conception of what matters always
of course we supervise that you're
willing to question it if it seems to be
going in the wrong direction if you
don't have that exploring the Internet
is just picking out random factoids that
don't mean anything so behind any
significant use of contemporary
technology the Internet communication
systems with graphics whatever it may be
behind unless behind it is some
well-constructed directive conceptual
apparatus it
is very unlikely to be helpful it may
turn out to be harmful for example the
random exploration through the internet
it turns out to be a cult generator pick
up a factoid here and a factoid there
and somebody else reinforces it and all
of a sudden you have some created the
picture which has some factual basis but
doesn't do with the world you have to
know how to evaluate interpret and
understand the say biology again they
the person who wins the Nobel Prize in
biology is not the person who read the
most journal articles and the most notes
on the person knew what to look for and
cultivating that capacity to seek what's
significant always willing to question
whether you're on the right track that's
what education is going to be about
whether it's using computers in the
internet or pencil and paper and books
you
well I is discussed in terms of whether
it's a worthwhile investment that does a
create human capital that can be used
for economic growth and so on that's a
very strange with that it kind of Airy
distorting way to even pose the question
I think do we want to have a society of
free creative independent individuals
able to appreciate and gain from the
cultural achievements of the past and to
add to them do we want that or do we
want people who can no increase GDP not
necessarily the same then not the same
thing and a an education of the kind
that say Bertrand Russell John Dewey and
others talked about that's a value in
itself whatever whatever impact it has
in society it's a value because it helps
create better human beings that after
all that's what an educational system
should be for on the other hand if you
want to look at it in terms of costs and
benefits make the new technology that we
were just talking about where'd that
come from well actually a lot of it was
developed right we were sitting down
below where we now are was a major
laboratory back in the 1950s where I was
employed in fact which was had lots of
scientists engineers
people of all kinds of interests
philosophers others who were working on
developing the basic character of the
and even the basic tools of the
technology that is now common computers
in the internet for example were pretty
much in the public sector for decades
just funded in places like this where
people were exploring new possibilities
that were mostly on photo of the heard
of it time as some of the work some
didn't the ones that worked were finally
converted into tools that people can use
that's the way scientific progress takes
place it's the way the cultural progress
takes place general classical artists
for example came out of a tradition of
craftsmanship that was developed over
long periods with master artisans with
others and something sometimes you can
rise on their shoulders and create new
marvelous things but it doesn't come
from nowhere if there isn't a lively
cultural and educational system which is
geared towards encouraging creative
exploration independence of thought
willingness to challenge to cross
frontiers to challenge accepted beliefs
and so on if you don't have that you're
not going to get the technology that can
lead to economic gains though that I
don't think is the prime purpose of
cultural enrichment and education as
part of it
you
there is in the recent period
particularly at increasing shaping of
education from the early ages towards on
that towards passing examinations that
can be taking tests can be of some use
both for the person who's taken the test
see what I know where I am what I've
achieved what I have it for instructors
what should be changed and improved and
in developing the course of instruction
but beyond that then really tell you
very much I mean I know for for many
many years I was on I've been on
admissions committees for Andrea to a
advanced graduate program maybe one of
the most advanced anywhere and we of
course pay some attention to test
results but really not too much I mean
you can but a person can do
magnificently on every test and
understand very little I mean all of us
who've been through schools and colleges
and universities are very familiar with
this you can be assigned you can be in
sums a course that you have no interest
in and there's demand that you pass a
test and you can study hard for the test
and you can ace it to use the idiom into
fine and the three we had a couple of
weeks later you forgot what that what
the topic was I'm sure we've all had
that experience I know I had it's a it
can be a useful device if it contributes
to the constructive purposes of
Education if it's just the set of
hurdles you have to cross it can turn
out to be now meaningless but it can
divert you away from things you want to
be doing after I see this regularly when
I talk to teachers
just give you one experience from a
couple of weeks ago was plenty like it I
have to be talking to a group which
included many school teachers that one
of them was a sixth grade teacher
teachers kids it's an hour eleven of the
twelve something like that she came out
to me afterwards and I've been talking
about these things and she told me that
I'm an experience that she had just had
in her class after one of the classes a
little girl came up to her and said she
was really interested in something that
came up and she asked how she could cut
the teacher give her some ideas about
how to look into it further and the
teacher was compelled to tell her I'm
sorry but you can't do that you have to
study the past this national exam that's
coming that's going to determine your
future the teacher didn't say it but
it's going to determine my future like
whether I neveri I heard and so on the
system is geared to getting the children
to pass hurdles but not to learn and
understand and explore that child would
have been better off if she had been
allowed to explore what she was
interested in and maybe not do so well
in to test about things he wasn't
interested in i'ma go come along when
they fit into her interest in concerns
and so a test I don't say that test
should be eliminated they can be a
useful educational tool but ancillary
something that's just helping improve
for ourselves for instructors and others
what we're doing tell us where we ought
to be moving but they don't passing
tests doesn't begin to compare with it
with
searching and inquiring and into
pursuing topics that engages and excite
us that's far more significant than
passing tests and in fact if you person
if you if that's the kind of educational
career that you're given the opportunity
to pursue you will remember what you
discover which is a famous physicist
world famous physicist right here at MIT
who like a lot of the senior faculty was
teaching freshman courses he once said
that in his freshman course didn't
Alaska what are we going to cover this
semester and his standard answer was it
doesn't matter what we cover it matters
what you discover and that's right
teaching ought to be inspiring students
to discover on their own to challenge if
they don't agree to look for
alternatives if they think they're
better ones to work through the great
achievements of the past and try to
master them on the run because they're
interested in if that's the way teaching
and is done students will really gain
from it and will not remember what they
studied but will be able to use it as a
basis for going on their own
and again education is really aimed at
just helping students get to the point
where they can learn on their own
because that's what you're going to do
for their free for your life not just
absorb materials that give it to you
from the outside and repeat it
you
