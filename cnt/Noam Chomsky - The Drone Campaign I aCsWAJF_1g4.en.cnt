after the Boston bombing there was a
drone strike in Yemen one of many but
this one we happen to know about because
there was a young man from the village
that was hit testified before the Senate
a couple of days later and described it
right at the same time and what he said
is interesting and relevant he's he said
that his village was an isolate liver
they were trying to kill somebody in his
village they said the man was perfectly
well known they could have apprehended
him if they want it he was a drone
strike is a terror weapon we don't talk
about it that way but it is just imagine
if you're walking down the street and
you don't know whether in five minutes
there's going to be a explosion across
the street from some place way up in the
sky that you can't see and somebody will
be killed and whoever else is around
will be killed and maybe you'll maybe
you will be injured of you there that's
that just as a terror weapon it
terrorizes villages regions huge areas
in fact the most massive terror campaign
going on Wow long treatment and what
happened in the village is that
according to the testimony testimony
that he said that the jihadis had been
trying for years to turn the villagers
against the Americans and had not
succeeded he said in one and drone
strike they turned the entire village
against the Americans that's a you know
maybe a couple hundred new people who
will go terrorists if they take revenge
it's a terror generating machine it's a
terror it's a terrorist operation and a
terrorist generating machine so it goes
on and on that's not just the drone
strikes also the special forces and so
on well that was right at the time of
the Boston Marathon that it's just one
of
innumerable cases and it's it is more
than that this the man who was the man
who was targeted for whatever reason
they had to target him that's just my
personal that's just murder there are
principles going back 800 years to the
Magna Carta holding that people that
cannot be punished by the state without
being sentenced by a speedy trial of
peers that's only eight hundred years
old have various excuses but I don't
think they really apply and I speaking
of the drone wars I can't help but think
of John Belanger the chief architect of
the drone policy who was speaking to a
think-tank
recently and he said that Obama's ramped
up the drone killings simply to avoid
the bad press of Gitmo of capturing
suspects alive and trying to make it Moe
when you hear things like this what is
your response to people who say his
hands are tied he wants to do well
that's like it was pointed out some time
ago by a Wall Street Journal military
correspondent what he pointed out is
that Bush's technique was to capture
people and torture them
Obama's improved that you just killed
them and anybody else's around it's not
that his hands are tied he's a that's a
much more it's bad enough to capture
them and torture them but just murder on
executive whim and as I say it's not
just murdering the suspects a terror
weapon terrorizes everyone else that's
it's not that anyone's hands are tied
that's what he wants to do I'd rather be
detained indefinitely than be blown up
as well as my family and friends around
me yeah and that terrorizes everyone
else and there's
there are recent polls which show that
our public opinion the results are kind
of interesting the they don't the Arabs
don't particularly like you ran but they
don't regard it as a threat it's ranked
very low they do see threats in Egypt
and Iraq and Yemen of the United States
is the major threat the policy of
murdering people instead of capturing
them and torturing them can be presented
to the public in a way that makes it
look clean it's presented and I think
most people see it this way as a kind of
a surgical strike which goes after
people who were planning to do us harm
and this is a very frightened to country
terrified country has been for a long
time so if anybody's going to do us harm
it's fine for us to kill them and some
of the reactions are how this is
interpreted is quite interesting for
example it was the case about a year two
ago when a drone attack in Yemen killed
a couple of little girls and there was
discussion but with a well-known liberal
columnist Joe Klein
he writes for time he was asked what he
thought about this and he said something
like it's better that four of them are
killed than four of four little girls
here so because I mean the logic is mind
boggling but if we have to kill people
elsewhere who might conceivably have
aimed to harm us and it happens that a
couple little girls get killed - that's
fine we're entitled to do that I mean I
suppose any other any country who's
doing that to us or to any anyone we
regard as
it's incredible
