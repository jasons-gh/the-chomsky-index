before Marwan goes I we can't not talk
about the Palestine papers because al
Jazeera has released them and you're the
senior political analyst for Al Jazeera
the Palestine papers the leaked
documents obtained by Al Jazeera that
show how Palestinian leaders offered
sweeping concessions to Israel on a
number of key issues but received little
in return the UN special coordinator for
Middle East peace Robert Serry has said
the papers highlight the Israeli
government's rejection of serious
negotiations in its attempt to retain
control over the West Bank what you have
seen is in my view an earnest genuine
Palestinian attempt to actually show
readiness for a two-state solution and
maybe we haven't seen that same
readiness on the other side given also
the fact that all of what happened
hasn't lead to an agreement and that
that's Robert sorry Marwan Bishara I
want to have you explain the
significance of this it's horribly
talked about in the United States we all
know about the WikiLeaks documents but
not the Palestine papers and again get
professor Chomsky to respond well look
it's very simple this has been ocean for
the last 20 years that from our effort
on words that the Palestinians were not
serious partners for peace that the
Palestinians were not forthcoming that
they're not willing to compromise that
they were set in their ways but we found
out from the Palestine paper 1,600
documents detailing session after
sessions with Americans with Israelis
and so on so forth that the Palestinian
delegation was not only making
incredible compromises that I'm not sure
that they will pass through the public
opinion in Palestine but they were
making acrobatic attempts just to please
their Israeli partners and their
American partners they were almost
playing and the American role of trying
to bridge between America and Israel
between Palestine is there themselves
and yet they've been met with rejection
after rejection of ejection not only
from the so-called hawkish bits of
Israeli politics but actually from the
so-called moderate parts of the Israeli
policy or days delegation so you would
see we would see sessions after session
for example with then for
Minister Livni where the Palestinians
are offering one possibility after
another and the Israelis coming back and
saying something so condescending such
as oh this is very interesting but I
don't think this will work once you come
up with something different and it just
goes on and on for years now as
Professor um she was saying the problem
with much of that Amy is that there is
information out there but it does not
come together in some understanding of
some sort so we know for 20 years the
Palestinians have made historic
compromises on the question of the
territory and the question of borders
even on the question of Jerusalem a
question of right of return of refugees
but they have always been met with
rejection from the Israeli side and
complicity from the American side and al
Jazeera's role here and the significance
before you go of Al Jazeera in this
entire uprising I mean solid Erica first
was really fiercely going after al
Jazeera and then before you know it he
the longtime Palestinian negotiator had
resigned you yourself Marwan are
Palestinian well you know there's a
there was an article that the couple of
days ago I think it was in The
Washington Post by Robert Malley who was
a former aide at a Clinton
administration he said well today we
should know that al Jazeera is the Arab
leader and what does that really mean
what it means is that al Jazeera is a
transparent open forum for Arabs to come
and speak and they have been for the
last decade and a half almost as long as
you've been on air Amy except that
they've given Arabs from various parts
of the Arab world the capacity to come
on air and speak and I think the the the
the way we've covered places like
Palestine for example we were the only
ones Amy in Gaza when during the during
the Israeli bombardment and war and
invasion of Gaza last one in 2008 and
hema right who now is in Cairo is the
claimant in that's correct and of course
in Cairo we've been there in a very
substantial I think we have like eight
roving reporters in Egypt alone when
when things work out so we are there
where we listen to the people and we
will report the story as is of course
before we've been accused because we
will report those things that that norms
talk about the sentiments of people
is a pent-up tension that area the fact
that the fact that Washington sees
people as terrorists as jihadists as
radicals as extremist and the most
autocratic and and and the most the
worst of kleptocracy in the world as
moderate as allies as friends of the
United States as an insult to the
American people but that's how
Washington has been via these things we
are going to break and then come back
Marwan Bishara I want to thank you very
much for being with us senior political
analyst at al Jazeera English and host
and editor of empire you can see al
Jazeera English on the web in fact we
did a very interesting forum that you
moderated Marwan at Columbia Journalism
school with Carl Bernstein and Clay
Shirky and and others about WikiLeaks
about a number of issues about what's
happening it was happening all about an
hour after Mubarak had resigned you can
go unfortunately i'll say online until
this is all over the united states and
toledo ohio in burlington vermont you
can see al jazeera english actually on
free speech TV and unlink TV satellite
networks who are giving over some of
their time to the programming we'll see
what happens the Al Jazeera English is
waging a huge campaign the United States
full page articles in the New York time
ads saying to people to call for their
networks to cable stations to bring al
Jazeera just as one of the panoply of of
networks that people can see marwon
thanks so much Marwan Bishara
