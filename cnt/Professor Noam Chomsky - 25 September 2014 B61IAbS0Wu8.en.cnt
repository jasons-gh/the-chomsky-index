and that he can answer some questions we
put him arising from this fascinating
film the man who is tall this happy them
welcome I think you can see that we have
an appreciative audience but has found
something very interesting in this film
and moreover is fascinated by your own
reflection no my I would like just to
start off by asking a few questions and
then I've got some questions from the
members of the audience I wanted to ask
first but sort of somehow between the
beginning and end of the film there's
quite an emphasis on education and you
in particular talk about the primary
school you attended that was fury eyed I
think you described it and I wonder
whether you think that the dewy-eyed
principles the principles of John Dewey
the American pragmatist a lot of us did
they have some sort of influence on you
whether you read him or not because of
this educational background and
a baths did you reproduce some of this
with your own children which is
something you discuss their education I
don't doubt that the first of all can
you hear me can you hear me can you hear
me yes okay I don't doubt that the early
educational experience had a quite
substantial impact on my thinking
development attitudes towards things and
hence indirectly due he had an influence
and said he was the person who inspired
the basic structure of the educational
system I should say later when I was a
teacher I sort of worked my way through
college teaching a Hebrew school and we
taught on dewy-eyed principles quite
explicitly so I had experience also as a
teacher using these and I can't doubt
that that transferred over the way we
handle our own children's my wife
actually went through the same
experiences about another aspect of your
upbringing and that is I believe from
other writings and interviews of yours
that you had a an intensely political
home background and that the predominant
influence was anarchism and I wanted to
ask whether there's something in that
anarchist
tradition that also appears in your work
or or helped you to really reconcile
yourself to allowing quite a lot of
chaos and complexity you didn't seem to
be frightened by the absence of higher
authorities you're quite confident to
set out by yourself well as a anarchism
is a term that is used very broadly by
anarchists as well but what I believe to
be the sort of core principle that runs
through the diverse anarchist traditions
is that structures of nomination of any
kind a hierarchical authoritarian
structure structures in which someone
gives orders and others follow them all
such structures are illegitimate until
proven otherwise the meaning they have a
and proof to bear they have to show that
they're legitimate otherwise they should
be dismantled that's true whether you're
talking about the sovereign in
international affairs the CEO of a
corporation the manager of a corporation
is giving orders to workers a
patriarchal family in which the father
figure is domineering the others and so
on at any level all such structures have
to demonstrate their legitimacy and if
they can't they should be dismantled
typically they can't that's very common
occasionally you can give a
justification for them but they have the
burden of proof and yes that I think
consciously consciously in this case
carries over to the kinds of domains
that you're referring to and I think
should be a guideline for everyone
thinking that in the account you give up
your ideas in the film the different
generations appear the parent generation
the child generation perhaps more than
two generations I had the impression
that innovation doesn't just come from
the old and wise or and it doesn't just
come from the naive wisdom of the child
but somehow there's an interaction to do
with the fixed attributes of our
intelligence that somehow these small
changes made by the parent generation
are seen in a more systematic way by the
child generation did did I get that
right or have I there's plenty of
interaction any parent that should be
aware that you can learn from your
children
the another great figure in modern
educational theory Paulo Ferreira
once described the education teaching
the teaching teacher-student relation as
a mutual relations
they're learning from each other it's an
interaction in which one learns from the
other that's I mean I happened to have
just come 15 minutes ago from a graduate
seminar where I happen to be lecturing
and it's exactly what happens hope one
hopes the students learn from you but
you learn from them if it's not an
interactive environment there's
something wrong with it and I think
that's true down to the level of nursery
school and your own children
grandchildren and my case grande great
grandchild it's a constant process of
interactive relationship new insights
coming from all directions corrections
coming from above and below and in fact
in general the a goal should be to try
to the extent possible to attenuate and
if possible eliminate the very concept
of above and below it's true that there
are some as I said some hierarchical
relations which can find a justification
but they have to demonstrate that the so
for example if I'm walking with my I say
my great grandchild in the streets and
he runs into the street and I grab his
arm and pull them back that's an
authoritarian relation but I think you
can give a justification for it and
sometimes you can I think it's much
harder than it's generally assumed we
should not take such relations for
granted in the educational domain either
as very rightly pointed out I think the
teacher-student relationship you won and
what role is played in this by the fixed
attributes I think you sometimes use the
term black box the the fact that we are
all both the parent and child generation
are both limited in this way
does this affect the relationship
between the two the two or more
generation yes and there are both
institutional and conventional and
natural structures that we're embedded
in but we should be open-minded enough
to question them and ask whether we
should conform to them or whether we
should modify them so yes there are
always going to be such limitations
coming from many directions and one
question that should be constantly in
the back of our minds you can't think of
it at every moment is but when a point
of tension arises it should always ask
yes
am i right and accepting this position
of whether it's authority or
subordination um
don't sum the capacity the infinite
capacity to appreciate patterns is that
something which contributes to this
present well we have a an infinite
capacity but remember that doesn't mean
a boundless capacity infinite and
boundless are quite different things we
have undoubtedly
infinite cognitive capacities which
reveal themselves in every aspect of
their mental lives and behavior there
are also intrinsic limits to it and
that's an interesting topic in itself
but that's everything we do is shaped by
the internal structures and patterns
that are available to us quite often
they are much an hour than the ones that
are in principle available to us that's
what learning is finding that I can
break these bounds and go beyond and
still be within my cognitive capacities
that sometimes when you can't break the
bounds
we are after all organic creatures not
angels um I wonder if I could ask you
about the status and the present
condition of linguistics the a
discipline to which you've devoted much
of your life I mean at some points in
the film you implied that it's still
quite backward and you say we haven't
even really got to Galileo yet on the
other hand there is a sense in which
linguistics I mean there have been major
breakthroughs
I mean others can say and you know you
yourself have often provided some the
most decisive of those breakthroughs in
recent decades but um it seems that
linguistics even though perhaps not
fully developed as some other Sciences
some other subsections and discipline
that it exercises a peculiar fascination
for very large numbers of people your
own work has had an impact far outside
the ranks just of linguists and your
ideas including as we've heard them
expressed and and marvelously
illustrated in the film they they seem
to exercise a peculiar fascination
because words are so important to us
language is so important to us to who we
are how we behave and is there a sense
in which linguist linguistics is always
going to have difficulty being quite as
precise perhaps as physics or geometry
but it still is because of the
importance of the topics it's dealing
with it still inspires great fascination
and interest well I think there's very
little doubt that as many thinkers have
pointed out over the age
Darwyn other's language is the most
striking a characteristic of human
beings the characteristic that sharply
distinguishes us from every other
organism known there is no other
organism that has anything remotely
comparable to the human capacity for
language now that's been I think
demonstrated quite dramatically in the
heroic and intriguing efforts to train
our closest relatives the higher Apes to
emulate some aspects of linguistic
behavior I think it's fair to conclude
that those have been an almost total
failure I couldn't go through some
details but and it's very likely that
this capacity which we have is a very
recent one in evolutionary time that it
developed millions of years after
separation from any other surviving
creature furthermore it's shared among
all humans there's a very strong reason
to believe that all existing humans have
essentially the same linguistic
capacities in fact cognitive capacities
generally I mean this is pathology aside
in the normal case so for example if you
take a child from a tribe and Papua New
Guinea a tribe that's been separated
from other living humans for tens of
thousands of years and if that child is
brought up say where I am right now in
Cambridge Massachusetts from infancy the
child will be indistinguishable in
linguistic and other cognitive
capacities from other children raised
here and conversely that seems to be
true across the species which means that
since humans emerged from Africa
relatively small numbers of them
maybe roughly 5060 thousand years ago
there's been essentially no evolutionary
change we're all cognitively identical
linguistically identical radically
different from other species it's hard
to find any aspect of human life in
existence as striking and said and as
this one as a distinctive feature of
humans so yes it does have a special
fascination and as far as progress in
the field is concerned it has been quite
supreme our Keable so I mentioned that I
just came from a seminar the questions
that students are working on questions
that they're asking the results that
they're finding are things that the
questions it couldn't have even been
imagined 50 years ago many of them 20
years ago those are signs of major
progress much more so than than other
disciplines that I know of outside of
the core hard sciences that's a pretty
striking fact about linguistics but
nevertheless I would still argue that it
has not yet reached its you might call
it Galilean stage that is the stage
where the sciences for the great
Galilean breakthrough I think was the
recognition that the phenomena of nature
are not the topic of our inquiry they
are data for our inquiry what we are
trying to do is to discover the
principles the hidden principles that
lie behind them of one modern physicist
great physicist and Nobel laureate once
described the essence of science as the
discovery of simple Invisibles that lie
behind the complex visibles and I think
that traces back to the galilean moment
and the history of the sciences of
course
didn't begin from de novo from nothing
but there was a real significant change
in that period I think it has led to the
modern Sciences so for example the fact
that say in modern physics the fact that
you can't yet find maybe 80% of the mass
energy in the universe does not
physicists do not conclude from that ok
let's throw everything or what the way
it's all a failure we give up but in the
social and behavioral sciences attitudes
like that are quite common
how can you constantly asked how can it
be that after you know maybe 50 years
that we still don't have a complete
grammar of any language is that totally
misconceives the problem it's even the
anything that complicated first of all
it's not even a task that's worth
pursuing what we want to pursue what we
ought to want to pursue in the galilean
style is an effort to discover the
leading principles the simple hidden
Invisibles that lie behind fundamental
properties of this extremely complex
activity that we're carrying out to give
an account of all the phenomena would be
a and first of all I mean kind of a
meaningless effort but the pointless
activity the phenomena themselves we
should understand I think are nothing
other than the data that we encourage us
and often data that we create by
experimental situations to lead us to
what the fundamental principles are so
for example Galileo was criticized by
the the funders of the day you know the
National Science Foundation of the day
namely the aristocrats for studying such
questions as what a how a ball would
roll down a frictionless plane why study
that absurd thing it doesn't exist in
nature it why not study how flowers grow
let's say or how leaves flutter in the
wind and and the he was right we should
be trying to inquire into the deep
abstract principles which we can only
find often in created environments
that's why modern science is based on
experiments a creation of artificial
environments which abstract away from
the complexities of the phenomena of the
world that's the way you get to
understand the phenomena of the world
but that conception is pretty foreign to
most disciplines outside the hard
sciences and that carries over to a
substantial extent to linguistics in
that sense I think we still have not
sufficiently made a breakthrough to what
we can call the Galilean revolution in
modern science that despite the fact
that there's tremendous progress being
made as I said the discussion that we
had in class today would have been
totally unintelligible say when I was a
student or even 20 years ago
it's statement Nome which I think could
almost provide the faces of another film
we do have some more questions but just
before turning it over to the questions
remember to the audience there's a final
question I would like to put to you
really on the political plane of the
world that we find ourselves in just at
the moment the the British Parliament
has been debating today a motion that
would approve and is likely to be
approved the bombing of Syria
sorry the bombing of Iraq excluding for
the present time Syria not including
Syria for the present time I want to ask
you about this because there's you've
devoted much of your life to arguing
taking courageous and unpopular
decisions and positions on world events
and also it's a rather extraordinary
event that we now see with the statement
of your president of Barack Obama and
and of David Cameron the British prime
minister they've changed their position
from just two months ago they seemed to
have cut something has happened I think
the shock tactics of of Isis or ISIL in
particular the result to beheading
somehow there was a perception that
things were very that there was a big
problems in the Middle East they were
beset there was the Israeli bombardment
of Gaza there was the killing of 1800
people and four or five hundred children
in Gaza I don't think there was any case
the Israeli army come babe in a barbaric
fashion but it doesn't do headings I did
somehow by doing beheading the ISIS
psychologically seems to have achieved a
breakthrough it it sort of shocked and
it it perhaps is getting it's persuading
somehow the Western governments to
behave in the way it wants to them to
bathe embarking on further rounds of
military escalation each of which has
proved in the past to be a mistake
I somehow obscurely feel that you're the
concepts you were using there in the
film of psychic continuity that somehow
to see someone beheaded I mean I think
it is a very terrible and shocking sort
of sign and that it somehow it seems to
have altered the balance of politics
there at any rate I just want to
conclude my queries to you by asking
whether you have any immediate
explanation or account of what is going
on and in the new positions of the
American government about Swedish
government well the question of the
reaction to the beheadings is a very
interesting one actually there were
beheadings quite a number of them in the
bombing recent bombing of Gaza but they
were done in the western way high-tech
attacks from a distance so if you look
at what happened and say try a district
of Gaza where the intensive bombing was
of civilian areas now people were
picking up body parts afterwards they
were trying to put together body parts
to find out who was killed and so on we
all read about that in the newspapers
but it didn't shock us the way the
beheading of an Algerian of a journalist
in Algeria did yesterday what's the
difference what's the difference and if
you look at let's say President Obama is
running the largest global terrorism
campaign
in history I'm it's a global
assassination campaign when you're
smashed to pieces by a an attack from a
drone it may turn out that their body
parts scattered around but that's not
beheading this is an assassination
campaign which is determined in the oval
office the office of the president so I
think it's by now every Tuesday morning
the high officials get together and say
who is guilty guilty has a special
meaning in the West
it means targeted for assassination
that makes it guilty so who is guilty
and we now have confirmation from high
officials that guilty means military
aged men congregating in certain places
there the Attorney General Eric Holder
just resigned yesterday's now being
praised as a great civil libertarian he
in his office explained that those who
are assassinated do receive due process
a notion that goes back to Magna Carta
eight hundred years ago you're supposed
to be received that to be tried if
you're suspected of a crime you're
supposed to be tried with due process by
a jury of your peers which reaches a
verdict and then maybe your sentence and
he was asked well does assassination in
the drone campaigns satisfy the
condition of due process and he said yes
we discussed it in the White House
carefully before King John would have
nodded an approval they would have
thought that's marvelous no we've now
abandoned the principles that he was
forced to sign and incidentally this
only arose in the case of an American
citizen who was killed for non-citizens
there what George Orwell called unpeople
they're fair game you want to smash them
to pieces
the scatter parts of their body around
with high-tech weapons so that's
perfectly okay we don't care about that
so the difference I think is essentially
what I think that's the core difference
at what Orwell mentioned people versus
unpeople were the victims versus
unworthy victims for us the victims of
our high-tech remote control a long
distance massacre operations those don't
shock us so the body parts scattered in
this fire district didn't shock us on
the other hand the weapons of the week
they do shock us because they are
supposed to be subordinate they do not
have the rights that we have put it in a
different frame if you study political
science or you know learn about the
notion of state power and so on there is
a criterion for state power the state
has a monopoly of violence in a certain
territory that's what tells you when you
have a functioning state in the post the
Burien conception well there's also a
similar conception which is not
articulated in the international domain
the International sovereign the ruler of
the world is supposed to have a monopoly
of force well who's the ruler of the
world the United States and it's the
loyal subordinate Britain they're
supposed to have a monopoly of force so
when they carry out a huge atrocities
when they radically violate
international law that's not a problem
because they are the sovereign they'll
not believe force when their victims
carry out atrocities that's a problem
they're not there that's supposed to be
the they're the unpeople they're not
allowed to carry out on a small scale
what we carry out on a major scale you
mentioned Obama's speech at the United
Nations what's interesting is what he
didn't say
he did not he spoke at the Security
Council he did not ask the Security
Council to determine that there is a
threat to peace in Iraq and to determine
that's under article 39 of the UN
Charter that is the responsibility of
the Security Council and not of the
British Parliament and not a president
of the President of the United States of
the Security Council he did not ask the
United Nations further to declare that
there is not only a threat of peace but
to authorize the use of force to deal
with this threat of peace as the United
Nations alone is entitled to do not the
United Nations but its Security Council
standing before the Security Council
Obama never occurred to him I'm sure to
ask the Security Council to pursue the
principles of international law that are
supposed to be the foundation of our own
contemporary legal order he didn't
rather he assumed that I presumed the
debate in Parliament assumed that the US
and Britain are rogue states principles
of law do not apply to them they are the
sovereigns they have the monopoly of
force and the right to use them and
therefore questions do not arise about
this the fact that in the United States
the UN Charter is in fact the supreme
law of the land under article 6 of the
Constitution but President Obama is not
criticized for violating the
constitutional requirement to observe
the supreme law of the land that
question doesn't arise we have the right
to determine if there's a threat to
peace and to decide how to act to
respond to what we call a threat to
peace that we even have the right and
this is pretty amazing when you think
about it
the first day of the bombing of Syria
was an attack on a group called Horus on
which
I heard of before and they were charged
with perhaps plotting perhaps plotting
some some time in the future to harm us
okay so therefore they can be blown away
if someone is suspected of planning to
harm us sometime in the future we're
entitled to blow them away
is that right reciprocal I'm do others
have the right to ask does Britain and
the United States are planners are they
planning might they be planning at some
future time to harm us and if we decide
they are will assassinate them I mean
that's so outlandish it you can't even
comment on it but since we take for
granted that we are the sovereigns we
are the rulers of the world we have a
monopoly on force our we are not we are
rogue states in the technical sense we
are not subject to law even our own law
or international law that's all taken
for granted and without having heard the
discussion in the British Parliament I'm
willing to wager that it was tacitly
taken for granted there - I think I hope
you could hear this warm applause to
your powerful statement I would now like
to turn and ask it Ashton could you give
us your question please you'd like to
have you got a mic hello can you hear me
hello Chomsky yes hi hi good evening all
afternoon
so can I start by just saying thank you
actually I'm a big fan of your your work
and your activism oh no I'm not allowing
in the room in that regard so yes so I'm
a local musician and the language
activists here in Jersey as a link
you may be aware that Jersey has its own
unique and centuries-old dialect of
norman-french known as Jerry eight which
is a much-loved element of our cultural
identity but is nevertheless currently
critically endangered having previously
suffered an authoritarian repression so
I'm part of the local effort to
safeguard and revitalized Jerry a I run
a folk band called Bad Levesque which
sing in Jerry a and our recordings are
used in local schools so my question is
really very simple and that is I'd like
to ask could you tell us a little bit
about your view on the value and
importance of maintaining and
revitalizing a language that is so
localized and so endangered and possibly
comment on how that might contribute to
a deeper sense of cultural identity and
help inspire why their Community Action
and positive and positive social
outcomes well the loss of a language
from a linguists point of view is of
course tragic it's like the loss of a
species for a biologist you are losing a
major source of information and
understanding but that's the least of it
there's much more so like a non
biologist should also be concerned by
the extinction of species for example we
should all be concerned about the fact
that species extinction today is
proceeding at a level beyond anything
for the last 65 million years since an
asteroid hit the earth and that caused a
massive extinction of species ended the
age of the dinosaurs gave an option for
small mammals to exist ultimately us
that we're now back to that level of
species extinction the difference is
this time we're the asteroid it's the
human impact on destruction of the
environment that is leading to this
massive extinction of species that's a
problem not just for biologists same
with the language case
a language is not just sounds that
people produce the language is a
repository of the cultural wealth of
oral traditions of the historical
consciousness of the community
solidarity a very rich system of human
existence is encapsulated in the
language and when that's lost the
language is lost all of that is lost
with it that's a serious blow to all of
us not just to technical linguists who
are losing some of the important part of
their evidence so I think there's a very
strong reason to be concerned that the a
very rapid disappearance of languages
usually this is discussed in terms of
indigenous languages tribal languages
and it's true that they are disappearing
quite rapidly but right in Europe the
languages that are disappearing very
fast one of the areas of most rapid
language disappearance in recent
generations is right in Europe there are
plenty of people in Italy for example
who can't talk to the grandmothers
because the grandmothers talk to
something which we call a dialect of
Italian but it's actually a completely
different language radically different
from conventional Italian I just
give another illustration about around
1970 a student of mine at MIT who a
linguistics student got his PhD and
linguistic worked on German and he
wanted to go to Germany just to you know
sharpen his linguistic skills after
graduation so he got himself a job and
Cologne his job was teaching at the
university he was teaching German -
German students he was teaching German
two student two German native German
students because their dialect their
version of German was
sharply different from standard German
okay that that's not true any longer but
now if you go to Cologne they're
speaking standard German those languages
have disappeared there are parts of the
United States say in Eastern Kentucky
where I've been where if I walk on the
streets I can't understand what people
are saying and at the University they
have to teach them English standard
English well their languages are
disappearing it's not a huge issue in
the english-speaking areas of the United
States United States happens to be an
extremely homogeneous society and not
for pretty reasons because the the
reason is the indigenous population was
mostly exterminated so when you
exterminate the population you end up
with something homogeneous but what
we're exterminated were huge numbers
thousands of languages cultures with all
that goes with it the richness of the
culture tradition all of that wealth of
cultural wealth and social significance
is all gone now is it worth is it
possible to recover yeah it is in fact
there's some remarkable illustrations
right here where I am my own department
at MIT a couple of years ago there was a
pretty amazing achievement by a great
linguist Ken he'll recently died
unfortunately but a marvelous person and
a wonderful linguist one of his
specialties was American Indian
languages there was a language spoken
here the language that was spoken quite
widely here before the English colonists
arrived and ultimately destroyed
everything
it was one panic was the language there
still is a whomping a tribe but nobody
spoken the language for a hundred years
it was assumed to be lost Ken Hale this
faculty member I mentioned along with
some of his students and a member of the
Wampanoag tribe Jessie little doe was
her name who came here to be a student
together they succeeded in
reconstructing the language using
comparative evidence from other
surviving languages and texts many of
the missionary texts from an earlier
period they reconstructed what is
probably a very close effect simile of
the original language the language now
has its first native speaker in a
hundred years Jessie little those
daughter who I think is now six or seven
years old and other young children are
now learning it the tribe has been
revitalized it's been an encouragement
to their solidarity of self-respect
existence recoverers traditions and so
on that contributes to cultural wealth
and diversity of a kind that had been
wiped out by I'm afraid literal
extermination to tell the truth well
that's an extreme example but it's
happening elsewhere as well as well I
mean if you happen to visit Wales about
20 years ago and I was struck by the
fact that children coming out of the
schools were talking Welsh I visited
Catalonia shortly after Franco died
Catalan the language of Catalonia had
been banned under Franco there was an
illegal language no when I was there
every all I heard was Spanish walking
the streets at the University and so on
of course people were speaking Catalan
in private but it was hidden I came back
a couple years later all I heard was
Catalan it had revived and not just the
language a lot more with it I mean I
happened to be in a hotel which was
overlooked the central square in
Barcelona this big Cathedral and square
Sunday morning looked at the hotel
window people were gathering in the
square there were musicians on the steps
of the cathedral the playing traditional
Catalan music they were folk dancing in
the square the cultural traditions had
revived it all come out of the woodwork
by now as you know it's at the point
where there's a significant pressure for
Catalonia and independence well that's
also happening in other areas I think
these are very healthy development and
it can be done cases an extreme example
but there are others to know I would now
like to ask Heather here we go on from
that independence they've got quite
appropriate question it was a Scottish
referendum there over and the majority
of the small in favour of the Union what
advice can you give to the mobilised
people who voted yes it didn't achieve
their dream of independent and do you
anticipate big changes to follow to the
UK political system as a result of the
referendum in general no it's not up to
me to give advice I should be hearing
from them what they think they ought to
do and how they're going to do it I
think there are complicated questions
that arise in connection with the
independence effort I in fact have been
asked a number of times through this
period to express a judgement and our
opinion on it and I've refrained from
doing so because I don't think it's a
trivial question I think there are
serious issues involved and I thought
thinking them through carefully and
becoming cognizant of the issues and
concerns
on many sides I think it would be
irresponsible to take a position so I
didn't but the people who are committed
to Scottish independence I think know
without my telling them exactly what
they should be doing they should be
carrying out activist programs within
their own communities
educational organizational act of other
axes appropriate to try to bring their
fellow citizens to accept the opinions
that they think are valid I not my
opinion it's not up to me whether they
are or not but that's the test for any
issue the same if you're interested in
reviving dying languages or much more
dramatically if you're interested in
ending the human scourge which is
destroying species at the rate of 65
million years ago and is marching
towards a precipice where we'll destroy
ourselves - those are the kinds of
things that you have to the only kinds
of advice that can be given the next
questioner is Bram or I think it's Brian
the optimism of the world question hello
mr. Chomsky it's a big honor to address
you I know you've been a dominant voice
in linguistics and that was most of your
film was on that area I've been
personally mostly influenced by your
your role of social commentator and
activist political activist and one of
the quotes that has always stuck with me
is your optimism of the will and
pessimism of the intellect which you've
demonstrated I think in number of
struggles you've been a part of now the
other day I read an article from your
hand and I had the feeling that the
balance was tilted slightly towards the
pessimism of the intellect I think he
was talking about
the end of human civilization climate
change was the main the main topic and
I'm always inclined to read mr. Chomsky
on current events and I was just
wondering if your perception of the
world today has been at all affected by
the state of the Arab Spring climate
change and if that balance has indeed
tilted towards the pessimism of the
intellect rather than the optimism of
the will well just to be clear ISM sure
all of you know I can't take credit for
that phrase that was a phrase that Grum
she made famous it wasn't his either it
was war along but Gramsci made it famous
I think it's a very important concept we
should have as he emphasized repeatedly
the pessimism of the intellect optimism
of the will and I think that's still
true it's true today too but you read
that article correctly I think the as
the world is proceeding right now the
balance is shifting towards pessimism of
the will that's our choice doesn't have
to could go in the other direction but
we're going to have to make a choice
there are processes underway which are
threatening the prospects of decent
survival not in the distant future for
our children and grandchildren the
unless your head is hidden in the sand I
think these should be familiar that we
are now so there was a big last Sunday
major March in New York City hundreds
thousands of people other places calling
for action on climate change the same
day one of the major international
monitoring groups produced a report
showing that global emissions of
greenhouse gases had increased to a
a new high that just the past year I
think was the year - that a 2013 by I
think 2.3 percent and in the United
States that increased by two point nine
percent reversing earlier declines
another study released the same day in
the Journal of the American Medical
Association estimated the number of
super hot days expected in New York City
that's over ninety fahrenheit in the
next thirty years said it would probably
triple worse than southern climates that
goes along with rising the sea level
other deleterious consequences
all right before us at the same time the
kind of institutional logic of state
capitalism kind of system we live in is
driving in the opposite direction so for
example Exxon Mobil the biggest energy
corporation they recently announced as
the business press put it I'm quoting
them that they are not going to change
their laser-like focus on fossil fuel
extraction because that's where the
profits are another major energy
corporation chevron did have a small
sustainable energy program which was
pretty successful it was profitable but
the profits were not at the level of
fossil fuel extraction so they therefore
abandoned it are now committing
themselves to a fossil fuel extraction
totally last time I was in England a
couple of months ago I guess at the
airport I picked up at the newspaper it
was the Daily Telegraph and there was a
big headline announcing that some laud
and past permitting fracking under the
individually owned homes without the
owner's permission all efforts to make
sure we get the last drop of
fossil fuels out of the ground when the
scientific consensus is that the
majority of those fuels may be up to 80
percent of them had better be left in
the ground if we're going to have any
hope for decent survival well that's the
direction in which we are marching like
the proverbial lemmings heading for the
cliff that's before our eyes no it's not
that nothing can be done about it
the climate change protests massive ones
on Sunday were an indication of what can
be done but it's gonna have to be done
on a significant scale directed at
really core elements of the whole
institutional logic of the societies in
which we live which are geared in many
ways towards maximization of short-term
profit no matter what the costs the
costs are externalized the corporation
you know corporations produce the energy
don't don't pay the cost
those are externalities and economists
term so you don't count them their costs
for the rest of us and for our children
and for our grandchildren and for the
children in Bangladesh who are gonna be
wiped out by the millions if the sea
level rises because it's a coastal plain
and on and on those are really serious
issues and by no means the only ones the
threat of nuclear war is ever-present no
time to go through the record now but
when you look at the history the fact
that we've survived this far is
virtually a miracle there have been near
misses so close but it's appalling to
think about them is anything being done
about this yeah President Obama recently
announced new programs to up upgrade US
nuclear forces more rapidly than has
been done since the early Reagan years
I think trillion dollars in the next 30
years that's what's being done
England the same other countries the
same I mean we are this is the first
time in human history that we really
face a choice as to whether to survive
or not it's not just the survive the
destruction of species at the rate of 65
million years ago
we're coming next and if you look around
the world there is opposition in fact
kind of ironically the leading
opposition to this the cutting edge of
it is the indigenous societies around
the world the tribal societies the First
Nations in Canada the aboriginals and
Australia the tribal people in India
that it's a dramatic in South America
where they unlike North America where
the English colonists came in South
America much of the indigenous
population was not exterminated it still
exists in Bolivia there's an indigenous
majority and they have actually put into
the the basic constitutional structure
provisions for rights of nature which
are rights that have to be preserved in
accordance with traditional cultures
quite apart from our right to have more
commodities and our button in our homes
Ecuador another country with large
indigenous population under their
pressure
it's an oil-producing country did offer
to keep its oil in the ground where it
ought to be had a huge cost to them if
the European countries the rich
countries would fund a small fraction of
the loss that they incur by not lifting
oil well the rich country is refused oh
so now they're lifting oil things like
this are happening around the world when
you look at them you can see reasons for
optimism flickers of light but pessimism
of the will is hard to avoid when you
look at how at the choices we are making
not other people we are making and are
continuing to make in the face of a very
severe threat to decent survival I'm
sorry but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
leave I have another interview waiting
for me right now
well all I can say now is you've spoken
to us wonderfully and a considerable
length they were we're very grateful to
you giving up time to come and speak to
us and I think we all found the
interview as well as the film very
stimulating so thank you very much and
[Applause]
Andrew so one second guys please just
before we leave I have a couple
announcements here mark shot at 9 p.m.
