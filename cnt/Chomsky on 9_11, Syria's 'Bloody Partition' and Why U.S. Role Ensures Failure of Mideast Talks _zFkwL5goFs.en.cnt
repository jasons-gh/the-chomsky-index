the war and peace report I'm Amy Goodman
with nermeen Shaikh our guests for the
hour is Professor Noam Chomsky in 2007
Noam democracy now interviewed General
Wesley Clark the retired four-star
general who is the supreme Allied
commander of NATO during the Kosovo war
general Clarke described how an unnamed
Pentagon official just after the
September 11th attacks talked about a
memo that said the u.s. plan to take out
seven countries in five years including
Syria about ten days after 9/11 I went
through the Pentagon and I saw secretary
Rumsfeld and in deputy secretary
Wolfowitz I went downstairs just say
hello to some of the people on the Joint
Staff who would used to used to work for
me and one of the generals called me and
he said sir you gotta come in you got to
come in and talk to me a second I said
well you're too busy he said no no he
says we've made the decision we're going
to war with Iraq this was on or about
the 20th of September I said we're going
to war with Iraq why he said I don't
know he said I guess they don't know
what else to do so I said well did they
find some information collect connecting
Saddam to al-qaeda and he said no no he
says there's nothing new that way they
just made the decision to go to war with
Iraq he said I guess it's like we don't
know what to do about terrorists but
we've got a good military and we can
take down governments and he said I
guess if the only tool you have is a
Hammer Every Problem has to look like a
nail so I came back to see him a few
weeks later and by that time we were
bombing in Afghanistan I said are we
still going to war with Iraq and he said
oh it's worse than that
he said he reached over on his desk he
picked up a piece of paper he said I
just he said I just got this down from
upstairs meeting the secretary defense
office today and he said this is a memo
that describes how we're going to take
out seven countries in five years
starting with Iraq and then Syria
Lebanon Libya Somalia Sudan and
finishing off Iran I said is it
classified he said yes sir
I said well don't show it to me
and I saw him a year or so ago and I
said you remember that he said so I
didn't show you that memo I didn't show
it to you
that was General Wesley Clark I was
interviewing him at the 92nd Street Y
here in New York in 2007 professor Noam
Chomsky if you could respond well I
think that's it's it's quite plausible
the the Bush administration veered
slightly not far but slightly from the
general pattern actually the goal of US
policy for decades has been to control
and dominate those countries but the
Bush administration was more extreme
they thought they could actually just as
they put it take her out and forcefully
impose a run of regimes not that that
would be anything new there's a long
list of similar cases going back to Iran
in 1953 Guatemala in 1954 there was a
assault against major assault against
Indonesia in 1958 and effort to strip
away the outer islands where the
resources are and because they were
concerned about too much independence
and Indonesia that failed fasion of Cuba
failed the murder of Lumumba which the
US was involved in the Congo destroyed
Africa's major hope for development
Congo is now total Horror Story for
years the u.s. supported them about
their dictatorship and now it's maybe
the worst place in the world and on
right through case after case this is
standard US policy the Bush
administration went beyond but they were
a more extreme in their goals and their
actions and they had to pull back
because that was just beyond us capacity
of Iraq the Iraq war was a very serious
defeat for the United States unlike the
Vietnam War in the case of Indochina
it's called a defeat but that only means
that the u.s. did not achieve its
maximal objectives it did achieve its
major objectives as McGeorge Bundy well
understood it had prevented a Vietnam
from moving on a path of independent
development which might have had this
contagious effect that Kissinger was
concerned with as it was put at the time
the one rotten apple may spoil the
barrel meaning just what Arthur
Schlesinger and other said if you allow
independent of taking matters into your
own hand and one place and it works
others will try to emulate it system
will erode a standard principle for
systems of power the godfather of the
Mafia understands it perfectly well in
the Mafia system if some small
storekeeper decides not to play pay
protection money that the money may not
mean anything to the Godfather but he's
not gonna let him get away with it and
in fact he's not just going to go in and
send his goons to get the money he's
also going to beat him to a pulp because
others have to understand that
disobedience is not tolerated in
international affairs that's called
credibility the bombing of Kosovo Wesley
Clark's bombings Kosovo was the same
after other their work pretext that they
collapsed and the final one as Tony
Blair and George Bush said was we have
to maintain the credibility of NATO NATO
had issued edicts and we must ensure the
they're obeyed and NATO of course does
not be in Norway it means the United
States if I could interrupt for a minute
to ask you about your reflections on
this anniversary of the September 11th
2001 attacks here in the United States
your reflections on this anniversary and
also how it relates to Syria and the
Middle East and what needs to be done
now I will respond to that though I own
view is that we should be concentrating
on the first 9/11 the one in Chile which
was a much worse attack by any dimension
but the one here was very significant
was a major terrorist act thousands of
people killed it's the first time since
the war of 1812 that US territory had
been attacked the United States has had
remarkable security and this therefore
was a inside for the etre Harville
atrocity a very significant historical
event then I changed attitudes and
policies in the United States that are
quite considerably in reaction to this
the government was able to ram through
the laws patriot act and others that
sharply constrained civil liberties it
was able to provide pretexts for
invasion of Afghanistan invasion of Iraq
destruction of Iraq consequences of
spread through the region
and it provides a it's the basis for
Obama's a massive terrorist war the
drone war is the most extreme terrorist
campaign that's underway no maybe the
most extreme in history and the
justification for it is the same the
second 9/11 9/11 2001
so yes it's had enormous effects on the
society
on the attitudes on policies many
victims throughout the world can testify
to that how do you see the situation in
Syria being resolved and now can you tie
it in to the larger Middle East crisis
talk about Israel Palestine talk about
the u.s. relationship with Iran and
relationship with Saudi Arabia well this
year Syria right now is plunging into
suicide if the negotiations options that
October he me and Russia and others have
been pressing if that doesn't work a
Syria is moving towards a kind of very
bloody partition it's likely that the
Kurdish areas which already are semi
independent will move towards further
independence probably linked up with the
Iraqi Kurdistan adjacent to them maybe
make some arrangements of Turkey those
are already in process and the rest of
Syria what remains will be divided
between a bloody murderous Assad regime
and a collection of rebel groups of
varying times ranging from secular
Democratic to murderous brutal
terrorists that looks like the outcome
for Syria there is another part of Syria
which is not talked about it's occupied
by Israel and annexed by Israel that's
the Golan Heights annexed in violation
of explicit Security Council orders not
to an exit their credibility doesn't
matter because Israel's Anela so that's
another part of Syria that brings us to
Israel Palestine now just a couple of
days ago secretary Kerry Secretary of
State Kerry appealed to the European
Union to continue to support illegal
Israeli settlement projects in the West
Bank wasn't put in those words but the
way it was put is that Europe had taken
the quite appropriate step of trying to
draw back from support for Israeli
operations in the illegal settlements
incidentally that the settlements are
illegal is not even in question that's
been determined by the highest
authorities the Security Council that of
the United Nations the International
Court of Justice in fact up until the
Reagan administration of the u.s. also
called them illegal
Reagan changed that to an obstacle to
peace and Obama has weakened it still
further - not helpful to peace but the
u.s. is virtually alone in this the rest
of the world that accepts the judgment
of the Security Council of the
International Court of Justice that the
settlements are illegal not just the
expansion of the settlement but the
settlements themselves and Europe had
pulled back from support for the
settlements and Kerry called on Europe
not to do that because pretext was that
this would interfere with the so-called
peace negotiations that he's set up
which are a total farce I mean the peace
negotiations are carried out under
preconditions u.s. imposed preconditions
which virtually guarantee failure there
are two basic preconditions we have in
seconds or we have 15 seconds okay one
precondition is that the US run them the
u.s. is a participant not neutral the
other is that Israeli expansion of
settlements must continue no these
negotiations can continue under those
conditions well no we want to thank you
very much for being with us spending the
hour with us Noam Chomsky world renowned
