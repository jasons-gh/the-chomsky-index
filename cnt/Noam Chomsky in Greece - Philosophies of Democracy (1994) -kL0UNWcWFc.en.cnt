if a person works on order let's say a
craftsman produces something on orders
or under coercion we may admire what he
does but we despise what he is because
he's a machine and we want people to be
human
you find exactly the same thing in Adam
Smith incidentally one of the reasons
Adam Smith was very critical of division
of labor I mean he has an O division of
labor at the beginning of wealth and
they of Nations would have he go on it
criticizes at the end and he criticizes
because he says if we let division of
labor continue we will reduce people to
creatures as stupid and as ignorant as
it's possible for a creature to be
because they'll simply be carrying out
mechanical operations under command and
a very limited domain and what you are
you know your intelligence your
understanding your your human
characteristics come from your capacity
or from the options available to you to
carry out independent productive
creative activities work included maybe
in free association with others because
we're social beings but not under
external coercion and then he said any
civilized societies gonna have to
prevent this from happening
[Music]
in the 18th century and the sort of in
the Enlightenment and the period of
early modern libertarian revolutions
people like for example Vilhelm Flynn
Humboldt and Rousseau thought about the
exactly these questions they were both
they both understood in some sense it
was hard to formulate it clearly and
coherently at the time but they both
grasped the idea that languages are
basically infinite that their
expressions of human creativity in fact
that's a leading Cartesian idea which
came to them right through the
rationalist and romantic traditions and
they were also both interested deeply
interested in human liberation and they
did in fact try to connect these things
pretty much the way suggests by
suggesting that it at some core level
the part of human nature is a which is
reflected on the cognitive side in
things like language is the capacity to
produce and understand and articulate
and express new thoughts without limit
and without control so the crucial fact
about language use is that it's not
determined by our situation it's coming
out of us as freely willed action in
some sense and continually novel and so
on
and to express thoughts and ideas that
are new to oneself and other people but
that are intelligible and appropriate
and so on this is a core aspect of human
nature in fact for the Cartesians it was
the the mark of mind it was the point at
which the specific point at which mine
draper at the core of human nature again
was a kind word later called it by the
coda an instinct for freedom that is a
need to become involved in free creative
activity free creative work so for say
Humboldt that one's work is sort of the
core of one's existence you want to be
involved in creative honest work in
association with others but voluntary
Association and not under external
control these things have mostly been
forgotten so the as the market systems
of the 19th century developed they
eliminated all of this they would have
appalled Adam Smith no doubt you know
the the market systems that developed
because they when you get the people I
say Malthus and Ricardo and so on the
conception of human beings as freely
creative active people with intrinsic
rights due to their nature disappears
and people become nothing more they have
no values other than a value of and what
they can sell on the market their labor
power if you can't sell your labor power
in the market you have no right to live
this way it was discussed because
there's nothing to a human being other
than what can be attained by sale of
labor power within a market system under
what become basically totalitarian
structures corporate structures and so
on so the modern extensions of classical
liberalism are very anti libertarian and
these I'd even the ideologies change and
you know the intellectuals change and so
on so this tradition has pretty much
been well if not wiped out at least
marginalized but it's there and it
certainly can be revived it stayed alive
and for example in the anarchist
tradition and in parts of the
libertarian left in the United States
you find traces of it as late as real
traces as late as people like John Dewey
who probably didn't know any of these
things but just came out of it from
another source and you know
reached the same point in his conception
of democracy is a value because it opens
the opportunities for people to freely
liberate themselves as they must do and
it's their sort of core innocence in the
contemporary world you'd be hard put to
find much discussion if it's
unfortunately but I think it should be
revived I think is very significant
mmm that's an interesting question
actually I mean Marx himself was complex
figure the early Marx so you read the
philosophical and manuscripts and so on
do you know this is coming straight out
of the French French and German
Romanticism so the kinds of ideas you
find expressed in Humboldt and in the
more libertarian side of Rousseau
Rousseau himself was very split but if
you take the libertarian as part of
Rousseau the second discourse on
inequality and home bold and so on all
of this was that's the background that
which Marx grew up and if you read the
philosophical and kind of manuscripts of
the early period they're immersed in
this so his theory of alienation comes
out of this work the coerced labor is
alienating and counter to human nature
precisely for these reasons for the
Humboldt E and reasons when you get to
the later Marx you know it's not it's I
mean it's sort of like a scholarly
debate about whether he changed his mind
or just started talking about other
things but anyway you don't find it any
longer and by that time Marx Marxism
does become exactly as you say very
detrimental to this so you get this idea
what you you do find in Marx but he
couldn't have believed that human nature
is just a historical product and people
are just malleable they're made what
their culture turns them into you get
this even people like Gramsci who was
one of the more libertarian Marxist but
this idea that humans are simply formed
by the environment and they are nothing
but clay you know passive clay in the
hands of their molders that's an idea
which is very attractive to radical
intellectuals because they think they're
going to be the molders of course and
that leads right to the Leninist version
of Marxism and it does become a kind of
orthodoxy and the earlier views of are
either forgotten or marginalized
although they're certainly there in Marx
and they certainly are in the tradition
that he came from exactly you know I'm
in the in the Marxists and the
behaviorists are right in the same
ballpark these kinds of Marx's the in
fact it's I think it's a tragedy and a
catastrophe that the left has been has
accepted the idea of humans as
historical products simply reflections
of their environment because what
follows from that of course is that
there's no moral barrier to molding them
any way you like I mean if humans have
no inner nature they don't have an inner
instinct for freedom you know if it's
not fundamental to their nature to have
free creative productive work under
their own control if that's not part of
their nature then why
there's no Advent there's no moral
reason for allowing them that space you
could just mold them into being what you
think they ought to be and you can be
the Central Committee or you could be
the you know the the managers of the
corporation or directors of the fascist
state or whatever and it's quite
interesting that the intellectual the
modern intellectuals have mostly moved
in one or the other of those directions
overwhelmingly either there and in fact
this was foretold in one of the maybe
that only prediction of the Social
Sciences that ever came so dramatically
true was bakunin discussion of this in
the late in the late 19th century he was
arguing with Marx and it's well before
Leninism but he predicted very
perceptively that the rising class of
intellectuals are just kind of becoming
identified as a class and modern modern
industrial societies he predicted that
they were essentially going to go in one
of two directions there would be some
who would believe that the struggles of
the working class would offer them an
opportunity to rise and take state power
in their own hands and at that point he
said they would become the red
bureaucracy who would create the worst
tyranny that humanity has ever known of
course all in the interests of the
workers that's one direction and he said
the others would recognize that you're
never going to get power that way and
the way to get power is to associate
yourself with what we would nowadays
call state capitalism and just become
the servants of its ruling class and
then you become the managers and the
ideologues and so on for the state
capitalist system and as he put it those
people will beat the people with the
people's stick in other words they'll
talk about democracy but they'll really
be beating people with the stick of
democracy which they'll turn into a
mechanism of coercion
there's some who think you can get power
by by exploiting popular struggles and
there are others who've seen that you
gonna get power by just associating
yourself with the people already have
economic power and that's largely
dominate and I think that was a very
accurate description of the century that
followed him on the one his fifty years
before the Bolshevik Revolution but he
predicted its form very precisely and
also its ideological background and he
also predicted quite accurately what
happens in the modern state capitalist
industrial societies and looking at it
now from the retrospective a hundred
years we can see I think we can see this
development very clearly and it also
explains an odd fact about 20th century
intellectual life namely how easy it's
been for people to shift from one
position to another so the same person
who's a Stalinist apologist one year is
a super American patriot you know the
next year is supporting every atrocity
and working and working in the Hoover
Institute and you know associated with
most reactionary institutions that
transition which sometimes is called the
God that failed change which was sort of
authentic in the early years like people
like Salone and others you know there
was something ascent authentic about it
became a joke I mean it's because when
people within the in fact we're seeing
in Russia right now the the worst
connoisseurs are now the ones who are
most passionate about the you know the
free market and investing and enriching
yourself and so on that they've made the
transition very easily and that goes way
back and I think the reason is there's
no transition it's just a different
estimate as to where power lies but the
same ideology the ideology is you beat
the people with the people stick and
we're going to do it and in fact if you
look at modern acket democratic theory
in the West it's remarkably similar to
this it's remarkably Leninist in its
character
if you think of modern democrat the
leading tendencies in the modern
democratic theory in the west so in in
academic world it would be the strands
of political science that developed from
the thinking of people like Harold
Lasswell and others one of the founders
of modern contemporary political science
and in the general sphere the Wilsonian
intellectuals the so-called progressive
intellectuals of whom maybe walter
Lippmann was the most striking example
in the United States progressive
intellectual in the 1920s
if who do all of these people develop
theories of democracy and they're quite
interesting the very Leninist and their
character the conception is that in a
democracy there's two classes of
citizens there's the general public who
Lippmann calls ignorant and meddlesome
outsiders and Lasswell says they're too
stupid too we should not be overcome by
dogmatism about the common man who's too
stupid to be able to do anything that's
the standard view so there's these
people the ignorant and meddlesome
Outsiders which is maybe 90% of the
population and then there are the
responsible men the wise men you know
the smart people the people with
integrity and honor the intellectual
aristocracy whatever you call them and
they have to rule they're the ones who
make the decisions who do the thinking
and so on and the role of the masses the
ignorant and meddlesome Outsiders is
just to show up every couple of years
decide which of the smart guys is going
to be their leader and then go home
they have nothing more to do that's a
democracy and then you have variation
there's the way Lippmann put it the
general public are to be spectators not
participants their only participation is
lending their weight to one or another
representative of the dominant class and
then going home that's an election and
the spectrum extends from about there
that's the liberal side over to the more
reactionary side where you get people
like say Reaganites people call
themselves conservatives though any
authentic
conserve it it would be appalled by
their positions they're really status to
reactionaries and their view rate the
Reaganites were very striking in this
respect their view is that the people
shouldn't even be spectators because
it's none of their business what the
state is doing
[Music]
so in the period when the right-wing
takes over the Reagan years what they
tried it was closed off state power so
you can't even see it that's why they
instituted unprecedented censorship and
it's why they carry out clandestine
operations clandestine operations which
they love are not a secret from anybody
except the population at home so for
example say during the Greek Civil War
in the late 1940s it was no secret to
the Greeks they could see what was
happening but it was a secret here
because it was clandestine that the US
was involved in major atrocities in fact
and it's the same right through the
eighties so the idea is we have to the
state has to be so powerful and so
private that the ignorant Outsiders
can't even see what's going on now if
you look at the modern world this is
happening a very dramatic way so one of
the major things that's happening now is
the transfer of real power away from
parliamentary institutions and towards a
transnational system of private power
transnational corporations and their own
institutions like the IMF and GATT and
the World Trade Organization and the
World Bank and the executive meetings of
the g7 you know the seven rich countries
that's a system of decision-making which
is completely separate from public from
the public public has no idea what's
going on there's almost no way of
figuring out what's happening in the
GATT council I mean I doubt if there's
one American Indian who knows what was
decided in the last and the in what's in
the GATT treaty you have to be a
specialist you know who goes and knows
how to go to specialized documents even
he had a picture of in a lot of it you
can't even find because it really is
secret well that's the in effect
transnational corporations themselves or
you know almost the you know the
unimaginable attack on democracy would
have actually appalled someone like Adam
Smith or Thomas Jefferson because they
are totalitarian institutions completely
absolutist absolutely unaccountable
public has nothing's
about them internally they're completely
hierarchic they're kind of like the
economic equivalent of super fascism and
they kept they're also undermining free
trade it's called trade but it's a joke
so it's it's much of the world is moving
in this direction that's a major attack
on democracy the use of terror is the
same takes a el salvador just had
elections no it's quite interesting to
see the background for those elections
in the 1970s there was there were the
beginnings of the possibilities of
democracy in Central America
there were organizations developing a
lot of them coming out of the church
you know peasant organizations of Bible
study groups that became self-help
groups unions and so on alright that's
the basis for popular participation in
controlling your own life what did it
lead to well it led to a decade of
incredible terror torture massacres
mutilation starvation economic
strangulation just a violent reaction in
which people were traumatized and now
they're allowed to have elections as
they just did because it is because it's
been driven into their heads that if
they get out of line they're gonna get
in real trouble now here people pretend
at least not to see it but El Salvador
they see it like the Jesuits in El
Salvador just at a conference before the
election in which they pointed out quite
in reviewing the situation of Central
America which is just devastated they
said that there's two aspects of terror
that you have to think about one is the
narrow aspect that's the low level of
terror that always continues like an
occasional political assassination and
so on which is just there to make people
understand don't forget we're here you
know we may not be doing a lot but we're
here that's the narrow kind of terror
then they say this the deeper kind of
terror the kind that's taken place for a
long period and that the mist
kate's people it gets them to
internalize the understanding that they
that there are very narrow limits to
what they can do and if they try to go
beyond those limits they're going to be
in very serious trouble their children
will be murdered and their wives will be
raped then they'll be killed and so on
once that becomes part of people's
psyches and they're domesticated as they
put it then you can have the powerful
can run free elections with no concern
at all because people have understood
that there are no options and that's
what's happening as much of the much of
the world not been up in the third world
in the richer countries other things are
happening which have parallel aspects
and it's all a major attack on the
libertarian tradition which we can trace
to the 18th century the range of even
articulate discussion is narrowing as
control becomes more and more
centralized a privatization increases
this because it puts power in the hands
of absolutely unaccountable corporate
structures pure eminent you know Public
Television let's say can be as
Democratic as the society is most
societies means not very democratic but
at least there's a some of the some
relation to the public and public radio
and television private radio on
television is Europe you have as much
relation to it as you have the General
Motors it does what it wants and it's an
its granted the right to do that
and the more business runs societies
have moved in this direction faster like
take the United States it's a very free
country in the sense that the government
can't coerce people to the extent that
they can elsewhere on the other hand
it's a business run society kind of a
one class Society you know this violent
class war going on but completely
one-sided very self-conscious business
community and nothing much else when
television came along there wasn't even
a discussion just became totally
privatized this so-called public
television which came much later but
it's very marginal and even that's
largely private and with this new the
new what they call information
you know this new technology of
interactive computers and video and so
on there is an argument going on now but
we all know how it's going to turn out
private power is so overwhelming as
compared with public organization that
it will be privatized and it will be
nothing more than another technique of
coercion of selling people things a lot
of controlling them and so on it's kind
of interesting to look at the debate
that's going on right now over this this
is a major issue right now there's all
this new technology and it's the next
step after a radio and television now
we're in this and if you look at the
debate it's very enlightening they're
talking about how democratizing it is
and how wonderful it's going to be and
then when you look at the examples turns
out the examples are given our primarily
home marketing meaning you can sit in
front of your television set and you'll
see things for sale and you know a nice
young women advertising and then you can
just push a couple of buttons and
somebody will mail it to your house
that's called interactive that's real
participation in control of your life
and the other thing the only other thing
I've seen mentioned is that in football
games you know like Super Bowl and so on
where everybody's supposed to be glued
than them and watching them because
you're not supposed to think about any
important thing that might matter you
have to be a passive spectator so
everybody in the country or at least all
the men are watching the Super Bowl and
since this is now an interactive system
they're going to they're going to try to
set up something in which they're going
to be able to punch in the play that
they think the quarterback oughta call
next you know so here you are and
they're all standing there and the
quarterback is gonna make a decision and
you're allowed to punch you and what you
think you ought to do quit he doesn't
hear you you don't have any influence
even on that you don't have any
influence it's just that you're allowed
to express your opinion and then you
know after the quarterback does
something the commentator will say what
here's what 90% of the people thought or
something well that's the kind of
interaction that they want they wanted
they want they make people feel that
that's interaction that's participation
and this is very revealing
I'm the idea or maybe you can express
your
that's somebody'll ask a question you
know do you want healthcare and you'll
be able to push buttons I want it but
nothing that involves actual
participation in making decisions or
forming plans or organizing with people
these are very atomizing technologies
you're alone you don't talk to anybody
and that most you can individually
express your view to unaccountable power
corporate and state power and that's
what's considered democracy so the the
monopolization of the the print media is
simply another aspect of it same with
publishing publishing is becoming very
much narrowed in all sorts of ways and
purchased through market pressures so
for example if you travel around the
United States now then take a look at a
city you barely find a bookstore and it
used to be they were bookstores well it
takes a Cambridge where we are no
University towns there were bookstores
all over the place not much anymore
there's still a few around the colleges
actually around MIT there's nothing but
around Harvard the other big University
there's a few but not much nothing like
what it was 20 or 30 years and see when
I came here in the 1940s it's totally
different this bookstore in every corner
now you have a few big chains who can
sell they'll sell mostly bestsellers
because they they want mass production
so they'll sell things cheap you know
and virtually nothing else it's not
worth it to them economically to have
books around the only a few people will
be interested in it doesn't pay like
having a brand of shoes that only a few
people want to buy so what you do is you
the change which are all over the
country they of course can undercut the
the book stores that have some you know
that do that that have intellectual
interests or something focused or
whatever because they can sell the know
they can sell the bestsellers much
cheaper so they'll undercut everyone
else just like you know just like
supermarkets and they're they themselves
are only interested in mass-produced
items and that's having a big effect on
literary production for example the
right of first novel now
is extremely hard you don't have any
more book stores which are willing to
sell a small number of copies of a first
novel and get people known and so on
what the bookstores want is something
that will sell a million copies and if a
book if it's clear within a couple of
weeks that a book isn't going to sell a
million copies might just well be pulped
you know cut it up and make scrap paper
out of it
at you look at it take a look at next
time you're in Airport at the newsstand
all there is is very cheap bestsellers
and this is true in much of Europe too
I've noticed the magazines the
newspapers the books and so on are the
level is declining in part simply
through market pressures and that has a
very narrowing effect on thought in
general it it gets people to it's like
this domestication through terror it
narrows horizons and it's functional in
that respect it drives the population to
being at most spectators and probably
not even spectators just out of the
system altogether as power gets removed
even more remotely from accountable
institutions like Parliament's and
that's very much the tendency in the
modern world in fact probably
accelerated the same as always I mean it
begins with I'm trying to understand
what's happening and helping others to
understand understanding is a collective
activity people don't do it alone you do
it in groups whether it's the sciences
or political life you work together with
people that's how you clarify your ideas
and you learn things and so on so the
beginning is understanding the next
things organization the next is all
kinds of action I mean the power isn't a
tent has always been recognized even by
the most reactionary people but the
general population have the power fact
you go back to say David Hume very
conservative this his principles of
government begin by but he kind of like
a paradox how come that the many are
willing to be governed by the few they
don't have
to be they could take power themselves
he says even in the most autocratic
system the general population always has
the power to take over if they want so
how come they submit themselves his
answer is well propagate what we would
call propaganda control of opinion says
the rulers have to control opinion and
unless they control opinion people will
rise up and take things over for
themselves and there's a lot of truth to
that I think he sort of underestimated
the use of violence but there's a lot of
truth to that and in our society it's
the more free societies it really is
opinion more than force that's
controlling people and we have to break
out of that we have to break out of the
ideological strictures that prevent
people from seeing things and then there
are many opportunities for organizing in
action and they've been pretty
successful
so I've been talking about the ugly side
of things but there's another side which
is quite contrary here I can talk best
about the United States but I think it's
worldwide if the United States in the
last 30 years
there has been a tremendous cultural
change the culture is much more free and
open and libertarian than it was 30
years ago in many respects so major
issues that didn't even exist 30 years
ago are now common coin issues of say
women's rights or civil rights for my
respect for other cultures let's say
environmental issues solidarity with the
poor with third world countries all of
these are at levels way beyond what they
ever work and that's another aspect of
the civilizing effect of the popular
movements and this has had a major
impact on policy on everything else it
hasn't yet reached to the central
institutions of power but there are more
and more people concerned about it and
even in the last months this has changed
so for example for the first time in its
modern history the American labor
movement is now recognizing that it must
be committed to international solidarity
first time American labor unions are now
supporting Mexican workers never
happened before in fact American
librarians were helping create the
conditions of oppression for workers in
the third world it's finally gotten home
to them that they can't do this if they
do this they're gonna simply destroy
themselves
and besides it's inhuman beginning to
understand what they're in fact doing
and you know people are not gangsters if
they see what's going on and I'm going
to like it and you have the first signs
of things like say protecting American
Mexican workers or Haitian workers and
others who are trying to organize and
survive under repressive and brutal
societies and perfect societies in which
American corporations are dominant well
that's something really quite new no you
know it's too small a scale to affect
the centralization of power
in Brussels and Geneva and the zurich in
new york you know but it's the beginning
and it's a major change over past years
and it just has to expand if it doesn't
we're in bad trouble as the economy is
becoming more globalized the third-world
model is becoming globalized there's a
third world model you go to any third
world country there's a small sector you
know 10% maybe of great wealth and
privilege often super wealth and
privilege then there's huge massive
population or basically superfluous and
they live in misery and starvation and
they're controlled by terror one or
another way and that's spreading to the
first world if you walk around New York
or Boston you see it England and the
United States are in the lead in this
that's Thatcher and Reagan basically but
continental Europe is not that far
behind and as the economy becomes
globalized it's forced so if it's
getting to the point now where German
corporations are shifting production to
the United States because they get
cheaper and more oppressed labor in the
United States the richest country in the
world u.s. wages are now 60% lower than
Germany and even 20 percent lower than
Italy that's the effect of this well
that's what happens in these business
run in societies England's kind of like
it but all of these are weapons against
West European workers the same is true
the end of the cold war the end of the
cold war basically drives Eastern Europe
back to what it traditionally was
third-world in fact in my opinion that's
what the Cold War was about it was to
try to stop this attempt at independence
in one part of the third world which
never is acceptable the Greek Civil War
so the back was very similar back in the
40s when you look back at it the same
with the fascist period you want to make
sure that third-world people in fact
Greece was regarded as third-world at
the time do not move towards
independence they become assimilated and
subordinated to the mm-hmm you know at
the centric to the power of the wealthy
Eastern Europe went that way its Eastern
Europe has not grenaded you
get rid of it in a weekend so took 70
years but they're now back in the third
world for the most part not entirely but
you know much of it is back in the third
world they're providing destruct
structurally their third world they're
providing resources and cheap labor and
investment opportunities and markets
like everywhere in the third world
there's a wealthy sector to a large
extent the old Communist Party who have
just recognized the better off of the
shift in the other direction but they're
still in power and this is a weapon
against Western European workers
daimler-benz and Volkswagen and General
Motors say can shift production to wet
to Eastern Europe where they can get
workers a fraction of the cost of
Westerner workers with no benefits and
protect they insist on protectionism
because these people don't believe in
the free market so when they move to
Eastern Europe they insist on tariff
protection high tariff protection and
other sorts of state intervention for
their benefit but they can use this as a
weapon against their own working class
it's very self conscious if you read the
business press it's open
Financial Times of London Businessweek
and so on they talk about how wonderful
this is because now you can undercut the
luxurious lifestyle of the pampered
Western European workers you know here
there were all these people who thought
they had a right to a job let's say
where they had a right to a week's
vacation or something well that's Pam
this is people have to understand that
they don't have this right and we have
to eliminate those rights and turn them
into tools of production back to the
1820s you know who sell their power on
the market and there's no further right
to life so this is having a polarizing
effect throughout the world the try
every trade agreement is like that NAFTA
GATT it's at its intention and its
result will be to polarize leading to
exactly what you described and a
basically third-world model so that's
happening that's happening in the
centralization of power and the attack
on democracy is happening but the
ferment among the general populations is
also happening they're all happening at
the same time and the question is which
of these forces will be more
significantly the drug war is being used
primarily for that purpose the primary
reason for criminalizing drugs is so
that you can have a weapon over poor
people because you can move in you know
any like a fascist state will always set
up a system of laws so oppressive that
you're always violating the law and then
if they want you they can get you that's
an efficient totalitarian state and we
you know this isn't fascist it's not the
tellurian but they're moving in the same
direction so I think about a quarter of
the prison population as people who are
picked up with a you know and in Chile
to marijuana in their pocket they're not
doing anything you know and that's
that's a way of controlling people plus
the fact that the criminalization of
drugs stimulates criminal gangs which
themselves control people it's a good
technique of control is to have criminal
gangs running through the ghettos that
scares everybody and controls them all
of these are techniques have controlled
reminiscent of what goes on in the third
world like in El Salvador these in that
death squads
here you do it a little differently but
the structural consequences are quite
similar and it's very reminiscent of
early Industrial Revolution and I think
it's going to lead in the same
directions towards popular organization
and either some accommodation or maybe a
real change in structure of power but I
think these are unpredictable you can
see the tendencies but you don't know
how they're going to balance
