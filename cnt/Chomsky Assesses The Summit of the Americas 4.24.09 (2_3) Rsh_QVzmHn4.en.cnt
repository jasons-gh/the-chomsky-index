you after some failure public commentary
is overcast silly the domino theory is I
mean they didn't invade us but that's
missing the point because there's an
internal version of the domino theory
which is just what Schlesinger said
sometimes called the threat of a good
example if something works out somewhere
others will try to follow it that Henry
Kissinger put it nicely with regard to
IND he said in Chile he said and is a
virus who could spread contagion as far
as southern Europe where what's called
Europe communism kind of social
democracy might take my end a success as
a demonstration that you can achieve
large-scale social reform through
parliamentary means I want that so what
do you for Kennedy was particularly
striking because it was the same
reasoning with regard to South via to
Vietnam same time planners were afraid
that independent development in Vietnam
would be a virus that would spread
contagion via a rotten apple that would
spoil the barrels was put internally and
what that means is the same thing as in
Cuba successful internal development
might be a model that others with
similar problems would want to pursue
and it's striking that both in the case
of Cuba and in the case of Vietnam
exactly the same fault policies were
followed despite the differences in
circumstances and it follows directly
from the standard characterization as
maybe the spreading democracy it has to
do with a virus though spread contagion
you have a virus little spread contagion
you know what to do destroy the virus
and immunize those are in danger of
being
affected by the virus and that was done
in Cuba and it was done in South Vietnam
in Cuba first the Bay of Pigs and the
Mongoose terror operations which were
pretty serious then when they didn't
work and the Missile Crisis made people
rethink because the world's going to
blow up turn to economic strangulation
to punish the population so first you
attack the virus we're still doing that
and then you immunize the surrounding
area and that was done by installing
vicious brutal neo-nazi national
security states in one country after
another started with Brazil the most
important country where the Kennedy
administration planned a military coup
happened to take place shortly after the
assassination but it was in the works
did install the first of these national
security states which crushed opposition
tortured and so on and so forth so that
protected Brazil and then the run
through it but it ran through the whole
continent 1980s Central America
it's those of it to the insane Vietnam I
mean in fact in my view my friends don't
agree but in my view the u.s. basically
won the war by late 60s it was very
clear that Vietnam was never going to be
a model for anyone if it if it even
survived and the surrounding areas were
insulated brutal dictatorships and posed
in one country after another the most
important because it's the richest
country with lots of resources was
Indonesia and Indonesia in 1965 there
was a military coup so hard those
military coup which killed hundreds of
thousands of people mostly landless
peasants destroyed any possible
opposition instituted a vicious
dictatorship and opened the country up
the Western exploitation so Indonesia
was saved in fact liberal colonists the
New York Times described that as a
a gleaming light in Asia sign of hope no
shoot but they they knew it was going on
is it staggering mass slaughter first
sign of hope in Asia and a later
McGeorge Bundy who national security
advisor for Kennedy and Johnson in
retrospect and who in guided the
programs in both Vietnam and Cuba he did
he said in retrospect we probably should
have stopped the Vietnam War in 1965
because the virus was pretty much killed
by then and the contagion wasn't going
to spread and the spread of contagion
was considered very serious I mean in
Latin America could erode u.s. dominance
so when internal documents talk about
policies going back to the 1820s they
knew what they were talking about the
spread of the virus and Latin America
could you know erode traditional US
dominance in its own backyard and the
spread of contagion was considered a
very serious I mean in Latin America it
could erode US dominance so when
internal documents talk about policies
going back to the 1820s they knew what
they were talking about the spread of
the virus in Latin America could you
know erode traditional US dominance in
its own backyard and as again internal
documents point out if we can't control
Latin America how can we control the
rest of the world you know one of any
it's called credibility to be one of any
credibility elsewhere
credibility means you better watch out
if we shake our fist do what we say and
in Indonesia was in Vietnam was even
worse they were afraid that the virus
would spread to Thailand Philippines
Indonesia and finally Japan which is the
John dower leading Japan his story and I
said called Japan the super Domino Japan
might accommodate to an independent East
Asia become its technological center
whole region had separate itself from
the US sphere that means the US would
lost the second world war in the Pacific
which was fought to protect prevent that
Japan was going to establish a new order
in East Asia where it would be the
center it would separate itself from US
control you know in 1961 60 the US was
not prepared to lose the Second World
War so the policies were followed both
there and in Latin America is successful
in both cases but in the case of Cuba it
continues to the president it goes
beyond sort of normal rationality and
facts very striking case in that respect
not only the American population but
even American business is in favor of
restoring relations with Cuba they can
make money out of it a big market
agribusiness pharmaceutical corporations
are interested in high-level Cuban
biotechnology and so on and energy
corporations believe probably rightly
that their substantial oil reserves off
the coast of Cuba they're not allowed to
drill so you have this situation where
but not only the population which is
normally irrelevant so that's not
unusual
but even substantial sectors of business
which are relevant to policy planning
are in favor of normalization of
relations but state Wow see a case where
the one of these there are examples like
this where the state executive is acting
in conflict with the sectors of power
that dominate the state executive and
there's a reason for that and the if
you're the CEO of a corporation your
interests are making a bigger salary in
getting more profit and market share for
the next quarter
if short-term localized interests if
you're that same person that becomes
Secretary of State he or she has
different interest
maybe the global welfare of the
corporate system you know long-term
thinking and we'll make different
decisions sometimes the Cuba's one such
case that's probably infused in the case
of Cuba by a anger you know that this
tiny little country has been carrying
out successful defiance right off their
shores for 50 years again handle that
but it's a something that happens effect
it's happening right now in the case of
Iraq that not for the first time the
history of us-iran relations shows many
such cases as for example in 1953 that
when the US and Britain overthrew the
parliamentary government installed the
Shah from the US government's point of
view that was part of a program of
expanding US influence in the Middle
East region which meant at the expense
of written because they were the
dominant power and the government wanted
to the Eisenhower government wanted us
all companies to take over 40% of the
British concession and it ran the
British should run it tirely before it
and the oil companies didn't want to do
it and not because they didn't like
Iranian oil but because they could get
the oil more cheaply from Saudi Arabia
so we and they didn't want to alienate
their Saudi friends by reducing lifting
in Saudi Arabia so from their short-term
interest concerns they were opposed to
doing it but pretty much the same people
in the State Department and the White
House ordered them to do it and in fact
threatened them with antitrust
proceedings and other other actions
unless they took over 40% of the British
concession and so they did and it comes
right up till today I'm in the US energy
corporations undoubtedly would be very
happy to get in the competition to
exploit Iran's enormous gas and oil
resources but they blocked by the
government and in part again it's just
anger I mean the Iranians commit
crime they overthrew the tyrant who we
had established they've been you know
thumbing their nose at us ever since and
we don't tolerate that so you have
another case where and in fact they're
geostrategic reasons
