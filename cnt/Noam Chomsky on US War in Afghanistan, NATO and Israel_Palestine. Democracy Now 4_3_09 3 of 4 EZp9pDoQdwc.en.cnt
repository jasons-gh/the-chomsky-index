Western world the way Lester primarily
the United States being the West all
together and it directly followed these
expressions of opinion which are very
likely those of maybe majority of
Afghans and maybe even more in fact he
went even further he said that he would
invite Willa Amara the head of the
Taliban to Afghanistan to try to work
out a solution and he added the United
States isn't gonna like this but they
have two choices they can either accept
that or they can throw me out you know
and in fact that's what they're doing
there are now plans to replace President
Karzai to sort of push him upstairs and
leave in the zoom that will win the next
election so put him in a symbolic
position and impose basically us
appointed the surrogate will essentially
run the country because that can't be
tolerated in a vent there are
alternative proposals they're discussed
here they're widely discussed in
Afghanistan at the highest level and
apparently one of the population to just
move towards a peaceful settlement among
Afghans and a regional settlement which
would take into consideration the
concerns of the region neighboring
powers why do you think Obama is
expanding this word do you call it
Obama's war now well that this goes way
back I mean the United States has sort
of a comparative advantage in world
affairs namely military might not
economic power you know not crazy
reserves and it's very powerful state
but out to one of several it's
comparable to Europe it's comparable to
the rising East Asia in say economic
power but in military power it is
supreme the United States spends
approximately as much as the rest of the
world and military force far more
technologically advanced and we have a
compare
as you tend to use it so policy
decisions tend to drift towards where
you're strong and we're strong as
military force it's you know the old
joke if you have a hammer everything you
can see is it now I think that's a very
much of a driving force and there's also
a long-standing Imperial mentality which
says we have to control and dominate and
in particular we have to dominate energy
resources that goes way back it's a you
know after the Second World War it's
been maybe the prime factor in use and
the energy resources in Afghanistan no
they're not in Afghanistan they're in
mostly in the Gulf secondarily in
Central Asia but Afghanistan is right in
the middle of this system I mean there
is a pipeline question how powerful it
is you can speculate but there have been
long standing plans for pipeline from
Turkmenistan and Central Asia to India
which would copy at school Turkmenistan
Afghanistan Pakistan India now that's of
significance to the United States for a
number of reasons for one thing if it it
would run right through Afghanistan and
through condor province one of the most
conflicted areas it if it was
established it would for one thing
reduce the reliance of the Central Asian
states on Russia so we can their role
but more significant it would bypass
Iran I mean the India needs energy and
the natural sources at Grant and in fact
they're they're discussing in Iran to
India pipeline but if you could get
natural gas flowing from Central Asia to
India avoiding Iran that would support
the US policy which is now very clear in
Obama's case it's been made more
concrete of forming an alliance of
regional States to oppose erat in fact
that's John Kerry the Senate head of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee
recently made an important speech about
that with Israel Palestine they said we
have to reconcile assign problem but
rather will sort of put that to the side
and what we have to do is create an
alliance of Israel and we're called the
moderate Arab states and moderate
there's a technical term means they do
what we say so the moderate Arab states
include the brutal Egyptian dictatorship
the radical fundamentalist dictatorship
in Saudi Arabia and so on they are the
moderates and they have to join with
Israel and us in an anti ranting
alliance and we have to of course break
ongoing connections between Iran and
India to the extent that we can and
elsewhere and that puts the
israel-palestine problems issue I want
to get to Israel Palestine but we have
to break and before we do just a quick
question do you think Obama should pull
the troops out of Afghanistan
immediately well you know I think the
Afghan should make that decision how
they have ways for example what the
peace movement calls for is their
traditional way of making decisions a
Loya Jirga major a meeting of elders
other figures and so on who will try to
arrive at a consensus on this with all
the Afghans and it should be their
decision I know we have no right to be
there we're talking to Noam Chomsky
