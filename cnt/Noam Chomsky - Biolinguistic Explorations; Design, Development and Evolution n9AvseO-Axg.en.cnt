well let me start with a couple of words
about my favorite century the 17th
century the famous philosopher historian
of philosophy and science Alfred North
Whitehead once wrote that for the last
several centuries we've been living off
the accumulated capital of the
scientific genius of the 17th century
which is not much of a distortion it's
pretty much true in the Natural Sciences
it's very largely true in our field
psychology linguistics philosophy it's
much less true much to their detriment I
think there was the part of the
Scientific Revolution the 17th century
was a cognitive revolution which was
extremely important and developed many
of the ideas that were rediscovered
without knowledge of their antecedents
in what's called the cognitive
revolution should be called the second
cognitive revolution of the 1950s which
led to cognitive science linguistics
related areas philosophy of language in
mind in the sense that we know them
today
and in fact much of that work is still
unknown and I think underappreciated so
to take simple elementary example one of
the notions that plays a fundamental
role in studies of acquisition of
language or nature of language is what's
called poverty the stimulus and there's
a huge debate about whether it exists
what is it is some weird thing about
language or something like that in fact
oh this is a total misunderstanding for
which I admit some guilt use the term
invented the term talking about language
but it's a general property of all
growth and that's well known and
understood outside the studies of the
mind of cognition where it's supposed to
be something special so it's taken for
granted for example no one even bothers
to mentioning mention it that the growth
of an embryo to mature whatever it is is
a striking illustration of extreme
poverty of stimulus though the stimulus
from the point of view of the embryo is
whatever the nutritional and other
environment is and it's perfectly
obvious and no one who bothers to talk
about it that the embryo doesn't become
a person or a chicken or whatever
because of the nutritional environment
which is far too impoverished to yield
that consequence so it's simply taken
for granted without discussion that that
results from some internal property to
that the of the embryo that we would now
regard as in part at least it's a
genetic endowment plus other factors
that enter into morphogenesis growth and
so on it's only in the studies of the
mental aspects of the world that that's
considered a strange and debatable
thesis as if they are somehow out of the
organic world an odd kind of dualism
that's characteristic of contemporary
thought and particularly the part of it
that regards itself is highly scientific
in the 17th century this was all quite
clear so the classic study of poverty of
stimulus and the cognitive domain was de
cartes discussion of how
an infant or an adult perceiving
something the great distinction was made
between growth and perception and they
are very similar how in either case we
the infant of the adults sees what they
do is simple example that he used was a
triangle so suppose I were to draw a
triangle on the board over there so what
you would actually do Descartes argued
these are instantly thought experiments
like most of the 17th century
experiments Galileo's and others the if
anyone were to carry them out this is
what would happen if you would look at
that thing I drew on the board your eye
scan it should be a sequence of
impressions on your retina a sequence of
stimuli on your retina and but you don't
perceive a sequence of stimuli as you
sort of scan the figure in some fashion
what you can perceive is triangle and in
fact what you perceive is a distorted
frame if you look carefully you don't
see a perfect example of whatever it is
which obviously can bother you a
triangle but you see it as a triangle
somewhat distorted like maybe one of the
lines is curved and two of them don't
quite come together something one of
them sticks out a little beyond the
other and so on now that's just your
immediate perception your instantaneous
immediate perception visit distorted
triangle
it shows the vast extent of poverty the
stimulus the stimulus on your retina is
just a sequence of stimulations
Descartes thought pressures but we look
at it differently the same thing and he
argued that the same would be too true
of an infant so he suggested that when
first in infancy a an infant is exposed
to say that figure the infant will
perceive a distorted triangle not a
sequence of stimuli as the retina as the
eye scans it
not a perfect example of whatever
distorted figure it is as far as I know
no one's ever carried out that
experiment but it would almost certainly
work that way the again the infant does
this because of some internal structure
that determines that that's the way you
perceive geometrical figures and the
court and others went on to argue that
that's exactly the same if you look at
more complex things like they say
something that you see is say that I see
here is people sitting in the room my
feet what I see is something far more
impoverished than that but I do perceive
it as people sitting in the room or men
wouldn't a street or something like that
that's all must come from internal
resources in the case of the triangle
Baker argue the mind is just constructed
so that it generates geometric
geometrical figures pure geometrical
figures and anything else and uses those
as a kind of a paradigm with which to
interpret whatever stim scattered and
stimuli actually reach the retina and by
now the last couple of decades there's
the beginning of understanding of the
neuro physiological mechanisms that that
yield these consequences beginning with
the work 50 Bell and Wiesel about 45
years ago and others since but it's
still rudimentary understanding that
there's very little doubt that that what
happened
well that's a dramatic and clear and
unexceptionable illustration of poverty
of stimulus and the visual domain
the other major domain that was
investigated in the first cognitive
revolution much as in the second that
the one in the 1950s was language those
were the two major topics study then and
there the two major topics studied now
some others but
the mass of the work partly because of
the accessibility of the of the
materials the in the case of language
what was taken further than assumed sort
of again thought experiments but seems
obvious is that the basic elements of
language say concepts or words if
there's any difference between them
those must be primarily generated
internally their complexity and richness
is such that they can't possibly be
acquired from experience they were what
were called the common notions or innate
ideas formed by some internal generative
process that's structured in some
fashion this and there was a good deal
of research into what we thought but
about how this is done suggesting that
what's involved is you start with but
are now called gustave properties
notions of causal relation notions of
agency anthropomorphic perspectives all
familiar with the way we perceive and
think about the natural world
so you see you you talk about a comet as
aiming towards the Earth and fortunately
missing it as if it had agency and
intention and the Sun rises in the
morning we don't talk about the earth
setting in the morning and so on but
that's true of just about everything we
talk about no matter how simple it is
and the properties of the concepts we
use are the same but they can't be
coming from the stimuli of the external
world and in fact as far as we know
there are differences among significant
differences among the organisms in how
they perceive the world and what
pathologists called
their own belt the world experienced
that in which they live will be
different for different organisms
different for us and for bees let's say
not because the stimuli are different
but because there is differently
constructed internally these mean the
the investigations were recognize that
there has to be both water at that time
called innate ideas or common notions
and fixed universal concepts that are
just part of our nature that provide a
framework for interpretation and
understanding and so on but also
principles generative principles of some
kind like the principles that form the
geometrical figures which yield the
internal symbolic constructions that
permit us to express our thoughts using
the atomic elements that are given by
nature basic atomic element effect the
linguistic research of the period did in
pursuit of those two lines of inquiry
what's the nature of the concepts what's
the nature of the universal principles
by which expressions are constructed as
modes of expression of thought sometimes
externalize mostly just in your heads
when you're talking to yourself by far
the yeah statistically speaking by far
the greatest use of language as you can
determine by introspection lead if some
lot of interesting work was done in both
of those domains I won't try to review
it a lot of it is still far from having
been reached in many of its details and
contemporary work that's particularly
true the study of concept which today is
much more impoverished than
was in the 17th century 17th 18th
century so take that and actually it was
recognized at that time that our most
elementary concepts or words don't pick
out identifiable things in the world
they don't pick out mind independent
objects actually that insight goes back
to Aristotle Aristotle's example was a
house he said the house is his
terminology a house has both matter and
form the matter of the house is bricks
wood were constructed of and that's mind
independent the form of the house is its
function its design the fact that people
live in editor store things in it and so
on and the house itself is a combination
of matter and form so it has both
material Constitution and design and
function us and when Aristotle defines
house he says he the finding a house the
combination of matter in forms but
actually it's important that it
recognized that the tradition from
Aristotle up to the 17th century and in
fact it revived in the contemporary
period is to talk about this
metaphysically you're defining a house
not the word house at the concept tells
so he's defying the thing house one of
those things in the world I wish then
matter inform were both regarded as part
of the world metaphysical that approach
in a yields hopeless dilemmas and
conundrums those of you who've taken
philosophy courses lulav run into
examples of them like the famous Ship of
Theseus or modern examples of Socrates
puzzles with belief
to run through them if you like but they
run these these takeoff on our concept
of city or and so on and show that
if you regard them as mind independent
you run into impossible unsolvable
paradoxes now that's taken to be a big
problem
all the way through from classical
philosophy up to the 17th century and
again in the last 40 years
that's regarded there's some kind of
major puzzle the 17th century whoever
looked at it differently now there was a
cognitive revolution remember so there's
a reinterpretation of the metaphysical
approach to an epistemological or
cognitive approach so you're not trying
to define house or ship or London or
something like that you're trying to
define the concept and if you discover
that the concept doesn't apply in all
possible situations as it doesn't that's
fine there's no reason why true concepts
are not built into us to deal with
imaginary situations that we can
construct so yes they don't apply
clearly in normal situations there's no
conundrum of paradox just the problem of
discovering what our conceptual
structures are and that's a very
productive and accurate way of looking
at it it's not the standard way today
and it wasn't the standard way prior to
the 17th century but it should be the
right way and if we think about concepts
and words a little becomes pretty
obvious that that must be true the word
house is not a bad example in fact if
you look at it more carefully defining
it in the word house in terms of matter
and form is nowhere near sufficient our
understanding of what a house is was far
richer than that
so for example if I say I painted my
house brown that you understand me to
mean that I painted the exterior surface
brown I can tell you that I
painted the interior surface brown but I
have to in a more complicated way I say
painted my house brown on the inside
okay that's and you know I meant the
inside that's what's called a marked
expression so if I say I climbed the
mountain terrific music playing Santa
went up if I can't say I climbed down
the mountain okay then I went down the
house is the same the exterior surface
is kind of unmarked that's what you take
the house to be you can with more
complexity identify the interior surface
but a house is not just an exterior
surface it can't be if it were it would
be a geometrical object and you couldn't
anything were to let's say you know five
feet away from the surface on the inside
you would be near the house but you're
not you're in the house if you're five
feet from it on the outside you're near
the house now it doesn't have anything
to do with its being contained the same
is true of saline - you know it goes
like this or even a straight wall
depending on whether you live on one
side of the other you're near it if
you're in the part that's intended to be
if it's outside the part that's intended
to be inhabited you're inside it if
you're the other one so there's a ton
you can go on and on like this
think through you will find many more
complicated aspects to the notion and
it's true of any know a house may be
sound may be a little bit misleading
because it's an artifact and one might
think that artifacts have that those
special properties now that the same is
true of the simplest words that aren't
or defects so it takes a another word
that was studied in the 17th century
first quite Thomas Hobbes that takes
they the Charles River which somewhere
around there
the the Charles River we call a river
but think about it a little you can
under very significant changes dramatic
changes it would still be the same river
on the other hand under very trivial
changes it would be a river below so for
example if the Hobbs argue that what
identifies something as a river as its
point of origin that's part of the truth
it can't be the entire truth because if
the river were saying it's the direction
of flow of whatever's in it were
reversed it would still be the Charles
River and if it were broken up into
tributaries and directed so it ended up
in some other place it would still under
appropriate circumstances be the Charles
River if whatever minimal amount of h2o
is in it were replaced by chemicals from
an upstream plant would stay they would
still be the Charles River though
wouldn't have any water in it and
probably not much of a change from what
it is now and so on lots of different
radical changes would still keep it
being the Charles River
now the other hand trivial changes would
keep it from being a river at all so for
example if it were directed between two
fixed banks let's say walls and used for
transporting freight ships with carrying
Freight then it would be a canal it
wouldn't be a river but it's a small
change in fact if some miniscule
physical change were carried out
undetectable except in very
sophisticated ways which was what's
called a phase change just changed its
surface so that became say glassy heart
almost undetectable I suppose was
changed to become hard and
a line was thrown down the middle of it
and people started using it to commute
from the bustling well then it would be
highway not a river even though the
changes are virtually undetectable and
you play with it you can find many more
complexities what all that means is that
a river is not a mind independent object
with some mental construct and the same
is true of any other word you look at
one of the terms that raised a lot of
interest in the seventeenth century
mainly because of interest in moral
philosophy was the notion person so what
makes something in person
John block for Bertram wolf spent a lot
of time on this well he argues a person
isn't the material object so I'm running
through the details he came to the
conclusion that a person is individuated
in terms of psychic continuity so if I
was the mine persists and the body
changes still the same person and he
concluded in fact that if you had two
psychic continuities in the same body it
would be two persons or if an effect you
know science fiction today plays with
notions like that the or the same a
single person could inhabit two bodies
if it's the same psychic continuity
running through it again a science
fiction trick and so and all of this is
known to infants I mean it's I don't
know if it's been really studied but
anyone who's had children or
grandchildren those that instantaneously
understood affect children's literature
is based on these notions from the
earliest stages cross-cultural as far as
we know
so the standard
children's story is you know the
handsome prince is turned into a frog by
evil witch
later the beautiful princess kisses the
frog comes the handsome prince not you
know some other creature and the choke
every child knows is the principle alone
even if in every physical respect it was
a fraud not because there was some kind
of psychic continuity running through it
my own grandchildren entranced by a
story about a a baby donkey named
Sylvester who his turn but by some
process and a lot until it rocked and
spends the rest of the story trying to
convince his parents that he's really
their baby donkeys Sylvester and them
since children's stories always and
happily the something happens at the end
and it's back in siddhis Sylvester
everybody lives happily ever after now
but the point is that the children have
no matter how young since I can
understand anything has no problem
understanding take for granted but even
if it's in every physical characteristic
arrived it's still Sylvester as long as
the psychic continuity persists luck was
to narrow this notion doesn't only hold
for persons but for organic creatures
and probably for inorganic ones if we
look more carefully well those are just
and we can proceed but if you think
about it no matter how simple an
elementary the concept you look at now
you'll find that those are its
characteristics it
and it's the the concepts and words that
we have
do not pick out entities in the world
that's a physicist could identify that
can be found you know by mind external
investigation rather they're basically
products of the imagination but them
mean it's not real or that we can't use
them to refer and communicate
ok so I can use all these terms to
communicate to you and I can refer to
them referring as an action not a
property of a word I can refer to them I
can communicate with you basic that mmm
and the reason is that we share the
cognitive structure and if the situation
is sufficiently circumscribed so that I
can convey to you the perspective from
which I'm looking at the world and you
can look at it from the same perspective
then I can use these mental entities to
focus your attention on aspects of the
world from the same perspective or close
enough perspective to mine and that's
successful active reference or
communication so there's no inhibition
of communication in these facts even
though there are no minded and
identities that say a physicist but
identify that to which the our words
have some relation a relation of
reference or D notation in technical
terms that means that the concept of the
formal concept of reference that you
study in logic that's developed by
fraida Purse tarski Carnap and so on it
just doesn't apply to natural language
there is no notion of reference for
natural language as far as we know or if
your thought for language and for human
language and thought just don't have a
notion of reference they don't have a
semantics in the technical sense they
don't have terms that pick out pieces of
the world
this appears to be a respect in which
humans differ sharply from any other
organism and as far as is known animal
communication systems are based on a but
sometimes called a one-to-one relation
and isomorphism between some internal
symbol and some identifiable aspect of
the world so if we take say calls of a
vervet monkey as it is five calls
looking at the vervet monkey
anthropomorphic li the way we look at
everything we say the monkeys giving
this call because there's an eagle there
and it's telling the rest of the you
know crew of the monkeys that we're
gonna weigh now what appears to be
happening is that there's a reflexive
reaction to some say emotion of leaves
or something like that and then the call
comes up there's apparently an
identifiable isomorphic relation between
the call and physically identifiable
aspect for the environment which we
interpret in the river that's
interpreters meaning get out of the way
you know whether they interpretive the
predators coming or not nobody notice we
just know that they run away the and
that appears to be the case for all
animal communication systems as far as
anyone's discovered if that's the case
then one fundamental difference between
humans and the rest of the organic world
is that we have concepts that do not
pick out mind independent entities and
that's a sick one of the two major
problems in any theory of the any
account of the evolution of human
language and cognition
some they have to face how did this
happen
and what change in human in the human
brain
led to a completely different way of
conceptualizing the world in which we
perceive it our boom belt is constructed
from internally generated mental objects
which we use to refer and communicate or
to express thought that are just to have
thoughts now that we should do not pick
out common mind independent entities
shared by the group that's interacting
or the person is thinking well that's
one big problem another big problem
recognized very well in the 17th century
they weren't talking about evolution
obviously we do you know can't say
anything about it we talked about the
the other big problem which will have to
be accounted for in fact of two of their
big problems at the account it's where
one is the fact that our minds are it's
capable of constantly do generate an
unbounded range of expressions which in
fact express thought they're related
somehow to the metal systems that we
have to we have some kind of system of
thought and at some stage in human
evolution some small changed some
rewiring the brain took place maybe some
small mutation nobody knows enough about
the structure of the brain to imagine
what it could have been but some small
rewiring took place which provided
humans with a school that recursive
operation an operation that allows them
to take the atomic elements that are
available whatever they are and to
construct from them and on
the array of structured expressions that
operation is that there isn't basically
only one such operation that's used to
generate any system of small digital
infinity like you know the number system
integers and language and so on
now again humans appear to be the only
organism that has any such capacity in
fact it's very hard to find in the
organic world all together fiercely some
kind of special innovation that took
place in humans and that does provide an
unbounded range of expressions with
which we can then have complex thoughts
sometimes express them communicate one
of the forms of interaction and so on
how that happened is the second big
problem that has to be dealt with and
there's a third problem which is the for
these first two problems are
researchable he can study there's a
third problem which you can identify
with nobody knows how to study it and
from the seventeenth-century point of
view it was the major one that's what
sometimes called the creative aspect of
language use the fact that not only can
you construct these expressions but that
you can do so independently of external
stimuli and independently if at least
identifiable internal states in a way
which is appropriate to situations but
not caused by them which is a crucial
difference and in a way that it allows
you to express thoughts that others like
you can interpret and understand and
realize that they could have said them
anyway if the heads or development that
combination of properties is as I say
sometimes called the creative aspect of
language use it's one dramatic
illustration of freedom of choice and
will but in a highly structured that
complex sense for Descartes and the
Cartesians that property was the
distinctive property that distinguished
the mind from the body so
indistinguishable Xand from automata
17th century much like today I was
fascinated with automata and interested
in the question what makes an automaton
or an animal of beasts so-called
different from a human and the
distinguishing characteristics primary
primary distinguishing characteristic
was identified as this one and again it
was argued that you can but this is true
of the youngest children all human
beings no matter how the mentally the
farm or whatever they all have this
property that makes them human the my
it's just side word in the terms of 17th
century this thesis that this identifies
the mind was a scientific thesis was a
normal part of science and a sensible
appropriate part of science it was
assumed at the time that the world is
basically a complicated automaton
it's more complex than the kind that
skilled artisans were creating but
pretty much the same in fact it was
belief that the world was created by a
skilled artisan master artisan divinity
created this complex machine and it
working week and then it just kind of
works the way it was designed so it's
like the you know a complicated clock or
other complex devices that were at the
time being constructed by very skilled
artisans and you know delighted people
and so on so I made a lot of sense to
ask well what students killed one of
those machines and say us and if since
the Cartesian Insight appears to be
correct that a machine can't have this
property then you have to assume that
there is some other principle in the
world in addition to the mechanical
principle in their terms of another
substance and that's mine so you have a
dualist approach well we all know or at
least think we know that that approach
collapsed and in a sense it did collapse
but not in the way that's commonly
believed what happened is that Isaac
Newton to his great dismay he never
believed it showed that there aren't any
machines
he showed that nothing in the world
works by the mechanical principles
that's what action that a distance means
he thought that was totally absurd
conclusion he said no person with any
sense could possibly accept it but just
appears to be true and it took centuries
before it really settled in on Newton
for the end of his life tried to
disprove it right into the early 20th
century scientists were trying to show
that there are mechanical interactions
that mean that the world really is a
machine the kind of entity in which I
can't move say this bottle over here
unless I touch it we now know that
that's false but it it is just our
concept our only conception of a machine
and it was the conception of the
scientific revolution well newton
disproved it that we didn't believe his
disprove and with the disproof of that
assumption the machine disappeared but
the mind was left intact so Newton
didn't get rid of the ghost in the
machine he got rid of the machine and
now the entire world is ghostly and
you're left with a completely different
conception of science the 17th century
conception was that the world should be
intelligible to us post Newton as the
Newtonian revolution finally sank in it
came to be realized as it is today that
the world is just not intelligible to us
that doesn't make sense no I didn't or
modern scientific theories it just makes
no common sense at all and nobody cares
because you know that are trying to show
that the world is intelligible it isn't
what you're trying to show is that you
can construct theories of the world that
are intelligible which is a completely
different enterprise that's the lowering
of the sights of science and slowly to
thank in over the centuries and from
this point of view the study of mental
aspects of the world is just like study
of chemical or optical or other aspects
just studying various aspects of the
world trying to find intelligible
theories of them try to unify them to
the extent that you can
unification does come about often but
often in extremely surprising ways even
in recent times and you don't know how
it's going to come about in the future
well that's the nature of the scientific
enterprise today it's you read
contemporary literature you read about
you know the what's called the
astonishing idea or the radical new
hypothesis
dramatic proposal that the mind is just
the result of the organic structure of
the brain no gotta be true but not part
of the structure of the foot apparently
cut your foot off and still out of mind
so it's got it's got to be something
that some product of the structure of
the brain but that was just taken for
granted by the late 18th century by the
time the Newtonian revolution had set in
in fact it was stated and virtually the
same words that are called
an astonishing hypothesis today another
example of how we're slowly coming to
comprehend what was very well understood
centuries ago another illustration of
the the kind of intellectual tragedy of
the fact that we haven't been living off
the intellectual capital of the 17th
century and the in these domains in
language philosophy cognitive science
and so on and have a long way to go but
the ideas are pretty clear and the
understandable just kind of different
than the ordinary way of looking at well
this third property the creative aspect
of language uses remains beyond inquiry
but the second property the principles
that were that we use to form
expressions to express our thoughts
that's a major topic of Investigation
did pick up again from the 1950s
breaking with the barriers imposed by
behaviorist and structuralist dogmatism
they collapsed
fortunately and we rarely gates became
possible to get back to some of the
topics that were seriously investigated
centuries earlier and in fact they go
far beyond because there are new tools
and new mathematical tools and others
that weren't available then and that
leads to modern linguistics in cognitive
science I don't have
kind to talk about it but from then on
you know you go off into what we
understand about the universal
principles that enter into what you and
I are not doing just the final word
about it if it is true and there's no
reason to doubt it that cognitive
capacity is capacity for language and so
on
I just aspects of the world like others
then we would expect that when we study
save language or moral theory or visual
perception or whatever we would expect
to find three separate factors that
enter into their growth and development
one factor is what in the 17th century
was called innate structure today we
call it the genetic component not
knowing a lot more about it than they
did we have a different word for it so
there is some genetic component that
determines that we have language not
know but to say my my granddaughter
exposed my granddaughter and her pet
kitten or chimpanzee or songbird or
whatever made me exposed to precisely
the same data precisely the same but
only my granddaughter interprets some of
it as linguistic experience in a very
mysterious way nobody knows how this is
done but some of the complex environment
is picked out as linguistic experience
if you have the right genetic endowment
and then out of that comes a knowledge
of a language in an almost reflexive way
you're not taught it you don't really
learn it just kind of grows in your mind
the way other aspects of your
the organism developed that's one factor
of the genetic component which
interprets part of the data as
experience and constructs some
intellectual structure in the mind from
that experience and then makes it
possible for us to use it in the way
we're doing now the second factor is
variation in the data so we happen to be
talking some variety of what's called
English but not some variety of what's
called Japanese well so genetic
differences but there are some
differences in the data which you those
distinctions presumably very superficial
ones can't be very much and in fact
that's welcome back that in a second but
that's the second factor the third
factor which is much harder to study but
it's coming into view in the study of
language and the study of biology also
are just general principles of nature
which enter into how organisms grow and
develop in every aspect I mean we know
that in some cases everyone knows that
say say cell division is in two spheres
not tubes but not because there's a gene
that tells the cell you know become a
sphere not Q that's because of physical
principles and no one knows exactly how
far that goes but undoubtedly the just
general principles of nature play a
major role in determining how an
organism gets to its successive states
of maturation and development and the
same is true of evolution there must be
fixed principles of nature that just
determine the kind of channel within
which natural selection can make a few
choices
that's the third factor and same is true
in language principles of language is
basically a computational system so you
would expect that principles of
efficient computation there's nothing
particular to do with language
should enter into the way a language
grows in the mind of a child no matter
what language it is and in recent years
it's for the first time become possible
to explore these properties of language
and get some interesting results about
them just to finish the these two areas
biology and linguistics have been
developing in pretty much in parallel
for the last 40 years or so and with a
good deal of interaction sort of the
phrase bio linguistics comes from in
both cases say around the 1950s it was
assumed both in biology and study him in
linguistics that hidden biology that
organisms can vary in every imaginable
way so the variation of organisms is so
extreme that each one has to be studied
a special case and if nature sets a
certain problem natural selection will
find a way to solve it study nature you
know that's a course in general biology
do you still read that similarly in
linguistics it was assumed that
languages can vary in every imaginable
way and that it's a mistake to approach
some new language with a preconception
of what it must look like because the
variation could be arbitrary well of
both of those ideas are literally
incoherent and they weren't really meant
literally because they are incoherent
but that was the kind of the atmosphere
you know the assumption is well
variation is so huge that it's not much
you say event over the years both
biology and linguistics have been
chipping away at those incoherent
assumptions with a fair amount of
interactions and by now it's not exotic
in either field to say that there really
only is one organism
with slight variations in the timing of
regulatory mechanisms and so on which
yield superficial what growth
superficial differences but from the
same deeply conserved elements some
which go way back to bacteria a Hawks
change of a famous case and similarly in
the case of language it's no longer
extreme to say that there probably is
really just one language with minor
variations depending on him this or that
option is fixed and when you know in a
well-constructed well-designed system
slight changes are made in several
places the superficial outcome can look
very different if you want to see an
explicit that working out of this that's
both very expert and very accessible
there's a book by a fine linguist mark
Baker and I called atoms of language in
which he takes two languages that are
that as different as you can possibly
imagine on the surface English and
Mohawk every possible property looks
totally different and he tries to show
and to a certain extent does show that
if you assume a fixed structure of
options that can be picked in the course
of acquisition on the basis of simple
data and then the two languages turn out
to be virtually identical just with
different choices of options very much
like the way say a butterfly and an
elephant that turned out to be pretty
much the same animal with just different
choices of timing of regulatory circuits
and so on that's the direction in which
both fields are going and probably will
will converge in that respect and
biology is called sometimes the evo-devo
revolution evolution development
revolution there's an interesting
general books on on it in linguistics is
called the minimalist program but it's
basically the same thing and has to do
with an interaction well that these are
researchable Pathak's the one that for
the moment at least no one has any idea
how to research is the one that was the
crucial one for the 17th century and
that is the creative aspect of language
use and the general problems of will and
choice which appear to be as far as we
know independent of the external
stimulation and internal control
appropriate but not cause these other
properties
