Thank You norm Chomsky for this
interview please at least with me - is a
very beautiful space here in Topsham for
me the first time in America first
dominantly I'm very happy I'm very happy
I'm studied your Terrace in when I was
when I was younger and you for me was
always example in Italy I'm working
about conference conference the question
is the relationship between science and
faith faith the component rationality
and irrationality in in men the passion
and the technique today they're in our
world the technique power power of
technique is also possible speak about
amante armani date the religion and the
technique or is impossible to the
relationship that's I don't think that
that's a general intellectual question
it's a personal question
I mean individuals can in various ways
relate religious faith if they have it
to scientific attendee progress of
science that goes back as far as
Augustine you know how to relate your
faith to the world of science huge issue
and for some people like me question
doesn't arise because I don't have
religious faith it doesn't mean that
there's not an irrational component I
think we have to distinguish two things
irrational components in our ways of
organizing our lives or scientific work
and so on and that's distinct from faith
and say one of the Abrahamic religions
that's a different matter you can have
one without the other but there that
there is some kind of a substantial
irrational component that enters into
our actions our decisions are the event
our scientific work that's not
disputable my favorite philosopher David
Hume is famous for having said that
reason is the slave of the passions
means a function without your emotional
state
intuitive conceptions about how the
world works and that's true even the
most elementary perceptions like when I
look at you I see a person why do I see
a person actually what's happening if
you look at my eyeball it's just a
series of random
stimulations going on but out of that I
can sort the person that's part of my
nature and elements like that into our
interpretation we can't avoid it you can
try to discover what the factors are
maybe even find ways to overcome but
that's just the way were built so for
example when you take the famous if you
look at the rising moon when it's on the
horizon looks very large there's a move
up into the sky it seems to get smaller
well we can't overcome that you can't
help seeing that the moon looks bigger
horizon but you can study from another
point perspective and point of view and
discover why it is that you're getting
this illusion that distorts the physical
reality sometimes there are things we
just can't discover they're too deep but
at every stage of her that I think faith
if you want to call it that is just one
further aspect where we find when we
begin by looking at the most elementary
experience and then on through our
interpretations of it to much more
complex and abstract conclusions about
the justice honesty regard so there are
in the humanity a universal component
universal component in humanity now and
for example in Europe theory of
linguistic theory the language has a
specific component Universal component
correct me if I'm wrong it seems to be
the case that language is a kind of a
species property of humans meaning it's
common to all humans and it's unique and
it's fundamental aspects so we don't see
any closer analogue in any other
organism so in that sense it's a species
properly we now know a fair amount about
this so it's pretty well established by
now that humans all humans
from a pretty small group in Africa they
began to separate about 150,000 years
ago and as far as we know all humans
everywhere share the same language
capacity and probably the same cognitive
systems but they are reaching and
offered this difference which is the
origin of the difference of linguistic
African Europe when is a why is this
shishun what why the humanity don't use
the same language
why don't we speak what we actually do I
think like psychology on the surface
that looks as if language is a very
different but when you begin to study
the mid-depth you find that as you go
further and further into the internal
nature of the language they're pretty
much almost modeled on the same caste
the same Bowl
it's the same with organisms you take a
look at all the organisms in the world
they look very different from one
another you know and locusts she human
like every possible thing to be an
organism and in fact that was believed
about 60 or 70 years ago it's now
knowing that all organisms are
remarkably similar and their basic
nature they really haven't they all fund
medli on the same form forms that were
established for one thing we all have
the same cells same kind of cells you
take the cells of say yeast the least
most primitive thing in humans you and I
couldn't tell the difference between
them you have to be an expert to see the
differences between them and if you look
at body forms turns out they were all
pretty much established about 500
million years ago and so for Cambrian
explosion haven't changed very much so
the variety on the surface looks very
different begin to penetrate into how
the system works and you find remarkable
similarities what's called very deep
conservation we've done two metal films
and you know anything you don't
understand
looks very complex the more you begin to
understand that to mortify the simple
[Music]
very around the surface the edges the
question very deep important for me is
the question of time philosophic
question the time in philosophy are
different as well for example Darwinism
is a typical answer about the question
of time in one of my philosophic book
the name is history as living organism
I imagine the time not the time not as a
line not as a circle but as organism
organism relation from different time
in the world if my as well for you is
the millinery a question of time
everything changed or are there
something in humanity that not change
well as I say with which is where humans
and that from the point of view of the
history of the universe humans are just
an instant our whole existence is a tiny
constant history the universe if some
accident had taken place if an asteroid
that hit the earth 200 thousand years
ago there would be any humans but
they're just a very recent development
emergence in the history of the universe
and our whole existence from the point
of view of a you know cosmic creature
looking at it it's not that you almost
invisible so your respect we're tiny
speck in the universe and at the time
the universe is developing
that we may not exist very long I mean
we're actually facing a period where
humans might destroy themselves within a
short period of time so in terms of
eternal history we may just live like a
tiny accident that happened quickly and
Emmas extinguishes that's I mean I'd
like to think of ourselves that way
that's what we are not the center of the
intelligent life all together is very
rare it almost never
that's conditions for it exist but never
emerges maybe because many of the
murders is interesting
no thank you again for these meeting I'm
very thank you
