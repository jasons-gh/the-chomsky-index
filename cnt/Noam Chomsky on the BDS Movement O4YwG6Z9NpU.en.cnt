your thoughts on the BDS movement the
boycott divest sanctions movement
well the BDS is a set of tactics right
these are tactics that you employed when
you think they're gonna be effective and
in ways that you think will be effective
tactics are not principles they're not
actions that you undertake no matter
what because you think they're right
tactics are undertaken if you're serious
because you think they're going to help
the victims that's how you adjust your
tactics not because I think they're
right in principle but because I think
they will be beneficial that oughta be
second nature to activists also second
nature should be a crucial distinction
between proposing and advocating I can
propose now that we should all live in
peace and love each other I just
proposed it it's not a serious proposal
it becomes a serious proposal when it is
becomes advocacy it is given I sketch
out a path for getting from here to
there then it becomes serious otherwise
it's empty words
that's crucial and related to this well
when you took it take a look at the BDS
movement which is separate incidentally
from BDS tactics let me make that clear
so when the European Union issued its
directive or when the that I mentioned
or when say the Gates Foundation
withdraws investment in security
operations that are being carried out
not only in the occupied territories but
elsewhere that's very important
but that's not the BDS movement that's
BDS tactics actually BD tactics boycott
divestment tactics that's important the
BDS movement itself has been an impetus
to these developments and in many ways a
positive one but I think it has failed
and should reflect on its so far
unwillingness to face what are crucial
questions for activists what's going to
help the victims and what's gonna harm
them what is a proposal and what is real
advocacy you have to think that through
and it hasn't been sufficiently done so
if you take a look at the principles of
the VDS movement they're three they vary
slightly in wording but basically three
one is actions should be directed
against the occupation that has been
extremely successful in many ways and it
makes sense
it also helps educate the Western
populations who are being appealed to to
participate enables so it's an opening
to discuss investigated organized about
the participation in the occupation it's
very successful a second principle is
that BDS actions should be continued
until Israel allows the refugees to
return is that has had no success and to
the extent that it's been tried it's
been negative it just leads to a
backlash no basis has been laid for it
among the population it is simply
interpreted as saying oh you want to
destroy the State of Israel we're not
going to destroy a state you cannot
undertake actions which you think are
principled when the work in the real
world they're going to have a harmful
effect
the victims was a third category having
to do with civil rights within Israel
and there are things that could be done
here one of the ones I mentioned in fact
the tax-free status for US organizations
that are engaged in civil rights vitamin
rights violations and remember a tax
exemption means I pay for it that's what
a tax exemption is well that's an action
could be undertaken others that have
been undertaken have had a backlashes
which are harmful and I won't run
through the record but these are the
kinds of questions that always have to
be asked when you're involved in serious
activism
if you care about the victims not just
feeling good but caring about the
victims that's critically important
