back in the 1950s President Eisenhower
was concerned about what he called the
campaign of hatred against us in the
Arab world that not among the
government's or more or less okay but
among the people and this is a secret
then it's been Declassified since the
National Security Council major planning
agency issued a memorandum on this issue
it stated that there's a perception in
the Arab world that the United States
supports that the harsh and brutal
dictatorships and that the u.s. blocks
democracy and development and we do it
because we want to control their
resources and it went on to say that the
perception is more or less accurate and
furthermore that's what we ought to be
doing as long as the population is quiet
it doesn't matter the dictators support
us everything's fine that's 1958 2001
defense Science Board essentially came
up with same conclusion the same
conclusion holds this today it was
strikingly illustrated in the WikiLeaks
revelations that one of the the ones
that got the most publicity big
headlines you for a commentary were the
revelations and cables that the Arab
support US policy towards Iran that's
really important one slight flaw and
those reports they were referring to the
Arab dictators they allegedly support
our policies towards Iran what about the
Arab population well we know their
feelings there are major polls taken by
the US leading us polling agencies
released by prestigious institutions
working institutions not reported in the
United States incidentally as far as I
know one report in England
Jonathan Steele an article in The
Guardian about it I think that's the
only one that they're interesting they
say that there are indeed Arabs who
support us policies on Iran about ten
percent think that Iran is a threat
overwhelmingly they regard the United
States and Israel as the major threats
in Egypt ninety percent regard the
United States is the major threat in
fact opposition the US policies are so
strong that a majority favored say the
region would be better off if Iran had
nuclear weapons almost eighty percent in
Egypt high percentage in the rest of the
region well that won't do again for the
usual reasons it's this so therefore
this is totally almost totally
suppressed as far as I know steel is the
only report in the english-speaking
world outside of critical yeah I write
about other people in the margins write
about it but the the reactions reveal
once again the simply extreme contempt
for democracy as long as the dictators
back us and matter what the population
thinks if there's a campaign of hatred
against us among the population and the
dictators are in control everything's
fine euphoric headlines that was
nineteen fifty eight to two thousand one
today its standard in the case of
Britain it goes back much earlier it
goes back to a century and a half two
centuries the US standard since the US
replaced Britain as global hegemon and
France is the same if not worse in fact
every great power acts pretty much the
same way well you know these are things
in the background of terrorism you have
to pay attention to them we also know
pretty well how to deal with terrorism
in fact Britney
led the way in this case in Northern
Ireland the terrorism was pretty serious
the IRA terror bridge Terra was even
worse of course but that's the usual
balance of forces but I are a terror was
not a joke as long as Britain reacted to
it with greater terror the cycle of
terrorism increased they finally last in
the 90s Britain finally responded with
us pressure in this case in a sensible
way they tried to pay attention to the
grievances that lay behind the terror
there were grievances real ones as
Britain started to pay attention to the
grievances terror reduced people who had
been involved in IRA hit men were
brought into the negotiations some of
them now I ended up the government it's
not utopia but it's a big difference
from what it was before I was actually
in Belfast in 1993 it was like a war
zone I was back last year and it's
peaceful you know this tensions but the
kind of tensions that exist in every
city I couldn't see them but people told
me you know this is a Protestant
neighborhood Catholic you don't go into
it and that sort of thing but but it
certainly wasn't what it was in 1993
okay and that's the way to deal with
terror let's take a look at its causes
and sources if you want to reduce it but
states do not consider
a terror or major problem it's true of
written in the United States for example
this came out the Chilcot hearings
clearly the head of British intelligence
testified that when the US and Britain
invaded Iraq they both anticipated that
it would increase terror actually it did
a lot more than anyone expected
increased it by about a factor of seven
but they both anticipated it was going
to crease terror but there are other
purposes there are higher priorities
than protecting the domestic populations
so they went to war and that's not
unusual there were timed over many more
examples anyhow I think these are some
of the things that you be kept in mind
and thinking about the return to
barbarism at our time the plague of
terrorism and our age and so on
