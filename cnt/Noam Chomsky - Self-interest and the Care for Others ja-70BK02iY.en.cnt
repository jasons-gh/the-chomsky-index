that's a matter of choice I mean you
know you have to choose each person to
what extent am I gonna be consumed by
self-interest to what extent am I gonna
care about others
nobody can lay down a legislation about
them but we can have our own views about
the topic so tell you my view you tell
me your view I think people should be
concerned with other not just with their
own self-interest of course you can't
dismiss your own self-interest
you want to survive a live a decent life
grandchildren and so on and so forth
that self-interest but a substantial
part of your life should be I think
concern for others and in normal human
beings it is sympathy is a deep
principle altruism is a deep principle
not just rather unit I'm just takes a
tall offense who are very remote from us
in the evolutionary skip million years
or so but many people have you know
demonstrate great courage to save
dolphins who were swamped on the beach
because we have sympathy
