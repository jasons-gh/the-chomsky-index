welcome to Democracy Now I'm Juan
Gonzalez hitting the framing Goodman who
set him back from East Timor President
George Bush and Russian President
Vladimir Putin signed a nuclear arms
treaty today the treaty doesn't require
either side to destroy a single missile
launcher or warhead instead it allows
them to keep weapons in storage where
they can be reactivated on short notice
the treaty is only real constraint is
that each side must have no more than
2,200 warheads by the year 2012 but
that's when the treaty expires so each
can actually have as many weapons as it
likes unless the treaty is extended and
both sides have far more strategic
nuclear warheads and they need the
Pentagon itself called for reducing its
active warheads to the number in its own
classified strategy documents the
agreement is also expected to pave the
way for Bush's unilateral withdrawal
from the 1972 anti-ballistic missile
treaty so he can build a Star Wars
global missile system Bush said the
signing ended a long chapter of
confrontation and opened up an entirely
new relationship between our countries
Putin called the treaty quote a series a
serious move ahead to ensure
international security well we now turn
to a speech by MIT professor Noam
Chomsky on the past and future of
nuclear weapons and their role in global
domination but nuclear weapons will not
be the only topic of discussion between
bush and Putin over the next few days
Newsweek is reporting the two could also
form a so-called energy security pact
under the agreement Russia would offer
to make up any shortfalls in oil
supplies to the West when there are
crises in other parts of the world such
as the Middle East we now turn to
professor Noam Chomsky he begins by
talking about America's long pursuit of
oil in the Middle East he then turns to
the issue of America's nuclear weapons
and global domination Noam Chomsky is a
professor of linguistics at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology he
is a leading scholar and critic of u.s.
foreign policy and the author of many
books including 911 stories press he
gave this speech in March at Stanford
University after September 11th
some of the press particularly the Wall
Street Journal did do what they should
have done they began investigating
opinion in the in the region to find out
why people they were trying to find out
the answer to George Bush's plaintiff
question why do they hate us when we're
so good you know happen that so within
actually before even before he asked the
question the Wall Street Journal had
provided some of the answers they did do
what they should have done they did a
investigation of opinions in the region
now they kept to the people they care
about so they had a it was what they
called money Muslims meaning bankers
lawyers managers of branches of us corp
transnationals that kind of people
people are right inside the US system
and of course naturally despise some
have been Laden because there is main
targets they're the ones he's after so
they don't like it and in that group you
can't what's their opinion about the
United States well turns out there
they're very antagonistic to US policy
though there in the main policies they
just part of the international economic
policies but what they what they object
to is the fact that the United States
has consistently opposed a democracy
independent development sporting corrupt
brutal regimes is that they're naturally
strongly opposed to the unilateral us
support for the Israeli military
occupation which is very harsh and
brittles now in its 35th year strongly
opposed the US sanctions against Iraq
which they understand perfectly well you
know to zone go into it are devastating
the population but strengthening Saddam
Hussein and they remember another
thing that we like to forget that the
United States and Britain supported him
right through his worst atrocities help
them continue to help them develop
weapons of mass destruction didn't see
anything wrong with gas and Kurds or
anything else they remember that even if
we choose to sweep it under the carpet
and for reasons like that they say they
lot of hatred of US policies despite the
fact that they're right in the middle of
the entire u.s. system well that's one
answer to George Bush's question it's
not the kind of answer you read and most
of the intellectual journals and the
press and so on there you read
sophisticated answers about how people
of that region have bad cultures or they
left out by globalization or they you
know can't stand their freedoms and our
magnificence and so on and so forth
anyone who is seriously concerned with
these issues certainly anyone who's a
specialist and international affairs or
the Middle East knows that there's
nothing new about these answers you can
go way back and find them as far back as
you want to go one of the good places to
look one of the advantages of living
here is that the United States has
become over the years a very free
country not a gift from the gods but as
a result of plenty of popular struggle
it's become unusually free country
uniquely so in some respects we have
more information about us high-level US
policy planning then you can find about
any country in the world that I know
about tons of Declassified material
which shows how policy is being
conducted and what the thinking is well
obvious place to look if you want to
find out more about this is the records
for 1958 the reason is that 1958 was a
critical year in u.s. international
affairs for a lot of reasons explain it
later if you like but in particular with
regard to the Middle East it's a
critical year because it was the first
year in which some country
namely Iraq had been able to break out
of the anglo-american condominium over
the world's energy resources he ran at
tried conservative nationalist regime
but they were there was a military coup
that of us British military coup that
overthrew it Iraq actually broke out and
it was a huge issue big flurry of
activity military forces all over the
place almost came to nuclear weapons it
was enormous issue so if you want to
understand what the US was thinking
about you look back to those records
well if you do you find that President
Eisenhower in internal discussion
observed to his staff his words that
there's a campaign of hatred against us
in the Middle East not by governments
but by the people and there was
discussion about this the National
Security Council the highest planning
body gave their analysis they said that
there is the reason is that there's a
perception in the region that the United
States is supporting harsh and brutal
and corrupt regimes and is blocking
democratization and development and is
doing so because of our interest in
controlling the oil reserves of the
region and they said it's difficult to
counter this perception because it's
accurate not only is it accurate but it
should be accurate it said it is natural
for us to support status quo governments
meaning the kind i just described and to
prevent democracy and development
because we want to maintain control over
the energy resources of the region so
there's a campaign of hatred against us
by the people and that's the reason for
it essentially the same is what the Wall
Street Journal discovered on September
14th and anybody new in between the only
difference is that of course some of the
specific policies like the sanctions
against you
new and so on but the general policies
are the same and they are talking about
the people not just money Muslims and
among the people there's a much deeper
resentment because they don't see any
particular reason why the wealth of the
region should flow to the west and to
the money Muslims but who are
cooperating with the west and not to
them the kind of backward cultures as
you read and this idea somehow
penetrated their minds and still hasn't
so there's an even deeper campaign of
hatred among the people who aren't money
Muslims in the middle of the u.s. system
so if you want to listen to some voices
outside the cocoon it's not hard to hear
them and they'll answer the questions
about why there's a campaign of hatred
against us whether it's now or in 1958
and in a good part of the rest of the
world where people just don't enjoy
being ground that dust under somebody's
boot I don't like it leads to hatred you
can avoid you know you can indulge in
the fantasies if you like but that's a
choice you certainly don't have to well
there's a lot more to say about this but
let me put these top relatively topical
issues side and look at some other
things a couple of weeks ago you read
certainly the front page stories on
George Bush's current wishes Nuclear
Posture review the and that was kind of
interesting wasn't interesting because
the content there was almost nothing new
and the content what was interesting is
that it was reported that had been
leaked and reported and since the
content is essentially the same as
everything preceded which was already
public though not reported one wants to
know why was it suddenly leaked and
reported and here we can only speculate
but my guess is that there probably are
people inside the administration who
aren't happy about the fact that
certified lunatics have their hand very
close to the button some of them some of
them you may actually have run into on
the Stanford campus there have been a
number of leaks recently which kind of
suggests that there's a concern that you
know things may really get out of hand
even from the point of view of a lead
interests anyway that's a guess what is
not a guess is that the content of the
Nuclear Posture review as far as it was
revealed is pretty much the same as the
preceding ten years right after the end
of the Cold War you know when the Berlin
Wall fell and no more Russians there was
there were quickly discussions of
tactical changes to deal with the new
situation some of it was public and
what's public is really sufficient to
natural again but sufficient to gain an
understanding of what's happening and
where we're heading and some other
abysses into which we might appear much
deeper ones than international terrorism
in this case the first conclusion which
was correct by the Joint Chiefs was that
the u.s. is no longer facing what is
called technically a weapons rich
environment Russia is a weapons rich
environment you know particular place
kind of weapons we're not facing that
any longer we're now facing a
target-rich environment that is the rest
of the world which is a lot of targets
but not many weapons so we have the
switch planning from a weapons rich
environment to a target rich environment
in fact the target rich environment had
always been the focus of military action
but under the pretext that we were
protecting ourselves from the weapons
rich environment now that's gone the
pretext is going on also the deterrent
is gone that was understood right away
that opens up lots of new opportunities
it does require new pretexts and new
tactics the the pretexts now couldn't be
any longer that the basically the plans
remained more or less the same except
that you can out shift too many nukes
little nuclear weapons that you can use
against places that aren't weapons rich
what's called adaptive planning new
techniques for dealing with small
countries that you want to destroy and
the and the description changed the pre
takes changed so by March 19 March 1990
just a couple of months after the fall
of the Berlin Wall the public documents
of the first Bush administration
explained publicly wasn't reported but
it was public that in their
presentations to Congress about the
Pentagon why we have to have the same
old Pentagon system even though there's
no more Russians they explained that the
reason now is not that the Russians are
coming but it's the technological
sophistication of third world countries
that's the phrase that's why we need all
this stuff and we also have to target
any country that's capable of producing
weapons of mass destruction you're
listening to Noam Chomsky dissecting the
US nuclear arms buildup we'll be back in
a minute welcome back to Democracy Now
resistance radio i'm juan gonzalez
filling in for Amy Goodman as President
Bush and Russian President Putin signed
a new nuclear arms pact that paves away
for Star Wars we return to a speech by
Noam Chomsky on the role of nuclear
weapons in u.s. global domination well
let me give you some of the flavor of
the clinton-era documents which
worth listening to and you might compare
them with the current nuclear posture
review says the this is clinton the
united states should have a fitness on
this strategic command you know the
highest level part of the pentagon that
deals with strategic weapons stratum
this is from a crucial document of
theirs which was gotten on the Freedom
of Information Act couple years ago
called essentials of post-war post Cold
War deterrence so major thinking about
how to carry out what's called
deterrence deterrence of course means
attack on the in the post-war period and
it says the US should have available the
full range of responses but nuclear
weapons are the most important of these
because unlike chemical or biological
weapons the extreme destruction from a
nuclear explosion is immediate with few
if any palliatives to reduce its effect
and then it's as though we are not
likely goodness for that we're not
likely to use nuclear weapons in less
than matters of the greatest national
importance or in less than extreme
circumstances they have to be available
all the time because they cast their
shadow over any crisis or conflict and
we effort to have them then there's a
section called maintaining ambiguity and
it says it's important that planners
should not be too rational about
determining what the opponent values the
most all has to be targeted it hurts to
portray ourselves as to fully rational
and cool-headed that the United States
may become irrational and vindictive if
it's vital interests or attack should be
part of the national persona we project
it's beneficial for our strategic
posture if some elements may appear to
be potentially out of control it goes on
to say if this sounds familiar it's not
an accident nuclear weapons seem
destined to be the centerpiece of us
for the foreseeable future we must
therefore reject any no first use policy
there never has been one but we much the
Institute one we make it clear that our
reaction may either be response or
preemptive actually that notion of
pre-emptive reaction is an interesting
one which tells you what deterrence
means so we have to have pre-emptive
reaction which means undermining the
stated goal of the non-proliferation
treaty and we should not agree to any
so-called negative security assurances
that ban the use of nuclear weapons
against non-nuclear states that are
parties to the treaty all of this
apparently been confirmed by Clinton's
internal Nuclear Posture review parts of
which have been Declassified and
subsequent presidential directives so
that's that's the old Nuclear Posture
stand and the new one is not very
different interesting question is why it
was suddenly publicized heard my guess
for the future we also have to face for
ourselves now back to terrorism the fact
that small moves can be smuggled into
any country including the United States
with no difficulty there's a recent high
level technical report quoting it which
says well planned operations to smuggle
weapons of mass destruction into the
United States would have at least a
ninety percent probability of success
much higher than ICBM delivery so that
raises the question what's missile
defense about if those threats are so
enormous and the answer is the missile
defense program does have an effect on
existing threats namely it enhances them
and furthermore that's understood it's
not a secret so much of the fuss about
ballistic missile defense these days is
criticism about whether it'll work so
critics say it's not going to work too
easy to fool it but I think they're
missing the point it's much more
dangerous
it looks like it might work it's enough
for it to look as though it might work
because in this kind of deadly game
appearance and reality are the same
thing nobody can take a chance so it
looks like it might work adversaries
potential adversaries are going to have
to interpret the system as if it would
work they have to just as we would if it
was inverted and the US intelligence has
been very clear about the consequences
they point out have four years as
Clinton years that if the u.s. deploys a
system that looks realistic that's going
on quoting now that will impel China to
develop new nuclear armed missiles
expanding its arsenal tenfold probably
with Merv's multiple warheads prompting
India and Pakistan to respond with their
own build ups that then leads to a
ripple effect throughout the Middle East
in same intelligence officials predict
that Russia and China both would
increase proliferation including selling
countermeasures to such nations as North
Korea Iran and Iraq and Syria they also
point out that Russia's only rational
response to the national missile defense
system would be to maintain and
strengthen the existing Russian nuclear
force that's the analysis of US
intelligence about deploying a system
that has even a likelihood of working
the Bush administration agrees they
announced on September first that they
have no objection to Chum reading
according from a press now they have no
objection to China's plans to build up
its small fleet of nuclear missiles
that's shifting policy pretty sharply in
the hope of getting chinese acquiescence
to the then plan now implemented the
demolition of the ABM treaty for similar
reasons clinton clinton's negotiators
had already encouraged russia to adopt
its called a launch on warning strategy
computerized strategy that says you know
she is some computer census it
send off the missiles they Clinton
negotiators had urged Russia to do that
reason the same reason to try to get
them to acquiesce to programs were
carrying out some experts nuclear
experts were asked about this regarded
it as in their words pretty bizarre
because we know that the their
computerized systems are deteriorating
their warning systems are deteriorating
and full of holes prone to false alarms
that increases the threat of Russian
unauthorized accidental or erroneous
launches meaning destruction we're
finished and that increases the threat
the administration also announced plans
to number first again to share detailed
information on its missile defense
programs with China that's going to
enhance China's capacity to overcome any
us systems and also to transfer
information to others who have similar
concerns about being targeted strategic
analysts point out that that change of
policy encourages China to aim more
nuclear armed missiles missiles at the
United States and Japan with the
expected effect on Japanese and
Taiwanese programs as well as India and
then onwards same day that all this was
reported the national press also
reported independently that the US would
impose was about to impose sanctions on
China for allowing the transfer to
Pakistan of missile parts and technology
that are essentially for weapons that
can carry nuclear warheads it's all
happening at the same time the clearly
the and it's understood programs like
missile defense increase the danger of
destruction for the United States and
for others but that's just not important
and furthermore it's not new that's the
whole history of that's military history
including the history of the arms race
for the last 50 years so just think
about that 50 years ago
nineteen fifty there was only one of the
US had an overwhelming security but
there was a potential threat on the
horizon didn't exist yet but it might
come into existence that was ICBMs with
thermonuclear warheads in her cunt they
weren't around but it's in her later
they would come around what was the
reactor stood you know everybody knew
that's the that is a real potential
threat to the United States how is it
dealt with well there's a history of the
standard history the arms race by
McGeorge Bundy he was Kennedy Johnson
national security advisor yet access to
internal records and so on many rights
in his history that he could find no
record of any interest even any interest
in pursuing the possibility of banning
these things which the Russians probably
would have accepted they were so far
behind and so much more threatened by
them there's every possibility they
would have agreed to a treaty that
banned them but there was never any
interest in this even though it was the
only potential threat to the United
States and a non-trivial threat
Eisenhower once pointed out that a
nuclear war would destroy the northern
hemisphere that was a threat but there
was no interest in trying to even move
towards negotiations that might deter it
the fact of the matter is that if you
really look over history including our
own the threat to threats to survival
are considered quite a marginal ranked
rather low on the value scale as
compared with others like enhancing
global dominance that's a kind of a
constant throughout history the
difference today is the scale of the
threat which is significant and well
there's a lot of as you know lots of
Russian archives have been coming out
either people are poring over them to
see they can find some justification for
us cold war policies and there's not
much but there is some interesting
material coming out some one of the part
of what's coming out of the Russian
cuz is a confirmation of what had
already been discussed by us strategic
analyst some of them from inside the
intelligence community in the Pentagon
who left and have described it now it's
confirmed by the Russian archives the
basic story is that confirmed now by the
archival sources on both sides is that
after stalin's death well after
Khrushchev took over mid 50s his view
was that the United States and his words
was using the arms race to destroy the
far weaker Soviet economy and by that
means to obtain its goals even without
war point is he never else knew the US
economy is far larger if the u.s. runs a
extensive arms race and the Russians try
to keep up it will destroy their economy
and Khrushchev understood that that's US
policy he therefore over these strong
objections of his own military command
we know this from Russian sources he
initiated a sharp reduction in Soviet
offensive military forces and called on
the United States to reciprocate while
the Eisenhower administration considered
it then rejected it but the death blow
to this was given by the Kennedy
administration at that point first chef
made really sharp cuts called for
reciprocity it was discussed internally
and rejected I'll just quote from the
leading scholarly study of the archival
records on both sides by Matthew
evangelist he points out that the
Kennedy refusal and their choice instead
of a huge escalation of offensive
armaments he said that drove the last
nail into the coffin of Khrushchev's
agenda of restraining the Soviet
military he was kicked out soon after
that and the arms race picks up and goes
on that's confirmed by internal us
sources now we have it from both sides
the Soviet reaction to the Kennedy
escalation and rejection of the
efforts also terminated Khrushchev's
reformist programs internally they might
have averted fact it's not impossible
they would have heard us this whole
social and economic catastrophe for the
first of all a stagnation of the Soviet
economy from the 1960s which was a
result of this and the immense human
catastrophe of the past decade which is
almost historically without precedent as
well as the destruction of Afghanistan
all kind of other atrocities not to
speak of the very serious danger of
nuclear destruction has come very close
in the past 40 years but all of that was
evidently regarded as a kind of
secondary concern by the Kennedy
planners and their predecessors and
indeed their successors well without
going on with this there isn't any real
novelty in the Clinton and Bush
preferences you look over time the
correlation between security policies
and concern for security is very weak
historically the case it's the case now
the so what's the ballistic missile
defense for well the first thing to bear
in mind about it is that everyone takes
it to be an offensive weapon not a
defensive weapon and that's a kind of
doctrinal truism when you hear the word
defense you interpreted as meaning
offense and in this case it's assumed
that that's assuming both by adversaries
and by advocates so for example the
these plans have of course been
escalated all of them not just the
missile defence plans but the much
bigger plans for militarization of space
of which there are small component they
were escalated very sharply after
September 11 the Bush administration saw
kind of a window of opportunity for to
kind of exploit the fear and the
concerns of the population and the
demands for patriotism meaning you shut
up to sharply escalate its own agenda on
everything
including a major attack against the
population of destroying social welfare
systems you know about this I don't have
to go into it but also vastly expanding
the militarization programs including
the space militarization programs which
they know perfectly well pose a very
severe danger far beyond international
terrorism to the existence of not on the
United States but in this case the human
species the as I said even the small
component that's missile defense is
understood to be an offensive weapon so
China for example says just says what
everybody knows when they observe the
top officials that once the United
States believes it has both a strong
sphere and a strong shield it could lead
them to conclude that nobody can harm
the United States and they can harm
anybody they like anywhere in the world
well the US RAND Corporation the top
military analysis agency they agree in
the same words virtually they point out
that ballistic missile defense some
quoting is not simply a shield but in an
enabler of us action and the logic is
obvious you have a shield they have a
sphere pretty obvious on the end
strategic analysts degree so kind of at
the right end of the spectrum and the
journal national interest well known
analyst Andrew bacevich writes that by
insulating the homeland from reprisal
missile defense will underwrite the
capacity and willingness of the United
States to shape the environment
elsewhere and he cites approvingly
commentator from the liberal end of the
spectrum the opposite end lawrence
kaplan and the New Republic who says
missile defense isn't really meant to
protect America it's a tool for global
dominance it's about preserving
America's ability to wield power abroad
it's not about defense it's about
offense and that's exactly why we need
it he's
it'll provide the United States with
absolute freedom in using or threatening
to use force in international relations
he Kaplan then a republic repeats
China's complaint which he thinks is
correct and he proves of it namely that
it will give the United States the
opportunity to do it it wants it will in
his word cement us hegemony and make
Americans masters of the world and
that's the way things should be and for
exactly that reason he says liberal
critics are missing the point they have
things exactly backwards he says the
missile defense will facilitate the kind
of interventions that liberals champion
and therefore they should applaud it
right you get the lot you're listening
to Democracy Now and Juan Gonzalez will
be back in a moment welcome back to
Democracy Now resistance radio and Juan
Gonzalez filling in for Amy Goodman that
cut you heard was the ramones we want
the airwaves as President Bush and
Russian President Putin signed a new
nuclear arms treaty paving the way for
Star Wars today we return now to a
speech by Noam Chomsky on the role of
nuclear weapons in u.s. global
domination now there is a kind of a
problem about missile defense kind of
like a technical paradox which you can
see discussed in the you know even in
journals like say Foreign Affairs main
establishment journal the problem is
that missile defense relies on
satellites and satellites are very easy
to shoot down they're much easier to
shoot down than missiles you know
missiles you don't know where they're
going anything else satellites they're
right there you can track them is
shooting down satellites it's kind of
like poor man's technology so how can
you have if we destroy us already have
the anti ABM and treaties well that
means anti-satellite weapons are now
legitimate and that undermines the
possibility of missile defense so
they're kind of like a paradox but
there's an answer the paradox is
it's at least in some imagined world
there's an answer the answer is what's
called full-spectrum dominance that
means such overwhelming superiority over
everyone else that nobody can even use
the poor man's weapon because we will
have offensive weapons in space here's
where the rest of the story comes in
will have offensive weapons in space of
extreme destructive power probably
nuclear-powered because there's no other
way to get that much energy up there and
they'll be ready for launch with instant
computer-controlled the reaction because
can't waste any time in these cases well
that's that very much increases the risk
of total destruction mass slaughter and
destruction own if only because of what
are called in the trade literally normal
accident normal accidents are the kind
of accidents that occur in any
complicated system unpredictably you
know are going to occur you just don't
know when or why I mean anybody who has
a computer tried to install DSL or take
part like I took part today and at one
point the doors decided they weren't
going to open or something like that
that kind of thing is what's called a
normal accident and it's going to happen
in any complicated system it's even it's
almost improvable and this kind of thing
guarantees normal accidents along the
line and that once the first one happens
you can say goodbye that's the end of
everything well the goals of
militarization of space in fact go way
beyond this and this is all public
documents there's no reason not to know
it the Clinton Clinton documents of the
Space Command in charge of this stuff
they actually published brochures for
pup for public use you know like you
look at the front page it's like a kind
of thing that you know people give the
corporate executives with big words
you're lining so the dumbest person can
follow it that sort of thing on the
front page of the document called that
is one called vision for 2020 and it
announces the primary goal of
militarization of space namely
dominating the space dimension of
military operations to protect us
interests and investment and that's
described accurately as the next
plausible stage in a historic task so
inferred earlier on you know people
developed countries developed armies
like the United States they said needed
an army during the westward expansion of
the continental United States which of
course was in self-defense comment about
that and nations also built navies to
protect and enhance their commercial
interests and the next logical step is
space forces quoting still to protect us
national interests military and
commercial and investment that's just
normal that includes nuclear national
missile defense but also space-based
strike weapons enabling the application
of precision force from to and through
space so that's the next step beyond
navies but there's going to be different
from navies in one crucial respect the
British could construct a huge Navy but
it could be countered like Germany could
build a navy that counters and Japan
could build a Navy and that had certain
consequences which we don't have to talk
about but this is going to be different
the reason is that the United States
will be so far in the lead so
overwhelmingly dominate a dominant in
militarization of space and placing
destructive offensive military weapons
there on on computer control will alert
that nobody will be able to counter at
least in the imagined world that will
make the u.s. immune that's one of the
reasons why we have to vastly outspend
all adversaries and allies combined
and even increase it further requires
total dominance so nothing can counter
us hegemony which remember is for the
benefit of the world by logic and the US
will then remain immune except for one
thing that very narrowly circumscribed
category of terrorism which is allowed
to enter the cannon because somebody
else does it to us well they go on
interestingly to say that this need for
time talking about the military planners
the need for total dominance will
increase as a result of the
globalization of the world economy the
reason is that globalization is expected
to bring about a widening of the divide
between the haves and the have-nots
that's an assessment which is shared by
US intelligence and by the US academic
specialists the study was just put out
of under CIA auspices which the whole
intelligence agencies with outside
academic experts and others called the
it's a planning for the next 15 years
and their conclusion is that
globalization should proceed on course
though it's evolution will be Rocky
marked by chronic financial volatility
which instantly translates into lower
slower growth and more suffering for the
majority and also a widening economic
divide that's the prediction if
everything works right slower growth and
a widening economic divide the military
planners make the same assessment and
they are concerned that the widening
divide is going to lead to unrest among
the have-nots you know
numbers have have not and that of course
requires that the US has the force to
control it as quoting them using space
systems and planning for precision
strike from space as a counter to the
worldwide proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction by unruly elements
which is a predictable consequence of
the recommended programs and is pretty
easy in the future just as the widening
divide is an expected consequence of the
preferred form of globalization notice
that's counter to the economic theories
that are professed right according to
the economic theories that you study at
Stanford globalization is supposed to
lead to a single market right that's the
measure of international integration but
what's expected is exactly the opposite
mainly it's going to lead to a widening
divide which is correct for the form of
globalization that is intended it's not
international economic integration it's
a particular form of corporate oriented
and globalization which is sometimes
described honestly so like the Wall
Street Journal describes what would have
presented publicly as free trade
agreements they call them free
investment agreements and that's correct
that kind of globalization you expect to
reduce globalization and the technical
sense but to increase it in the
doctrinally preferred sense with much
slower growth which has been a
characteristic of the past 25 years
anyway it's going to slow even more
because of increasing financial
volatility we're suffering and a
widening divide meaning less
globalization in the sense of an
economics course but more in the sense
of reality you know preferred doctrine
at least well they could have gone on to
give them deeper historical background
that's getting late now do it but if you
look at the history of industrialization
history of industrial development you
discover very quickly there's since the
18th century of the modern industrial
revolution it's been very heavily
military based that includes the
American system of mass per day
action that amazed the world in the 19th
century which came out of armories
Springfield Armory mainly it includes
the basis of the automotive industry
century ago the main technical problems
in mechanical and electrical engineering
had to do with things like placing a
huge gun emplacement on moving object
namely ship and trying to set it up so
it could hit another moving object
namely another ship those were problems
which are kind of analogous to the
problems of space vehicles today and
working on those within the military
system made it possible to socialize the
costs and the risks means public pays
for them under the military cover but
then privatize the profits of anything
works out and that's exactly what's
expected from the current space system
and in fact anyone who looks at the
modern economy knows that's how it
developed so the so-called new economy
computers and telecommunications and all
that kind of stuff almost entirely comes
out of the very dynamic state sector
that's why if you look at the work at
the World Trade Organization rules you
know they have a thing called a national
security exemption which means that
you're allowed to violate the rules for
national security well national security
means anything having to do with the
military and for the United States that
means the whole cutting edge of the
economy for the last 50 years and for
the future and in fact the good bit of
the past and the same for other
industrial countries doesn't do Haiti
much good but for the guys who run the
world the Masters of the Universe does
them a lot of good well throughout
history it has been understood that all
of this is very dangerous and in fact
that's we have a history of wars that
tells us how dangerous it is what's
different now is just the scale and the
scale is qualitatively not slight
differences well I'm going to stop
there's a lot more to say about all of
this these are the some some not all of
the deep of this is
into which we ought to be peering the
good side of the story which there
really is less need to talk about
because we all know it and we don't have
to congratulate ourselves on
achievements but there have been plenty
of i mentioned that we're now
commemorating the 40th anniversary of
the attack on South Vietnam without any
notice the reason there's no notice is
because there was no protest at that
point and say Berkeley or anywhere else
nobody cared if the United States was
going to start bombing another country
and attack it with chemical warfare
that's fine that's what we do no
American president could conceivably do
anything like that today it took years
at that time before any protest
developed out of that protest and the
parallel civil rights movement and other
popular developments big changes took
place one change that took coming to the
changes it took place over the past 30
or 40 years have made the country at a
lot more civilized that couldn't
conceivably have been a meeting like
this 40 years ago or probably only 20
years ago there's been a constant
improvement places just a lot more
civilized in every lots of dimensions
you go back to the 1960s there was no
feminist movement there was no
environmental movement which meant
nobody cared with there's not going to
be in you know this if there won't be a
environment which our grandchildren
could survive just wasn't an issue there
were no solidarity movements no mass
anti-nuclear movement no anti-apartheid
movement no aunty sweatshop movements no
movement supposing international
economic integration of the investor
rights style which was already going on
nothing no I me know some but not very
much kind of marginal now it's enormous
furthermore its worldwide the
particularly with regard to
international economic integration the
what's ludicrously called globalization
that our free trade or one of these
other propaganda terms
that's opposition of that has been going
on extensively in the south like in
Brazil and in India for years for
decades in fact finally in the last
couple of years it hit the North in
Seattle that's why you constantly read
and when it's in the north you can't
ignore it like if it's just hundreds of
thousands of Indian peasants and so on
you can kind of pretend it's not
happening but when you see it in the
streets of Seattle it's happening so
therefore that's called the beginning of
the anti-globalization movement which is
ridiculous for one thing cuz it's not
opposed to globalization nobody sane as
opposed to that and it's not starting in
the north it's we're coming along behind
but it's a good thing because it's the
first time ever ever that there has been
a real international the beginnings of a
real international that's what's been
the core ideal of the the left and the
working-class movement since their
beginning of since their beginning in
the 19th century and this is the first
seeds of it in porto alegre in brazil a
month ago it was very impressive sixty
seventy thousand people from all over
the world south-north every possible
peasants workers environmentalists all
kinds of activists essentially working
on the same things and very seriously I
mean the descriptions than the press
which are comical are comical because
they terrified they're terrified of
what's going on and rightly what's going
on are substantial popular movements
which are completely unprecedented in
scale are growing out of the changes
that have been taking place over the
past few decades it continues a
historical course I mean there's been a
long struggle to attain more more rights
more democratic control and its
continuing and probably accelerating and
it's a tendency running counter to the
tendency towards destruction
and exactly which curve is going to move
up faster will determine the fate of the
species that question is pretty much in
the hands of people like you that was
Noam Chomsky speaking at Stanford
University last march on the dangers of
the nuclear weapons buildup and that
does it for today's program democracy
