John Stuart Mill a very significant
figure and he's quoted as saying that as
an alternative to capitalism an
alternative capitalism should involve
the replacement of capitalist relations
by real partnerships in which workers
would have a say and the governments of
productive associations in their
capacity of work providers not as owners
of capital not as managers and in this
form labor with higher capital that's
okay as far as it goes but actually a
mill went considerably farther in
important ways important enough so that
I picked it up and quoted it this is
from mill the form of association which
if mankind continued to improve must be
expected to predominate is the
association of the labourers themselves
on terms of equality collectively owning
the capital with which they carry on
their operations and working under
managers electable unremovable
by themselves notice that in this
picture there is no distinction between
workers managers and owners those who
work in the in the enterprise are the
managers and the owners of course a
broader picture which is richly
developed in much of the left literature
over the years is that these would be in
associations with self-governing
communities but as far as the workplace
itself is concerned there is no
distinction between worker manager and
owner that's an important idea to pursue
but in fact it's related to another
point that's brought up in the book
which is
probably the most radical can't comment
here but not pursue but it could be I'm
sure is in these volumes workers who
sign a labor contract sell their dignity
as stakeholders when they accept the
subordination stipulated in the contract
and they sell it for nothing given that
the pressure of unemployment makes them
accept working for almost any kind of
organization in other words the work
contract itself is illegitimate
it says illegitimate as selling yourself
into slavery and it's worth noting these
two notions interrelated if the firm not
just the corporation but any firm is a
dictatorship in which for most of our
working lives we subordinate ourselves
to tyranny with no choice there's a real
problem if the idea that workers and
stakeholders meaning people in the
community shouldn't have a voice in this
dictatorship is a step forward but John
Stuart Mill went far beyond he said
there should be no dictatorship there
should be just the association of people
who are doing productive work whatever
it may be they choose their managers and
can recall them if they don't like them
and are constantly in control over them
no division no managers no workers no
owners that's a much more extreme
position and it's the illegitimate II of
the labor contract which is pointed out
in the quote I just mentioned leads us
in that direction and in fact it's worth
mentioning that this is classical
liberalism it's not just John Stuart
Mill begins with John Locke goes to
Smith Thomas Paine Abraham Lincoln the
whole of classical liberalism until it
was pretty much destroyed by industrial
capitalism but the whole tradition of
classical liberalism holds that the work
contract is illegitimate
so for Abraham Lincoln and believe it or
not the Republican Party a major
principle was that wage labor is
distinguishable from slavery only in
that it's temporary they have a chance
to get out of it pretty soon and be a
person who is not under the control of a
master and much more interesting this
was the dominant view of the American
working class there was a very lively
labeled for us in the mid 19th century
one of its crucial ideas was essentially
this so they pointed out that the press
discusses he's working people some of
them many of them women from the farms
factory girls they were cold who were
forced to go into the mills have their
own publications artisans blacksmith and
Irish blacksmith and Boston and so on
eastern Massachusetts they pointed out
that when you go into the capitalist
system system of dictatorship but you're
moving from a system of price to wage
when an artisan sells his work for a
price he retains his person when he
sells himself to a master he loses his
person in his dignity
this is a fundamental infringement on
human rights in a free society it should
not be accepted these are directions I
think that can be pursued much further
and it's one of the many points where I
think this material offers
very good starting places for a
conversation as was mentioned that can
proceed to real serious rethinking of
the nature of society in many respects
