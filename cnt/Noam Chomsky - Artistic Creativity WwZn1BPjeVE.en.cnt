I'm interested in you saying that
meaning is primary and I'm wondering
what the implication is for creativity
do you think that artistic expression
like music or painting manifests from
that primary source and bypasses
language does artistic creativity come
from the same sources linguistic
creativity
yeah the primary source but but that it
doesn't process through linguistics
through linguistic processing at
bypasses now this was discussed is
nobody knows but it was discussed in the
a lot in the 16th and 17th centuries
18th century early aesthetic theory of
classical aesthetic theory and so on so
there was a conception actually as far
as I know it goes back to a 16th century
Spanish philosopher and one part they
was first one to talk about it and it
was developed in later centuries but he
said there are three kinds of membered
exactly there are three kinds of
intelligence one is the intelligence of
you know groups animals you know just
things reflectively the second level is
normal human intelligence which is
manifested in the essentially creative
use of language the kind of thing we all
do all the time you make up new
sentences they express those thoughts
you know and so on and so forth and then
he says is the third kind of creativity
which has actual aesthetic value and
that he said that quoting from Plato
involves a mixture of madness but
whatever that is it's beyond these two
and then there's a lot of discussion of
that do they have the same roots nobody
knows I mean there's nothing like
artistic creativity to look at
comparatively I'm you can't even find
the second level of creativity in other
organisms and what's beyond that who
knows
now that is pretty striking if you look
at the human archaeological record have
you ever looked at the Lesko paintings
for example well you know they're pretty
amazing actually my wife and I saw them
before they were closed off by now you
can't see him anymore but we were able
to get to them before the caves were
closed and you can understand how
Picasso for example react this is 40 30
40 thousand years ago and what Picasso
saw them he was stunned he said they're
the greatest modern artists and it's a
sort of strikes you that way so who
knows where it came from
