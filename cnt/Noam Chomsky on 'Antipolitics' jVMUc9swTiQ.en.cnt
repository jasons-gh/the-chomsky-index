oh the Oklahoma City bombing so bringing
the chickens home to roost well
unfortunately there's a little more
truth to that than the press is willing
to make out turned out in this case
remember the beginning they were looking
for some middle east connection and they
would have bombed anybody in sight if
they found that you could tell that
right off the didn't work so you're
stuck with the angry white men and
they're the source of that is extreme
they have every reason to be angry
there's a lot to be angry about in the
I'm assuming that the current stories
are correct at the sectors from which
this is coming there's plenty to be mad
at but I don't think people know what to
be angry about what has been created by
this half century of massive corporate
propaganda is what's called anti
politics so anything that goes wrong you
blame the government well okay there's
plenty to blame the government about but
the government is the one institution in
which that people can change
so one institution you can affect by
participation without institutional
change right that's exactly why all the
anger and fear is directed against the
government the government has a defect
it's potentially democratic corporations
have no defect
they're pure tyrannies so therefore you
want to keep corporations invisible and
focus all anger on the government so you
don't like something you know your wages
are going down blame the government you
know not blame the guys in the fortune
500 because you don't read the fortune
500 you know the thing you just read
what they tell you in the newspapers
so you don't read about the dazzling
profits and the stupendous this and the
wage is going down and so on all you
know is that the bad government's doing
something so let's get mad at the
government as I say a plenty to be mad
about about the government but the
government is exactly what Dewey
described it as it's the shadow cast by
business over Society you want to change
something change the substance not the
shadow and everyone contributes to this
including the
they're deeply committed to it you take
a look at the Clinton campaign
literature it's it's like you know it's
a public relations firm wrote it but
whatever one did it understands their
business the thing that they were
getting out at the drugstores you know
consents for their mandate for change as
they called it incidentally a slogan
that they borrowed from Eisenhower which
shows how much change they contemplated
the the first chapter of it was called
entrepreneurial economics and that was
their big economic program I explained
how these they're not old-fashioned
liberals you know believe in
entitlements getting children food to
eat and that sort of thing we're
interested in entrepreneurial economics
now you go on to describe it and it's
very really carefully very interesting
to see how the mind of the commissar
works you know the really skilled
propagandas guys who get trained in the
good universities the way it works is
like this entrepreneurial economics
involves workers and their firms it's
all about workers and their firms you
know anybody who works in a firm can
tell you how much is their firms
so there's workers and their firms and
then there's the government which is
going to try to help out the workers and
their firms the work there's a couple of
words that don't appear in it like
profits you know bosses managers they're
not investors banks they don't appear
just the workers and their firms there
are entrepreneurs who have a kind of a
shadowy existence they're sort of nice
guys who live in the Sloan School or
somewhere and every once in a while they
come around and they sort of help out
the workers and their firms and then
they kind of disappear somewhere and
that's the economic that's
entrepreneurial economics well ok you
know that's the kind of thing you're
taught to do in good universities to put
things that way and that's the Democrats
know when you got that on one side and
on the other side you got you know I
hate the government because they're
responsible for everything in its taxes
and the the pointy-headed bureaucrats in
Washington but not the ones in the
insurance offices you end up with a mood
of what is called anti politics and ante
politics is a very
Guerry phenomenon it can take the form
of that it is taking you know forming
what shouldn't be called malicious
because remember militias are things
raised by States these are just private
armies forming private armies to defend
the country the people against you know
the UN forces being brought in on the
black helicopters by the Council on
Foreign Relations to commit genocide or
whatever story alike or else it's you
know fight against Lucifer and beast 66
who's doing this that and the other
thing and that's what if you take a look
across the country that's what people
are worried about and fighting against
aliens you know the devil the UN forces
the federal reserve I mean everything
except what's real namely private
private area private corporate power the
guys that were listed in the fortune 500
well that's an achievement
that's a propaganda achievement and
while the anger and the fear is real and
it's based on something and you got to
sympathize with it because it is real
when your wages have dropped 25 percent
roughly and say 15 years and you know
your wife has to work and your kids
can't eat and so on and so forth you
have no future and everything's rotten
you have a lot to be angry about but
people are not focused on what's doing
that's the difference between the days
in which there was a live functioning
labor movement that was organizing these
people exactly these people work
together to change things
