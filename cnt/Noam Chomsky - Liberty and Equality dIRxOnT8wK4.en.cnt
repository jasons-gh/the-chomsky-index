I think the great question of not only
you know practical politics but of
political theory or is how do you
balance the needs of liberty and
equality because those two impulses
always seem to be in conflict
conservatism would put in a sort of an
extreme emphasis on individual liberty
and sort of neglect equality liberals
you can argue probably one a little bit
of both and radicals or they're
anarchists communists or socialists
would in some sense lean more toward
equality over liberty I'm just curious
to know from you how do you think first
up do you think there is a tension
between liberty and equality and
secondly how do we best create a society
that balances those two tensions the
idea that there's a conflict between
them is ideological dogma we don't know
that there's a conflict between them and
in fact classical liberals didn't think
there was so it takes a Adam Smith who
were supposed to revere but not Reid is
one of his core arguments for markets he
had rather nuanced arguments for markets
but one of the basic ones was that as he
said in a free society markets will lead
to equality and he meant equality of
outcome not equality of opportunity no
he met equality of outcome which he took
for granted to be a deserter out him
well that was one of his core arguments
for markets uh the under particular
social and economic conditions you get
different results but I don't think
there's anything generally can be said
about this I was gonna say cuz Adam
Smith and I actually didn't read my Adam
Smith one of the reasons he believed in
markets was because he was anti
monopolies and that he viewed you know
these concentrations of power as
inherently dangerous to Liberty is that
accurate that's correct
and he was opposed to mercantilism
structures which have been reconstructed
in many ways in modern corporations yeah
he was strongly opposed to that in fact
when the modern corporation that wasn't
introduced by state power about a
century ago classical liberals
conservatives they were often called
literally condemned it is return to
feudalism
