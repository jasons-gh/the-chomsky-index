I mean face-to-face contact and the
virtual reality you know contacting
somebody somewhere who maybe doesn't
exist to accept in your mind and so on
that has its negative side even at best
on the other hand it is a way of and has
been used pretty efficiently in fact to
mobilize people to get information to
them they wouldn't get otherwise to
it'sit's been a spur to significant
action actually takes a East Timor which
is something I've been working on three
years the change in the scale of the
popular movement after the technology
came in is very dramatic I mean before
that it was a matter of waiting for your
friends in Australia to medias and
clippings now
lots of information is around very fast
and people are doing good things with it
and this is largely because a few people
like Charlie shiner and White Plains are
using it intelligently it can be done
and it can have a positive effect and
there are a lot of things like that so
it's you know what what happens to it is
going to depend on the interaction of
corporate power and popular forces and I
don't think it's predictable anymore and
it was predictable stay with radio or
television or cable or anything else
it's something that can be worked on so
are there other alternatives plenty of
them I mean for example now it's
possible to with desktop publishing it's
possible to publish extremely cheaply
something like say is the magazine is
published literally by two people it
would have taken a big staff and you
know angels and so on and so forth just
a couple of years ago and and the tech
in effect for the third world that
technology is incredible it sounds like
but in fact for third world countries
desktop publishing is a dream it's very
cheap it's way cheaper than printing
presses and all this sort of thing and
it enables a few people to do it even in
their spare time sometimes and the same
is true here it offers lots of
possibilities and the I think it's true
of technology in general it really
offers lots possibilities depends who's
got their hand on the lever so what
extent is General Electric influencing
American nuclear weapons policy General
Electric a nuclear weapons policy I mean
I don't think they care much to true
them and as long as in fact takes a
nuclear power right now they're not
interested in pushing it very much and
the reason is it's not cost effective on
nuclear weapons policy thankfully doubt
that the board of directors of G cares a
lot one way or another but I don't see
why they should care what we were just
talking about it in schooling and we
learned that they do know better
sorry we were talking about that issue
in school and we learned that they do in
funds
sorry I can't they are influencing
foreign policy I mean gg yeah oh they're
influencing foreign policy not foreign
policy but nuclear weapons policy and
that they have a big nuclear weapons
industry well they sort of the way and
they certainly are not on ege but lots
of other corporations are part of the
nuclear system and make money from it
and so on and so forth but I really
don't think it's a major issue for them
now I mean they don't care about the
nuclear weapons but they might care
about his nuclear power but right now
that for just business reasons doesn't
look very cost-effective remember that
oil the price of oil is now down to
about water
think about what it was in the fifties
but it's very cheap now in fact it is
part of the reason for the sanctions on
Iraq just to keep more oil from getting
into the market because so they don't
want the price to go down to lows price
goes down too low it starts harming the
American economy because the air energy
companies are American and a lot of
money pours in you recycle Petro dollars
so they it's always been and has always
been an effort to try to keep oil prices
within a certain band not too high not
too low now they're getting too low but
one effect of that is that one
consequence of that is that nuclear
power is not economical as far as I'm
aware at least the big corporations are
not all that interested in pushing it
you can even see cutbacks and versus
rather significant cutbacks and funding
for the longer term possible you know
for the long term longer term
possibilities for nuclear power like the
you know the whole things there on the
border are being cut back the big
reactors the efficient research stuff
like that
which simply means that the big
corporations are right now don't see as
AI priority I think they may change
their mind but you know I don't I'm
really speculating I don't have any more
information about that you do but I
don't see whether it should be much
interested in nuclear weapons policy and
I'm not aware of any thing specific
good evening my name is Corky day and
I've long worked in the alternative
media bill asked earlier if the
fragmentation of the media could be good
you said the situation was more of
concentration of the media but in the
alternative media we are being
fragmented aren't we as alternative
journalists spreading ourselves too
thinly and wouldn't we be better off
with fewer
stronger and bigger alternative yes I I
didn't realize that the question was
about alternative yeah I thought it was
about the mainstream media so yeah ok
let's talk about the alternative media
well there is tiny fragmentation but now
let me make what's deeper on the same
wavelength I mean one thing that's going
on is a lot of very local very special
issues sort of things which don't
interact much with one another that kind
of fragmentation may reflect something
with at some level a healthy that is
interested in a wide range of things but
it's a nolo I don't think it's a very
healthy phenomenon in general I think
that's in fact why you're getting things
like the Buchanan phenomenon it's part
of the the the core concerns of great
many people and rightfully have been
sort of abandoned by fragmentation of
special interests on the list if that's
what you mean I think yes something to
worry about
yes yeah that's part of it right but in
fact I strongly agree with it that's why
somebody like me can and can come in and
pick me and I just basically pick up
slogans that he's taken from the left
and turn them into a monstrosity because
the people who ought to be doing it
aren't there are many of them engage
there many of them and they're engaging
good things but very narrowly focused
often and off the main track of most
people's concern
that's the problem I think it's been a
significant problem I've written about
it for quite a while and spoken about it
a lot myself but I've always felt I felt
for a long time that that's a serious
problem
and one that people who regard
themselves you know who feel that you
know they are part of the effort to
extend justice freedom things that are
called for less they ought to really be
worried about me thinking about sorry
are you encouraging them to get together
more only in the sense that I'm trying
to do it now I mean I think it's not I
think it's it one I think it's a
dangerous tendency and you got to
overcome it from within so yes if that's
encouraging sure I think good it it
would seem to me that I mean you know I
don't know like I'm not suggesting a
party line or anything I don't encourage
in that sense but I do think it's a
question of fundamental importance and I
think good the left has very much harmed
itself by not taking it seriously
and is causing serious harm in the
society at large of which something like
the Buchanan phenomenon is a reflection
I mean there was a section of the Nazis
that did the same thing you know the
left wing left wing of the Nazis had
slogans to the left and may well have
meant them but they worked them into
this crazed more general system and
that's what you find in the Buchanan
phenomenon he really is appealing to
people upon too many people on issues
that they have every right to be
concerned about and nobody else was
talking any sense to them so that wasn't
this crazy stuff it seems to me that a
public education is a major tool could
be a potential major tool for
manufacture
and said she's the term for descent you
know it's kind of like technology it
depends what you do with it yes I mean
the public education system at least in
the United States was set up pretty much
as a socializing system it was really
set up primarily to sort of take
independent farmers and put them into
factories something almost like that
actually Emerson once said we're
educating them to keep them from leaping
at our throats and
