you wrote in one of your essays but in
addition society everyone would have the
opportunity to find interesting work and
each person would be permitted for this
possible scope for his talents then you
went on to ask what more would be
required in particular extrinsic reward
in the form of wealth and part only if
we assume that applying one's talents
and interesting and socially useful work
is not rewarding in itself and I think
that that line of reasoning is certainly
one of the things that appeals to a lot
of people but it still needs to be
explained I think why the kind of work
which people would find interesting and
appealing or fulfilling to do would
coincide at all closely with the kind of
work which your needs to become if we're
able to say anything likely than be
living which people demand the values -
well there's a certain amount of work
that just has to be done if we were to
maintain that standard of living it's an
open question how owner is that work has
to be let's recall that Science and
Technology and intellect have not been
devoted to examining that question or to
overcoming the onerous and
self-destructive character of the
necessary work of society the reason is
that it has always been assumed that
there is a substantial body of wage
slaves who will do it simply because
otherwise they'll starve
however if human intelligence is turned
to the question of how to make the
necessary work of society itself
meaningful we don't know what the answer
will be what my guess is that a fair
amount of it can be made entirely
tolerable it's a mistake to think that
even back-breaking physical labor is
necessarily owners many people I
included do it for relaxation if it's
under our own control part time and so
on well this weekend for example I got
it into my head to plant 34 trees and a
meadow out behind the house for example
in the state Conservation Commission
which meant I had two big 34 holes in
the sand well let's you know for me and
what I do with my time mostly pretty
hard work but I have to admit I enjoyed
it I wouldn't have enjoyed it if I had
work norms
had an overseer if I'd been ordered to
do at a certain moment and so on on the
other hand if it's a task taken out of
just interest time it can be done and I
think that a good and that's without any
technology without any you know without
any thought given to how to design
working sorry I put it to you but there
may be a danger that this view of things
is a rather romantic delusion and
contained only by a small elite of
people who happen like professors
perhaps owners and so on to be in the
very privileged situation of having jobs
in terms of their pay to do what anyway
they like to do that's why I began with
a big if I say we first have to ask to
what extent would be let's call it the
necessary work of society mainly that
work which is required to maintain the
standard of living we want question
first question is to what extent need
this being onerous and undesirable
that's an unknown question I think much
less than it is today but let's assume
there is some extent to which it remains
owners well in that case the answer is
quite simple that work simply has to be
shared has to be equally shared among
people capable of doing it and beyond
that number Latvia wasn't on our okay
will be a productive island setting all
that is collecting the garbage and if it
turns out that these are really tasks
which people will find no soft
fulfilment in incidentally I don't quite
believe it as I watch people work
craftsmen let's say automobile mechanics
for example I think one often finds a
good deal of pride in work I think kind
of fact I think that that kind of pride
and work well done and the in
complicated work well done because it
takes sought and intelligence to do it
especially when one is also involved in
management of the enterprise
determination of how the work will be
organized what it's for what its what
the purposes of the work are what will
happen to it and so on and thinking all
of this can be satisfying rewarding
activity which in fact requires skills
and which the kind of skills that people
will enjoy exercising however I am
thinking hypothetically now suppose it
turns out that there is some residue of
work which really no one wants to do
whatever that may be ok then I say that
that residue of work must be equally
earth and beyond that people will be
free to exercise their talents as they
see fit my pretension professor that if
that residue were very large as some
people would say it was like a cabbage
revenge the work involved in producing
90% of what we all want to consume then
the organization of sharing it on the
basis that everybody a little bit a
little bit of all the nasty jobs would
become wildly inefficient social even
the nasty job you have to be trained to
do and equipped to be and that the
efficiency of the home economy would
suffer and therefore the standard living
which exclaims would be produced well
one thing not at what and I think this
is really quite hypothetical because I
don't believe that the figures or
anything like that as I say it seems to
me that if human intelligence were
devoted to asking how technology can
design to fit be designed to fit the
needs of the human producer instead of
conversely that is now we ask how the
human being with his special properties
can be fitted into a technological
system designed for other ends and we
production for profit my feeling is that
if that we're done we resign but the
really unwanted work is far smaller than
you suggest but whatever it is let's say
whatever amount it is notice that we
have two alternatives one alternative is
to have it equally shared the other is
to design social institutions so that
some group of people will be simply
compelled do that work on pain of
starvation those are the two
alternatives
well not given those not composed to it
but they might agree to do it vocally
because they were paid to do it in the
length which they felt maybe bookbub
well but see I'm assuming that everyone
essentially gets to essentially equal
remuneration don't forget that we're not
talking about a society now where the
perhaps you are where the people who are
do the owners work are paid
substantially more than the people who
do the work that they do on choice quite
the opposite
at the way our society works the way any
class society works the people who do
the unwanted work are the ones who are
paid least that is that work is done and
we put it out of our minds because it's
assumed that there will be a massive
class of people who cannot whose only to
control only one factor of production
mainly their labor and have to sell it
and they'll have to do that work
there's nothing else to do and they'll
be paid very little for it now one can
imagine so let's accept the correction
what's imagine three kinds of society
one the current one in which the
undesired work is given to wage slaves
that's the current system system let's
imagine a second system in which the
undesired work after the best efforts to
make it meaningful the undesired work is
shared and let's imagine a third system
where the undesired work receives high
extra pay so that individuals
voluntarily choose to do it well it
seems to me that neither of the two
latter systems are consistent with
vaguely speaking anarchist principles I
myself would argue for the second rather
than the third but either of the two is
quite remote from any present social
organization or any tendency in
contemporary social organization
let me put development to in the another
way it seems to me that there is a
fundamental choice however one is guided
it as to whether you will organize work
for the satisfaction that gives the
people to do it or whether you get
organizers on the basis of the value of
what is produced - the people are going
to use or consume what is produced and
that a society which is it were was
organized on the basis of giving a word
of the maximum opportunity to fulfill
their hobbies which is essentially the
work for what trick it finds it -
logical combination here in a monastery
where as it were the kind of work which
is done is namely prayer is work for the
self enrichment of the work and where
nothing is produced which is very useful
anybody and you live either the most
undeserving very waxy stuff so there are
some factual assumptions here and I
disagree with you with other factual
assumptions my feeling is with part of
what makes work meaningful is that it is
it does have use that its product who
have use work the work of the craftsmen
is in part meaningful to that craftsmen
because of the intelligence and skill
that he puts into it but also in part
because the work is useful and I might
say the things true the scientists I
mean the fact that the kind of work you
do may lead to something else that's
what needed
they contribute to something else that's
very important quite apart from the
elegance and beauty of what you may
achieve and I think that that covers
every field of human endeavor
furthermore I think that if we look at a
good part of human history you will find
the people to a substantial extent did
get some degree of satisfaction often a
lot of satisfaction from the productive
and creative work that they were doing
and I think that the chances for that
are enormous were enhanced by
industrialization why precisely because
much of the most meaningless drudgery
can be taken over by change which means
that the scope for really creative human
work is substantially enlarged now you
speak of work truly undertaken as hobby
but I don't believe that I think work
freely undertaken can be useful
meaningful work done well also you pose
a dilemma which many people pose between
the desire for satisfaction work and the
desire to create things of value this
community but it's not so obvious but
that's a dilemma that that's
contradiction it's by no means clear in
fact I think it's false that
contributing to the enhancement of
pleasure and satisfaction work is
inversely proportional to contributing
to the value investor a possible but it
might be unrelated I mean take some very
simple things like selling ice creams on
the beach on a public holiday it's a
it's a service to society and I think
people want the ice cream person hot on
the other hand it's hard to see in what
sense there is a good either across from
these joy or a great sense of social
virtual mobility in performing that
touch y-yes I must say at all aunt asked
if they were not rewarded for asking
some very Kuryakin ice cream vendors you
all know rightly ideal of money and I
haven't liked the idea that they're
giving children ice cream which seems to
me a perfectly reasonable way to spend
ones time as compared with thousands of
other occupations that I can imagine
recall that a person has an occupation
and seems to me that most of the
occupations that exist especially the
ones that involve what are called
service that is relations beginning
beings have an intrinsic satisfaction
and reward associated with them mainly
in the dealings with the human beings
that are involved that's teaching and
true as ice-cream vending I agree that
ice creams ending doesn't require the
commitment of intelligence that teaching
does and maybe for that reason it will
be a less desire to occupation but if so
it will have to be shared however what
I'm saying is that we are characteristic
assumption that pleasure and work pride
and work is either unrelated to or
negatively related to the value of the
output that's an assumption which is
related to a particular stage of social
history namely capitalism in which human
beings are tools of production is by no
means necessarily true for example you
know I filled the field if you look at
interviews with workers on assembly
lines for example that have been done
over and over again by people do
industrial psychology you find that one
of the things that complain about over
and over again is the fact that their
work simply can't be well done the fact
that the assembly line goes through so
fast that they cannot do their work
properly their pride and craftsmanship
is itself to mean it let let me just
mention another well I just have to look
recently studies longevity Journal of
gerontology I know I was reading that
and it tried to trace the factors that
you could use to predict longevity
length of life and you know cigarette
smoking drinking genetic factors
everything would look that turned out to
the fact that it was the highest
predicted and a successful predictor
with job satisfaction not if you have
not you live long people who are
satisfied with your jobs now what leads
to job satisfaction it I think that
makes the deal sense you know because
that's where you spend your life and
that's where your creative activities
are now what leads to job satisfaction
well I think many things lead to it and
the knowledge that you're doing
something useful to the community is an
important part of it which many people
feel I mean many people feel and many
people are satisfied with their work are
people who feel that what they're doing
is important to do they can be teachers
they can be doctors they can be
scientists they can be craftsmen they
can be farmers I mean I think the
feeling that what you're doing is
important is worth doing you know
contributes to those with whom you had
social bonds that's a very significant
factor in in one's personal satisfaction
and over and above that there's the
pride in undersell fulfillment that
comes from a job well done from simply
taking your skills and putting them
deuce I don't see any reason why that
should be why that should in any way
harm in fact I just think that that
would enhance the value of what's
produced but let's imagine skill that at
some level it does harm
well okay at that point to society the
community has to decide how to make
compromises each individual is both the
producer and consumer after all and that
means that each individual has to join
in those socially determined compromises
if in fact there are compromises and
again I feel that the nature of the
compromise is much exaggerated because
of the distorting prism of the a really
courses and softest trim personally
destructive
