Hi everybody, this is DAI Heidelberg online channel daiHOME, free of charge.
Donations are welcome. We are very happy today to have a special guest, the famous
linguist laureate professor who taught at MIT half a century and is now
teaching at Arizona the renowned political dissident Noam Chomsky who
joins us for a conversation from his home in Tucson Arizona, where he is
sheltering with his wife Valeria. Hi Noam!" "Hi. How are you?" "Fine. Today the United
Nations celebrate the humanity of the human rights day while we face the
erosion and the Doomsday Clock shows about a hundreds seconds before 12, so
all data seem to say "rebellion or apocalypse".. What is your advice for us?"
"We're in a very unusual moment, a unique moment in human history. The Doomsday
Clock, which you mentioned, illustrates it.  I'm sure you all know every January The
Bulletin of Atomic Scientists brings together distinguished scientists and
political analysts try to give an assessment of the security situation in
the world. They've been doing it since 1947. It's encapsulated in the Doomsday
Clock, certain number of certain the minute hand is a certain distance from
midnight. Ever since Trump was elected the minute
hand has been moving closer to midnight. Two years ago it reached the closest
point it had ever been since 1947, when it was initiated. This last January they
abandoned minutes and moved to seconds. As you say it's now a hundred seconds to
midnight. Midnight means terminal disaster. Since January Trump has been
acting in ways which moved the second hand even closer to midnight. Recall that
there are three issues that the analysts focused on: One is the increasing threat
of nuclear war. Trump has since escalated the threat, he had already
abandoned the INF treaty, has now abandoned the Open Skies treaty, which
goes back to Eisenhower. The last treaty is the New START treaty. The Trump
administration has imposed frivolous conditions on any negotiation to ensure
that it will not be settled. I mean they're
developing new nuclear weapons. The Trump administration is calling for new
nuclear tests for the first time in 28 years violating the treaty. Second issue
is the enormous risk of growing environmental catastrophe that Trump has
been escalating that, they're perfectly openly incidentally in his February 2020
budget proposal for the next year he called for - this is while the pandemic is
raging - he called for continuing to
reduce funding, as he's been doing for the last four years to continue to
reduce funding for the Center for Disease Control and all health related
elements of the government. And to increase subsidies for the fossil fuel
industries and of course for the military.
Meanwhile his administration is making use of the pandemic cover to eliminate
regulations, which somehow mitigate somewhat mitigate the effects
of global warming and protect Americans from the lethal effects of pollution. So
that's increasing. The third issue that they raised was the deterioration of
democracy. At first that sounds as if it doesn't belong with the two existential
threats but it in fact does, because they vibrant functioning participatory
democracy is the only possible hope for escaping from the two major threatening
disasters. Well what's Trump been doing on that tearing to shreds the remnants
of American functioning democracy. He has already eliminated from the
executive branch, any independent voice all that is left is cowardly psycho fans
there are inspectors general established by Congress to monitor executive branch
the corruption and malfeasance. They were beginning to look into the swamp that
Trump has created in Washington. He fired them or eliminated them, they're purged.
Today's news, look at the newspaper ,he wants to purge the Pentagon of anyone
who is not sufficiently loyal to him. This  goes step by step trying to
eliminate the formal aspects of functioning democracy. That democracy
doesn't rely on laws.  British democracy is 350 years old.The
Constitution is maybe a dozen words. It relies on trust and good faith. If you don't
have those, you can have beautiful Constitution the way Stalin did it,
doesn't make any difference. This is dismantling every component of
functioning democracy to try to turn the country not towards fascism. Fascism is
well above Trump's comprehension level. That was an
ideology couldn't understand that . This is turning the country into a small
tin-pot dictatorship of the kind you find in the neo-colonial societies where
there's a coup of a couple of years, and it's run by a megalomaniac whose only
interest is himself. Now that's the objective and it's being carried forward,
so if the Doomsday Clock were set now, second hand would move closer to
midnight. What can we do about it? Almost everything. Europe does not
have to capitulate to this. Europe has so far been so cowardly that it capitulates
to every move made by the Trump administration: the tortoise shreds, the
Iran nuclear deal, which was working very well,
raising growing threat of war in the Middle East, the severe threat.
Europe doesn't like it, but they go along,  they don't do anything to objective it
and this is the case. The same is true of everything else." "Noam, it it's so
shocking in a way. You mention nuclear power, but in fact in none of the
newspapers we read, we ever see that kind of headline. We see another
headline, that's racism at the moment. We see black lives matter, we see
the argument of full prisons, we see many other signs of riots, we see police force
questioned. Why is the nuclear threat so invisible?" "It's invisible here, too  - I mean you
can find discussion of it and the arms control journals. Occasionally you see a
report but basically nothing. In fact it's rather striking that in the
campaign that is underway in the United States which of course has
enormous publicity,  there is almost no mention of any of the
three things that the Doomsday Clock registered. Most no talk
about the growing threat of nuclear war. Even very little commentary on the
growing environmental catastrophe that which is quite serious. On the racism
issue: it's not a small point and what is happening is very significant. The
demonstrations around the country,  overwhelmingly peaceful demonstrations with
enormous public support are completely unprecedented. There's been nothing like
them: scale solidarity, black solidarity popular support. And it's a very belated
beginning of a recognition of 400 years of vicious repression, which
has left a very bitter legacy, not just police violence. So I mentioned that
Trump is eliminating regulations on emissions like carbon dioxide and other
emissions. Well they happen to poison the atmosphere.
We're in the middle of a respiratory lung pandemic. Pollution in the
atmosphere increases that significantly. So the regulation says not only "Let's
destroy the environment." but "Let's poison Americans in the middle of it by making
the respiratory disease worse." Who suffers from this?The people who live
near the polluting plants. Of course they can't afford to live anywhere else. Who
are they? Mostly black, because of the legacy of racism. So this everywhere you
look, you find this. Again, this aspect of it is not being discussed but
should be. But as for why the European press is not focusing on the main issues,
you'll have to tell me. They're very serious. I mean the pandemic is
a very serious affair. We should be asking why it came at all. If we don't
get to the roots of the reason why it's here, it will recur in a harsher form.
Scientists are telling us right now exactly what they did in 2003, after the
SARS epidemic. That another pandemic is coming probably a corona virus, could be
worse than this one, exacerbated by global warming. And they are telling us
exactly what we have to do about it. We didn't do it in 2003, we have to do it
now. And that is barely being discussed. Meanwhile of the Arctic ice sheets are
melting,  that's inexorable. There's undermining of
the huge glaciers in the West Antarctic. We're on a course, which within a
generation will make most of the habitable world
almost unlivable: large parts of South Asia, the Middle East, Africa. All of
this is taking place.  That means, well most countries are
doing at least something about it, not enough.
That's something the Trump administration alone among the developed
societies is racing toward the abyss as rapidly and enthusiastically as we can:
more use of fossil fuels including the most polluting of them, eliminating
regulations on automotive emissions. Some of what's going on is almost
indescribable. I give you one example: one of the Trump administration
bureaucracies, national transformation transportation administration, years ago
published a detailed environmental assessment. A couple hundred pages
detailed analysis of what's happening to the environment.They predicted, that if
we continue on our current course, by the end of the century the global
temperatures will have risen four degrees centigrade over pre-industrial
levels. That's Cataclysm and they make a
recommendation that we eliminate emissions controls on automobiles.
Understand? We're heading for total catastrophe so
therefore let's eliminate the controls that are mitigating it to some extent. If
there's a document like this in human history,
I'd like to see it. The only thing that comes to mind to me is the Wahnsee
declaration, but that doesn't compare in evil to this. Hitler was saying "Let's
kill all the Jews, the 30 million Slavs,  Roma and others." He didn't say "Let's
destroy organized human society." But that's what they're saying. Do you have a
headline about that?" "So 2020 that is a probably the most crucial election
in human history. Do you think we can actually make a change, will that be a
change?" "It's very incertain. If you look at
polls, it seems that the Trump is far behind. But that's quite misleading. First of
all, polls are not voter. Voters are skewed segments of the polls. We don't
know what they'll do. Also we have to remember the electoral college in
the United States. In 2016 Trump lost the popular vote by about 3
million, but won the electoral college. All that's necessary is a few selected
counties and a few states might swing the electoral college. There's also a
serious question being raised at the highest level, that's weather if
Trump loses the electoral college he will leave office.
That's a question not out of the  fringe, it's being raised right at the
highest level. This is a not a normal person. This is not a person of the kind
who has ever been seen in Western parliamentary systems,
maybe Hitler was one. If he loses the electoral college is perfectly capable
of saying, that the vote was faked, that there were illegal immigrants voting, we're
going to stay here, I'm calling out my armed militias to protect the White
House. Then what happens depends on the military and that's why what happened
this morning is not insignificant. He's purging the military, trying to at
least of all but Trmup loyalists. I think there's a reason for that, they're
thinking of these possibilities. This may sound exotic, unfortunately it's not. Even
the Democratic presidential candidate said "If we have to take him
out of the White House we'll do it by force." We're not talking about something
out of the fringe." "Do you think that the Bernie Sanders movement will
probably influence this? It's a broad,  a youthful movement in a way. Will they
be capable of making a contribution to the outcome of this election?" "That's
happening. Sanders and his associates have begun to engage in the Democratic
National Committee program and they have shifted the program quite far to the
left. In fact, if you take a look at Biden's program it's the most
progressive of any Democratic candidate probably since FDR. So they're
influencing the program. The activists are making a difference. If they continue,
that's crucial - they don't go home, if they continue that
can have an effec. The public opinion can't be disregarded even in a
dictatorship and we're very far from the dictators. So yes, they are having an
effect and can have a greater effect. But we're coming to a very severe problem. I
should say in the background is something different. If none
of this was happening, if there was no Trump if the country was continuing on
the normal parliamentary course it would still be facing a serious constitutional
crisis a very serious one. The US Constitution in the 18th century was a
progressive document even the phrase "We the people"
was a very impressive move. The continuous what was called a
revolution terrified European statesman. King George, the third of England said
he heard the whole British Empire bizarre and marinate warned about the
rise of this threat of republicanism, which will destroy all civilized society.
Well that was the 18th century to adhere to an 18th century constitution today
it's very regressive. If the United States were to try to enter the European
Union with its current constitutional structure, it would be turned down by the
European Court of Justice almost certainly. The Senate which is the
most powerful part of the formerly is radically undemocratic.
The state of Wyoming with 500,000 people has two senators. California with
40 million people has two senators. This affects the electoral colleges, will
excuse the electoral college towards the smaller states. Beyond that there are
demographic changes so eternity the votes there's an increasing urbanization
but that's not affected by the voting. It means that rural air enough
plenty of gerrymandering in the most the Republican parties working overtime to
try to prevent voting. They're very much afraid of voting because what they're
hoping for and what the constitutional crisis is leading to is that a small
part of the population maybe 15 or 20 percent that's mostly rural, conservative,
the Christian, white supremacist, elderly, now that sector
could actually govern the country, the way the constitutional system is set up.
And there's nothing that can be done about it. The only way to change it would be
by constitutional amendments and the smaller states will never have enough
votes to prevent that. So there's quite a serious constitutional crisis coming."
"What about the GOP, the grand old party,  the republicans.
They're considered dead, you considered them the most dangerous organization of
the world." "The Republican Party ceased to be a normal parliamentary party quite
a few years ago, not my opinion two of some of the leading political analysts
from the conservative American Enterprise instead
Norman Ornstein and Thomas Mann wrote years ago that the Republican Party has
become in their words "A radical insurgency, which does not observe
parliamentary programs" we saw that very clearly when Obama was elected. The
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell not at the moment,
two years late,  Mitch McConnell the Senate the Republican majority leader of
the Senate announced openly that the sole goal of the Senate will be to
prevent Obama from doing anything. That's the end of the kind of trust and
good faith on which democracy rests. The Republicans have profits through
probably 30 or so efforts to try to overthrow the Affordable Care Act. Right
now, in the midst of a pandemic, they are supporting a suit in the courts to
eliminate the health system. I mean this is not a normal political party. This is
a group of extreme reactionaries who know that there are minority but are
doing everything they can to hold on to power. You take a look at the Senate
under McConnell the last couple of years. It blocks all legislative
proposals that come from the house. The way the system works legislative
proposals come from themselves in house considered by the Senate and joint
meetings. They all block. What the Senate is doing is two things:
passing legislation to enrich the very rich and the corporate sector like
the tax bill and the new bills that are passing right now. And stuffing the
judiciary from top to bottom with young ultra-right
lawyers who will be able to block any legislation for a generation that
departs from their ultra reactionary position. They are trying to destroy the
functioning democratic system, because if they try to survive within it,
they will never win another election.
Radames note said openly, if we allow a voting, Republicans will
never be elected, because too many people who vote." What about the role of
the media? You once said Trump and Murdock cooperate in this destruction of
the United States as well as the world." "The Murdock system includes primarily
for Fox News major television channel now plus lots of others so the talk
radio the radio that people listen to when they're at home or driving has
been totally taken over by extreme far right groups which are even righter than
Fox News. There's a major temp but Fox News itself has a very interesting
relationship with President Trump. Fox is the new source the main news source, almost
the only news source for most Republicans, there are studies on this. Fox News is an
echo chamber for the White House. If Trump says of the coronaviruses is just
a flu, Fox News announces "corona virus is just a flu, don't worry about it." If
Trump was to announced tomorrow that the world is flat, they will say
"greatest discovery in human history". But that's only half of it.
Trump doesn't pay attention to the news. He doesn't pay attention to intelligence
reports. In the morning he turnes on Fox News and that tells him what to
say. What's on Fox News. So there's a dyad, a kind of a mutual echo chamber
which is what the Republican constituency watches and that's why you
have the results that you have. Say global warming is the most serious
challenge that humans have ever faced,  except for a nuclear war. 22% of
Republicans think that humans have some role in global warming, 22%.
The same percentage think that's a problem that is important to deal with.
What's happening in the most important
country in the world is shocking and Europe is just as bad. They're doing
nothing about it just cowtowering to the power in Washington. I mentioned one
thing that's true and everything else. They don't have too. Europe could be
a force in world affairs." "So in this terrible arena,
what actually gives you hope? Is that there is an attempt for Green Deal, new
deal, there are youngsters on the move, they are even gangsters in Brazil
who do what the president is obviously not capable for doing for his
citizens. Cuban doctors go to Italy. So there are obviously signs of
encouraging aspects. What do you see as a hope in in a kind of sustainable sense
of the word?" "Exactly that and it's very substantial. The black
lives movement protests in the United States, they can reach very far
to the social groups of racism, the institutional structures,  that lie behind
the racism. The D crisis over the last several hundred years and they're very
broad. They affect the whole community the whole society. I'll take the green
new deal which you mentioned. A couple of years ago nobody was discussing. A group
of young activists sunries movement were pressing very hard for it
they finally occupied congressional offices, they got some support from the
new young Congress women who came in on the Trump wave also from a Democratic
senator in Massachusetts Ed Markey. Now it's in the center of the legislative
program. Some form of green New Deal, well another form is essential for survival.
Now that shows what can be done. As I mentioned the Sanders movement
has been oppressing and succeeding and moving the Democratic Party programs, the
will, towards the Social Democratic side. We should recognize, that what's called
the Sanders revolution in Europe would be considered mild social democracy.
Let's take a look at Sanders as two major programs which are considered
revolutionary in the United States. The radical programs universal health care
You heard of a country that hasn't? You  heard of a country that doesn't have it? A free
higher education. Ever hear of a country that hasn't? Now those are considered so
radical, that we don't know if the American people can tolerate.
Sanders is moving with a lot of the population behind him, he is probably the
most popular political figure in the country, towards a kind of social justice,
social democracy, extension of the New Deal, the programs that Eisenhower
wouldn't have been surprised by. It's a sign of the sharp shift to the right of
the political issue on not the public during the neoliberal period and now
that's being reversed. That's a sign of real hope. Similar things are
happening in Europe. Well the Progressive International which was just announced a
couple of weeks ago at its first major meeting in September in Iceland with
the prime ministers. Remeber, this is initiated by the Sanders campaign in the
United States by Yanis Varoufakis and the diem25 movement in Europe,
transnational movement, bringing in voices from the global South. If that can
get off the ground could be a major counter force to the developments that
are taking place, to the efforts by those who created the system to try to
perpetuate it. Now that's a conflict which is very significant at the moment.
How it turns it's kind of almost you could almost call it a class conflict on
the international scale. How that turns out will determine whether organized
human society can survive." "Now the virus was considered the great or is sometimes
presented as the great equalizer between rich and poor. In fact the poor pay a
terrible price in it. Now we see the governments around the world trying to
have programs in trillions of dollars. What will that make in this process,
that is ahead of us?" "First of all it may be called a great equalizer but it is
the opposite. If you take a look at the impact on I don't know the European
figures. But in the United States take a look at the figures on inequality,
they've risen. The people who are gaining from the crisis are billionaires, private
equity firms, hedge funds, Amazon.They are gaining tens of billions of dollars.
In fact there was just a study, during the pandemic some tax revisions were
taking place, that presumably have to deal with the pandemic. It turns out that 80% of
the gains from the tax changes go to people who make a salary an income of
more than a million dollars a year. That's the great equalizer. Meanwhile as
I mentioned pollution controls are being eliminated which will rate increase the
pandemic, the respiratory crisis, among people living near polluting plants,
black and poor. That's the great equalizer. People in power know what
they're doing. They're not in favor of providing the poor and vulnerable people
with gifts. They're in favor of providing gifts for themselves. Well if they can
get away with it gonna be a great equalizer. So the question is: how the
public will respond to these developments? And we're back to where we
were. But there are steps towards it, but it's gonna be." "Noam, now just two
final little questions. A crucial point will be or is considered here
the choice of the running mate for Biden, whom do you have in mind?
There are several black women that are suggested. Do you have one guess
for us?" "My guess doesn't mean much but off the cuff I would yes it's very likely he
will pick Kamala Harris, my guess doesn't mean anything so don't pay attention to it." "May I add a very
personal question: four years ago we sat together and against the two of us
Valeria, your wife predicted the success of Donald Trump in this presidential. Does
Valeria have an idea for the outcome this year?" "Valeria is the the only
person I know who predicted the Trump victory in 2016. She's not here but I have to call to her,
current prediction is that Trump will lose the election. So since
she has a perfect record so far, maybe she's right.
However bear in mind what I said before and what people in high places up to the
Democratic Party candidate are saying. If he loses the election that's not
necessarily the end." "Now we had a few questions of people coming in
let me just take one talk about globalization. Do you think the
rapid spread of the corona virus will be regarded as a downside of globalization
and therefore lead to a global counter movement with more nationalized
industrial production what consequences would stem from this?" "First of all
globalization is a fine thing. But the fact that you and I could be
together four years ago that's globalization. The question is what form
of globalization. Now a particular form of globalization has been developed
under the neoliberal model which basically holds that decisions have to
be in the hands of private unaccountable power. That's the major principle of
neoliberalism. Can be dressed up in other terms but that's what it comes down to.
When Ronald Reagan says "government is the problem not the solution" that means
hand decisions, take decisions away from government which has the flaw that it
can be influenced by people, turn it over into the hands of unaccountable private
tyrannies corporations in which people have no influence.
That's how globalization was formed what are called free trade agreements or in
fact investor rights agreements. They have almost nothing to do with free
trade. The form of globalization that was established was to try to maximize
profit and you maximize profit if you have no spare capacity. If you're running
an automobile plant and you want to maximize profit you make sure that you
have no waste capacity meaning no security. If anything goes wrong well you
can fix up the assembly line. When you run a world like that it's a disaster.
The globalized system that was set up is extremely fragile. If anything goes wrong
it collapses. In fact we even see that in the health system not compared Germany
in the United States. Germany delayed on dealing with pandemic but it finally did
it. Germany had spare capacity diagnostic
capacities, spirit health capacities. Another health
system was able to reduce the number of deaths. The United States had the same
basically the same number of cases, still does, because the health system is run on
a business model, a strict neoliberal business model: no spare beds no spare
capacity, almost totally privatized health system, huge salaries.
You're after profit. Same with the
globalized system. One thing that is very likely to happen is that there will be a
shift towards less fragility and more security. I felt if the corporate
managers who run the world under the neoliberal system, if they
prevail, nothing much different is going to change.
Just less fragility more more security." "There's a special attention given to
a very American issue that's weapon lobbyists. Can you imagine how these
militant and violent actions enter the campaign of the election?"
"It's already entering. I don't know how much the news reaches you but was the
report of what happened in Bethel,  small village in Ohio about two
weeks ago. Well I tell you in case it wasn't. It's now happening all over the
Midwes. This is a small village,  couple thousand people, six
policemen nothing ever happens. A few people decided to have a small peaceful
march to support the protest the nationwide protests on racism. The
village was assaulted by about seven or eight hundred militia troops armed
militias, smashing the place up overwhelming the police force, driving
people back to their homes, calling for denouncing the protest and so on. Now
this is happening all over the country. In the state of Wisconsin are these
armed militia. Demonstrators actually took over this the legislature. It's a
serious phenomena and Trump is supporting them all the way. I
should mention some statistics who were recently released. Take a look at
terrorism in the United States and threats of terrorism. There is
a huge amount but it's substantial. In 2016, 20 percent of the
terrorism and terrorism threats was connected to white supremacy and 2018
it's 98 percent and it increased in 2019. Now it's almost all.
That's related to the tweets that you see coming out of the White House, which
stimulate this. When the legislature was occupied in Wisconsin, Trump tweeted
"These are good people very good people." You know about Charlotteswill, it's always
there and you notice, what he's doing. That's part of his constituency and he's
got a voting constituency. His actual constituency is the super-rich and the
corporate sector. All the legislation goes to serve them, but you have to have
a voting constituency. You can't go to ask people to vote for you by telling
them I'm tryna undermine you and support the very rich. No I don't vote for you
that way. So you have to appeal on what are called cultural issues,
religious extremism, 25 percent of the country's evangelical vote for them.
White racism, white supremacy. The second amendment, which is a force. I could go into
that but no it's holding rid. You have to have your assault rifle with you, when
you go into a coffee shop. So will appeal to them on tha,t and this is part
of the support of the militia. And it's a serious phenomenal." "Yeah, we have seen them in Tulsa
at his campaign, that people were standing there with guns at the
entrance to this place and they can actually openly wear." "The law says
you can carry guns openl. I teach at the University of Arizona, when you come to
the gate of the University there's a sign saying no weapons allowe. Now
that's a constant battle between the University and the state legislation,
which wants to open the university too to open carry of guns. In the state of Texas
that's already permitted. I have a friend,  a hundred years old,
assisted living place way out in the suburbs. You go to visit him, nice house
with elderly people - there's a sign on the door saying "no weapons allowed." I mean, there's not much time but
I'll be brief -  the whole history is a con job. In the late 19th century the gun
manufacturers realized that they don't have a market for their fancy weapons. The
Civil War was a great market. European Wars were a great market. There was
declining. Nobody wanted the fancy weapons they produced. But it was an
agricultural society every farmer had a weapon. But it was like a shovel.
You wanted the old rifle the scary coyotes away. They wouldn't buy the fancy
weapons, so they started the first huge public relations effort in history.
A huge campaign to try to concoct fables about the Wild West which never existed.
You know nowadays everybody sees them on cowboy movies nor existed the sheriff
who's fast on the draw. I mean I
believed,  when I was a kid, we used to play this game it was all invented and the
subtext was "You have to buy your son a Winchester rifle or else he's not a real
man."  So they started buying this. That was bad enough. Then came 2008 the most
reactionary Supreme Court in his modern history.
She changed the meaning of the Second Amendment. She read the Second Amendment
it says "In order to establish a well or militia the right to hold guns shall not
be infringed." That was the 18th century
and they had reasons for it. One is they were afraid the British were coming for
good reasons. They were the big power and there was almost no standing army so you
needed minutemen and the other was they were invading the Indian country, that was
part of the reasons for the Revolutionary War. To be able to invade
the West, you needed guns. Thirdly it was slavery. There were slave revolutions, you
needed guns. Those are the reasons why the founders wanted guns and a militia.
And that's for a hundred years the court decision was having guns
was connected to a militia right. That was reversed in 2008, the Scalia decision
said it's an individual right, nothing to do with militias. That turned the
Second Amendment in the Holy Writ and now it's to ask most people what's in
the Constitution the only thing they'll know is the second aendment, which is that
right to carry an assault rifl, when we go into a coffee shop. The judgment is
astonishing. It mentions none of the reasons why the founders established the
Second Amendment. These are supposed to be originalists, you know people who
observe the original text and meaning of the terms for the founders, not in this
case. Jjust let's make individual rights to guns the Holy Writ
and you'll notice that every time Trump issues a tweet supporting some
action, he says "you have to defend your second Amendment rights" even if it has
absolutely nothing to do with it. Why? Because that's the rallying cry. That's
the way you get your voters together to vote for you, even when you're
stabbing them in the back. It's a very effective trick. And
I'm afraid I have to leave." "Yes thank you very much, and thanks also to Valeria for
keeping a strict regime on your health. We are all very grateful for you sort of
participating in this and thank you very much for your generous time." "Good to see
you, we might make it anytime in person on these." "Yes, hopefully"
"Thank you."
