you've said before that enlightenment
ideals as well as the principles of
classical liberalism have influenced
your own political philosophies could
you just comment on some of the
philosophers in particular who have had
an impact on you it's a little
misleading because in general my own
picture of how the world works and the
way it oughta work was I've pretty well
been formed before I became familiar
with the intellectual and tradition the
Enlightenment and earlier tradition so
it's not so much an influence as just a
recognition and an understanding a
deeper understanding of the way I think
things would work but you know there are
there are philosophers and political
thinkers and others who whose work I
find very congenial in many ways some
way is not all I could written about
some of them but I think we've least my
experiences we form our own ideas we
experience participation by where lives
work or associations what we do to try
to change the world and then we read
things that give substance and direction
and often the deeper roots to it
anyhow my experience
