but they were both subordinate to u.s
power
so it was okay interesting uh professor
chomsky when you travel
the breadth of the muslim world all the
way from morocco
to indonesia as north as chechnya to
asaph as tanzania
millions of muslims still positively
talk about
the notion of a caliphate a caliphate
which was part of islamic history for
nearly for
the best part of 1400 years it was a
polity which
muslims believe was left to them by the
prophet muhammad
and of course the word caliphate let's
put isis aside let's put al-qaeda aside
let's put these kind of groups aside
it is no it is not unheard of to go any
part of the muslim world today
and you will find many many people
fondly talking about
a caliphate where why cannot arab states
or muslim states
come together like the europeans have or
like other
uh countries have as as regional powers
what is why can't the muslims have a
caliphate if we
wanted one via you know if this was
something which
reflected our cultural religious
uh you know values and morals and so
forth
and obviously one of the biggest
propaganda message of the war on terror
was the emergence of a caliphate
so i want to ask you how real of a
threat
was the notion of a caliphate to the u.s
right now there's actually one contender
for that position
erdogan that's clearly what he's aiming
at
he wants to restore something like the
ottoman
empire with the center in
istanbul and him being
the successor of the caliphate but
the obstacles to that are pretty obvious
can we can we hit can we hear some of
the what are the obstacles can we hear
it
what are some of the obstacles well take
a look at libya
where turkish and uh gulf arab
forces are fighting each other with
proxies
saudi arabia gulf dictatorships are
obvious obstacles it's not
obviously not going to bring in iran
it's uh the nationalist forces are
opposed to it the international forces
are opposed to it
but let's think for a moment about the
ottoman empire
the last time there was a caliber yeah
and
it was very brutal in many ways there
were plenty of things wrong with it
but there were also some positive
aspects to it
there were so for example in the levant
yeah people were pretty much left alone
the greeks could run their affairs the
armenians would run their affairs
this sunni group could run their affairs
partly out of incompetence partly
because of
lack of power the situation was
fairly fluid on the ground which pretty
much
fit the nature of the societies
and remember under the you could travel
from cairo
to baghdad to constantinople
without crossing any borders you didn't
need a password
that's one complex web
uh mentioned i yeah i mean
i mean i mean professor chomsky it's
interesting that you mentioned this
if you go to if you speak to people who
are 80 90 plus
who are still alive and the stories they
heard from their grandparents i'm
talking about
the levant i'm talking about
you know parts of the muslim world which
was under ottoman rule
they'll say that yes the ottomans were
not perfect they weren't perfect
they had their many issues but it was a
far better successful model in terms of
amalgamating and establishing some
relative peace than the nation states
that followed after is destruction
um and i and and many muslims find it
unfortunate i myself as
a graduate of politics a journalist by
profession
it's of concern that when we even
not romanticize or nostalgia but when
you talk about
real facts and that is that the ottomans
managed to keep
peace and stability in a region which
now after its destruction has been
marred by war and invasion and
occupation
and it's a sentiment which millions of
muslims have
do you feel that it's understandable why
many muslims would have that sentiment
when they look back at ottoman the
ottoman period and compare it to the
situation
of the middle east and north africa over
the last 90 years
well i think the picture that you're
describing
from people my age incidentally
so something i can remember it's
partially romanticized it wasn't
that pretty but there's a lot of truth
to it it is true that the
complex mosaic of cultures
societies that constitutes the region
was left pretty much in place you could
move from one place to another you could
control
your own local affairs pretty well
now that i think makes sense i've long
believed
that we should be moving
take the israel-palestine conflict
i think the only real hope for any
sensible solution for that is within the
framework of a
regional integration which
uh softens and erodes the national
borders
that were imposed by imperial power
remember the borders
are all artificial when i
crossed into lebanon 70 years ago and
i was crossing an artificial border at
that point it wasn't even marked
uh and that's not that far from the time
that these people you're talking about
were
thinking about and that's what it should
go back to
this doesn't make any these these lines
in the
on the border make no sense from the
point of view the people living there
they were imposed by imperial force for
the benefit of the
imperial powers in that region mostly
france and britain
and it's causing enormous difficulties
you can groups that don't belong
together fighting each other
groups that do belong together blocked
by borders
i mean it's an unnatural system how
unnatural it is we can see from the
history of europe
remember that it took centuries of
violent
bloody murderous conflict for those
borders to be as
for the nation-states of europe to be
established
they didn't just come like that under
the 30 years war in the
17th century killed about a third of the
population of germany
what's now germany okay
was peaceful uh two world wars
weren't peaceful those were the efforts
to establish the borders of
what are now european states and in fact
very quickly sensibly after the
last great mutual slaughter europe began
to move towards somewhat eroding
those borders which are not natural
borders
none of them are like neither the one
that's
a couple of miles south of me that's not
a natural border either
it's imposed by imperial violence
okay and they should be eroded but we do
want what was more positive about the
ottoman empire
namely the local independence and
freedom
and the absence of artificial boundaries
that's the favorable part kind of like
the schengen agreement in europe
the favorable part of the european union
there's also
a highly negative parts like the
centralization of power out of popular
control
color would be another form of that so i
don't think any
all of these systems have elements
that are worth pursuing other elements
that
should be abandoned and eliminated
but we shouldn't live under the illusion
that the
nation state was some natural state of
human beings
it's a recent development created by
horrendous war and violence and it
doesn't answer to people's needs
professor norm chomsky it was an
absolute pleasure speaking to you this
evening
you know thank you very much for giving
your time um i'm very sorry that we can
have you on for longer but the time that
you did give us
we're very honored to have you on thank
you very much thank you it's my pleasure
thank you very much
