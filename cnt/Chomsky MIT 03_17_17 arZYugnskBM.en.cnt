[Applause]
I know you're clapping for me anyway on
behalf of the MIT Center for
International Studies I'm Michele as
director of public programs and would
like to welcome to today's star forum
which I'm delighted to see that everyone
got the memo and first however I'd like
to mention a few housekeeping items we
have several upcoming events that we
hope you're able to attend the most
recent one will be on April 6th with the
former foreign secretary of the UK Jack
Straw he will speak on brexit Europe and
Trump on April 11 yes we've got a lot of
good events in store for us on April
11th we have an event on digital
innovation and Africa which will explore
the consequences of Africa's leapfrog
into new technologies and on April 12th
we have a book talk with ambassador
Celso Amorim he's Brazil's former
Minister of Foreign Relations his book
is entitled acting globally memoirs of
Brazil's assertive foreign policy
details for these talks and others are
available on our website or you can pick
up a flyer on your way out today's talk
will conclude with a Q&A from the
audience for those asking questions we
really need you to line up behind the
mics we also ask that you are considered
of time and of others who want to ask
questions because this is a question and
answer session not a personal statement
session
[Applause]
finally it's truly an honor to introduce
a man who needs no introduction please
join me in welcoming Noam Chomsky
[Applause]
[Music]
first question as always as can you hear
me yeah okay for quite a few years I've
been intrigued by an interesting debate
that took place about 25 years ago
between two great scientists Carl Sagan
and Smyre they were discussing the
likelihood of finding intelligent life
extraterrestrial intelligent life and
Sagan who looked at it from the point of
view of an astrophysicist calculated the
number of planets more or less like
Earth and concluded that the chances are
quite high
Meyer looking at it as a biologist said
look we have only one test case namely
Earth which has had about 50 billion
species and we can raise the question
whether what are the criteria for
biological success on earth with 50
thousand 50 billion cases to look at and
he pointed out that there is a striking
regularity the species that are
successful that a lot of them around
basically are those that mutate quickly
like bacteria or those that have a fixed
niche like beetles and they just stay
there no matter what happens and as you
move up the scale of what we call
intelligence a biological success
declines so they're not many mammals
there are very few Apes the only reason
there's a lot of cows is because we
domesticate them but by and large
biological success declines as
intelligence increases humans look like
an exception but that's a statistical
blip just tiny moment of
evolutionary time lasts a couple
thousand years actually so his
conclusion is that I'll quote him the
history of life on earth refutes the
claim that it is better to be smart than
to be stupid it should what a chose in
fact is it's much better to be stupid
than smart that's the conclusion he also
points out that the average lifespan of
a species is about a hundred thousand
years we've doubled it we're about two
hundred thousand so we're a little
beyond the expected extinction point
well that's the question I want to
consider today is it better to be smart
than stupid was addressed recently by a
very good Indian writer ami tough Ghosh
has a book called the great arrangement
climate change and the unthinkable and
in fact our failure to address the most
awesome challenge of human history with
the possible exception of nuclear
weapons is indeed a true arrangement and
painful evidence for the plausibility of
Myers thesis that it's better to be
stupid than smart well these are the two
existential challenges that overwhelmed
anything else completely overshadow all
other discussions and their severity and
their imminence is illustrated
graphically by the famous Doomsday Clock
of The Bulletin of American scientists
was initiated in 1947 right at the dawn
of the nuclear age in 2015 and again in
2016 it was moved the hand was moved
forward midnight means we're finished
the hand was moved forward to three
minutes to midnight that's the closest
that had been to midnight since the
early 1980s when the
major war scare the early Reagan years
the reasons that they gave were the
mounting threat of nuclear war and the
failure to deal with climate change I'll
quote what they said is at the time the
probability of global catastrophe is
very high and the actions - needed to
reduce the risks of disaster must be
taken very soon
that was 2016 at the outset of the Trump
term they found on quoting the danger to
be even greater the need for action more
urgent and they moved the clock to two
and a half minutes to midnight the clock
is ticking global danger looms that's
the closest to terminal disaster since
1953 when the United States and Russia
exploded their H bombs well there is an
important difference between these two
extension threats if by some miracle we
escape nuclear disaster and anyone who
looks at the shocking record will
realize that it's a miracle that we've
gotten this far but if by some miracle
we do escape at least we know in
principle how to end the plague get rid
of the scourge global warming is
different it's inexorable that we might
pass a point of no return when the
damage that we've done is simply
uncontrollable they're reversible that
it might not be far off well the human
species is right now undertaking an
experiment to answer to determine the
answer to ernst myers question is it
better to be smart than stupid and to
examine what i'd like to do now is to
examine the course of the experiment
just by picking a few dates so let's
start with today could be any day but
we'll start with today
if you looked at this morning's
newspapers you see a report on how we're
dealing with the - existential crises
one on the nuclear threat Christopher
Ford the national security council
senior director for weapons of mass
destruction and counter proliferation
under the trump administration he
advises that we should reconsider the
unrealistic goal of a world without
nuclear weapons that has been advocated
among others by extremist peaceniks like
Henry Kissinger George Shultz Sam Nunn
and William Perry and the reason for
abandoning this unrealistic goal of
these utopians is Russia's increased
aggressiveness which is incidentally a
charge that's dismantled quite
effectively in the current issue of
radical rag that's worth reading now and
then Foreign Affairs the main
establishment journal on global warming
today this morning the National snow and
ice data center reports that the Arctic
has less sea ice at winters end now than
ever before
that means more dark ocean hence more
absorption of solar energy more warming
and we're in a feedback loop and you
know what that means
the mean temperature for November was 23
degrees above normal and at some points
in the last couple of months it went to
more than 35 degrees warmer than normal
well that's today's good news let's go
back to yesterday quote from the
Washington Post water temperatures at
the surface of the Gulf of Mexico and
near South Florida are on fire they
spurred a historically warm winter from
Houston to Miami in the Gulf the average
sea surface temperature
never fell below 73 degrees over the
winter for the first time on record
Galveston Texas has tied or broken an
astonishing 33 record highs since
November 1st while neighboring Houston
had its warmest winter on record at both
cities have witnessed precious few days
with below normal temperatures since
late fall and on and on will I apologize
if this is unfair but I can't refrain
from quoting one of the comments by a
reader on this news report he says the
Republicans have all this under control
the plan is to have Jeff Sessions and
Ted Cruz's dad stand at the shoreline
with Bibles in hand as as the sky
darkens and the water rises they will
raise their left hand holding the Bible
and command the Seas to settle and if
that fails plan B is to run like hell
and to blame Obama which
couldn't say it's better it's a classic
and it captures the spirit of the times
very accurately well there was a second
report yesterday in the business press
of Bloomberg Businessweek
the headline was the oil boom is back
and I'll quote it the number of oil and
gas rigs drilling in the United States
has almost doubled since bottoming out
at the lowest level in more than 75
years of records while two dozen nations
are coordinating to cut oil production
and rein in the global supply glut US
producers are moving in the opposite
direction over the last four months
output increased by half a million
barrels a day
and if that rate of expansion continues
the shale boom will break new production
records by summer the u.s. now produces
9 million barrels a day we're way in the
lead well this illustrates a very
crucial fact of current history the
world outside the United States is
taking steps halting steps but steps
towards facing the existential challenge
to survival meanwhile the United States
virtually alone is racing towards
destruction with enthusiasm and
dedication which is quite a remarkable
fact now of course the oil industry has
plenty of help and helping and moving as
quickly as it can to destroy the chances
for survival
the IMF reports that the fossil fuel
industry extracts a 700 billion dollar
annual taxpayer subsidy which is not in
the crosshairs of Mike Mulvaney I'm sure
and the industry doesn't take chances in
2016 it spent 117 million in campaign
contributions while fielding 720
lobbyists in Washington to make sure
that Congress gets the message and
apparently it does it's a recent
Washington Post article which reports
that many Republicans in Congress do
recognize the severe threat of climate
change but they won't talk about it
because of funding pressures from the
fossil fuel industry that's particularly
true since citizens united open the
floodgates even wider for a flood of
corporate political funding which means
you throw the corporate line or you're
out
well that's yesterday these reports are
quite typical of the daily fare pick
almost any day and find similar things
well let's continue to review the
experiment that humans are undertaking
I'll just pick a few recent dates from
the last few months so start with
November 8 that was an important day in
history for several reasons several
events took place on November 8th one of
them was very important a second one was
extremely important and the third was
absolutely astonishing the very
important one was the election in the
United States plenty of coverage of that
so I don't talk about it the extremely
important one took place in Morocco in
Morocco on November 8th the about 200
countries were gathering in it's called
cop 22 the international conference to
try under UN auspices to try to deal
with the problem of global warming the
that with the goal of the conference was
to put some teeth into the Paris
negotiations the year before
cop21 December 2015 that conference had
aimed to establish a verified
viable treaty but it couldn't do it for
one reason the Republican Congress would
not accept any binding commitments so
therefore the world had to settle for
something less namely informal
agreements and cop 22 in Marrakech
Morocco was supposed to carry this
forward well on November 8th conference
began on November 8th the World
Meteorological Association delivered a
report which in their words confirms
that 2016 was the warmest year on record
a remarkable 1.1 degrees centigrade
above the pre-industrial period sharply
above the previous record set the year
before and in fact approaching the
desired limit that was set in Paris as
the gold and other dire reports which I
won't read but you can pick them up on
the internet if you want well that was
the World Meteorological Association but
then the deliberations essentially ended
the election results came in from the
United States the conference essentially
person stopped nothing more to discuss
the only question was whether it would
be possible to salvage anything from the
wreckage with the world's most important
country the richest most powerful
country in world history did declare
having all three branches of government
committed to racing to destruction what
could be done and there was some hope
they looked at one country as the
possible Savior namely China that was
November 8th the extremely important
event on November 8th the conference
went on but concluded without issue well
the third event was absolutely
astonishing namely the leader of the
free world is leading the world to
disaster the world is looking to China
to save it and what's the reaction
silence not a word about it
pick up the newspapers
November 9th listen to BBC on November
9th and the days that followed and you
see nothing about this there's one of
the most astounding events in history
the world's most powerful country most
powerful country in history
extraordinary advantages incomparable
racing to lead the world disaster and
the world is hoping that maybe China can
somehow save us can you think of an
event like that in history not a word
about it that's the astonishing fact of
November 8th well that's November 8th
let's move forward to March first talk
about both the world and the United
States in the world a study was released
showing that tens of thousands of miles
of permafrost in Northwest Canada are
rapidly melting along with accelerating
decline of permafrost in Alaska Siberia
and Scandinavia and it pointed out that
this could lead to massive huge release
of greenhouse gases co2 and methane
which is accelerated of course by the
unprecedented Arctic heat wave which
gets radically worse every year that's
the world in the United States the Trump
administration on March 1st decided to
help the process along by rescinding the
so called methane rule which limits
release of methane from oil and grass
dillings drilling sites on federal lands
so that's a way of accelerating the oil
boom and increasing the flow of methane
into the atmosphere of methane is far
more dangerous than co2 even though it's
short-lived that was also on March 1st
announcements of sharp cuts in the
Environmental Protection Agency staff
and programs and also an edict banning
research we don't want to learn about
these things that was March 1st let's
turn to March 16th
the world a new study was released on
the damage to the Great Barrier Reef one
of the world's greatest living
structures which is damaged that's quite
intensifying and the report said that
it's by moat by far the most widespread
and damaging of recent mass bleaching
zuv coral reef since 1998 with
wide-ranging disastrous effects that
most of you know about well that was the
world the United States on March 16th
the Trump budget was released
Environmental Protection Agency is
virtually dismantled it's now pretty
much run by Senator Inhofe and his
associates Inhofe for years has been the
leading climate change denier in the
Senate he's an extreme fundamentalist
and his position is that if God is
warming the earth so be it it would be
sacrilegious to interfere with God's
will that's the view in the most
powerful advanced sophisticated country
in the world and that's the least of it
for action and research on climate of
the EPA is actually a small actor a far
more important is the Department of
Energy it's now in the hands of a guy
who had decided to get rid of it a
couple of years ago before he learned
that it controls nuclear weapons so we'd
better keep it but not entirely the
office of science according to the
budget is in the Department of Energy is
scheduled to lose 900 million dollars
that's nearly 20% of its budget it's 300
million ARPA energy program is
eliminated completely that's along with
deep cuts and research programs at the
EPA and the NOAA the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration and also
a 5 percent cut to nasan's earth science
budget well the budget generally
is of unusual savagery even for the Paul
Ryan wing of the Republican
establishment which is effectively
running the show now behind the Trump
Spicer Twitter facade that's designed to
grab the headlines every day the budget
if you look at it is a vicious attack on
working class and the poor a lavish is
even more gifts on the wealthy and the
corporate sector and along with the
process that you can only describe I
think as the Taliban ization of America
in accord with the bannin sessions the
voz ideal of a society which they've
described based on judeo-christian
tradition the white supremacy
destruction of the humanities arts
public schooling and on the side medical
research that's the goal towards which
were aiming at home while we race
towards destruction internationally well
practically every issue of science
journals provides more grim forecasts
those of you who read the science
journals regularly are familiar with
this so one recent paper in atmospheric
chemistry and physics by James Hansen
eighteen other scientists carries out a
comparison between today's climate and
the climate of one hundred and twenty
thousand years ago which had
approximately the same temperatures or
slightly warmer temperatures than today
that led 120,000 years ago to a
sea-level rise of 20 to 30 feet when
much of the polar ice disintegrated the
paper predicts in the near future near
future killer storms stronger than any
in modern times disintegration of large
parts of the polar ice sheets leading to
melting of huge glaciers that's taking
place
rapidly especially in the Antarctic
which the most dangerous and they
predict the rise of sea a sufficient to
begin drowning the world's coastal
cities before the end of the century
Hansen says we're in danger of handing
young people a situation that's out of
their control with precipitous rises in
sea level not too far down the road
other dire consequences there are other
studies that indicate that climate
change is occurring faster than at any
time over the last hundred million years
by some estimates far faster last years
you probably know atmospheric co2 past
the symbolic level of four hundred
particles per million that's considered
a crucial danger point that's the first
time in four million years and possibly
irreversible well that's only a small
sample of many such reports they're
constantly in the major science journals
sometimes making it to the media
meanwhile the Republican wrecking
machine is systematically dismantling
the institutions that offer some hope
for decent survival and it's not just
Trump it's the whole Republican Party
leadership at the national level and
also at much of the local level so in
North Carolina for example a couple
years ago there was a scientific study
commissioned by the Coastal Resources
Commission and it estimated that the sea
level will rise by 39 inches by the end
of the century there was a response by
the Republican run State Legislature
they passed a law that barred state and
local agencies from developing
regulations or planning documents
anticipating a rise in sea level
rational reaction there was a pretty
good comment on it by Stephen Colbert
he said this is a brilliant solution if
your science gives you a result you
don't like pass a law saying the result
is illegal problem solved that captures
quite well the mentality of the
Republican Party leadership a few years
ago Bobby Jindal the Republican governor
who succeeded in sinking Louisiana even
deeper into the abyss
he warned Republicans that they are
becoming what he called the stupid party
the respected conservative political
analysts Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein
of the right-wing American Enterprise
Institute they described the party or
maybe the former party as a radical
insurgency that has abandoned
parliamentary democracy perhaps a
simpler characterization is the utterly
outrageous charge that they are the most
dangerous organization in human history
dedicated to the prospects to ending the
prospects for human survival that is
outrageous no doubt but more interesting
question is whether it's wrong leave
that to you to think about well I
already mentioned Paris 2015 cop21
Marcos 2016 those are two crucial
examples the 2016 primary campaign was
quite remarkable in many respects
primarily those that weren't discussed
namely the attitude of the candidates to
climate change which barely got a word
of commentary every single candidate
denied that what is happening is
happening with the exception of the
sensible moderates like Jeb Bush who
said it's uncertain but we don't have to
do anything because we're producing more
natural
thanks to fracking or John Kasich who
was supposed to be the adult in the room
who did at least agree that global
warming is probably happening but he
said he's governor of Ohio he said we're
going to burn coal in Ohio and we're not
going to apologize for it
that's the sensible guy the meat as far
as the media were concerned they ignored
it
it was almost nothing mentioned about
this after all it's only the most
important issue in human history and you
can't really blame the media for this
because they're following a concept of
objectivity that's taught in journalism
schools objectivity means reporting
accurately what's going on within the
beltway in Washington circles so you got
a report actually accurately what
they're saying there if you talk about
something else
it's bias or opinion or something but
it's not genuine reporting
so since what's going on within the
Beltway including the Democrats
incidentally is denial or ignoring or in
the case of Republicans flatly denying
what's happening is happening then you
don't report it because some within the
Beltway it's not objective
well even sea-level rise that's much
more limited than what's anticipated is
going to inundate coastal cities and
more significantly coastal plains like
in Bangladesh where there will soon be
tens of millions of people fleeing
probably in the fairly near future these
are flat planes which are going to be
inundated and many more later that's
going to make today's refugee issue a
tea party the chief environmental
scientist in Bangladesh says that these
migrants should have the right to move
to the countries from which all these
greenhouse gases are coming
millions should be able to go to the
United States that just fits the current
mood and what has long been the richest
and safest country in the world and also
the most terrified and those who think
it's better in Europe can turn to a
recent poll showing that a majority of
Europeans want a total ban on
immigration from Muslim majority
countries so the idea is first we
destroy them then we punish them for
trying to escape from the ruins that
we've created and we have a name for it
we called it a refugee crisis
well thousands of people desperate
people drown in the Mediterranean
fleeing from Africa where Europe has a
certain history with which you're not
unfamiliar in fact the and the same is
true of the United States and Central
America of course and the Middle East
and in fact the so called refugee crisis
is actually a serious severe moral and
cultural crisis in the West well these
two existential crises are related
the Himalayan glaciers are melting and
in the not-too-distant future that could
threaten the water supplies in South
Asia which are already at dangerously
low levels so 300 million people in
India are reported to lack adequate
drinking water right now that could very
easily spark conflict between India and
Pakistan two nuclear-armed States
constantly at the brink of nuclear war
right now in fact a nuclear war would
destroy India and Pakistan but much
worse than that
could very well lead to nuclear winter
meaning global famine which pretty much
ends organized human life on work on
earth which is not very removed if you
think it through well that leads us to
one final date to look at one of the
most important dates of human history
namely the end of world war two it was a
moment of joy but also of horror with
the dawn of the nuclear age I can
remember very well my own feelings on
August 6th horror at the events and
their constant implications their import
an astonishment that so few people seem
to care about it
either about the enormity of what had
just happened or about the fact that we
had entered into what may well be the
final era of human existence the nuclear
age the moment when human intelligence
had succeeded in developing the means to
instantaneously destroy us all
in 1947 shortly after the Doomsday Clock
was instituted and the hand was set then
at seven minutes to midnight we're now
remember at two and a half well we have
not only entered the nuclear age but
also the so-called Anthropocene a new
geological epoch in which human activity
is dramatically changing the environment
now there have been debates about the
improper date - for the inception of the
Anthropocene but the world geological
society has made its decision it settled
on 1950 as the beginning of the
Anthropocene that's partly because of
radioactive elements that were dispersed
across the planet by the nuclear bomb
tests and other consequences of human
action including the sharp increase in
greenhouse emissions so the nuclear age
and the
servicing basically coincide these are
epochs of the post-world War two period
we are also now well into what's called
the sixth extinction it's expected to be
similar to the fifth extinction that was
66 million years ago when a huge
asteroid hit the earth destroyed 75
percent of species ended the age of the
dinosaurs
it opened way for small mammals to
survive and to expand and evolve and
ultimately become us about 200 thousand
years ago for a long time the humans had
fairly limited impact but by now in the
post-war period we've succeeded in
becoming the next asteroid destroying
species at an enormous rate perhaps
ourselves not too far in the distance
now there are careful studies of species
extinction and they have some
interesting results they show that this
extinction is different from its
predecessors in an interesting respect
of the earlier ones where species
neutral species just disappeared across
the board and this one it's different
it's mostly larger animals that are
disappearing disproportionately and that
actually runs through the history of
protohumans our human ancestors early
human ancestors back around a million
years as they expanded their territory
the large mammals declined and of the
many species closely related to us only
one survives which raises some questions
that you might ponder and that includes
the lingering question expires is it
better to be smart than stupid now we
have a few years to answer this question
not many so how are we answering it well
one step
george w bush's abrogation of the ABM
Treaty followed now under Obama Bush and
Obama Obama followed by ABM
installations right near the Russian
border allegedly for defense against
non-existent Iranian nuclear missiles
you can believe that if you believe the
tooth fairy
which Russia doesn't they have good
reason to regard it as a first strike
weapon as strategic analysts understand
missile defense to be on all science the
next step was offering NATO membership
to Ukraine Ukraine is the Russian
geostrategic Heartland that was George
Bush but the efforts have been pursued
by Obama and Clinton
well the comprehensive test-ban treaty
would at least in nuclear tests which
would be a considerable step forward but
it can't go into force until it's
ratified by the few holdouts three are
crucial the nuclear weapon states that
refused to ratify it China Israel and
the United States the major nuclear
powers US and Russia have overwhelming
preponderance of nuclear weapons are
both expanding modernizing their
Arsenal's in quite dangerous ways that
includes tactical nukes that can be
scaled down to battlefield use under the
command under low-level command could
easily lead to very rapid escalation if
there were any conflict and any conflict
between Russia and the United States is
essentially terminal for everyone that's
pretty obvious the flash points are
becoming more serious and if it's right
at the Russian border that noticed the
Russian border not the Mexican border
that's a fact worth considering
and it's a result of expansion of NATO
right after the collapse of the Soviet
Union this was in violation to verbal
promises to Mikhail Gorbachev verbal
promises that NATO would not expand the
phrase was one inch to the east that
meant East Germany nobody was thinking
about anything beyond NATO would not
expand one inch to the east
if Gorbachev agreed to unification of
Germany and Germany a unified Germany
joined joining NATO a hostile military
alliance was a pretty remarkable
concession in the light of the history
of the past half century that when
Germany alone had practically wiped
Russia out two times well that was the
agreement but verbal NATO at once expand
expanded to brew East East Germany and
Beyond under Clinton right to the
Russian border there's recent archival
work by University of Texas young
historian Joshua Schiffer Anson was
published in the MIT journal
international security worth looking up
he it very strongly suggests that
President Bush number one the Statesman
Bush and Secretary of State James Baker
who were the negotiators I can strongly
suggest they were consciously deceiving
Gorbachev pretending to make an
agreement which they intended to violate
and we're very careful not to put
anything on paper so when Gorbachev
complained he was told it was just a
gentlemen's agreement and the
implication unstated implication was if
you're stupid enough to accept the leave
and a gentlemen's agreement with us it's
your problem not ours well there was a
Gorbachev did propose a vision of what
he called a common European home
Brussels to Vladivostok security system
with no military alliances that's a
fading dream George Kennan and other
senior statesman had weren't warned
right away that NATO expansion is what
they called it tragic mistake policy
error of historic proportions
that's kenan and it's now leading to
rising and serious tensions on the
traditional invasion route through which
russia was virtually destroyed twice
during the past century by germany alone
the risk of terminal nuclear war is not
slight and that's one of the two reasons
why the hand of the Doomsday Clock is
moving so close to midnight well with
some Justice European historian Richard
sacra writes that NATO's prime concern
now is to manage the risks created by
its existence which is quite accurate I
think and it bears on Arents Meyers
conclusions that's how we're dealing
with one of the two crises what are the
others how about global warming
well we're answering Meyers question by
unilateral withdrawal from the world's
efforts to address the crisis not just
withdrawal but replacing their efforts
with a dedicated race to the precipice
even more rapidly by sharp increases in
fossil fuel use that includes coal and
refusing the promised subsidies to
poorer countries to develop renewable
energy and dismantling the regulatory
apparatus so that profits can boom along
with threats to survival and we can't
stress too strongly the enormity of the
fact that the United States is alone in
the
world in this respect since November 8
and the no less astonishing fact that
this extraordinary development barely
registers in the so-called
information system should have regular
screaming headlines and be the most
prominent issue in the academic and
intellectual world which is more
evidence about the great derangement and
no less astonishing is the fact that
while the richest and most powerful
country in world history with
incomparable advantages is leading the
effort to intensify the likely disaster
well that's happening efforts to avert
the catastrophe are being led worldwide
by what we call primitive societies the
First Nations in Canada tribal and
Aboriginal societies elsewhere so for
example Ecuador which has a large
indigenous population sought aid from
European countries rich European
countries to allow it to keep its oil
reserves underground where they ought to
be even at a cost of considerable profit
the aid was refused Ecuador revised its
constitution in 2008 to include what are
called the rights of nature having
intrinsic worth the same in Bolivia with
an indigenous majority and quite
generally the countries with large and
influential indigenous populations are
well in the lead and seeking to preserve
the planet while the countries that have
driven indigenous populations to
extinction or extreme marginalization
are racing towards destruction which is
perhaps something more to think about
well outside of the world
Center of devastation and destruction
which is right here
some things are being done not enough by
any means but not negligible and an
indication of what can be done
so Denmark is aiming to reach a hundred
percent renewable electricity within 20
years and in all sectors by 2050 Germany
which is the most successful state
capitalist economy has tripled renewable
energy for electricity in the past
decade aims to increase it by almost
half by 2025 the more than 80% by 2050
and by then to have reduced greenhouse
gas reductions to 80 or 90% of 1990
levels China which is still a huge
polluter is well in the lead in
production of solar panels and also
development of advanced solar technology
claims to be phasing out Seoul coal
plants in the United States Hawaii
passed a law mandating that all the
state's electricity will come from
renewable sources no later than 2045 and
right here several Massachusetts
Democrats have filed a bill that's SD
1932 if you want to look it up which
requires that the state use a hundred
percent renewable energy by 2035 and
mandates elimination of all fossil fuels
in the state by 2050 so a hundred
percent renewables San Diego is the
first large city to have planned to run
on a hundred percent renewable energy
and cut greenhouse gas emissions in half
by 2035 and that's incidentally a
bipartisan effort the Republican there
endorsed the climate action plan that
was unanimously approved by the Democrat
control City Council in December that's
San Diego so and in fact at a period
when the federal government is in the
hands of bulls and the china shop
states and cities can still do quite a
lot and the federal government could
also do so in the right hands so one of
hillary clinton's programs was to shift
all households to total renewable energy
in four years is quite feasible would
create many jobs along with
weatherization and other forms of
conservation and federal regulations in
recent years have had some positive
effects unfortunately counterbalanced by
support for greater fossil fuel
production there's a final assessment by
the obama administration it was
published in science the journal science
a couple months ago that reports that by
2050 in 2015
total energy consumption was two point
five percent lower than it was in 2008
while the economy grew by 10%
now the reduction is by no means enough
but it does remind us that growth is not
in itself a menace to the environment
depends on what kind of growth so for
example development of a rational mass
transportation system or development of
renewable energy or growth in education
and R&D they can all that's growth and
it can all improve prospects for
addressing the crises while also
significantly improving lives the obama
assessment reports that about 2.2
million americans are employed in the
design installation manufacturer of
energy efficiency products and services
as compared with half that number
employed in the production of fossil
fuels and their use for electric power
generation and the current oil plume
which I mentioned earlier creates almost
no jobs because it's almost all
automated well again it's nowhere near
enough but not insignificant and more
important an indication of what can be
done and there's good reason think it
can Harvey
Michaels is research director of energy
management at Sloan Sloan School here
he's shown I think persuasively how
ambitious but feasible measures beyond
those now contemplated internationally
that's internationally apart from leads
Republican us such measures could meet
the goal of keeping global temperatures
below two degrees centigrade that's
considered the major danger point the
Ernie Moniz know back at MIT has
produced figures about declining costs
for clean energy technologies that lead
him to conclude on quote him that
climate change may have inspired the
energy revolution but price makes it
inevitable and maybe even in time at
least with enough effort
well replacing fossil fuels by renewable
energy is the major issue but it's not
the only one the UN economic program
summarizing recent scientific studies
estimates that industrial meat
production contributes about 10 to 25%
of total greenhouse gas emissions
not so much co2 as methane and nitrous
oxide both greenhouse gases the
variation and the estimates depends on
whether the figures take into account
deforestation and other land-use changes
as such
with livestock a livestock is about 80%
of agricultural emissions now this is
mostly industrial meat production which
is quite vicious as you know it's
designed the maximize profit with
animals treated as efficient production
elements awful effects on animals but
also a significant increase in
greenhouse gas emissions actually
pre-capitalist animal agriculture didn't
have those problems cooked from the UN
report under natural conditions which
were maintained for thousands of years
and still widely exist around the world
there's a closed circular system in
which some animals feed themselves from
landscape types which would otherwise be
of little use to humans they thus
convert energy stored in plants into
food while at the same time fertilizing
the ground with their excrements
although not an intensive form of
production this coexistence and use of
marginal resources was and still is in
some regions and efficient symbiosis
between plant life animal life and human
needs but capitalist industrial
production aimed at profit maximization
has changed all that well I mentioned
that with the federal government now
turned into a wrecking machine states
and cities can do quite a lot and that
same is true for every one of us there
are major issues of Education and
organizing that have to be faced and
again some of these are unique to the
United States in the developed world one
of them is the extraordinary power in
the United States of fundamentalist
religious doctrines so about 40% of the
population dismiss the threat of global
warming on religious grounds they regard
it as either certain or
highly probable that within a few
decades the Second Coming will put an
end to the problem well it's important
to remember in this connection that the
United States is a kind of a cultural
outlier in some respects prior to the
Second World War the United Services by
far the most powerful economy but it was
not a major center of scientific or
general culture so if you wanted to be a
physicist you'd go to Germany you want
to be a writer an artist
go to Paris and so on had personal
experience with the residue of this when
I was appointed to MIT in 1955 one of
the teaching assignments was to help
scientists and engineers fake their way
through reading exams in French and
German now that was a residue with the
fact that before the war that's where
the scientific literature was took a
while for this to be phased out by that
time was almost all in English but by
1950s was an anachronism the changes are
very real but they've affected only part
of the country it's much of the
population is still pretty much where it
was pre-world War two and that's a major
task for the educational system and the
prospects right now at least don't look
good not with the divorce sessions
banning conception of Education the
Trump administration has to do something
for its huge evangelical popular base
that involves driving the United States
even farther off the spectrum of the
modern world with the Taliban ization
project that's know underway well there
are major challenges no doubt there are
also
quite a few rays of hope I mentioned
some of the measures that are being
taken by state local governments even
national governments around the world to
address the crises not enough but not
negligible indication of what's possible
and there are other reasons for optimism
one of them has just been reported but
of all places Fox News they ran a poll
on popularity of political figures and
in first place by a huge margin was
Bernie Sanders even more among the young
who are the hope of the future now there
are ample opportunities but you have to
grasp them and all of this takes us back
to Ernst Meyers question is it better to
be smart than stupid it's a question for
you to ponder and like it or not for you
to answer and without too much of a
delay
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
myk's for your questions
hello thank you very much professor
Chomsky with all these sort of
existential crises if you if you were to
put yourself in the body of a
twenty-something year old growing up
today
how would that shape your serve life
decisions with these two crises so it
was 20 years old yeah pretty much the
way it did when I was what was it seven
sixteen years old on August 6th 1945 I
happened to be a junior counselor and a
summer camp the news was reported in the
morning you know broadcast everyone
Tomic bomb wiped out Hiroshima you know
everyone went on to their next activity
you know baseball game or whatever it
was I didn't know how to react I just
left went off into the woods sat there
for a couple hours thinking what does
all this mean
and afterwards decided look you just
have to devote your life to this and I
think that's we're in a worse situation
now and there's plenty that can be done
the opportunities are far greater now
than they were in the past
thanks to what's been done by people
like you in earlier years like MIT to
say you could never get an audience like
this 20 or 30 years ago in fact in the
1960s MIT was a very conservative campus
almost nothing was going on
about a dozen undergraduates just change
the place enormous Lee and it's been
very different ever since and that's
happened all around the country which
means that you have a legacy that you
can build on plenty of challenges with
plenty of opportunities and the question
is do you decide the grass Bowman oh
yeah so thank you I'm wondering Noam how
much emphasis you would place on the
possibility of finding solutions
addressing the problems you've laid out
outside the framework of the current
political system in the United States
and how much emphasis you would give to
the need the the necessity of taking
this political system head-on and and
changing it and what would what do you
think we we need to do to change the
system to open up the possibilities that
you're talking about well I think there
are good grounds for changing the nature
of the political system pretty radically
I'm in a system of organization of
production let's say just keeping to
that which is geared towards profit
maximization not use is inherently
destructive a system of institutional
organization in which the basic
functioning institutions are
totalitarian like a business top-down
control you know fit somewhere in it
take orders from above given below at
the bottom you rent yourself that's
inherently I think humanly and socially
destructive so there's plenty of changes
that could be made and we can think
about them and in fact you can try to
build within the existing society pieces
of what might be a more democratic and
humane future Society it's even being
done but you can't change the political
system radically unless the great mass
of the population comes to a recognition
that we're in a situation where the
changes that have to be made can't be
made and will be resisted within the
current system and we're nowhere near
then so I don't think the question
arises as a practical question it does
arise as a question to have in mind in
choosing tactics and strategies
oh hi professor um
so as we all leave this lecture hall
today what do you want us to take away
from your talk I mean I know you let
left us this one question to ponder
about but beyond that and the reason in
the last two months there have been many
talks on climate change on the political
climate here speakers including former
Secretary of State John Kerry and also a
Nobel laureate Mario Molina who
discovered CFCs but beyond discussions
in terms of actions what do you want
what do you want all of us and also
people watching through Facebook to do I
came from a city called Duisburg in
Germany and it used to be part of the
heartland of the German coal and steel
industries until recent also passed a
couple years ago they implemented new
energy policies to basically shut down
all of these factories that were harming
the environment such a radical degree
and even though it practically crippled
the German economy in terms of coal and
steel production ultimately the
environment benefited a lot from that
from benefit the energy policies that
crippled the economic force which which
was coming from the steel and coal
industries in Germany in West Germany
near the Rhine divor but here in America
even though we're having so many
discussions about you know what can we
do in terms what kinda lots of I feel
like we we have is it's a it's more of a
question of balance how much do we want
to sacrifice of our economy in order to
save the environment but then some of us
it's just not a matter of actually but
more of a matter of discussing things
and talking about it and I just know
yeah I guess the question is is what can
we do exactly like what is the bigger
point of your lecture other piece we'll
hear what can you do yeah all sorts of
things I just mentioned them for
number of them take say for example the
bill that's pending in the Massachusetts
State Legislature if it was passed could
have a big impact it could put the state
on a direction in the near future
towards a hundred percent renewable
energy what San Diego is already moving
towards and San Diego's not exactly a
bastion of liberalism if that can be
done there it can be done here but it's
not going to happen unless there's
plenty of pressure for it I think there
are three legislature let the
legislators who put it through and
virtually nothing is known about it so
one thing that people can do out of
thousands is try to work to get measures
like that passed not only in the state
but even in say Cambridge I like San
Diego another thing you can do is move
very directly even simple things like
replacing light bulbs with LED bulbs has
a pretty significant impact on energy
production and that can be done fix to
do it on a significant scale takes
organization and activism but that's one
thing you can do the two that as I
mentioned the most popular candidate and
the political figure in the country
happens to be Bernie Sanders
overwhelmingly among young people that
popularity he is he calls his position
of revolution but that's an indication
of how far the country has shifted to
the right in fact his policies would
have been quite acceptable to Eisenhower
in fact if you go back and read
Eisenhower's comments on the New Deal
you know I said anyone who questions New
Deal policies doesn't belong in the
political system
oh that's just about everybody by now
except Sanders is calling for New Deal
policies Eisenhower's comments on the
significance of huge unions labor unions
or almost unimaginable today but correct
and that's the right wing in 1950s so
yes we can shift the spectrum back to
the days when Social Democratic policies
were considered legitimate and you can
go way beyond that there is an election
coming up in 2018 the Democrats among
their failures have been essentially the
Obama Democrats basically destroyed the
party
there's nothing almost nothing left
except that the presidential level the
Greens have the same fallacy they've
focused on the presidential you know the
quadrennial extravaganza haven't built
the party at the local level school
board's
state legislature City Council's
governor's the whole system which has to
be in place if anything's going to
happen the Koch brothers understood this
the right wing has understood it and in
fact built such a system even on a
minority base hasn't been done on a
majority base but it certainly can be
there's the beginnings of establishing
say cooperatives or work around a worker
owned enterprises run by their own
members that's these are things that
Norma can be done but are being done
there's a whole range of possibilities
that can be pursued if you choose them
if you choose to do it there's just no
shortage of things it's an immense
pleasure to listen to you I'm a little
bit off topic but I don't think I will
have a chance ever to ask you that what
do you think about the Madeleine rush
that the Kremlin in our election sorry I
didn't hear
could anybody the Madley of Russia the
Kremlin in our 2016 election oh the
meddling of Russia and our elections now
that has most of the world cracking up
and laughter you know I'm supposed every
charge is correct let's say the most
severe charges are correct that's not
even a joke as compared with what we do
constantly just take the minor example
what we do with Russian elections in the
early 90s when Yeltsin was Clinton's
favorite he was supposed to be the you
know the guy the hope for the future I
hate when he destroyed the Parliament
and overthrew the formal democratic
system he was strongly supported by the
United States in 1996 when he was
extremely unpopular for pretty good
reasons because the the shock treatment
the sort of free-market policies imposed
by American advisors just wiped out the
economy and led to the death of millions
of people it was highly destructive I
led to the rise of you know the
oligarchs many of them former
apparatchik sand the communist system
who stole the resources it was a total
disaster
and Yeltsin was the symbol of it Clinton
moved in a very extensive quite openly
there wasn't a nothing secret about it
very openly with everything from loans
to advice to direct involvement to try
to make sure that our fair-haired boy
one that's nineteen ninety six and these
are minor examples I'm the kind of thing
we do constantly is just overthrow the
government
you know Institute of military
dictatorship but not in the distant past
and it just happened under Obama in 2009
in Honduras
there was a mildly reformist government
the you know the tiny a lead of
super-rich who run the country didn't
like it he was kicked out in a military
coup the United States is one of the
very few countries that supported it and
claimed that the election taken place
under a military dictatorship was
legitimate it's basically supporting a
military coup to overthrow parliamentary
government is that meddling in the
election you know I mean it just goes on
and on like this that's uh so as I say
this is just making the United States
kind of a laughingstock in the world
even if every single charge was correct
most of them have no basis thank you
thank you
so the silence in the media right now
regarding climate change and an
existential threat to humanity is pretty
deafening and you provide an explanation
for that in your book manufacturing
consent that there are certain filters
that limit the range of acceptable
political discourse I'm wondering though
it seems like in this recent election
cycle that maybe some of those filters
are being circumnavigated by increased
use of the internet and more democratic
social mass media do you think that the
election of Trump the insurgent primary
of Bernie Sanders and the sudden outcry
from major media outlets about fake news
and the end of truth are a sign that
maybe these this propaganda system is
breaking down and if so what does that
mean for the ability to sort of break
the silence regarding these existential
threats that we face yeah I think that's
very important if I have to take a look
at the Sanders campaign I mean it really
hasn't been discussed discussed as much
as it should be but it was a pretty
astonishing achievement I mean for well
over a century American elections have
been pretty much bought I mean the
evidence is just overwhelming the person
has done
to the work on this is Tom Ferguson
political scientist at UMass Boston used
to be at MIT he's got a book called
golden rule which studies the role just
to simply of campaign funding on outcome
of elections and policies going way back
into the 19th century right through the
new deal and so on and it's startling
results he has a recent paper that came
out a couple months ago looking at
congressional elections from about 1980
up till the present and just comparing
campaign funding with electability it's
kinda like a straight line you don't get
results like that in the social sciences
well and it's nothing new I mean back in
1895 there was a great campaign manager
then named Mark Hanna and he was asked
once what's necessary to run a
successful political campaign and he
said well you need two things the first
one is money and I've forgotten what the
second one is that's it that was 1895
it's gotten way more extreme since and
by now it's out of sight okay after over
a century of this somebody comes along
who nobody ever heard of that he uses a
scare word socialist you know he has no
funding nothing from the corporate
sector and nothing from wealthy people
immediate totally against him almost
either ridiculing and we're dismissing
him he could easily have won the
Democratic Party nomination if it hadn't
been for the party shenanigans to keep
him out that's a pretty amazing
development and what it shows is that
the institutions are they look powerful
but they collapse as soon as the
population becomes engaged they're
basically very weak actually that's an
insight that goes back
the years one of the first modern works
on politics is by David Hume one great
philosopher founder of classical
liberalism he has a study called I think
Prince of first principles of government
and he opens it by saying that there's
strange paradox in governments he says
in every government whether you know
military run more or less popular like
England at the time this is the strange
thing people obey their rulers and why
do they because power is in the hands of
the governed and if they want they can
take it and he says by what miracle is
this achieved this is only by control of
opinion if you can make people feel that
they're powerless and hope and
everything's futile and they can't do
anything ok then they'll obey if not
they don't have to obey and that's much
more true in pretty free countries like
ours than say a military dictatorship
but it's but the paradox is real and
it's in people's hands to overcome it
and the Sanders campaign is one dramatic
illustration of that and what you say
about alternative media it can be - if
it's properly done also affects the
major media because they have to respond
to it so there's the institutional
structure is basically quite weak and
can easily be changed thank you
hi I want to be hopeful about our our
major institutions our systems of
governance and higher education in
particular and its ability to to grapple
with the immense challenge of climate
change and its and its like but
sometimes I wonder if we really need
something dramatically different when I
think about higher education the world
that I live in mostly do you think that
there's you know completely new
structures or approaches that we should
be trying to create in order to deal
with this because incremental ism maybe
isn't doing so hot well you know I think
any of us could sit down at a you know a
coffee shop and think of much better
ways to run the world
you know better institutions were
Democratic ones more just ones and so on
but thinking of that doesn't really help
you have to get the great mass of the
population to be committed to creating
and you can only do that incremental e
you have to work within the system that
exists you can do a lot of things within
it you can have a vision of the future
which people can take as a guideline for
further action and maybe leading and as
I mentioned before you can construct
institutions of a future society within
this one like cooperatives for example
like work around enterprises if they
would extend they would be they would
change the society enormous Lee and
those are things that arise constantly
if you're willing to grasp the
opportunity so take say the 2008 crash
the one of the things that happened then
which was pretty interesting was that
the government essentially nationalized
the auto industry basically just bailed
it out it was gonna disappear
so the government meaning the taxpayer
bought out the auto industry and then
there were a couple of choices that
could have been made that one choice is
the one that was made without discussion
namely you turn it back to the former
owners may be new faces but pretty much
sin you know saint banks and so on so
essentially turn it back to the former
owners and have it go on doing exactly
what it was doing producing cars there
was another possibility turn it over to
the workforce let them run it
democratically and have it produced with
the society needs which is not more cars
but rational mass transportation that
was another possibility but in order for
it to be implemented you had to have
mass popular support for it there was
essentially none so it didn't happen and
things like that happened even right
locally in this neighborhood so a couple
of years ago there was a small plant and
Taunton mass suburb of Boston which was
quite successful a plant making
sophisticated parts for aircraft it
wasn't making enough profit for the
multinational who owned that keep it
going so they decided to put it out of
business the Union progressive Union you
we offered to buy the plant and have it
run by the workforce which probably
would have been profitable for the
multinational but for class reasons they
don't like that kind of thing if there
had been popular support they could have
won
there wasn't any so they didn't win
things like that are happening all the
time these could lead to major changes
in the society are they incremental in a
sense but they're they're long-term
consequences could be very great and
that's true of all kinds of things
thank you let's go grab some of those
opportunities
I think we have time for one more
question mm-hmm hi everyone I have fifth
question for everybody who is here
actually thank you so much the first
question is how many of you have a car
in this room I'm sorry how many of you
have a car in this room and how many of
you run your car at least five minutes
to warm up while you're getting ready
how many of you use paper or plastic
plates and how many of you replace their
cell phones every year so being
environment friendly require being aware
of mistakes that we do and I would like
to remind everyone here change only
comes in baby steps of people who cares
let's show that we care about
environment and let's rethink about what
we buy and what we spend on there was no
question I guess for you well on behalf
of the Center for International Studies
I would like to thank everyone for
attending this event and please join me
in thanking Noam Chomsky
