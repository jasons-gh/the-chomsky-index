in Colombia on the other hand if you
look at the general population attitudes
are somewhat more complicated for
example a large majority of the
population thinks that it's the
responsibility of the government to
assist where people who need help
in fact the substantial proportion last
time I looked at a photo of the majority
are willing to raise taxes to help poor
people overseas so the idea that you
should have responsibility to help queer
people that's very widespread on the
other hand the polls also shows strong
opposition to welfare so the same people
who say it's the responsibility the
government to help the poor are opposed
to welfare and the reason is because
there it sounds contradictory but it
isn't I don't think if you look at the
propaganda that people are being fed the
propaganda is that welfare does not go
to help for people welfare welfare goes
to keep the you know rich black women
breeding like rabbits and driving
Cadillacs well I don't want my money to
go for that you know so yes I'd like to
have money go to help the poor but not
welfare and similarly with foreign aid I
don't want to give those people money
for you know rich people are going to
just hate America if we could go to poor
people in Africa fine no now here's what
the propaganda has been successful in
associating the actual facts about
welfare in aid from the idea that you
have a responsibility to help people now
like it has in any propaganda it's not
totally qualified so an awful lot of
foreign aid is putting money in the
pockets of rich people and a lot of
what's coming even with a
welfare which is a very narrow part of
welfare you can find welfare fraud and
so forth but I mean even the most crazy
propaganda to say Hitler's propaganda
about the Jews had some fringe of
plausibility or else you couldn't get
anybody to accept it the propaganda is
more elaborated in the rest of that
story if I remember it it starts by
saying that everyone agrees even
liberals that AFDC has been a total
failure and that it is not gotten rid of
poverty and so on and so forth well that
may be what the author of the article of
whoever is giving him his lines believes
but it's certainly not a fact that
people who know anything should believe
because it's just not true the fact is
that if what failed about AFDC is that
it was eliminated AFDC which was never
very high has been cut back by close to
50 percent since around 1970 you take a
look at AFDC in real terms from 1970 to
say 1990 through the Reagan years it's
down a close to half in fact it got to
the point where it was lower all such
payments if you see food stamps and I
forget the third third one we're lower
than just food stamps alone before this
period so sure if you cut down support
systems for poor people you're going to
have a lot of for people that's for sure
so one factor in the fact that we
haven't gotten rid of poverty is that
the so-called war on poverty was called
off right away it in fact didn't go into
effect until the late 60 and it whisk
and by the end of Nixon's term that was
over and Nixon was over the last liberal
president you know even toward the end
of his term was being attenuated but
when you get into Carter Reagan and so
on that's the end it just goes down down
down so yes these programs didn't have
much effect because they were never
applied know they had some effect you
know like some poor children
you'd get enough food b-but and in fact
that we're out the effect of cutting
them down is quite marked or at least
you know cause effect relations are hard
to determine but at least this much is
correct several years after the decline
in welfare as welfare declines you know
regularly steadily as it has been doing
since around 1970 a couple of years
later you get an increase in work and
families child abuse illegitimate births
and so on and so forth
now whether that's a cause effect
relation or before/after relation you
can argue but there is a temporal
relation at least between cutting back
of support systems and disruption of
families and that's not I think you can
imagine why that should be and it gets
worse
incidentally there's another factor
intervening which overwhelms all of them
and that is that starting around that
same time real wages began to stagnate
and from 1980 they've been going down
and for poor people much further down
and for younger people even worse so say
entry-level wages you know your first
job remember the numbers but for males
it's dropped about 30% I think since
1980 and for females I think it's drop
about 18% well that's you know that's a
steady effect on your long term future
meanwhile real wages have been going
down steadily high school graduates
which is probably 70% of the workforce
or so what they call non skilled workers
funny term for it but a considerable
majority to work for something like 70
or 75% of lost males have lost about I
think over 20% of their purchase of
their income since about 1980 now
furthermore this has had an effect this
has had the effect of driving a second
parent into the workforce you know if
women want to work that's fine but this
is forcing them into the workforce when
they don't
because you have to have food to put on
the table so you have two parents in the
workforce to try to keep at least family
income steady support systems are
collapsing hours of work are increasing
so by the early 90s it took two hours
more two weeks more of working year to
make a 1980 salary so you have two
people working very heavily that just
try to keep things going no support
systems if they get in trouble like say
it's an abused teenager and she can't
live with their parents and she goes off
somewhere to try to get some help
that kind of payment is going way down
well what's the effect of all of that
stuff going to be you not to be a genius
to today I mean what it's going to mean
is child abuse neglect of children
malnutrition violence against children
by children drug abuse unwanted
pregnancy is all sorts of things in fact
all of these consequences are exactly
what has been the clear determinable
result of social policy by the people
who call themselves conservatives they
have been fighting a war against
families and children and it goes back
to the early 70s the propaganda that
people are being fed is what you read in
that article that it was a failure of
the attempt to deal with these problems
on the contrary it was a conscious
attempt to create those problems and I
say conscious in the sense in which you
use the term you know in law I mean if a
consequence is completely predictable to
a sane person that's evidence for intent
and this was all completely predictable
to a sane person
justice is completely predictable to a
sane person that this that these changes
that you quoted in your first statement
are going to have very severe effects
which means it's equally clear that when
he said
it's a gamble that's just not true
there's no gamble you know exactly
what's going to happen it is a cover for
something else well when you have that
kind of propaganda and that's what's
being I mean this is what's being given
to the you know the educated folk so
it's in big words and the New York time
we can review but you're getting it at
some level over and over again
everywhere from television sitcoms to
you know radio soundbite advertising to
the schools to everything people are
being dead huge with this propaganda as
a result they probably believe that the
war on poverty was failure and that it
didn't get rid of welfare and all these
things that the author there says
everyone believes yeah sure that's what
you would believe if you were totally
subordinated to the propaganda system
and you didn't have a way to think
yourself out of it now most people don't
but the author of that article does he
knows enough or at least could know
enough easily to find out just what
happened to the war on poverty so what
happened to AFDC he can find out the
answer to that question that's his field
he covers those things so he can find it
out as soon as he finds it out he knows
what he wrote is put it charitably
nonsense to put it probably accurately
something much worse well the end result
of this is you get the kind of confusion
if you're talking about that we were
talking about yes we should help the
poor and it's the government's
responsibility to do it but welfare is
catastrophe it's created poverty
