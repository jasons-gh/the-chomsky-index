you spoke about how when you go overseas
you are given access to the mass media
but here that doesn't seem to be the
case has that changed at all have you
ever been invited to appear on Nightline
or Brinkley yes I have a couple times
been invited to speak on Nightline I
couldn't do it I had another talking
something or other and today the honest
truth I don't really care very much fair
the media monitoring group published a
very interesting study of Nightline it
shows their conception of a spectrum of
opinion is ridiculously narrow at least
by European at world standards Madison
Wisconsin on a listener-supported radio
station community radio station a very
good one I was having interview with
news director I've been on that program
dozens of times usually by telephone and
he's very good he gets to all sorts of
people and he started the interview by
playing for me a tape of an interview
that he had just had and had broadcast
with the guy who's some mucky muck and
Nightline I think his name is Jeff
Greenfield or some such name that name
just a selection of guests to analyze
things
why is Noam Chomsky never on Nightline I
couldn't begin to tell you it's one of
the leading intellectuals in the entire
world I have no idea I mean I can make
some guesses he may be one of the
leading intellectuals who can't talk on
television you know that's a standard
that's very important to us if you got a
twenty two minutes show and a guy takes
five minutes to warm up now I don't know
what the Chomsky doesn't know he's out
one of the reasons why Nightline has the
usual suspects is one of the things you
have to do when you book a show is know
that the person can make the point
within the framework of television and
if people don't like that they should
understand it is about as sensible to
book somebody who will take eight
minutes to give an answer as it is to
book somebody who doesn't speak English
but in the normal given
hello that's another culture bad thing
we gotta have anyone speaking people we
also need concision so Greenfield or
whatever his name is hit the nail on the
head the US media are alone in that that
it is you must meet the condition of
concision you got to say things between
two commercials or in 600 words and
that's a very important fact because of
a beauty of concision you know saying a
couple of sentences between two
commercials the beauty of that is that
you can only repeat conventional
thoughts I was reading Chomsky 20 years
ago I think his notion he doesn't he
have a kid Nico or that called
engineering consent or the manufacturing
a concern I mean some of that stuff to
me looks like it's from Neptune this is
the first time the Neptune system has
been seen clearly by human eyes these
pictures taken only hours ago by Voyager
2 are its latest contribution
you know he's firmly entitled said if
I'm seeing it through a prism to but my
view that of his notions about the
limits of debate in this country did
absolutely whatever it is two minutes
and I say Qaddafi's a terrorist how
many's a murderer you know etc etc the
Russians I don't need any evidence
everybody just nods on the other hand
suppose you say something that just
isn't regurgitating conventional piety
suppose you say something that's the
least bit unexpected or controversial
suppose you say I mean the biggest
international terror operations that are
known are the ones that are run out of
Washington or suppose you say what
happened in the 1980s is the US
government was driven underground
suppose I say the United States is
invading South Vietnam as it was the
best political leaders are the ones who
are lazy and corrupt if the nuremberg
laws were applied than every post-war
America
president would have been hanging the
Bible is one of probably the most
genocide 'el book and Eric total canon
education is a system of imposed
ignorance no more morality in world
affairs fundamentally than there wasn't
a ton of Genghis Khan they're just
different you know they're just
different factors to be concerned no job
see thank you well you know people will
reason of quite reasonably expect to
know what you mean why did you say that
I never heard that before if you said
that you better have a reason you know
better have some evidence and in fact
you better have a lot of evidence
because that's pretty startling comment
you can't give evidence if you're stuck
with concision you know that's the
genius of these of this structural
constraint and in my view if people like
say Nightline and neo lair and so on
were smarter if they were better
propagandists they would let dissidents
on let them on more in fact the reason
is that they would sound like they're
from Neptune then comes our special
conversation on the Middle East crisis
tonight's is with the activist writer
and professor Noam Chomsky again there
is has been an offer on the table which
we rejected an Iraqi offer last April
okay
eliminate their chemical and other
unconventional Arsenal's if Israel were
to simultaneously do the same have to
inject there but I think that should be
pursued as well sorry to interrupt you I
have to end it there that's the end of
our time professor Chomsky thank you
very much for joining us AT&T has
supported the macneil/lehrer Newshour
since 1983 because quality information
and quality communication is our idea of
a good connection AT&T the right choice
