the official he was asking him why is
this intensive bombing going on northern
Laos nothing to do with the war in
Indochina just destruction of work as in
society what must malevolent acts of
history and he find the official finally
explained he said look but as attempt
calming North cessation of the bombing
of North Vietnam and we have all these
planes I would remain so we'll bombed
out ok I think that's a lesson of
history that bear in mind and creating
jeremy's exposures of first black border
of the mercenary army and del J saw some
little secret army secret the same way
the secret wars received at a reporter
who's willing to
has the courage and integrity to expose
it you can expose these resources are
there they're growing they have a self
generating capacity are they going to
get larger and larger the gonna want
more more to do and if one target
disappears though we turn somewhere else
and Jeremy headed will be turned to you
and this history of that to somebody
want to read about it there's a very
important book by a story in very good
historian now l mccoy other things too
mr. prose portrait so on visa filipinas
story and lonely and he did a study of
the philippine war the u.s.
counterinsurgency warum philippines in
the third century ago was a rural
beverage for hundreds thousands of
people slaughter our story and you
pointed out that at the time was over
when the sort of a pacification began
the US forces were mostly in those days
we're using the highest technology
available to develop a surveillance
system over the Philippine society so
they can do it try our standards now at
a primitive level of the kinds of things
that Jeremy described and they did
that's turned the Philippines into a
Philippines hundred years later never
escape from this Philippines
consequences of this long terrible war
but McCoy pointed out something else he
pointed out these measures from before
the First World War we're very quickly
picked up domestically both by the
British in the United States and apply
to a surveillance and control techniques
within their own societies and FBI here
and so on and next we can expand and
size februari round resources are there
they are self generating they're kept
under and they also not too much
inspection of them but they're gluten
because seen they're going to grow
they're going to develop if they missed
recurrent targets disappear they'll move
on the new targets possess the nature of
these systems just like the planes who
had lowered bombs as inside that scent
of the bomb or the klaus and they'll
come home already happening cuz we can
expect more adorable I think that's the
historical background should very much
be kept in mind
