could you comment on the Tea Party and
their tactics they're almost anarchistic
like government is bad and every
everything that destroys it is good but
like in some ways they're like the most
revolutionary group in the United States
they were able to stop the government
for 16 days well I wouldn't call them
revolutionary that I think one of the
best descriptions of them is by one of
the leading the conservative political
analyst Norman Ornstein who was
referring to the republican party
altogether the modern Republican Party
but tea parties an extreme example he
just described them as a radical
insurgency opposed to rationality to
political compromise to participation in
a parliamentary system in fact with no
positive goals of themselves they say
they do oppose too much state power but
that's a bit of a joke they also support
state power powerful they support the
powerful systems that sustain private
power a concentration of power as
opposed to traditional manner the
traditional anarchists were opposed to a
master to a relation of dominance
between masters and servants between
owners and workers that's one of the
major that one of the most elemental
types of dominance that are as I've
always been opposed by any manner keys
but not by now they're in favor of it
they want they're in favor of having the
population subordinated to concentrated
private power which should have no
limits when they call themselves
anti-government that means they don't
want government to limit the capacity of
concentrated private power to dominate
the society that's very far from any
anarchism the reason that they're
successful does it have an enormous
amount of
a private capital supporting them
they're very heavily funded they have a
media outlet summon there are genuine
there are popular movement they have a
base and kind of mostly almost entirely
white mostly petty bourgeois small store
keepers and so on many of them there's
elements they're highly nationalist as
racist elements they basically just and
their their power and significance
doesn't come from their numbers but by
the backing that from the backing that
they have they do serve the interests of
significant elements of private capital
I was thinking more in the sense that
they I mean that the power of the
government is not able to they're not
able to legitimize themselves so they
they actually challenge the government
very directly and then they have a
little bit they're able to be voted into
power which they have popular support
and there's plenty of financial support
and a lot of their power comes from the
radical of gerrymandering redesigning of
electoral districts you can see it so
for example they're powerful in the
House of Representatives we're in fact
the Republicans have a majority of the
of the represent representatives but
with a minority of the vote so in the
last election the Democrats actually won
a significant majority of the popular
vote for the house but by virtue of
rearranging electoral districts and vast
amounts of money you the right wing was
able to take over the representation
effect has been studied by the main
political scientist who works on has
been working on campaign funding for
many years Thomas Ferguson university of
massachusetts came out with a study
which showed that there's an almost
linear relationship between the amount
of money
put into a campaign and and electoral
victory these are basically brought
