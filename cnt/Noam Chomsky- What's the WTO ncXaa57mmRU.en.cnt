the World Trade Organization replaces an
earlier Organization GATT the world
trade organization came into being
through a several rounds of negotiations
Uruguay round was the one that founded
it and it's an organization of States in
theory and practice it's an organization
run by the richer and more powerful
state and the multinational corporations
that are closely linked to them and it's
the arrangements of the Uruguay Round
we're set up there I'm kind of a mixture
of liberalisation and protectionism
carefully crafted to ensure the wealth
and power of them were privileged
sectors that basically run it so they're
many strongly protectionist elements
and there are other liberalizing
elements and they're crafted in the
interests of the founders and you can
see it by say comparing what say
comparing the rules that were set up in
the GATT system so the United States is
obviously the most powerful by far so
back in the 1950s the US insisted on
various protectionist devices for
agriculture and textiles and so on right
now it happens that the US is in a
position where its own agribusiness
biotechnology will gain at the cost of
others if those barriers are reduced so
therefore the World Trade Organization
changes the system so as to favor
liberalisation of say genetically
engineered foods and so on because
that's in the interests of US producers
thirty years ago the other way around
the multiplied our agreement which is a
highly protectionist the element that
blocks production from the poor
countries through tariffs that states I
mean theoretically it's going to
disappear sometime but it stays however
the most extreme protectionist element
that was introduced again at the
insistence of the United States and
agreement of the other rich countries is
what's called intellectual property
rights which is a not only highly
protectionist but is designed to prevent
development and
innovation to ensure that that the
technology of the future in
pharmaceuticals software etc will remain
in the hands of the huge publicly
subsidized corporate systems of the West
primarily the US but others too
instead of being freely available and
various measures were introduced to
which are as I say not only highly
protectionist but designed to prevent
growth and development so for example
the institution of what are called
product patents instead of process
patents is quite significant that means
that if say you know merck
pharmaceutical developed some technique
to produce a drug under press it you can
you could under the earlier regime
product a patent process but if somebody
figured out a smarter way to make it you
couldn't patent product they could make
it that smarter way suppose say in the
Brazil or somewhere they figured out a
cheaper way to make it they could do it
now that's block two in an effort to
prevent progress and development but to
increase profits through protectionist
measures this is now having a big issue
primarily because of things like you
know the AIDS epidemic in Africa you
know the spread of malaria and other
things all the drugs are priced out of
sight because they're not being sold at
market prices they're being sold that
highly inflated prices due to the
monopolistic protectionist measures
introduced through the World Trade
Organization arrangements and there are
many things of this kind whether the
other crucial aspect of the Uruguay
Round is that it extends further
something has been going on for some
time and that is the transfer of Rights
nothing
alrights in fact away from people and
into the hands of corporate corporate
entities honest Oh early in this century
corporations were by judicial activism
granted not legislation granted the
rights of persons so they became persons
of course they're not persons there are
collectivist entities there actually did
private tyrannies as with the amount
through but they were given the rights
of persons it's a great attack on
classical liberalism on the theory that
rights in here in people but now these
new arrangements extended so under the
World Trade Organization rules and not
only then corporations have rights way
beyond people for example you and I
don't have the right to say sue Canada
if Canada is doing something we don't
like
but the ethyl corporation has the right
to sue Canada if Canada's blocking
distribution of some probably
carcinogenic additive that they're
producing and similarly all sorts of
such arrangements and these conflicts if
they come to arbitration under World
Trade Organization rules the arbitration
is designed so that corporations always
win
in effect I mean say that but that's
what it comes down to the arbitration is
not a judicial proceeding it's not
public
there's no adversary proceedings nothing
like that it's a secret proceeding
carried out by we're called trade
experts
I mean guess who they are and they come
down with a ruling and you can predict
what the ruling is going to be in theirs
case after case where it works the way
it predict the idea is to eliminate the
democratic right of people to decide
what you know they want to eat or what
they want to breathe or what kind of
country they want to live in or whatever
and to transfer that right into the
hands of the private tyrannies investors
lenders and so on banks but under the
guise that this protects trade now you
know trade may be good or may be bad but
it's not a fundamental value it's not a
fundamental human right to have
international trade by General Motors
maybe it's good it's bad
to elevate it to the rank of Rights as
Ludacris it's whether it's good or bad
as an instrumental question question is
how does it affect people and that turns
out to be pretty complicated but if it's
raised above all other values in this
highly nuanced way so sometimes
protectionism is insist on protectionism
sometimes insist on freedom investment
freedom of capital flow of all depending
on who benefits No
then of course it's a major attack and
intended as a major attack on human
rights on democracy and the rights of
people's to decide what they want so for
example if Europeans decide let's say we
don't want to be experimental subjects
they don't have that right anymore
so for example suppose that the you know
biology department at MIT told you
you're going to be an experimental
subject we want to fill around with your
brain or something supposedly you're
supposed to have the right to say well
I'm sorry I don't want to be an
experimental subject but the World Trade
Organization rules are designed so you
don't have that right
so for example if Europeans decide look
we don't want to be experimental
subjects with genetically modified foods
because just too much uncertainty nobody
knows what's going to happen and we
don't want to be experimental subjects
we would like to make our own decision
well that is a right that's taken away
under these rules the the corporate
Monsanto for example can bring case to
the World Trade Organization and claim
interference with their you know their
divine right to invest in trade freely
and that goes to a secret panel which of
course decides in favor of the
corporations now you know then the u.s.
is permitted to retaliate that's the way
it works and that's supposed to show
that everybody is equal so for example
if if you know
hey T let's say brings a case against
the United States for dumping chicken
parts in Haiti and destroying the
chicken parts industry as the US does in
fact and it destroys it they can bring a
case they can use a D dumping rules to
prevent the United States from doing
this and they can to punish the United
States for example they can close off
the Haitian market which will really
hurt the United States badly and the
United States can do the same to them
well okay we know how that's going to
come out so the US can impose penalties
on Europe and it can impose penalties on
Haiti and you know Kenya they can do it
back to us but this isn't even a joke
beyond this last point about this the
the new the evolving rules which are in
the World Trade Organization and other
arrangements give corporations what are
called the right of national treatment
meaning if General Motors operates in
Mexico they have to be treated like a
Mexican business on the other hand
that's a right that human beings
so if a Mexican comes to New York and
says I'd like to have national treatment
don't have to say what will happen
it's another respect in which the system
is designed so that human rights are
marginalized in favor of the rights of
private their own ease within a
complicated way and say only one might
ask why this whole organization is
needed at all is it doing anything that
cat wasn't doing I mean during the GAT
period which is since second world war
in the 1950s in the 1960s a trade growth
increased fast in fact it increased
faster than it's been increasing in the
last 20 years and that was just a
different arrangement again of the
powerful states but not this one there's
no particular reason to believe this was
needed for anything except to ensure and
enhance the rights of the designers the
rights and power with designers and ways
of the kinds of adventure
I'm in the linkage between the powerful
States and the wealthy corporate
structures is very tight in all sorts of
ways and state power is sinhala
specially in last 30 years has been
designed in order to extend the to
diminish the rights of people and to
extend the rights of private power it's
done in lots of ways I mean for example
liberalisation of capital flow which is
maybe the most important decision of the
last 50 years in international affairs
in the early 1970s a primarily through
us initiative but other major powers
came along there was a breakdown that
the Bretton Woods system the post-war
and international economic order was
essentially dismantled that order was
crucially based on the right of states
to control capital flow in and out and
relatively fixed exchange rate so you
don't have speculation against
currencies that was dismantled there are
a lot of reasons for it but in any event
it was a decision to dismantle it it
wasn't a law of nature and as it was
dismantled it had the expected effects
the the 1:1 effect was that it slowed
down well it was correlated with I
should say nobody understands the
International economy enough to be able
to use cause-effect terminology or you
can talk about is what happened so
there's no good models of financial
markets and so on but what happened was
as was predicted in fact by the founders
of Bretton Woods around the 40s that it
slowed down growth productivity
increased inequality slowed wages down
and so on it had these general negative
macroeconomic karlitz and probably
consequences but the other effect was
not even in question the founders of
Bretton Woods is at that time the US and
Britain recognized clearly that free
capital flow would undermine democracy
and that's almost trivial if
if investors and banks and so on can
move capital in and out of a country
freely without constraints they can set
policy they basically determine policy
there what's sometimes called a virtual
Parliament like they don't if a
country's some countries trying to say
stimulate its economy or to carry out
what investors regard as irrational
policies like say improving health or
education or something like that
protecting the environment well you can
punish them just defund the country now
drive up interest rates by pulling out
money which will slow down the economy
and lead to recession and in effect
terminate the policies so allowing free
cap it was well understood in the 1940s
this is perfectly explicit in the
planning for Britain woods nothing you
know making it up it was understood and
it's kind of obvious that unless a
country can control its own
its own capital basically with
constraints on export of capital with
decisions about you know under what
conditions people can invest you know
that I have to have local privileges for
say you know particular areas where you
want to invest or for minorities or
women or something like that unless you
have such constraints the decision on
how your country will run will be in the
hands of concentrations of international
capital not in the hands of its own
population so it's a weapon against
democracy the at the time in the 1940s
there was just overwhelming popular
support around the world for including
the United States for essentially social
democratic policies what we call a
welfare state and also
policies designed to government policies
designed for the welfare of the
population there was enormous popular
support for that and in fact even more
radical alternatives like dismantling
private ownership and there was a lot of
fear about that and the Bretton Woods
system was designed to protect those
rights sometimes called embedded
liberalism liberalism meaning free trade
but embedded and so what we call out
welfare state measures or social
democratic measures and of course ever
since then the business world and its
and the governments which are close to
it have been trying to dismantle that
system naturally and they've been doing
it in all sorts of ways but the
elimination of the constraints on the
liberalisation of capital flow was a big
change and it had the predicted effect
you can see it all over the world you
know from the United States Britain
Germany Sweden third world it's just a
disaster
the welfare state measures are declining
in the interests of concentration of
wealth in the United States a pretty
clear case we always a very limited
welfare state by international standards
like it's the only industrial country
with no health care system for example
but it had you know the word measures
kind of New Deal style measures and they
increased in the 60s but since the early
seventies they're being taken apart to a
large extent some people are fighting
for them and maintaining a lot of them
but they're considerably weakened and
you can even see it in just wages so for
example for the majority of the
population wages have either stagnated
or declined since the early seventies of
what wealth has been produced is much
more highly concentrated than in the
past and a lot of its kind of shaky its
stock market inflation asset inflation
but these are and these they're similar
effects throughout most of the world for
again for the third world it's can be
catastrophic and often is and those are
the natural expected anticipated and
certainly planned effects not too
surprising to see them happen
the World Trade Organization is part of
this much more general system as its
design is to exalt freak the right to
invest and to trade as the most supreme
human value but carefully nuanced so
they're strong protectionist elements
and this word innate everything else to
that
well no no wonder that huge number of
people around the world don't like you
can't take global polls but probably the
majority in places where you can take
polls it's the majority of the
population is opposed for good reasons
good organization and education but the
population has been opposed all along it
takes a NAFTA when the doesn't the
intent was in 1992 to ram NAFTA through
in secret the signal a signing of the of
the treaty by the three presidents got
virtually no no by the three executives
got no no publicity but it's kind of
broke into the public arena briefly and
then came a huge propaganda campaign to
try to convince people to be in favor of
it and normos all the media were like a
probably 100 percent in favor close to
it
a no-brainer I mean economic models
proving a Marvel it's going to be a
massive campaign interesting effect is
it didn't change people's minds at the
time of the NAFTA vote population still
opposed they know why for the most part
because there was no discussion or you
know
in fact the with one of the most
striking things is that the position of
organized labor was never allowed was
never made public
I mean labor did have a position an
official position
it was never public affected this day
has been made
rather they were kind of denounced as
you know crude vulgar nationalists with
the bullying tactics and so on denounced
from what's called the left like people
like Anthony Lewis in the New York Times
but their actual position was never made
public and their actual position was
quite constructive and fit makes sense
to go back and read it but it never
reached the public they never heard
about in fact even maybe even more
remarkable in a way Congress Congress
had it since been killed but it had a in
independent research bureau the office
of Technology Assessment and they had an
analysis of NAFTA which was very
critical they predicted that it would be
harmful to the populations of the three
countries and suggested a redesign in
ways which would be beneficial not just
to investors but also to people and in
fact their position was very much like
the labor position but that was
suppressed too as far as I know it still
hasn't been made public but despite the
attempt to conceal the to suppress the
any debate or discussion and to
and to keep people basically in the dark
even if major not knowing major
positions nevertheless public opposition
continued and it was still a majority at
the time of NAFTA same in Canada
Mexico's dictatorship so you can't
really be sure what public opinion was
but there were large-scale protests not
just of the general population but you
know business protested because middle
sized businesses recognize they're gonna
get wiped out and so on very little of
that was ever reported here so it was
true of NAFTA and it's been true of
every trade agreement since when it must
have been what fall of 97 I guess when
they tried to ram through fast-track
again it was like close to a hundred
percent support elite support media you
know business and so on but they could
not get it through and the reason they
couldn't get it through was described
sort of ruefully by the Wall Street
Journal it was for strongly in favor of
they said that the opponents of
fast-track have what they called an
ultimate weapon
namely the populations opposed and we
haven't quite figured out how to deal
with that PR problem so the you know
people were banging on the doors of
their local representatives and
demanding they vote against it and
finally it was voted down even by people
in Congress who were in favor of it
because of constituent pressure without
any anything much of an articulate voice
and the same thing happened shortly
after with multilateral agreement on
investments it was intended to be kept
secret it was negotiated for several
years in virtual secrecy I wasn't really
secret so the business world knew all
about it and was publishing monographs
and so on the newsroom certainly knew
about it but it was virtually nothing
published I actually did a review of the
media in several countries and you know
amazing how much how the discipline how
tight the discipline was finally China
broke through first in Canada
through the internet and other ways and
there was large the Sun has got known at
all within months it was a very
substantial protest grassroots
organizations and activists and so on
and they forced the OECD to back down on
it
I'm the OECD that roughly thirty richest
countries in the world and the major
corporations and the media and so on
that's a huge concentration of power and
nothing like it in world history but
they had to back down in the face of
grassroots activism and organization
well that was 1998
no it's year before Seattle so this
shouldn't come as a big surprise I mean
what happened was that there was enough
very effective organization and
educational programs and so on so that
people were out there in the streets but
it's a further development of the same
very natural phenomena reflection of the
opposition to the dismantling of
democratic structures and the attack on
human rights and so on
has to be done is to build on I mean the
corporate power and state power isn't
going to go away is going to home
they're going to continue trying to
implement the same decisions and the
NAFTA the Seattle protests did bring
together a very very dramatically a wide
range of constituencies international
domestic and so on which have rarely had
to do anything with one of them that
anything to do with one another before
if that can be used as a basis for
constructing a really powerful
international popular movement of many
coming from many different parts of
society that can really be a way of
changing a lot of things not just the
WTO but lots of more fundamental things
