thanks very much
quite a number of interesting and
important topics were raised by the
students who invited me here and I wish
there were time to talk about all of
them I hope you'll feel free to bring
them up in discussion but I thought what
I would do rather than trying to review
review those briefly is to focus on just
one question the most important question
that's ever been asked in human history
a question that should be uppermost in
one's mind it's been hanging over our
heads like a kind of sort of Damocles
for many years becoming more urgent
every year and it has now reached the
point that the question will be answered
in this generation that's your challenge
to answer it can't be delayed the
question is whether organized human life
will indeed survive and not in the
distant future the question was raised
clearly to everyone with eyes open on
August 6 1945 I was then
roughly your age happened to be at a
summer camp I was counselor in the
morning an announcement came over the
loudspeaker saying that the United
States had obliterated the city of
Hiroshima with a single bomb the atom
bomb people listened a few expressions
of relief and then everyone went on to
their next activity baseball game
swimming whatever it might be
ah I was horrified both by the news and
also by the casual reaction so utterly
horrified that I just took off and went
off into the woods for a couple of hours
to think about it it was perfectly
obvious if you thought for a second not
only about the horror of the events but
that humans in their glory had achieved
the capacity to destroy everything not
quite at that time but it was clear that
once the technology was established it
would only be developed further escalate
and would soon reached the point of
becoming what Dan Ellsberg in his recent
book central reading incidentally calls
the doom a doomsday machine an automatic
system set up so that everything becomes
annihilated and as he points out we have
indeed constructed such a machine we're
living with it the coming forward until
today leading specialists on these
topics echo much the same double concern
but now in more strong
stark and urgent terms than in 1945 at
one of the leading US nuclear
specialists former defense secretary
William Perry has been touring the
country recently with the message that
he is as he puts it doubly terrified
terrified by the severe and mounting
threat of nuclear war and even more so
by the lack of concern about the
possible termination of organized human
life and he's not alone
among others General Lee Butler formerly
head of the US Strategic Command
which controls nuclear weapons and
nuclear weapons policy
he recently reflected with deep remorse
on his many years of service in
implementing plans for what is sometimes
called omnis I'd cream crime far
surpassing genocide crime of wiping out
every living organism
he writes that we have so far survived
the nuclear age by some combination of
skill luck and divine intervention and I
suspect the latter in greatest
proportion and he adds a haunting
question by what authority do succeeding
generations of leaders in the nuclear
weapons States usurp the power to
dictate the odds of continued life on
our planet and most urgently why does
such breathtaking audacity persist at a
moment when we should stand trembling in
the face of our folly and United in our
commitment to abolish its most deadly
manifestations Dan Ellsberg in his
recent book again I urge that you read
it if you haven't describes the record
that he reviews mostly from inside the
government at the highest planning level
for many years and he describes it as a
chronicle of human madness and that's
accurate enough repeatedly we have come
very close ominously close to terminal
disaster the record should really be
studied carefully
it's shocking sometimes it's due to the
reckless acts of leaders sometimes our
leaders very often through just sheer
accident so I'll give you a couple of
examples they're actually hundreds
literally take one in 1960 when it was
discover
that the Russians might have missiles or
soon might have missiles the first early
warning system was set up to detect a
missile attack the first day it went
into operation it provided two high
leaders the information that the
Russians had launched the missile attack
with 99.9% certainty fortunately people
didn't react the way their its
instructed to react and it turned out
that there had been some miscalculations
and radar hit the moon and actually
bounced back wasn't expected to bounce
back and that's one case a couple of
years later 1962 came what's been called
rightly the most dangerous moment in
history Cuban Missile Crisis the
background is worth studying I won't
have time to go into it but it is
reckless acts of leaders including our
own leaders at the peak moment of threat
of the Cuban Missile Crisis which came
extremely close to terminal disaster at
that moment there were Russian
submarines outside the quarantine area
that Kennedy had established and they
were under attack by US destroyers were
dropping depth bombs on them the
conditions and the submarines were such
that the crew could not really survive
much longer they were not designed for
service in the Caribbean they were
designed for the far north the they had
us didn't know it at the time but they
had missiles with nuclear warheads and
the crew at some point decided look
since they're dropping bombs on us they
had no contact with any
there must be a nuclear war we might as
well send off the ultimate weapon that
would have been the end there would have
been a retaliation and then were
finished to send off the missiles that
required the agreement of three
submarine commanders - agreed one
refused volley arkhipov one of the
reasons why we're still here nineteen
seven that many other cases 1979 a
National Security Advisor speak Nayef
Brzezinski was literally on the phone
ready to call President Carter saying
that there was definite information of a
massive Russian missile attack when he
got a call saying it was an error so he
didn't call him a year later Ronald
Reagan came into office and one of his
first acts was to start a program to
probe Russian defenses the objective was
to determine what kind of Defense's the
Russians had against our attack if we
had one the official wording was to
practice command and staff procedures
with particular emphasis on the
transition from conventional to
non-conventional operations use of
nuclear meaning use of nuclear weapons
the idea was to simulate air and naval
attacks on Russia with the all of this
made as public as possible to the
Russians because they wanted to see how
they'd react including simulated nuclear
attacks at the time it was thought the
Russians would probably figure out that
it simulated wouldn't react now that the
Russian archives came out took turns out
they took it pretty seriously just as we
would certainly have done in fact one of
the leading US intelligence analyses
that recently appeared concludes from
the record title is the war scare was
for real
they took it extremely seriously right
in the midst of this the Russian
detection systems which are far more
primitive than ours
did detect an ongoing u.s. missile
attack the protocol is for the human
being who receives it his name had to
happen to be Vladimir Petrov he's
supposed to take that information send
it up to the Russian High Command and
they decide whether to release totally
destructive missile attack on us he just
decided not to do it he decided it
probably wasn't serious another reason
why we're alive can add him to the role
of Honor this goes on time after time
there have been literally hundreds of
cases that came very close The Bulletin
of Atomic Scientists as you probably
know established what they call a
Doomsday Clock shortly after the atomic
bombing the first what they do is every
year a group of physicists nuclear
specialists political a strategic
analysts get together try to assess the
state of the world the threats to the
world and set the minute hand of the
Doomsday Clock a certain number of
minutes before midnight midnight means
seg-y we're finished the first setting
1947 was seven minutes to midnight it
reached the most frightening setting
just two minutes to midnight in 1953
when what was easy to anticipate in 1945
had happened first the United States
then the Soviet Union carried out tests
of hydrogen bombs vastly more
destructive than atom bombs in fact an
atom bomb is just used as a trigger to
set it off it's a huge destructive
capacity
that meant that human intelligence had
reached the point where we could easily
destroy all all life no no problem and
the minute hand reached two minutes then
since then it's oscillated but in recent
years it's been approaching midnight
again January 2017 right after Trump's
inauguration the minute hand was
advanced to two and a half minutes to
midnight last January after a year from
in office it was advanced another half
minute to two minutes to midnight
that's a sign that we have now matched
the closest point the terminal disaster
in the nuclear age ominously close that
was January a couple months later
president Trump's Nuclear Posture review
was released raises the dangers further
I presume if the clock was set now it
might move another half minute to
midnight well
I'll return to current crises which are
very real and how they're being handled
and what we might do about them to avoid
disaster but first something else since
1945 we have been somehow surviving the
nuclear age actually miraculously and we
can't count on miracles going on forever
but we didn't know in 1945 was that
humans were entering into another epoch
a new one which is no less ominous it's
what geologists called the Anthropocene
a new geological epoch in which human
activity is destroying the environment
there have been debates among scientists
about when to date the onset of the
Anthropocene but last year the world
geological society that
Herman that a proper time to set it is
right after world war two at the same
time as the nuclear age the reason is
because of the sharp escalation at that
point in human activities which were
significantly damaging and will soon
destroy the environment for organized
life that's you might add that the
Anthropocene carries with it
automatically a third major epoch which
is called the sixth extinction you look
through millions of years of history
there have been periods when some event
caused the mass extinction of animal
life if the last one was 65 thousand
years ago when an asteroid hit the earth
destroyed about 75% of animal life and
at the age of the dinosaurs actually
opened a way for small mammals to
survive they ultimately became us we are
determined to become another asteroid
intent on destroying all most animal
life on earth and we will advanced in
that process so there are three major
epochs that we've been living with the
nuclear age the Anthropocene the sixth
extinction all accelerating so let's
just ask how dangerous is the
Anthropocene well give you a couple of
recent illustrations from some of the
leading scientific journals recent
articles start with nature british
journal the leading general scientific
article the title of the article is
global warming's worst case projections
look increasingly likely now reading it
a new study based on satellite
observations finds that temperatures
could reach could rise nearly 5 degrees
centigrade
by the end of this century the odds that
temperatures will increase more than
four degrees by that 2100 in this in the
current scenario increased from 62% to
93% in other words pretty near certain
you go back to the Paris agreement
sparse negotiations December 2015
they hope was in the international
negotiations that the temperature could
be kept the temperature rise could be
kept to 1.5 degrees centigrade rise and
they considered that maybe 2% would be
tolerable instead we're heading to four
to five percent with very high
confidence and here's one from the World
Meteorological Organization a recent one
concentrations of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere surged that a record-breaking
speed in 2016 last figures they have to
the highest level in 800,000 years the
abrupt changes in atmosphere witnessed
in the past seventy years the
Anthropocene are without precedent in
the geological record that globally
averaged concentrations of co2 reached
over 400 parts per million up from just
400 parts per million in 2015 which has
been sit considered the upper tolerable
limit so we're now beyond that the
concentrations of co2 are now 150
percent above the pre-industrial level
rapidly increasing atmospheric levels of
co2 and other greenhouse gases have the
potential to initiate unprecedented
changes in climate systems leading to
severe ecological and economic
destructions
the last time the earth experienced a
comparable concentration of co2
was somewhere around three to five
million years ago at that point the
temperature was two to three degrees
centigrade above now and the sea level
was thirty to sixty feet higher than it
is now
that's what we're moving to in the near
future in fact we're going beyond
because the prediction is the four to
five degrees centigrade well I'll leave
the effects to your imagination here's a
final example general science of the
leading American science journals even
slightly warmer temperatures less than
anticipated
in coming years could start melting
permafrost which in turn threatens to
trigger the release of huge amounts of
greenhouse gases trapped in ice there's
twice as much carbon and permafrost as
in the atmosphere the this will release
huge amounts of methane which actually
is far more lethal than co2
even though shorter persistence and that
accelerates other processes now very
clearly underway like the rapid melting
of polar ice and polar ice as it melts
it reduces the reflective surface
surface for sun's rays and creates more
absorbent surfaces the dark seas so that
accelerates warming could lead to a
nonlinear process in which everything
blows up west and our it's leading among
other things to the breaking up and the
melting of a huge Antarctic ice caps at
one of them West Antarctica contains
enough ice to raise sea level more than
10 feet we're pretty easy continued and
brief the prospects are extremely
serious in fact they're really awesome
which raises an obvious question what
are we doing about how are we reacting
well the world is actually taking some
steps
inadequate but at least something
there's a commitment and states and
localities in the United States are also
taking steps which is quite important
but what is of prime importance of
course is the federal government the
most powerful institution in human
history so what is it doing
it's withdrawn from the international
efforts but beyond that it's committed
to increasing the use of the most
destructive fossil fuels so our federal
government for which we are responsible
is dramatically leading a race to
destruction while we sit and watch
that's pretty astounding
that ought to be the screaming headline
and every day's newspaper what will be
the main topic you study in every class
never been anything like it and it is
astounding as is the lack of attention
another doubly terrifying phenomenon and
we should be asking among other things
what this tells us about our society and
about our culture what we are immersed
in and remember all of this is imminent
we're approaching this rapidly this
century it's your task to do something
about it and we're ignoring it it's
going on we're racing towards it we're
ignoring it meanwhile our chief
competitor and destroying the planet the
Saudi Arabian dictatorship has just
announced plans to spend 7 billion
dollars this year for seven new solar
plants and a big wind farm it's part of
an effort on its part to move from oil
which destroys everything it's a solar
renewable energy that how hot this is
Saudi Arabia and that highlights how
lonely we are in our race to destroy
even the extreme reactionary
dictatorship Saudi Arabia which lives on
oil refuses to join us at our unique
insanity which is dedicated to
destroying organized human life and it's
not just the current administration the
entire Republican Party leadership
agrees if you go back to the 2016
primaries every single candidate denied
that what was happening is happening
with the exception of those who were
called the sensible moderates like Jeb
Bush who said it's all kind of uncertain
but we don't have to do anything about
it because we're producing more natural
gas thanks to fracking in other words
making it worse the other sensible
moderate the adult in the womb as it was
called was John Kasich the government
governor of Ohio he's the one person who
agreed that anthropogenic global warming
is taking place but he added that we're
going to burn coal in Ohio and we're not
going to apologize for it
ethical grounds that's the worst of all
think about it well what about the media
they totally ignored this spectacle
every crazy thing you and I can imagine
was discussed extensively in the massive
cover at coverage of the primacy the
primaries but not the fact that the
entire leadership of the party was
saying let's quickly destroy ourselves
nothing go back and check also no
comment about it
the denialism of the leadership is
having an effect on public opinion
so Republican voters have been climate
change skeptics for a long time way
beyond anything in the world but it's
gotten far more extreme since Trump took
office and the numbers are
pretty shocking so by now half of
Republican voters deny that global
warming is taking place at all and only
30% think humans may be contributing to
govern the to global warming I don't
think you can find anything like that
among any significant part of the
population anywhere in the world and it
should tell us something one thing that
should tell us is that there's a lot to
do for those who hope that maybe
organized human life will survive and
we're not talking about a remote future
just think about the numbers I gave you
before we're talking about something
imminent well let's put that aside for a
moment and go back to the growing threat
of nuclear war are these ominous
developments inexorable so should we
just throw up our hands and despair say
ok we're finished have a nice time
goodbye that's not at all true there are
very plausible answers in every single
case that exists diplomatic options are
always open and there are quite
straightforward general principles that
can be quite effective one principle is
simple obey the law not a particular ad
achill idea almost unheard of but it
could have some consequences so what is
the law well there is something called
the US Constitution which people are
supposed to honor and revere
Constitution has parts as article 6 for
example article 6 of the Constitution
says that valid treaties are the supreme
law of the land every elected official
is required to observe them what's the
most important treaty of the modern
period unquestionably it's the United
Nations Charter article 1 of the chart
requires us to keep the peaceful means
to resolve international tensions and
disputes and to refrain from the threat
or use of force in international affairs
and I stress threat because that's
violated all the time by every president
and every high political leader every
time you hear the phrase all options are
open that's violating the supreme law of
the land if anyone cares let's take a
couple of examples and so take Iran it's
a important example there's a good deal
of talk about the possibility that Iran
and may be violating the joint
comprehensive agreement the jpz jcpoa
and the Iran deal
there's Emily no evidence for that a US
intelligence says they're observing it
the International Atomic Energy Agency
carries out repeated expections say
they're observing it completely now but
there's a lot of discussion about it
there's no talk about something else
is the u.s. violating the agreement and
try to check and see if anybody's talked
about that well the answer is that's
pretty simple u.s. is radically
violating the agreement and has been all
along the error the agreement states
that all participants meaning us must us
cannot are not permitted to impede in
any way Iran's reintegration into the
global economy particularly the global
financial system which we pretty much
control because everything works through
New York we are not permitted to
interfere in any way with the
normalization I'm quoting it the
normalization of trade and economic
relations with Iran we're doing that all
the time and in fact are proud of it all
violations of the agreement but it's
ignored
on a principle that's kind of
interesting the prevailing tacit
assumption that the United States just
stands above the law including its own
laws so we don't have to observe our
laws or any other laws because we're
just unique we do what we like see if
you can find an exception to that in the
discourse on this topic well in a couple
of days as you know we're a president
Trump will probably withdraw from the
treaty possibly that's a gift to the
hardliners in Iran tells them then they
should maybe return to nuclear programs
that's an opening for the new National
Security Advisor John Bolton for
Benjamin Netanyahu both of whom have
called for bombing Iran right away even
while they fully respect the terms of
the agreement that we violated publicly
quite publicly there's no secret about
it and the consequences could be
horrendous but there happens to be a way
of blocking those consequences namely by
the very simple device of respecting our
own law in fact the supreme law of the
land
again see if you can find a suggestion
to that effect
well are there peaceful options pretty
obviously in this case we could join the
rest of the world permit the agreement
to continue to function or better we
might turn to improvement of the
agreement that's one thing that Trump
has vociferously demanded and there's a
good ways to do that but one obvious
proposal for improving the agreement
which is ignored entirely it's to move
towards establishing a nuclear weapons
free zone in the region there are such
agreements in various parts of the world
Latin America for example and it's a
step towards mitigating the threat of
disaster
so what about a nuclear weapons-free
zone in the Middle East that were
established it would end any conceivable
Iranian threat that you can imagine so
is there a problem of establishing it
well actually there's one problem but
it's not the one that comes to mind
there's certainly no problem convincing
Iran because they've been calling for
this for years and vociferously
certainly not any problem with the Arab
world
they're the ones who initiated the
proposal 25 years ago the rest of the
world agrees as well there's one
exception the United States the United
States refuses to allow it to proceed
this comes you don't read this but it
comes up every couple of years and the
annual review meetings of the
non-proliferation treaty countries where
it's continually brought up continually
vetoed by the United States most
recently by President Obama in 2015 and
the reasons are perfectly clear to
everyone the US will not permit Israeli
nuclear weapons to be even examined and
by the a by the international agency
alone to be dismantled so therefore we
can't proceed with this very simple way
of eliminating any nuclear threat from
Iran or anyone else in the region and
also not discussed is that the United
States and Britain have a special
obligation a unique obligation to pursue
a nuclear weapons free zone in the
Middle East the reason is a United
Security United Nations Security Council
resolution 687 and look it up on the
internet which was initiated by the US
this was the resolution that was
initiated when the US and Britain were
this is back in 1991 it's a resolution
which called on
Arak to terminate any nuclear weapons
programs the US and Britain relied on
this resolution in 2003 when they were
trying to concoct some pretext for their
planned invasion of Iraq
so they appealed to this resolution and
said we think Iraq is violating it which
in fact they weren't and they knew they
weren't but if you read that resolution
go to article 14 it commits the signers
to work for a nuclear weapons free zone
in the Middle East so the US and Britain
are uniquely committed to working for
this by the Security Council resolution
that they initiated well again check to
see if it's ever discussed and so in
short the u.s. willingness to observe US
law could bring this crisis to a very
quick end and could even move on to a
better solution for example if we were
willing to observe Security Council
resolutions that we ourselves instituted
to end the illegal threats of force by
every recent president and other high
officials and to end our constant
violations of the Iran nuclear agreement
so the easy answers to this crisis
really simple obey the law okay that
would end the crisis again I advise you
to search to see how often this is
discussed and what that implies about
our educational system our culture our
media our universities and so on well
let's turn to the other major threat
North Korea there has been a proposal on
the table for some years about how to
reduce the threat in Northeast Asia it's
called a double freeze it was initiated
by China supported by North Korea
by Russia general sport throughout the
world the idea is that North Korea
should freeze its
weapons and nuclear programs and in
return the United States should call off
the threatening military maneuvers that
the us constantly carries out on North
Korea's border including flights on the
border by our most advanced nuclear
capable bombers warning of the threat of
total obliteration of North Korea
constantly happening and it's no joke
for the North Koreans they have a little
memory we may want to forget it but at
the end of the Korean War when it was
more or less settled a u.s. bombing was
so intensive that there was nothing left
to bomb literally so the Air Force
general macarthur started destroying
dams major dams and if you read the
airforce histories they exalt about this
happens to be a crime for which people
are hanged at Nuremberg but again we're
above the law but the North Koreans can
remember and when these advanced nuclear
capable bombing bombers are flying there
they Vokes a memory so double freezes
Impa is one possibility a double freeze
could easily open the way to further
negotiations and at this point the
record becomes important and you can
find it in the scholarly record not in
the press but in the scholarly record
there have been successes in
negotiations the major one was in 2005
the Bush administration was pressured by
international pressure to return to
negotiations and the negotiations were
extremely successful North Korea agreed
I'm quoting the final document North
Korea agreed to abandon all nuclear
weapons and existing weapons programs
and to allow
national inspections in return for that
the u.s. agreed to establish a
consortium that would provide North
Korea with a light water reactor for
medical use it would also us would also
issue a non-aggression pledge and an
agreement that the two uncoding that the
two sides would respect each other's
sovereignty exist peacefully together
and take steps to normalize relations
instantly the Bush administration
renewed the threat of force froze North
Korean funds and foreign banks and
disbanded the consortium that was to
provide North Korea with a light water
reactor the leading u.s. Korea scholar
Bruce Cummings writes that the sanctions
were specifically designed to destroy
the September pledges and to head off an
accommodation between Washington and
Pyongyang that was 2005 well I've been
searching the press for some time to see
if these facts can even be reported
breaking the constant refrain that North
Korea has broken all agreements and so
can't be trusted
can't review it now but I urge you to
try you'll learn a lot well that path
could be pursued again but as we know
there are even better options and it's
worth taking a close look at them on
April 27th North and South Korea signed
a remarkable historic document it's the
Panmunjom declaration for peace
prosperity unification of the Korean
Peninsula and it's worth reading
carefully urge you to do it not the
commentary the actual words in this
declaration the two Koreas I'm quoting
it affirmed the principle of determining
the destiny of the Korean nation on
their own accord on their
a court to completely continuing to
completely cease all hostile acts
against each other in every domain to
actively cooperate to establish a
permanent and solid peace regime on the
Korean Peninsula to carry out
disarmament on a phased level manner to
achieve the common goal of realizing
through complete denuclearization a
nuclear-free Korean Peninsula to
strengthen the positive momentum towards
continuous advancement of inter-korean
relations as well as peace prosperity
and unification of the Korean Peninsula
and they further agreed to actively seek
the support and cooperation of the
international community which means the
United States for the denuclearization
of the Korean Peninsula now it's
important to read those words their
import is very clear what they're saying
is the US should back off and allow the
two Koreas to achieve peace disarmament
unification and complete
denuclearization on their own on their
own accord in the words of the
Declaration so we the United States
should accept the call for support and
cooperation in this endeavor by the two
parts of the Korean nation to determine
their destiny on their own accord okay
to put it more simply the declaration is
a polite letter saying dear mr. Trump
declare a victory if you want to prance
around in public but please go away and
let us move towards peace disarmament
and unification without disrupting the
process now that plea could hardly be
more clear and the general
interpretation here is quite revealing
the general interpretation is that this
complicates Washington's strategy as the
New York Times explains mr. quoting it
mr. Trump will find it hard to threaten
military action against the country
that's extending an olive branch okay
that's the liberal side it's entirely
true that threatening military action
which happens to be a criminal act is
hard when the target is extending an
olive branch so we have some problems
well case after case I won't go through
other cases we find that there are
peaceful diplomatic options can't ever
be certain that they'll work but we
should always be prioritized in
accordance with their international
obligations
in fact in accord with the supreme law
of the land well is it hopeless no it's
not hopeless far from it and we have
plenty of evidence for that so let's go
back to very important date in modern
history November November 8 1916 huge
coverage of that date and several events
happened that are significant the least
significant of them was the one that
gets most of the coverage of the
election of Donald Trump it's a little
bit unusual but it's not that out of the
norm if a billionaire with a huge amount
of campaign spending and huge media
support wins the presidency that's kind
of within the norm but something really
surprising did happen the Sanders
campaign that broke with practically all
of American political history for well
over a century American elections have
been mainly bought literally you can
predict the outcome of an election with
almost complete certainty by just
looking at
campaign funding there's extensive
detailed academic study of this both for
President and Congress what happened on
November 16th was different for the
first time a candidate came very close
to winning the nomination and would have
won the nomination probably if the
Democratic Party managers hadn't
manipulated Affairs to keep him out thus
Bernie Sanders and he did it without any
campaign funding from any of the major
sources no corporate funding no wealth
no media support he was either ignored
or denigrated in the media that's a real
breakthrough what's more he ended up
becoming by far the most of the most
popular political candidate in the
country take a look at the polls as you
can see on Fox News in fact well away
well above any other political figure in
popularity well you know in a Democratic
Society the most popular political
figure in the country who had just
carried off a remarkable break and well
over a century of political history
you'd hear him every once in a while
okay I urge you to take a look and
didn't take your own decisions that's a
more important event that took place on
November November 2016 that is another
one which didn't get covered but should
at that time the world was carrying out
the successor negotiations to the Paris
negotiations the Paris negotiations on
climate change in December 2015
aimed at a treaty a verifiable treaty to
do something about this ominous threat
they couldn't reach a treaty for one
reason the American the Republican Party
would not permit
so they couldn't have a treaty it was a
voluntary agreement the following year
2016 they were meeting again to try to
put some teeth in the theory and the
treaty on November 8 the day of the
American elections the World
Meteorological Organization this was
taking place in Morocco Marrakech
Morocco the World Meteorological
Organization released the study on the
very dire state of the climate kind of
thing I gave a couple of samples of
before then the election results came in
the meeting basically stopped the
question before the international world
is can the world survive when the most
powerful country in history is taken
over by a political party that not
already denies that what is happening is
happening but it's committed to
accelerate the race to destruction and
they kind of hope that maybe China would
save the world from disaster just think
about that for a moment
maybe China will save the world from the
disaster that the Republican Party is
bringing to the world let you think
about that but the fact is there are
plenty of things that can be done and
the success of the Senators campaign and
particularly the aftermath lots of
things are going on the fed from it that
could make a difference
but it doesn't happen on its own and it
takes serious engagement well go back to
the beginning your generation that's you
is facing the most awesome question that
has ever arisen in human history the
question is will organized human life
survive and we're talking about the near
future can't escape it there are plenty
of opportunities like it or not it's up
to you to determine the fate of the
human species it's an awesome
responsibility
one that cannot be evaded
okay thank you
now it's your turn hello hello all right
good afternoon everyone just wanted to
give a quick thanks to everyone for
coming out tonight and a great thanks to
dr. Thompson tonight for this great
delivery tonight we're gonna open it up
about 20 15 minutes for discussion
questions so if you'd like to come up
here to give you a questions that'd be
great thank you hi professor Chomsky
first I just wanted to say thank you so
much for being able to come here it's
truly an honor to see you in person and
I really mean that
the question I have for you is in your
opinion do you see a link between Islam
as a set of ideas and Islamic
radicalization or is the latter solely
as a result of American foreign policy
in your opinion do you see a link
between Islam as a set of ideas and
Islamic radicalization or is the latter
solely as a result of American foreign
policy
Islamic ideas practice yeah
the Prussian about Islamic ideas in
practice I mean Islam is like
Christianity Judaism Buddhism find all
there's no such thing as Islamic ideas
there are lots of different Islamic
ideas just like Christian the real
question we should be asking
particularly here is what about
Christianity that's something we can do
about ok so that's the highest priority
so what are Christian ideals
well they vary all over the place people
in high places now claim to be devout
Christians and on the basis of Christian
ideals they're saying let's proceed to
destroy the world I don't know anybody
in the Islamic world is doing that
that's of course not all Christian
ideals there are others too Martin
Luther King expressed different
Christian ideals and it's the same with
the Islamic world you can find lots of
things but the idea that there are fixed
Islamic ideals which are a problem for
the world that doesn't mean anything you
have to look at take a look at
individual cases so take say Iran in the
United States both states in which the
leadership is led claims to be deeply
religious and committed to the faith and
asking what the two of them are doing
with regard to the leading issue that
they're now in conflict over turns out
that the Iranian leadership is calling
vociferously for establishing a nuclear
weapons free zone in the region which
would end any threat on the Christian
United States with its deeply Christian
leadership is named sorry we can't
because we have to preserve Israeli
nuclear weapon
from inspection well is it a problem
about the Islamic faith thank you would
it help if I approached you so you could
hear my question better or you're okay
I really loved the theme that was
present throughout your entire speech
where you talked about the necessity of
following the law and I feel like a big
problem is playing into that currently
is that white-collar legal practices are
not really being persecuted right now so
people empower people of wealth or not
submitting to the law and I was
wondering if you have any ideas on how
we could reform the judiciary system
that allows people to be persecuted if
they're in a place of power or in place
of great wealth there are easy ways for
the people in power to be prosecuted we
have laws okay so we could implement the
laws I mean I agree that it's kind of
unthinkable but but that's within our
power right it is within our power to
compel the authorities who are
technically under our control in a
democratic society to do something
simple like obey our own laws the every
administration says no that's impossible
so it takes a torture under the Bush
administration that was a massive
torture going on there's no debate about
this when Obama came in he decided he
determined that there would be no
punishment for the torture I choose when
you look back at the torture it's kind
of interesting it's claimed that the
bush massive torture by the bush regime
Guantanamo and all sorts of other black
sites around the world that that was in
violation of US law it's not so clear
the United States has never signed the
literalism ever has really never signed
that the International torture
convention under Reagan 1984 the u.s.
did sign it and ratify it
but with reservations when the u.s.
signs international agreements almost
always with reservations and those are
important to look at the reservations
excluded the kind of torture that the
CIA has determined is the most effective
torture it's what's called mental
torture not electrodes on the genitals
but the kind of torture that doesn't
leave a sign on the body which is
miserable vicious torture that they've
the term they picked it up from the KGB
the Russian KGB that this is the kind of
torture that really works and that kind
of torture was excluded that when the
u.s. signed and ratified the torture
convention it was then clinton added
further endorsement that something else
we might want to think about and we
might want to think about the fact that
the new head of the CIA is a woman who
was supervising this but that's only one
example the case of the constant threat
the constant threats of war the and it's
case after case like one thing that the
u.s. is very proud of talks about openly
under obama was carrying out a cyber
attacks against iranian nuclear systems
which severely severely harm them
another thing we're that happens to be
the pentagon regards cyber attacks as an
act of war the new Nuclear Posture
review
states that cyberattacks are a
legitimate nuclear war in response but
when we carry them out we're proud of it
okay
the drone campaign is a global
assassination campaign we assassinate
anybody we think might be planning to
harm us
I suppose that some other country did
that they suppose that Iran started
assassinating every president john
bolton the national security adviser who
writes in the main press that we should
bomb Iran no question about the threat
plenty of other people who they think is
or harming them half the leadership in
Israel how would we react and would we
think you know that's fine every right
to do it we have to reach a level of
civilization in which we are able to
think about ourselves and what we do
it's really easy to blame others right
but there's another question what about
ourselves can we reach a level of
culture in which we can ask ourselves
really simple questions like the kind
you're asking it's very hard you take a
look at the discussion and across the
spectrum and the intellectual culture
the questions just aren't raised and
that means a lot of work to do serious
work starting right here in universities
[Applause]
because of time restrictions we only
have time for four more questions so I
apologize for everyone who came up but
if you guys could please take your seats
first of all thank you for coming and I
thank you for the great talk
so the political revolution that Bernie
Sanders promotes is a bottom-up movement
and historically bottom-up movements in
the US that have succeeded have required
the presence of a sympathetic government
so in today's conditions when the
government is unresponsive and can be
quite threatening
how can a grassroots movement be
successful well just take a look at her
own history and it takes a let's go back
to the 1950s in the 1950s black people
were being lynched in the south with
celebrations black a black person
couldn't sit in a bus a black student
couldn't sit at a lunch counter I mean
there were laws in the United States up
with much later in fact against
miscegenation which said that if anyone
had one drop of black blood which means
any remote black ancestor they couldn't
marry a white person that was the 1950s
after the 60s is it true today no why
well one reason is a couple of black
students in Greensboro North Carolina
decided to sit-in at a lunch counter
they were of course immediately arrested
and dragged away I can't do a thing like
that I could have ended it but it didn't
a couple more black students came in the
next day it was a bigger arrest pretty
soon you had some white students coming
down to the south yeah the formation of
snake Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee he had Freedom Riders going to
areas in the south which are really like
Nazi Germany no you could just be
slaughtered inferred trying to allow a
black person to vote in fact I should
say that when Germany Nazi Germany was
searching around for some legal
precedent for their racist laws the
Nuremberg Laws the precedent they hit on
was the United States the United States
is the only country they could find
which had laws like the miscegenation
law they didn't quite accept US laws
Coast us laws were too severe the Nazis
didn't accept the one drop of blood law
and they thought that was too harsh but
that's the United States
it's the problems aren't over by any
means certainly not over but they're not
what they were
and that's grassroots movement same with
a woman's movement same with just about
any advanced and society that you can
think of these are not gifts from above
they come from activist movements often
students are in the lead there's a good
reason for that students not just in
this country others to countries to
students say you are our stage of their
lives where they are uniquely free think
about it you're sort of out of parental
control you're not yet in a situation
where you have to put bread on the table
to survive so you have a lot of freedom
they have a lot of free you can take you
can think you can talk to each other you
can go into that you're in a situation
in a any reasonable University I'm sure
here where you can explore you can
acquire you if you have the resources
it's a time when people can really think
about things not just about how to make
money tomorrow but about other more
important
things and one of the results says
students are often in the lead that's
why you had snick Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee Freedom Riders
and others and the same is true today
so aggressive movements can do you know
in a relatively free country like this
almost anything I mean for fairly
privileged people in the United States
like anybody here it's a pretty free
country by comparative standards not
like other places so a lot of
opportunities question is do you want to
take them
in both the doomsday machine and his
early memoir secrets Daniel Ellsberg
sort of describes a culture within
military leadership just a general
disregard and dismissal of sort of
civilian officials Authority in the
general public so that leads to the
question of how are we able to effect
change upon systems of power that ignore
or reject our attempts as citizens to
limit it how do you challenge the
prevailing culture let's just take a
look at the ways it's been done in the
past I mean the prevailing culture in
our you know in my lifetime in fact in
recent years the lifetime of all the
faculty here has changed attitudes
towards lots of things have changed
enormous ly as I say this country had
miscegenation rules laws up into the
late 60s I mean there was nowhere in the
world where they had anything like that
now even the Nazis didn't go that for
okay
it was changed the United States had
anti sodomy laws into up until the 2000s
okay that's changed how you change the
take women's rights I'm in until you go
back to America look take a look at
American history when the country was
founded women were not legally not
people literally the United States took
over British common law you read
Blackstone British common law women are
property not people a woman is the
property of her father and the property
is handed over to the husband okay
in fact you look back at the
Constitutional Convention
some of the arguments against allowing
women to vote were that would be unfair
to unmarried men because a married man
would have two votes his own vote in the
vote of the property okay that's
American law through almost all of
American history in fact it wasn't until
1975 it's not that long ago that the
Supreme Court determined that women are
peers they have a legal right to serve
on federal juries other things have
happened to again problems aren't over
but it's a huge change and case after
case these are by no means the only ones
you find out that we know exactly how to
proceed exactly how to proceed it's been
done over and over lots of opportunities
it's just a matter of taking them thank
you
thank you so much for coming I was
hoping you could talk about the
neoliberal ization
of Education where students such as
myself have incurred thousands of
dollars of debt where words such as
diversity and inclusion are offered as
hollow solutions to the effects of white
supremacy and USNO hegemony and where
student activists are punished more
severely than racists and rapists on
campuses
[Applause]
so how can we deal with the neoliberal
programs specifically with the
university is how that's being pushed
universities
well the neoliberal programs which
really took off under Reagan and
Thatcher there are few things before but
these are we could go through exactly
what they were but their consequences
are very clear and they were designed to
have those consequences so during the
neoliberal period that's basically since
Reagan well wealth as highly
concentrated in very few hands and for
working people it's been stagnation or
decline literally real wages for
American workers are actually literally
lower than they were before the
neoliberal programs began productivity
per worker amount of output per worker
has about doubled but wages have
stagnated or declined that money is
going somewhere it's going in there very
few pockets a lot of its going into
financial institutions we just exploded
during this period and do nothing for
the economy they probably arm it goes on
and on like this now that's the this
also incidentally undermines democracy
but perfectly obvious means that once
wealth becomes concentrated and
corporate power becomes unleashed that
one of the things they do is just take
over the political system by pretty
obvious means funding lobbying writing
legislation and so on
so the net effect is to make democracy
much less functional and we see the
effect
snow in the United States but elsewhere
democratic institutions are under attack
the cover of the journal Foreign Affairs
the main establishment Journal this
month take a look at the cover it says
is democracy dying it's the wrong
question question is are we killing
democracy an answer is yes we've
designed systems which are killing
democracy that's you see it in election
after election not just in the United
States but through most of the developed
world anger fear contempt for centrist
institutions they're collapsing the main
parties are collapsing and so the
democratic system is being undermined
alone along with the rest now what's
going on in the universities well that's
pretty interesting
since essentially the 1970s kind of
neoliberal revolute number of very
important things have happened
remember that US higher educated 12
there's been radical defunding just
killing the system and there are major
efforts to destroy the public education
system Koch brothers Alec the big
lobbying organization for corporations
are carrying out programs state-by-state
systematically to try to get state
legislators to pass laws which will
essentially eliminate the public
education system defund it make it
private you know part of the neoliberal
system massive public education is one
of the great contributions of the United
States that's one of the major u.s.
contributions to modern democracy late
19th century the you know us initiated
mass public education which is extremely
important established at the now they're
trying to kill it but what about
universities same thing the US
established
public universities which were unknown
in the world in Britain nearest analogy
they didn't really start public
universities until after the Second
World War
red brick university so cold it was
elite universities so the land-grant
universities were extended generally
higher education was also under attack
students are under attack students are
now coming out of college with huge
debts it's not an economic necessity of
course not
it's take a look at other successful
industrial countries like say Germany
most successful industrial country in
education is free and it takes a Finland
which ranks highest in all international
tests education is free the same in case
after case and the same is true in
poorer countries so go south of the
border this country called Mexico okay
it's a poor country quite a good
education system knowing that teachers
are underpaid it's poor country but Unum
major at university I've lectured
there's very high quality free ok take
the United States up internal Liberal
programs higher education was pretty
much free oh it was a much poorer
country then remember we're wave richer
than we were then but the GI Bill gave
free education and subsidies to huge
numbers of people who were would never
have gone to college it was very good
for them was very good for the country
wasn't flawless it was racist remember
almost everything was officially racist
housing everything else the GI Bill
didn't reach blacks because of the
segregated army until too late you know
but it certainly was a major advance in
fact even the Ivy League colleges were
pretty much free actually I went to one
in 1945 University of Pennsylvania at
the wishin was a hundred dollars a year
and you could easily get a scholarship
because they did okay so has anything
changed I mean then we were much but
we're still a rich country but much
poorer than today so is there any
economic reason for the explosion of
tuitions no is there any reason why
administration and universities as
exploded while faculty decision making
us declined yeah there's a reason
imposition of business models when you
impose business models on universities
you get massive inefficiency that's what
the business world is administration
controlled testing and for okay so yes
these things are happening I mean there
are not laws of nature their decisions
and decisions can be reversed but to
reverse them you have to understand
what's going on in the world have to
find the sources and use all the means
that are available to bring the
understanding to people and reverse
what's going on that's not that hard
laws can be changed the Koch brothers
don't have to succeed in getting state
legislators to destroy the public
education system they will if there's no
resistance but they don't have to it's
kind of interesting to look right now
the teacher strikes and one of them is
in Arizona where my wife and I live this
is the state that has the lowest
practically the lowest pay for teachers
in the country teachers in the country
are paid very low as compared to their
skill levels and other occupations
roughly 75% Arizona it's about sixty
percent they are now all on strike okay
West Virginia on strike Oklahoma on
strike all the deep red states for good
reasons that's where the budgets are cut
in order to kill the educational system
and other benefits for people and the
teachers are not just striking for
higher pay it's important therefore
striking to improve the funding of
Education
so that teachers don't have to teach
overcrowded classes so the class has
chalk to draw on a blackboard that
teacher doesn't have to bring it in so
they're not just saying give us higher
pay they're saying revive the
educational system so children will be
able to have a decent education and go
on for better lives and to improve the
country they're in the forefront of this
and they can be helped
I'm sorry we gotta cut it off right now
so thank you everyone for coming that's
it with the questions please give us
special thanks to dr. Tom C for coming
out and talking to us today
