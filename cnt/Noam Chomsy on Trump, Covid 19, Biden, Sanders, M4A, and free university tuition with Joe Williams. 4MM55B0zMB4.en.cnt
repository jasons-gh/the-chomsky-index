but have a high-end correct priority
we've got to get rid of the malignancy
in the White House and they felt African
Americans and women particularly two
major constituencies seemed to feel that
Sanders would not be able to put
together a broad enough coalition to win
the election you can debate this
I mean maybe right maybe wrong but it's
not an unreasonable conjecture there was
another factor young people who support
Sanders didn't vote now that's a you
know that's a big loss he was hoping to
get a surge of new voters which would be
mainly young people and strongly support
him but apparently they were too busy
was there like that I don't know what
happened yeah I was just looking at the
National Review rich Lowry referred to
Bernie Sanders as the president as well
it there's a National Review article
written by rich Lowry one of the editors
and it's entitled are we ready for
president Noam Chomsky Hecky yeah you
hear that all the way over to people
like Paul Krugman left of the mainstream
spectrum who say yeah I think his ideas
are fine but the American people aren't
ready for it which is a very interesting
criticism because take a look at his
proposals universal medical care free
higher education those are the two main
ones every other major country has this
so what these people are saying is the
United States is such a primitive
backward society that it can't rise to
the level of comparable societies may
that's true but that's the kind of
condemnation of the United States you
might expect to hear from Russian
propaganda and that's the left of the
spectrum in the United States didn't
seem to understand what they're saying
what's so remarkable about doing what
everyone else in the world does I mean
every other developed Society and most
others have universal health care that
free higher education is everywhere next
door in Mexico and Finland which comes
out first and educational testing every
year Germany France and almost
everywhere so the United States can't
rise to those little in fact didn't we
we used to have a free college in
California right wasn't it regulated and
sort of in the 1950s higher education
was essentially free it was called the
GI Bill and my father went to Penn on
the GI Bill
yeah I was at Penn I was a little too
young to be been a soldier but most of
the fellow students were former soldiers
it was kind of interesting for me
because I was a 16 year old kid and
these guys looked like ancient people 25
or something that was another universe
was very good for me because in the
psychology lab one of the I had my
partner was a xgi and we had to do
things that I just couldn't do like cut
up a frog but he had no problem with it
so I was able to pass a couple but the
point is it was not my free but they got
subsidized and it was very good for the
country was very good for them obviously
but I was you know I I just do as a kid
from high school
tuition at Penn when I got there was a
hundred dollars a year and he could
easily get a scholarship I had a
scholarship so I went free
I mean that's what the country and it
was a much poorer country then remember
we're a much richer country now than we
were then so there can't be any economic
reasons for this I think it's has
totally different reasons I I've talked
to some Democrats and they said why
should I you know I paid for my college
tuition why should I give it to somebody
for free or with health care they say
you know it won't be high quality health
care you know it would be sort of
actually the US has about the lowest
quality health care and the OECD has
twice the expenses and some of the worst
outcomes I'm it's true that if you're
privileged and wealthy you get you can
get a very high quality health care but
incidentally that's a joke - I mean I've
I've lived in Boston all my life the
best hospitals in the country I've had
some fairly serious surgery a couple
times over the last 40 years I mean the
surgery itself is very high quality but
the treatment is awful there no this is
the best hospitals the top ones the
University Hospitals Britain and women
not Auburn world they they lead go and
so on I mean like in Mount Auburn I had
to have a fairly serious spine operation
couple disc room and I was in a word
with eight men it was one nurse who was
also busy with other wards I had to have
a spot on the back where surgery is
going to be there had to be a had to be
swallowed by some antiseptic at four
o'clock in the morning I was on a walker
I could barely move the horrible thing
the nurse came blind she said sorry I'm
too busy you have to do it yourself so
somehow I managed to get into a shower
was great pain
put the swab on my back magic it by with
the Walker with the IV and that's the
best and you have the best coverage yeah
after the surgery I was I was kind of
waking up from from the anesthesia I was
on a gurney in the hole outside and I
was waking up I was dying of thirst I
tried to get somebody get me a drink of
water I must have been there for 45
minutes everybody went but I was too
busy I mean that's the best Hospital in
the country so yes
the surgery is very high-class but the
treatment is you know like a third-world
country and of course if you poured far
worse you go into the emergency room at
Mass General in the best Hospital that's
pathetic people sitting there for
sometimes days trying to get somebody to
pay attention to it terrible headache so
the idea that it's high quality is the
truth
in fact the system is set up on a
business model which means you have to
have what's called efficiency not a any
single thing extra so if everything's
perfect works fine slightest thing goes
wrong like the nurse has too much to do
you're in real trouble
and that's what's causing the problem
now this is why we weren't prepared you
say for the coronavirus because of a
sore neoliberal capitalist medicine
medical system I mean you run a bit you
run a hospital the way you do an auto
plant
now if assembly-line stops for a couple
minutes from the Ford plant lesson
terrible happens it stops in a hospital
you go to catastrophe
we can thank Milton Friedman you're
saying this the the whole idea of
neoliberalism started maybe in the 1920s
in Vienna
I heard you I was just listening to your
another interview did
talk about that yeah they're really
disturbing neoliberalism and
authoritarian regimes to me
well they I'm in the guru you know the
man figure was hired to con Mises was
the main of our Mises by account others
and they were in Austria they they like
they were very happy with the
austro-hungarian Empire because it
didn't interfere with what they call the
sound economics which is the only thing
that matters and it was a kind of a free
trading area quite very brutal an
autocratic but who cares about that
after the war first world war Austria in
the countries broke of Austria where
they were had a social democratic
government strong labor movements they
were crushed by violent state
intervention I was a
proto-fascist children von Mises
couldn't overcome in his euphoria was
delighted when I Mende that helped
preserve sound economics the labor
unions and social democracy interferes
with the market like labor unions try to
get better rights for workers it's a
market interference and of that so if a
fascist government comes in smashes
unions was fine and it all became
completely obvious under Pinochet I mean
their first chance to really impose new
liberal principles was under the
Pinochet dictatorship and it was a
perfect experimental conditions nobody
could protest torture chambers took care
that they had money pouring in from the
United States the World Bank and so on
every possible advantage and they were
smart enough not to close the source of
Chile's economic wills they nationalized
her company Cadell which was producing
the main wealth for the country was very
efficient so they forgot their
principles put them aside let that keep
running
in fact now everything was perfect and
about five years they crashed the
economy in state to take it over nobody
talks about that but this is perfect
experimental conditions doesn't affect
anything we've got our principle sound
economics whatever that sound economics
means the market is perfect so if I have
a billion dollars and everybody else has
ten dollars the perfect market produces
luxury yachts for me and a bag of potato
chips for anything else that's sound
economics speaking of you know hospitals
they here in Philadelphia I remember
Bernie came here he's trying to keep
hanaman I mean University Hospital open
but it was sold to some guy who's he's
like a real estate developer and it's
when the virus started I I know the
mayor was trying to get it reopened so
they could you know serve more people
but he refused to he I think he's gonna
make condominiums or suffer that's
normal
yeah that's good at comic reason I see a
place where you could put plenty of
patients yeah motels oh they're all
empty
got plenty of beds I wouldn't hold your
breath oh wait oh so we're left with
basically Joe Barton and isn't he also
sort of neoliberal I know you said this
is the most consequential election
probably in human history but nothing to
rave about I mean first of all he's
much cognitively-impaired yeah I think
so
term if he's elected my policies will be
made by the people around it whoever
they are he put out a list of people he
he bring in I think Jamie Dimon you know
those types of suppose it's Jamie Dimon
not my favorite person
he's infinitely better than trunk
infinitely better I mean almost anything
you can think of is better than this
mania he's actually driving us to
destruction the people who refused to
vote for him like a lot of the less
consuming aren't thinking I mean you
have another four years of trunk on
global warming you may be passed tipping
points we may have a nuclear war even if
you look domestically the courts will be
so packed with young ultra-right maniacs
that nothing will be possible for a
generation I mean the guy is a real
super danger not just him but Mitch
McConnell and the other guys who part of
his entourage it's their know they're
going to destroy the world
you can vote for anybody he's bitter
because you know they're you're right
you know cuz I was a huge Bernie's
supporter and I've noticed some of the
the people I've met on social media they
they said there's no they can't vote for
buying because of the well there were
sexual assault allegations against them
recently and suppose it's true I mean
his sexual assault thirty years ago
worse than destroying human civilization
and you're not one given for hyperbole
so for you to say that he said it'll be
the end of organized human life it's not
just me it was a very interesting memos
it just leaked
oh yeah the case what Chase Bank JP
Morgan Chase so JP Morgan Chase
Jamie Dimon spanked internal memo to
investors said that the bank's policies
of fueling of funding fossil fuels are
putting the survival of humanity at risk
okay that's the biggest bank in America
I know I yeah I know you've it been
answers before uh don't they have to
live on the planet to what you know is
they're putting these their short-term
profit over
that's exactly right but they've known
it all along
Jamie Dimon is no fool knows as much
about global warming as we do but you
know you've got to live by making profit
tomorrow
hands down that's the same with the
coronavirus I'm in 2003 the drug
companies the new perfectly we'll
whatever he scientist was telling them
including the wrong
another major pandemic is coming it'll
probably be a corona virus did they
prepare for him you know it's not our
business if a catastrophe is going to
come our business is making sure his
profit tomorrow as capitalism okay as
it's a lethal system it can be
controlled like the Salk vaccine I mean
when I was a kid
polio was a terror and I remember the
summer people were afraid to go to the
beach children were dying well it was
cured by a government initiated
government-sponsored program and no bad
Jonas Salk refused refused to take a
patent should be free as the son he said
right yeah
well that's yeah it's capitalism but
they're kind of it
Sammy saying regimented capitalism
before the neoliberals managed to take
over and turn it into a total
monstrosity
was a neoliberalism was that a term
coined by David Harvey is it no okay
they called it or they call it in fact
the term I think was first used in 1938
around it even there's some go back even
earlier the point is they were not
trying to restore the old liberal order
in the austro-hungarian Empire which
they loved they were going to try to
adapt it to new situations so his new
liberalism and here well in the United
States did it start with Reagan which is
a Ronald Reagan I'm starting to be it
started in the late seventies you know
the old system of regimented capitalism
was routing but it really took off with
Reagan and his inaugural speech cover
it is the problem it's not the solution
let's turn everything funny how people
couldn't understand what that means
what's government the government is
something that's at least partially
accountable to the population if
government isn't making the decisions
who is private corporations are they
accountable to the population zero mama
they're pure tyrannies which are totally
unaccountable accepted themselves and
Milton Friedman chimed in and said
corporate managers have only one duty to
increase the wealth of the corporation
to enrich the shareholders were very
rich so that's the duty and government
can't intervene which is a joke
because every time they have a problem
they plead with the government to bail
them out started right away with Reagan
when he built a feeling back big
feelings Bank
happening again right now what's
happening now you take a look at what's
happening now so the air airline
industry is asking for 50 billion
dollars why do they need 50 billion
dollars the reason is that during the
orgy of profit making since 2009 they
have not been developing their
businesses they've been buying stock to
inflate stock prices for their
shareholders but also for management I
said they've been interfering with the
market to inflate stock to inflate their
own salaries and management bonuses and
so on now they're pleading for the
counts about 50 billion dollars now
they're pleading with a nanny state to
give it give it back to them well before
Reagan that was illegal couldn't do it
stock buybacks couldn't do it and the
treasurer enforced it so it didn't
happen
Ragan open disputes because government
is the problem
same with tax havens they have tens of
trillions of dollars you know Apple has
a small office in Dublin somewhere the
Nestle taxes that's Reagan before Reagan
tax havens were illegal and it was
enforced okay that's tens of trillions
of dollars we're talking about not small
change other things have happened under
neoliberalism so that the financial
institutions we shall overwhelmingly
dominate the economy I mean Blackrock
has tens of trillions of dollars and
just half owns the economy none of this
was around pregrated banks were working
for the real economy you know your bank
is a place where you put in money if you
had something you didn't use and they
lend it to somebody to buy a car change
radically with the neoliberal system now
it's basically financial institutions
run the place and every and they
repeatedly get into trouble and crush
the economy happened over and over each
time worse than the last
each time the taxpayer bales a month
Obama was the list okay no with the
automobile the GM right he also built
out well Obama virtually nationalized
the auto industry there were a couple of
things that could have been done they
one is to just hand it back to their
former owners may be new faces with the
same system haven't producing more cars
there was another possibility and it
over to the workforce and let them
produce what we need which is not new
cars and smashed public transportation
that's a possibility if there had been
public pressure might have happened it's
not going to happen if you don't have
public pressure then there's one group
in the country that's constantly
relentlessly
fighting class war the business classes
the dedicated Marxists never stopped
from class war for an instant
they're doing it right now so right now
I don't know if you paid attention to
this but Trump and February came out was
the most amazing budget proposals
pandemics region he was denied but
everybody else knew
he said just don't uh just sneeze into
your elbow and don't touch your face no
you know everyone around him certainly
what's the budget cut down on funding
for the center of Disease Control
something we've been doing credible term
for any health-related part of the
government cut funding but increase
funding for fossil fuels so I mean it's
as if these guys are you know dedicated
sociopaths
let's harm everybody in the world as
badly as we can of course more for the
military and for his wool that's
mid-february so these guys and at the
same time his EPA which not just run by
corporate polluters decided to lower
restrictions on the emissions so we'll
kill a lot more people
that's terrific I remember my bad
um this is worse than Hitler Germany
really is oh yeah you've said that too
is the worst the GOP is the worst little
organization in history can't get
anybody listening but it's obvious that
Hitler wasn't trying to destroy it we're
gonna human life on earth because I
thought Bush and Cheney were pretty bad
but it seems like it just gets into war
they get worse every four years they
they find somebody else I'm in Bush
whatever you think of him he had a
certain resemblance to human beings
doesn't he
but Antrim and Bush did some very good
things if he doesn't get treated for Oh
wishes AIDS program and Africa saved
millions of people you can imagine so
yeah we have to pick Biden wh oh he's
he's defunding them as well that's a
good move for him it'll kill a lot of
people and it may slightly improve his
election chances so that's fine why not
for this for the coronavirus a I don't
know if you said this that one person
dies every forty or so seconds in the
United States how did we we came I mean
we we really are exceptional in some of
the worst ways we're now have the most
cases in the world and we didn't even
even compared to China where it's kind
of shocking to me so some people have
said that maybes Chinese lying about
their numbers maybe in the United States
case we don't know because the United
States under Trump is the one country
that is so dysfunctional can't even
provide statistics so we don't know in
the United States yesterday we learned
that Britain has been under estimating
deaths by about ten percent but maybe
China is I mean we don't know for sure
medical specialists don't see any
particular evidence for it and it's not
clear whether they should be what are
they getting out I mean by early January
they had provided all the relevant
information they had identified the
source of the virus the sequence the
genome provided the information to the
entire
and countries that are functional paid
attention so the East Asian countries
immediately reacted they all have it
under control that New Zealand seems to
quash the virus totally hmm the United
States and the hands of the freak show
so they claimed it wasn't happening now
they're trying to blame somebody else
he said Germany's doing a pretty good
job to Angela Merkel done a good job for
itself but it doesn't give any aid to
the northern Italy right across its
border fortunately northern Italy can
Yeti from Cuba not from Germany yeah so
yes it did a good job for themselves
tells you what the European Union
announced that's funny because Bernie
you know got a lot of trouble for just
saying oh he thought Cuba had a really
good literacy program they're the best
health program in the world Cuban health
statistics are better than the United
States and probably 2% of the expenses
Wow and they're heavy their medical
training I think free also than their
medical school internationally it's the
one country in the world that believes
in genuine internationalism so there's
thousands of doctors all over in the
most difficult places not just now this
has been going on for a long time and
remember they're not just a poor country
it's crushed under the American Jacklyn
constantly hideous sanctions murderous
sanctions they're showing the whole
world you're a bunch of you know you're
a bunch of total jerks through the old
insane country and now I know you'd
mentioned Brazil to Brazil as sort of
the lunatik of the south you were saying
well Dee just a couple days ago was
there was a study released by Brazilian
scientific institutions claiming
that's assessing the coronavirus effect
on Brazil they concluded that the
reported death rate is one twelfth of
the actual district now talk about China
an underestimate within the flaw bella's
beyond belief
they're supposed to have washed their
hands you know where they were not
supposed to you know said isolate
yourself with 20 people of living in a
room and she's very interesting in
Brazil there is an organization that's
trying to bring some semblance of health
proper health behavior to the favelas
you know who it is that's the crime
gangs that terrorize the favelas they're
so strong the police are afraid to go in
now they're the ones who are imposing
health standard
tells you something about the world I
was also thinking about like a house
how's this impacting Gaza for example
look good I mean there were a couple of
cases and get it so far it's controlled
by the designer controls because that's
sort of like a open-air prison in other
poor communities I so for example in
Canada which has a pretty bad record not
as bad as the United States was bad
the indigenous population the First
Nations don't have any doctors and
medical assistants
so they've appealed to Cuba to help them
in Cuba degree Canadian government can't
accept help from Cuba the Communist the
United States will get angry Wow so
therefore let the indigenous communities
that's Canada our civilized neighbor you
in one of the talks you were talking
about a progressive international
movement that would maybe the only it's
gonna be have his first opening meeting
I think in November oh this actual
organization it's being formed initiated
by Sanders and Janos very focus that's
being prepared but if the first
international conference is scheduled
for sometime in November you you uh you
were giving it I guess about a hundred
talks a year all over the world now
would you say how is it now I like now
you're it's worse it's constant and you
know the technology is not all that
great so sometimes it's some air try
yesterday I think just going to work
with yes
difficult now I'm not a 25 years old
anymore
yes wearing which reminds me I've gotta
get lost another interview coming in
three Oh Yuki state champ oh thank you
so much for your time okay it's a great
honor to talk to you
they don't do trace try Stacey and
everything getting here what's that
thanks so much norm
