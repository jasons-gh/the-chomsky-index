the Middle East the region is engulfed
in flames from Libya to Iraq one new
formation jihadi formation after another
seems to spring out from nowhere and the
current focus of course is on Isis what
can you tell us about Isis and whatever
its origins well actually there's an
interesting article that just appeared
in a couple of days ago by a highly
qualified analyst Graham fuller CIA
background one of the leading
intelligence and mainstream analysts of
the Middle East and the title is the
United States created Isis this is one
of the conspiracy theories the thousands
of them that go around the Middle East
but this is another source this is right
at the heart of the US establishment now
he hastens to point out that he doesn't
mean the United States decided to put
Isis into existence and then funded it
his point is and I think it's accurate
that the United States created the
background out of which Isis grew and
developed part of it was just the
standard sledgehammer approach smash-up
what you don't like in 2003 the United
States and Britain invaded Iraq major
crime just this afternoon the British
Parliament granted the government the
authority to bomb Iraq again the
invasion was devastating to Iraq Iraq
had already been virtually destroyed
first of all by the long decade-long war
with Iran in which incidentally the Iraq
was backed by the United States and then
the decade of sanctions which were
described there
they were described as genocide 'el by
the international respected
international diplomats who administered
them and both resigned in protest for
that reason they devastated the civilian
society they strengthened the dictator
compelled the population to rely on him
for survival it's probably the reason he
wasn't sent on the path of a whole
stream of other dictators who were
overthrown finally the u.s. just decided
to attack the country 2003 the attack it
was compared it's compared by many
Iraqis to the Mongol invasions of the
thousand years earlier very destructive
not a hundred thousands of people killed
men's refugees amazed by the displaced
persons the destruction of the
archaeological richness and wealth of
the country back to Sumeria and one of
the effects of the invasion was
immediately to institute sectarian
divisions part of the brilliance of the
invasion force its director Paul Bremer
was to separate the sect the sect Sunni
Shia Kurd separate them from one another
set them to each other's throats
within a couple of years there was a
major sectarian conflict incited by the
invasion a very brutal that you can see
it if you say look at Baghdad if you
take a map of Baghdad and say in 2002
it's a mixed city Sunni and Shia are
living in the same neighborhoods they're
intermarried in fact sometimes they say
they didn't know who was Sunni who was
Xie it's like knowing whether your
friends are in one Protestant group or
another Protestant group there are
differences but it was not a it was not
hostile in fact for a couple of years
they were
but both sides were saying they'll never
be sunni-shia conflict were to
intermingle than the nature of our lives
where we live and so on and by 2006 it
was a raging war out of that that
conflict then was spread to the whole
region by now the whole region is being
torn apart by Sunni Shia conflicts and
out of such conflicts the natural
dynamics of them of a conflict like that
is it the most extreme elements begin to
take over and they had roots their roots
are in the major US ally Saudi Arabia
that's been the major US ally in the
region as long as the US has been
seriously involved there in fact since
the foundation want since the foundation
of the Saudi state it's kind of a family
dictatorship as you know and the reason
is has a huge amount of oil Britain
before the United States had all
typically preferred radical Islamism to
secular nationalism and when the US took
over it essentially took the same stand
a radical Islam which is centered in
Saudi Arabia's most extremist radical
Islamic state in the world no makes Iran
look like a tolerant modern country by
comparison but and of course the secular
parts the Middle East the of the Arab
Middle East even more so but it was the
it's not only directed by an extremist
version of Islam the Wahhabi Salafi
version but it's also a missionary state
so it uses its huge resources oil
resources to promulgate these doctrines
throughout the region establishes
schools mosques you know clerics and so
on all over the place is from Pakistan
to Africa North Africa and
an extremist version of Saudi extremism
is the doctrine that was picked up by
Isis so it grew out of ideologically the
most extremist form of Islam the suti 1b
version and the conflicts that were
engendered by the by the u.s.
sledgehammer that smashed up we rightly
racked and has now spread everywhere and
that's what fuller means by a Saudi
Arabia not only provides the ideological
core that led to the Isis radical
extremism but it also funds them not the
Saudi government but wealthy Saudis
wealthy quai T's and others provide the
funding and the ideological support for
these jihadi groups that are springing
overall up all over the place there are
other this attack on the region by the
United States and Britain is the source
of where this thing originates
that's what fuller meant by saying the
United States created Isis and you can
be pretty confident that as conflicts
develop
they'll become more the more extremist
the more brutal the harshest troops will
take over
that's what happens when violence
becomes the means of interaction it's
almost automatic it's true in
neighborhoods you know it's true in
international affairs and the dynamics
are perfectly evident and that's what's
happening that's where Isis comes from
if Isis if they manage to destroy Isis
they'll have something more extreme on
their hands
