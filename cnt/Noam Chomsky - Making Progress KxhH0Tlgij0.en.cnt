if the world is displayed the comma
stars and distance ended in different
places and what is a commissar will be
called a dissident eventually in our
present distance many heroes what is the
possibility having a real change global
scale interested in the doctrine that
the professor who introduced you said
focus time it's ever changing but if you
think about it it's changing for the
better and it's not changing for the
better buy any gifts from the God do you
think focusing on personal change you
know that's a decision you have to make
but I don't think so no but the fact of
the matter is if you look over time
today first of all the Soviet system of
tyranny did collapse looking at
ourselves the counterpart of Eugene Debs
would not be thrown into jail today
nor would Bertrand Russell be thrown
into jail today nor would Emma Goldman
be kicked out of the country today nor
would labor be crushed in anything like
the fashion it was crushed in the 1920
that's all unimaginable today things
aren't great and plenty of things wrong
but there's a lot that's much better
I mean just think about today's problems
you know like say today there's a
problem of trying to maintain I know
this is a value judgment maybe you have
different values but I'll speak for my
own there's the problem of trying to
sustain and extend and strengthen the
very meager health care system that we
had there was no such problem in the
1960s because we didn't have the system
ok so now it's a problem of trying to
defend what in fact came out of the
ferment of the sixties what came out of
the ferment of the sixties was some you
know a lot of pressure which ended up in
some degree of legislation there was a
thing called the war on poverty
kind of a joke it was maybe like a small
skirmish against poverty
it went on for about two years and then
it started declining like AFDC the main
welfare program which was just killed
that has been declining steadily since
1970 from 1970 to 1990 it went down by
about 50% that was part of the general
attack on women and families and
children and so on that really picked up
steam and they you know mainly under the
Reagan administration both by the late
seventies actually Nixon was our last
liberal president if you want to tell
the truth right and it lasts me Bueller
I mean I but or takes a Social Security
okay now there's a problem of defending
Social Security in the 1930s there was
no such problem there was no such system
the freedom of sex a freedom of speech
that's one dimension on which the United
States does reign very high the United
States does freedom of speech is
protected to a degree that I think has
no counterpart in the world at least I
don't know of any but remember how
recent that is until the 1960s freedom
of speech literally didn't exist in the
United States until the 1960s you could
be jailed for seditious libel
that's the Keystone that's the hallmark
of a free society seditious libel means
assaulting the state by words okay that
was a crime in the United States as it
is in England today for example and in
most of the world it was a crime in the
United States until the 1960s was
finally struck down by the Supreme Court
in the course of the civil rights
movement and in fact as a reaction to
activism in the civil rights movement
well okay that was a landmark and there
are others but all of this is progress
in the show so it's not true that things
can't change in fact we know that they
can change they have changed they've
changed dramatically
okay maybe you know if you want to say
have we reached kind of heaven No plenty
of problems you know but to say that
nothing can be changed is just ignore
history I mean we don't have feudalism
we don't have slavery there's a degree
of women's rights there's a degree of
respect for other cultures there are
protections for fundamental human rights
which didn't exist not long ago well it
wasn't given to anybody as a gift it was
won by struggle and by some people who
joined the struggle and became voices
for the voices which anybody can do they
weren't preaching to them incidentally
they were joining all the ones I just
mentioned we're politically effective
what I've just said is that they are
politically effective that's why we
don't live under feudalism and slavery
and we don't have counterpart of Eugene
Debs being thrown into jail and we don't
have hundreds of workers murdered by the
state security forces because they're
involved in strikes has happened early
in this century and on and on and on I
mean look we had essentially slave labor
in this century up until the 1930s the
if you look at the south know after
slavery was officially eliminated and
after you know reconstruction was beaten
back there was a slave labor system in
the prisoners prison labor in the south
was an enormous system blacks of course
and it's the source of the big
industrial revolution that the place in
the south in the late 19th century early
20th century northern Alabama Georgia
Tennessee in that region whether it was
a big industrial revival mostly on basis
with slave labor labor in prisons in
other words which the employers
described as reliable and productive not
like those workers in eastern
Pennsylvania and Ohio who were
rambunctious and striking and that kind
of thing and these guys didn't need any
benefit
and so on and so forth that's pretty
reason you know and Mississippi went on
until the Second World War actually
since things are cyclic remember it's
now being reinstituted so we are now
reinstituting a system of slave labor in
prisons which is nowhere near the scale
of what it was in the early part of the
century and again is mostly black and
the drug war is mostly used as a pretext
to try to drive them into that and it's
being reconstructed and in fact it's
very valuable for American corporations
same reason you know it's a cheap labor
controllable can't strike no benefits
like it's got all the things that
economists tell you are good it's a
flexible labor force meaning you don't
it's flexible labor market if you don't
need them today stick them in the cell
the state will pay for them if you do
need them today pull them out of the
cell and they'll work without making any
fuss about benefits and things so it's a
perfect labor market and the and it's
being rebuilt but nothing like the scale
in which it was well these are all
victories that were achieved they're not
permanent victories and sometimes things
go backwards as now but they are
achieved by popular movements by exactly
these popular movements fighting to
defend the fundamental human rights the
ones who do the archbishop was talking
about and El Salvador they want some
victories too I mean they suffered a
very brutal time but they want some
victories
pardon no not at all
I mean there are plenty of people who
didn't then I'm there plenty of people
who remained alive you know some I
mentioned the ones who got murdered
right I mean it's true that dissidents
aren't welcome but the way in which the
reaction through them depends on the
nature of the society and our satellites
that's true they tend to get their
brains blown out or be cut up the pieces
with machetes and so on other societies
are somewhat different at home it's
changed used to be much harsher than it
is I mean for us to talk about
repression as a joke today the truth I
mean dissident intellectuals in the
United States are so privileged as
compared with just about anybody in the
world so protected that for them even to
convention the word repression in regard
to themselves is a sick joke I mean
maybe the worst that will happen is
somebody a light-year you won't get a
job they're worse days
yesterday he said instantly if I can
mention I'm I have to qualify that
that's true of dissident intellectuals
in the United States who are from the
more privileged and wealthy sectors it
wasn't true for it Hampton for example
then you can still get murdered
