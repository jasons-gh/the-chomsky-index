now Arizona Public Media's Christopher
Conover talks to a man who's been
described as everything from a
libertarian anarchist
to one of the most brilliant linguists
of our age here's his interview with
Noam Chomsky who's in Tucson for a
lecture at the University of Arizona
joining us now in the studio is Noam
Chomsky who will be speaking here on
campus for the next two days thank you
so much for coming in and talking with
us glad to be with you earlier today let
me start with this you were a
participant in a news conference here on
campus with a group of students talking
about University University of Arizona
divesting certain investments for those
who didn't make the news conference what
are some of those investments and why
should the university divest the
specific investments are in to
corporations Motorola and Caterpillar
and the particular issue is their role
in the Israeli occupied territories they
are both intimately involved and
destruction of Palestinian villages
developing settlements security
arrangements for settlers and so on and
all of this activity is completely
illegal it should be uncontroversial
it's in violation of explicit Security
Council written regulations it's in
violation of a World Court judgement the
Human Rights Watch has called for an end
to all such support Amnesty
International I mean any authority that
there is has declared this to be
essentially criminal activity
so therefore the group is requesting
that the university stop participating
in it you're here on campus to give a
couple of talks one in the liquid and
the linguistics Department you are
officially a linguist but your writings
over the years have spanned all kinds of
things you're also talking about
education tomorrow night now we want
everybody to go to that event at
Centennial Hall but can you give us a
little bit of a preview some of the
things you're going to talk about in
that speech
well there are fundamental questions
about education from kindergarten
universities that one question is who's
it for and the other is what does it try
to achieve and there are sharp
differences of opinion about this so if
you look at the history of the
educational system in the United States
the US was in fact the first country to
develop a mass public education system
she was a real achievement at the higher
level higher education it was mostly a
gentlemen's club for elite that's
changed it in the Second World War the
whole world system changed the US had
been a it was the richest country in the
world but it had been a kind of
backwater if you wanted to study the
physics or philosophy or be a writer or
an artist you went to Europe the second
ruler changed all that the u.s. became
far and away the most powerful country
in the world competitors were devastated
or destroyed and the kind of
intellectual center shifted here and the
educational systems changed radically
for one thing that was that one change
was the GI Bill which let lots of people
go to college who've never would have
been able to go before and that slowly
undermined the a-league character of the
major institutions there had always been
land-grant colleges which in fact my own
University I might tease one of them and
that was public education but the the
primary the the prestigious schools were
gentlemen's club that changed women were
allowed in a huge amount of government
money came in for research there was the
the the government had always been
involved in economic development right
from the colonies but it took a huge
surge forward after the Second World War
lots of Technology had changed radically
the war and very much afterwards and the
the things that we now take for granted
like you know your iPhone your computer
or the Internet
flying on commercial aircraft satellites
and all of that most of that group
basically grew out of the state sector
of the economy largely three
universities so there's a lot of
university funding it's billed over to
other disciplines the universities
changed and who they were for became
quite different so in the 1960s they
were take say my own University and the
1950s it was white males by the 1970s
it's half women 1/3 minorities and so on
and change in the character of the
educational system then came other
changes the activism of the 1960s and my
view really civilized the country that's
what was the core of the civil rights
movement the women's movement the
environmental movement concerns that are
placed at university like mine research
university concerns over the uses of
technology never asked before and there
was a backlash let me ask you about
activism on university campuses we don't
see that anymore and obviously you've
been on the MIT campus for four decades
so you've seen the change we don't see
the the level of activism anymore why oh
why not I don't agree with it I think
we've just changed our conception of
what it of what's to be expected so in
the 1950s it's true there was almost no
activism the 1960s for most of the
sixties not much it peaked in the late
60s there's a periods about maybe 67 to
71 72 when there was intensive activism
on campus after that it leveled off and
its continued so if you take oh I travel
a lot to universities almost everyone
there's all kinds of activity going on
of a whole range of topics Global
justice women's rights concern over the
environment
constant things I mean not major
demonstrations like two or three years
in the sixties but that was a that was a
it's not the baseline you know in
general it's continued that it's now
expanding and it's all over the world so
for example in Latin America there's
huge student movements from Chile which
is one of the most active of them all
the way through the continent it's
engaging the United States and Canada
the Occupy movements have a lot of
student input to them there's other
things happening on campus and like this
for example things like this going on
everywhere so there's a there's a level
of student activism which is now
fundamentally a baseline which did not
exist before the sixties and there have
been attempts to beat it back I'll talk
about that tomorrow interesting attempts
but I think it's survived all right well
we invite everybody to come out to
Centennial Hall to hear your speech you
and I will be together on the stage for
that so we have a little preview thanks
so much for coming in talking with us
for a few minutes
glad to do it
