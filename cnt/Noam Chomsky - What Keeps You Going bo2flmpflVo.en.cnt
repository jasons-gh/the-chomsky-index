I'm very impressed by your consistent
compassionate effort in the world and
what does practitioner I consider you
some form of a bodhisattva actually but
in the absence of many what would have
been rejected to say amount of their
King or Gandhi or the Dalai Lama like a
religious faith or a limited practice
just I'm sure curiosity I'm interested
what kind of spiritual resources or you
can draw from or any advice you give to
people who want channels Pattillo
looking at certain actions toward a more
open world how to enroll in ourselves
and empower ourselves on a kind of heart
level because I'm just exactly a
tireless efforts and kind of case how
you're going that's a question to ask
that I just don't understand and on
every every running and picture global
warming I'm sure every person here cares
about whether their grandchildren will
have a way to survive do you need unique
spiritual resources for them I mean it
has to be something that prevents you
from doing it you know it's that's what
we should be asking ourselves what
prevents
and preparing on the rhetorician
including serious that was outrageous
when in this like took the fact that and
for the last roughly 30 years the United
States has had economic policies stowed
economic policies state corporate
economic policies which have led to
virtual stagnation for the majority of
the population County of economic growth
but it took very few pockets of foreign
managers and people with that but not
the population well you know I think
people care about that in fact if you
look at polls people care a lot about it
take taxes for the last about 40 years
there have been regular polls asking
people with their attitude is towards
the tax system overwhelmingly and
consistently that people think there
ought to be much higher taxes on the
rich
how does policy work reduces taxes on
the rich it's one of many illustrations
of how policy is divorced from opinion
but I don't think it's a matter of
people I think what this shows is that
people have this what spiritual
resources to give the right answers but
how about doing something about it that
takes a little more than giving the
right answers to a full taker and I
think that's the question why do we stop
short of doing the things that we know
we should do answer there's an
interesting article by George Orwell and
everybody here read Animal Farm in
elementary school very few people read
the introduction to animal form which
were will wrote it wasn't published it
was found thirty years later in his
unpublished papers and it's kind of
interesting what he says is it's
directed to the people of England of
course his audience he says look the
book
the satire on the totalitarian enemy but
people in England shouldn't be too
self-righteous about it because he says
in free England I'm quoting now ideas
can be suppressed without the use of
force and it gives us a couple of
examples and a few sentences of
explanation that one his reason he says
is the press is owned by wealthy men who
have every reason not to want certain
ideas to be suppressed but then there's
another reason which I think is more
significant he says a good education if
you've gone to the best schools you went
to Cambridge and Oxford Harvard Yale and
so on you have instilled into you the
understanding that there are certain
things that just wouldn't do to say I
don't think it goes far enough it
wouldn't do to think even that's a large
part of what a good education is so you
don't see things that are right in front
of your eyes but take everything I
mentioned which i think is pretty easy
to document it's right in front of our
eyes why is it surprising why isn't it
taught in elementary school
well it's good reason got to keep the
population in the dark and we
internalize it especially people like us
I'm sure most of us have had with a cold
good education it's best colleges and so
on yeah you get instilled it into you
the idea that you shouldn't think about
certain things and you shouldn't do
anything even if you know that the
failure of grandchildren depends on it
shouldn't do it but that can be overcome
