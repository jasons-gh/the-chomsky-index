I'm sorry Terry didn't tell me that
story about the National Press Club I
could have warned my one good tie which
I got from the National Press Club in
Australia a couple of months ago when I
was asked to deliver a talk there at the
Parliament building very harshly
critical of Australian foreign policy as
I was happy to do and I even got a nice
tie for it well I'm here for in
Washington for two talks one tonight one
tomorrow morning
neither of them came with a title so had
to make some decision and one natural
choice seemed to be to pick one to focus
on the international arena and another
one on the domestic scene and I thought
I'd start tonight with the international
arena the two are closely linked of
course even more so than in the past as
the globalization of the economy and the
interconnection of the global system
increases well in the international
arena just to get it out of the way
there is a conventional view the
conventional view is that in
International Affairs US policy for
since the Second World War has been
shaped by the Cold War the United Stated
States and the world against the threat
of aggressive communism now that's
finally over so there's a new era of
great opportunity opening this was
articulated very lucidly by the Clinton
administration's leading intellectual
the National Security Advisor Anthony
Lake a couple years ago outlining the
Clinton doctrine as it came to be called
he said throughout the Cold War we
contained a global threat to market
democracies now we should seek to in law
their reach and he went on to say that
there's no longer any barrier to our
extending to the whole world what he
called the enduring truths about our own
history and the constant face of
everything we have ever done namely our
dedication to tolerant societies in
which governments do not abuse people
and the most fundamental of the enduring
truths is still quoting of course we do
not seek to expand the reach of our own
institutions by forced subversion or
repression but rather alone in history
we've always kept a persuasion
compassion and other peaceful means and
commentators were much impressed by this
enlightened vision of the move from
containment to enlargement and by this
very persuasive rendition of the
enduring truths of history although it's
true that some were concerned afraid
that we might go too far in our
traditional altruism and benevolence
Henry Kissinger was one who urged that
we also pay some attention to on the
side to our own interests and needs
instead of just dedicating ourselves
wholeheartedly to the service in the
service of others as we've traditionally
done and will now do throughout the
world well I should add that it's not
the there were similar refrains sung in
the client states so for example the
prestigious Institute for International
Institute of Strategic Studies in London
in its 1989 review of world affairs
explained that during the Cold War in
the United States the principles of
democracy and commitment to human rights
and free markets were distorted by or
subordinated to the need to contain a
Soviet threat but with the Cold War
ending the United States will be free to
see the problems of
world's impoverished nations their
critical debt burden their fragile
political processes and related human
rights violations in their own terms
rather than through the east-west prism
so in other words the US will now at
last be free to show its constant face
and to act in accordance with the
enduring truths for the first time in
history
well I'll spare you any further rhetoric
and I won't insult your intelligence by
comparing the enduring truths to the
facts although it is a useful and
enlightening exercise it's one that
would be undertaken routinely in free
societies may be taught in elementary
schools well let's turn to the present
situation now that we're free to see the
problems of the world without the
shackles of Cold War and to show our
constant face without cold war
distortions in particular we're now able
to see the problems of the world's
impoverished nations accordingly
Washington has announced further cuts in
its foreign aid which is an
international scandal it's the most
miserly in a developed world and it
would be virtually invisible if we were
to remove the biggest component which
goes to a very rich country Israel and
that incidentally stays high and
unchanged it also happens incidentally
to be the component of the foreign aid
budget that's most opposed most strongly
opposed by the public side comment in
general public opinion and policy are
not very well correlated there are
usually pretty substantial differences
between them but the current period is
marked by an astonishing this difference
it's become a real chasm I doubt if
there's a period in history when the
divergence between public opinion which
is well known from many attitude studies
between public opinion and policy has
been so dramatic and so marked as in the
present period that's one indication of
the deterioration of functioning
democracy that's a very marked and
striking feature of the contemporary era
here dramatically and to some extent in
other places well the current Congress
has cut further the ridiculously low aid
budget leaving intact only one component
aid to Israel and Egypt which is about
the same thing Egypt because of its
relation to Israel that now amounts to
40% of the total however there's a
one-third cut and aid for education
health care Family Planning and
Environmental Protection in poorer
nations and a 40% cut just announced in
u.s. contribution to low-interest loans
to poor countries through the World Bank
that's all because we are now free to
view the problems of impoverished
nations without the distortion of the
Cold War that's only part of the story
the United States is always also busy
continuing in fact escalating its
dismantling of the more democratic
aspects of the United Nations it's
recently announced that it's going to
cut probably terminate its contribution
to the United Nations industrial
development organization the FAO and the
Food and Agriculture Organization is on
the way out the International Labor
Organization is not likely to survive
very long for one thing because it
committed a rather serious transgression
a couple of years ago it departed from
its usual prakit almost never criticizes
one of the rich its rich donors but it
did condemn the United States a couple
of years for its severe violations of
standoff convinced international labor
conventions by permitting the hiring of
permanent replacement workers to break
strikes and that's a crime for which you
don't you have to have proper
retribution so they're probably on the
way out incidentally the United States
has the worst third work to be precise
the third
worst record in Europe and the Western
Hemisphere in reckoning International
labor conventions there are two worse
Lithuania and El Salvador's or not at
the bottom but in any event there's good
reasons for the ILO to go and you can
understand Jesse Helms they're all
headed for extinction because the u.s.
refuses to pay its legally required
funding for them UNK tad is also on the
way out um Ted provides expert economic
analysis about the international scene
but it happens to conflict with the IMF
World Bank orthodoxy and often to
undermine it so that has to go the UN
did have a group which monitored and
provided data about transnational
corporations in fact it was about the
only source of such information that's
already dead and in fact quite generally
any part of the United Nations that
serves the interests of people and not
investors is on its way out because we
are now free to show our constant face
and to live by the enduring truths
without the distortions of the Cold War
well the same reasons explain let's go
back to our other the other remember we
weren't able to view human rights
violations in their own right because of
the Cold War distortions but now we can
do it so it takes a this hemisphere
where the prize for human rights
violations is currently held by Columbia
which gets about half of all US military
aid and training for the hemisphere on
pretexts that are too ludicrous to
discuss increasing under President
Clinton and incidentally extending a
correlation which has been rather close
for many years between torture and US
aid as demonstrated in the number of
studies the same reasons explain the
warm well
a few weeks ago for General Suharto of
Indonesia he's a really world-class
killer and torture greatly beloved in
the West Suharto is our kind of guy a
high administration official told the
press when he was here despite the
hundreds of thousands of corpses so
Suharto is at heart benign the London
economists explained so therefore he can
probably thinking of his attitude to
foreign corporations which indeed is a
very benign he can therefore join the
long list of our kinds of guys the
Brazilian and Argentine neo-nazi
generals general Chun of South Korea to
mention one who's recently in the news
cha chesco of Romania who was a
particular favorite Mobutu of Zaire
Somoza and a whole host of Latin
American monsters Saddam Hussein great
friend and Ally and in earlier days
Mussolini Hitler Stalin Stalin and was
particularly admired by Chairman Truman
and Churchill as we now know from
released internal records and too many
others to mention this was when we were
living the enduring truths and put aside
some local talent along the way well
it's in a way unfair to review and I
therefore will stop to continue to
review how we have lived the enduring
truths and shown our constant face and
how we continue to despite the
predictions and there are several
reasons why it's unfair
it doesn't take note of other factors
that prevent us from showing our
constant face one of them actually one
factor that'll be mentioned is that
everybody else in the world every other
power in the world is exactly the same
although the West perhaps win some
prizes in cowardice and deceit good
education helps with that
but in standard
if not for the maybe not in the domain
of self-education but at least in
behavior other actors in the world scene
aren't all that much different but more
to the point here we have to recognize
that with the Cold War true the Cold War
did end but it was replaced right away
by new and very severe problems so that
the enduring truths have to be put on
the Shelf a little longer and we can't
yet show our constant face to the world
one of the enduring truths was explained
by the Bush administration right after
the fall of the Berlin Wall a few weeks
after the fall of the Berlin Wall in
November 1989 when they sadly informed
the public and the Congress that there
would be no peace dividend well it's
true that the Russians were gone nobody
could pretend that they were on the
march any longer but that threat had
been replaced by a different one the
different threat was I'm now quoting the
technological sophistication of third
world powers which requires that we keep
the Pentagon budget just where it was or
even going up and maintain what's called
the defense industrial base which means
the whole of high technology industry
and we also must maintain our
intervention forces the White House
pointed out to inform Congress aimed
primarily at the Middle East which is
where they have been aimed for a long
time
recall that this was well before the
Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait this
would at the time when Saddam Hussein
was still a favored Ally and trusted
friend but we had to maintain the
intervention forces poised towards the
the source of the major energy reserves
of the world the Pentagon budget in fact
has remained high it's now actually
higher in real terms than during the
Nixon years about 85 percent of the Cold
War averaged and it's increasing for a
rational person this fact gives some
measure of the perceived importance of
the Soviet
threat during the period when we were
supposedly defending ourselves from it
points obvious so it won't expand on it
depending on budget as you know is now
going up the Heritage Foundation which
calls itself conservative in some odd
Orwellian usage is it has presented the
budget which Congress the Republican
Congress pretty much implementing
anything any government service that
goes to people is down but one part is
going actually two parts or going up the
Pentagon budget has to increase
according to the Pentagon budget and of
course the other component of the
security system the imprisonment of the
population which is not taken off into
the stratosphere that part has to
increase to Newt Gingrich of course
agrees and the reasons are explained the
reasons were explained for example by a
spokesman for the aircraft industry for
Lockheed which happens have its
corporate headquarters in Gingrich's
district and just received a huge
subsidy from the Clinton administration
for the for having had to face the big
problem of merging with Martin Marietta
along with big subsidies for the
corporate executives and so on so an
executive of Lockheed Martin the new
merged Corporation pointed out that it's
a dangerous world out there and which
sophisticated fighter planes are being
sold so we're really in trouble who are
they being sold by well mostly by us we
have about 75% of the international arms
market at that time for the third world
and he pointed that out
executive went on to say we've sold the
f-16 the most advanced fighter plane
we've sold the f-16 all over the world
what if a friend or ally turns against
us so it's a real dangerous world out
there and there's an obvious solution to
that namely we should sell still war
f-16s but now upgraded ones so the
public should pay Lockheed and put money
into the hands of Gingrich's
constituents we should pay Lockheed to
upgrade f-16 so they're even more
dangerous
and then we should do what's called
selling them to the third world which
means giving them with export-import
bank loans and other guarantees that are
again paid for by the public and having
created a more dangerous world out there
we then have to spend tens of billions
of dollars on F twenty-twos in order to
counter the threat that's created this
way that's the obvious solution and
that's indeed what we're doing and
that's why the Pentagon budget is
growing up with a sort of a small point
on the side instead of the public is
overwhelmingly opposed to this public is
by about six to one opposed to
increasing the Pentagon budget the
Pentagon is opposed to it says it
doesn't want all that stuff but there's
someone more important who does want it
namely people like Newt Gingrich's rich
constituents and others like them who
have to be protected from market
discipline if they had to face the
market they'd be out selling rags or
something but they need a nanny state a
powerful nanny state to pour money into
their pockets they happen to be they're
represented by the country's leading
welfare freak Newt Gingrich that's
literally correct it's not an
exaggeration and it's furthermore well
known although it's not reported the nor
is the fact that the Pentagon system has
long been the country's biggest welfare
program transferring massive public
funds to high-tech industry on the
pretext of defense and security and that
it is a pretext is also well known and
has been public as certainly in
Washington since the late 1940s for
example when the senator from Missouri
senator Symington an aircraft producer
at that time secretary the Air Force
under Truman explained that the word to
use is not subsidy the word to use is
security that's the way you can get the
public to pay the costs of high-tech
industry which cannot survive and an
unsubsidized competitive free enterprise
economy as Fortune magazine pointed out
so that the government must therefore be
the savior as Businessweek added
and that's the role of the Pentagon
providing what's called dual use
technology that means military
technology that can be adapted to
civilian uses like computers and lasers
and the whole rest of the routine and in
fact the whole framework of the advanced
industrial system rests on that
technique of extorting money out of the
public on completely fraudulent
pretenses so quite naturally that major
state intervention in the economy
through the Pentagon system not only it
has to be sustained but has to be
increased well that's one reason why the
enduring truths have to be on hold we've
got this big problem out there of the
technological sophistication of third
world powers that we have to defend
ourselves again even though the Russians
are gone there's a second reason why the
enduring shell the enduring truths have
to be kept on the Shelf for a few more
years and that is that although the Cold
War ended it was replaced by an
unanticipated outbreak of ethnic
conflicts and other irrational violence
and religious fundamentalism and so on
maybe even a clash of civilizations one
of the fancy phrases from Harvard and
other novel Horrors so we're still not
free to show our constant face to the
world it's gonna have to wait a while
well let's have a look at that starting
with today troops going to Bosnia where
they can be expected to implement what's
now pretty clearly in process name with
the effective partition of Bosnia
between greater Croatia and greater
Serbia whatever it may be called both of
them both of these surviving units it is
hoped under Washington's guiding hand as
Croatia already is as part of the
expanded Middle East region the US has
always regarded that region as basically
a fringe of the Middle East and in the
Middle East with its enormous
energy reserves of the US has always
said well since second world war has
insisted on unilateral control in part
this anticipated US base in the Balkans
will also serve as a kind of a leverage
with regard to another prize namely the
fate of Eastern Europe with the end of
the Cold War east most of Eastern Europe
is returning back to its being forced
back in fact into what it always was for
hundreds of years namely a service area
a third world we now call a third world
serving the West and the question is
who's going to pick up most of the
prizes and here there's some conflicts
the Germans have their ideas and
American investors have their ideas and
they're not entirely identical and the
base in the Balkans gives a sort of a
some leverage in influencing that
outcome so that looks like what's going
on there the US troops in Bosnia are not
garden-variety
peacekeeping forces in fact they're not
peacekeeping forces at all for a good
reason
the United States has an unusual
military doctrine possibly unique which
disqualifies it from genuine
peacekeeping operations that is
operations in which civilians are
involved so we're different from Canada
or Ireland or Norway or Fiji Islands or
other places that do send peacekeeping
forces the difference is that US forces
are not permitted to face any threat if
they sense a threat they're supposed to
respond with massive force and that's
unusual and perhaps unique the that the
point was that we just saw that in
Somalia where the threat was very very
slight you know teenagers with rifles
but they ended up with according to
Washington sources about 7,500 that
10,000 civilians killed in the course of
that operation and that's because of the
US military doctrine which is unique and
does rule out any u.s. participation in
peacekeeping operations this is not one
that was made very clear when the
announcement of the troops was made a
couple of days ago
Washington announced that there will be
what they called robust rules of
engagement no more limits on the use of
force nothing like those wishy-washy
Europeans the US will use deadly force
wherever necessary the Secretary of
Defense said Anthony Lake added that if
anyone fools with our forces they will
get hit immediately and very hard
implication is pretty clear they can
commit atrocities if they like but don't
fool with our forces well there's
actually supposed to be a reason for
this there's a kind of an official
reason at least in the doctrinal system
as to why the US has this unique
military doctrine the reason it's
supposed to be the Vietnam experience
that's kind of interesting and
interesting fraud the problem is that
there's two stories that have to be
concealed story number one is that the
United States attacked South Vietnam and
then all of Indochina during the Kennedy
years and then expanded it that left
three countries in total ruins with
millions of people killed and limited
likelihood of recovery that all those
facts are unspeakable in the United
States in fact the West in general the
second point that has to be concealed is
that the public opposed this and opposed
it on moral grounds that's you're not
allowed to know that during the period
when polls were taken from early 70s up
til the early 90s there were regular
polls the people when asked about the
Vietnam War about seven roughly seventy
percent it's a very stable figure
opposed the Vietnam War as I'm quoting
fundamentally wrong and immoral not a
mistake
well well-educated folks understand that
it was at worst a mistake but good
intentions cannot be questioned it could
not be called fundamentally wrong in
tomorrow
now since the facts are completely
unacceptable we need a better story
and the better story is that the public
opposed the war because of US casualties
so in other words the public is just as
rotten as the educated folks the
commissar class that's the story and the
same fanciful tales incidentally are
told about Somalia and now Bosnia
they're clearly refuted by public
opinion studies but facts are one thing
and enduring truths or something else so
the US forces are going to Bosnia under
robust rules of engagement and of course
under US command called NATO but US
command again that's a commitment that's
a that's a doctrine that is unlike other
countries I know of no other one well
these are all among their prerogatives
of power and part of the enduring truths
that are some of the real ones well it
should be mentioned that the Bosnia
sending first of Bosnia is being debated
in fact hotly debated last Sunday for
example take a look at the New York
Times there were big discussion about it
New York Times Asia specialists Barbour
Chrisette she warned us that we ought to
remember Cambodia quoting now barely
alive after decades of civil war
marah's genocide and foreign occupation
by the Vietnamese foreign occupation
which incidentally terminated the
genocide calling forth wrath and
punishment by the United States
punishment for those who had committed
the crime of ridding the country of Pol
Pot I might mention that that the
prussians of Asia is the New York Times
angrily called them referring to what is
probably the closest approximation to
humanitarian intervention in history but
somehow isn't in the Canon not that they
did it for humanitarian reasons but
neither does anyone else but something
that comes closer to meeting those
conditions than anything else I can
think of well that's
Macross het goes on she stresses the
difficulty of achieving the good
intentions of the United States and its
allies in Cambodia and points out that
that's a warning for Bosnia well does
anybody remember anything in Cambodia
besides civil war Khmer Rouge genocide
and occupation by the Vietnamese does
anybody remember for example a six-year
bombing campaign before the Civil War
before the Khmer Rouge take over the
heaviest bombing in the world in in
world history of civilians which left
600,000 people dead according to the CIA
millions of refugees about a hundred
thousand people dying a year in the city
of Phnom Penh alone in 1964 75 when the
Americans finally left and predictions
by high US officials that a million
people would die under any circumstances
because of the devastation in the
country that had been carried out during
this heavily intense extraordinarily
intense bombing of civilian areas that
was the first half of the decade of the
genocide the phrase is not mine it's
taken from the one it's the title of the
one independent government investigation
of the horrors of Cambodia by the
government of Finland the decade of the
genocide decade because it started in
1969 when the US bombing began continued
in 1975 when the Khmer Rouge took over
and ended in 1979 when they were kicked
out by the Vietnamese so that's the
decade of the genocide but somehow the
first half of it the first six years of
it are gone from history and
incidentally we're remarkably little
reported at the time I won't go into
that but I've reviewed it in print if
you're interested and it's pretty
astonishing ok that's out of history but
what we are warned about is just the
parts that are allowed into history
well Chrisette also warns about Haiti
where our good intentions she says may
be undercut by demagogy poverty
and homegrown distrust homegrown
distressed these backward Haitians
somehow distrust us good intentions
despite all the blessings we've lavished
on them for 200 years maybe bad genes
the point is elaborated by the times
leading thinker Thomas Friedman same day
in a column called think Haiti which and
he says Haiti is a cautionary tale about
the limits of our ability to do good we
did the right thing in Haiti he says but
president Aristide has not abandoned his
populist radical impulses and he's
dragging his feet on handing over
Haiti's remaining assets to foreign
investors so we've had to cancel unpaid
parts of the promised aid since
obviously we can't tolerate that well he
Friedman goes on to say we can't even be
sure that we can trust the police in
Haiti even though the I'm quoting now
even though they've been through put
through us human rights courses as in
Colombia and El Salvador and Indonesia
and other Paragons of virtue like a
hundred percent of his colleagues
Friedman refrains from giving us a
little background about our steeds
radical populist impulses which we
thought we'd overcome by returning him
on a condition that he accept
Washington's socio-economic program of
which which is public though you
wouldn't know it from the press the core
element of it the core sentence of the
program on which he was restored is the
following the renovated state in Haiti
must focus on an economic strategy
centered on the energy and initiative of
civil society especially the private
sector both national and foreign in
other words the rich families living up
in the suburbs who supported the coup
their Haitian civil society investors in
New York City our Haitian society but
the people in the slums of Port
press or the peasants in the hills
they're not Haitians a civil society
just the rich Investor's in New York and
the wealthy supporters of the coup
that's Haitian civil society and the
renovated state must focus on their
interests and Radek our steeds populist
radical impulses are that he though he
did sign on to this he apparently is
dragging his feet on this forthcoming
program a little bit what the peep the
point is that the general population the
overwhelming majority the population of
Haiti they're not civil society just the
rich there and in New York and Miami and
so on the people who swept our seed into
office had a different conception of
Haitian civil society and that of course
has to be beaten out of their heads they
also had an unacceptable concept of
democracy and they had this weird idea
that the general public actually has a
role to play in the way affairs of state
are conducted that's contrary to two
centuries of doctrine in the United
States which goes right back to Madison
and the framing of the Constitution and
is expressed in more modern times by
leading Wilsonian liberals like walter
Lippmann Lippmann who explained that the
ignorant and meddlesome Outsiders
meaning the general population have to
be kept out of the public arena they can
be spectators but not participants and
the Commission's in they're ignorant
ways didn't understand that so they
needed a few lessons and democracy
that's another unspeakable enduring
truth
well what Clinton's in fact done is to
restore the situation prior to the free
election of 1990 which was a disaster
because the democratic forces the
popular forces actually participated and
got their own conception of
socio-economic development and their own
representative in power so that had to
be overthrown by violence and
in fact what the the current program is
that virtually identical to that
advocated by Washington's candidate in
the 1990 election mark bazan a world
bank official who received 14 percent of
the vote but is now effectively in power
thanks to our restoration of democracy
at least its program is in power well
those are more enduring truths which
you're not supposed to know about it's
kind of interesting that Haiti the most
impoverished country in the hemisphere
is still dragging its feet it's among
the few countries where people are
actually struggling against these
structural adjustment style proposals
which are also being applied to us too
and that's pretty dramatic fact and
something if we want to the idea that we
should go to Haiti to teach them about
democracy is so ludicrous that one
hardly knows how to comment we maybe
ought to go there to learn something
about democracy but that's about the
only relationship as far as democracy
goes anyway we're supposed to see this
experience as a cautionary note about
our ability and what is Arab ility well
in reality it's our ability to demote to
destroy democracy to intensify miserable
poverty and suffering and to win rate
and rich Haitian civil society sitting
in the wealthy suburbs of Porto press or
in corporate boardrooms in New York
you're gonna have to look pretty hard
for the actual facts which incidentally
are not in dispute and I don't urge you
to waste your time looking because you
won't find them unless your way out to
the margins well I should say that
honesty requires that we recognize that
there is a discordant note in this
chorus of self adulation about Haiti so
if you read this morning's New York
Times there's an editorial which
this discordant note I should say
teaches you is worth looking at closely
because it teaches you a lot about how a
really well-oiled propaganda system
works so start with this morning's New
York Times it condemns as an editorial
condemning CIA for undermining Clinton's
efforts to restore democracy in Haiti so
they are criticizing they're referring
to a report last Sunday on CBS 60
minutes which confirmed that the head of
the terrorist forces in Haiti
frapp that's during the military coup
years amano a constant was a paid agent
of the CIA well The Times also reported
that something similar had been reported
in the press namely it had been
discovered by and reported by freelance
journalist Allan Nairn who somehow it
remains unmentioned in all of this but
now the fact is confirmed last Sunday in
an interview with constant on CBS over
60 minutes and there was great outrage
at this new exposure of CIA misdeeds
Senator Tom Harkin was interviewed he
was particularly shocked that the CIA
should undercut the u.s. policy of
opposing the military regime and
restoring democracy Clinton's ambassador
Lawrence pezzulo was amazed to learn
that Constance
frapp organization was behind the
demonstration that had caused the that
it caused Clinton to turn back the
Harlan County the ship that went into
port-au-prince Harbor and then pulled
out because of a demonstration crucial
event in the whole affair and Petrillo
is equally constant was he was also I
should say that constant was also amazed
that this incident namely amazed that
the United States had backed off in the
face of a few dozen demonstrators who
hadn't expected that well the CBS
interviewer asked constant ins quote
after you scuttled the president's plan
to restore our steede to power in this
Harlan County incident did the CIA
distance itself from you know constant
answered eliciting more shock and
amazement well let's have a look at some
of the facts that have somehow escaped
the eye of the New York Times and The
Washington Post and CBS investigative
reporters and others one fact is that
Bush and Clinton did not oppose the
military regime quite the contrary
the OAS the organization American states
did call an embargo after the coup but
with it varied within a few weeks Bush
announced that US manufacturers would be
exempt from the embargo now that was
called fine-tuning the embargo to help
the Haitians in the new york times so
trade with the coup regime continued not
quite at the usual level but not all
that far below it under clinton that
trade actually increased not much below
the normal level even training of
Haitian military officers continued
according to Haitian Church sources
right through the military coup period
well there's something much more
important than that the crucial element
of any embargo as everyone knows is oil
and everyone in Haiti could see that oil
was continuing to float and in fact at
the rich the mavs family and these other
rich coup supporters were building
storage tanks for new oil and so on and
so forth well where was it flowing from
well we now know the answer the answer
is it was flowing from the Texaco
Corporation which had been explicitly
authorized by the Bush and the Clinton
administration's to ship oil illegally
to the military hunter right through the
period of the alleged embargo to be
precise Texaco was informed that it was
illegal for it to shift to ship oil in
violation of a presidential directive
but they were also told that they could
proceed without any concern for legal
action or penalty Texaco even went so
far as presenting to the administration
its
plan to the Treasury Department it
presented its
to evade the embargo by some legalistic
trickery
you know claiming some other subsidiary
was doing it and so on and asked whether
that would be legal and the Treasury
Department no it wouldn't be legal but
go ahead anyway nothing will happen if
you do it well are those facts deeply
hidden no there are not deeply hidden
they were the lead story on the AP wires
on the day when every newsroom
everyone's eyes were focused on Haiti
including mine the day before the US
forces landed when every newsroom was
focusing on Haiti and everybody was
reading the AP wires which were pouring
out stories and the lead story which
kept being reiterated and focused was
what I just said it said that the a leak
from the Justice Department which was
then confirmed as accurate stated that
right through the Clinton Bush and
Clinton administration's we don't
exactly how late but well into them into
the Clinton administration the
authorization of illegal shipment of oil
continued that was the day before the
troops landed impossible to miss in a
Free Press the headline the next day
would have been there was no embargo the
United States and conspired with the
military to continue the terror and to
block Aristide from coming in well you
know like anybody was interested in
Haiti I was watching the AP wires that
Sunday and immediately picked up the
story of course because you couldn't
miss it and I wrote an article the next
day but that's for a you know
alternative press it was gonna come out
in six weeks and I therefore wrote it in
kind of past tense I described this
story as if everybody knew it already so
I really oughta call that appeared it
says well as you know you read already
in the paper six weeks ago such and such
well that was kind of naive it didn't
occur to me that even this much could be
suppressed by the Free Press and I was
wrong it was suppressed it's still very
well hidden later I did a database
search on it just out of curiosity and I
can tell you the details if you want
but basically it's out of history what
about the Harlan County it's being
returned to you know this great
demonstration that forced it to be
returned which we now discover with
amazement was organized by constant and
so on was that a surprise well it wasn't
a surprise to New York Daily News
correspondent 1 Gonzales who learned
about the plans at a duvet gayest rally
the day before the Harlan County
incident that was a rally attend meeting
duvae latest meeting it was attended by
US embassy personnel and he published
the story on the very day when the
pre-arranged plans were executed namely
October 11th 1993 and in fact it wasn't
a secret from any other journalist to
either and it wasn't a secret from the
CIA and it wasn't a secret from the
White House and it wasn't a secret from
Lawrence pezzulo the the the president's
plan to restore our esteem with the you
know the the the idea that did immanuel
kant's
let's return to the question asked by
the 60 Minutes reporters did you man how
did the CIA react after in Manoa
constant scuttled the president's plan
to restore our esteem big amazement the
CIA kept helping him are they kind of a
rogue elephant or something like that
well not as far as we know what we know
is that the White House scuttled the
plans or rather never had them and we
know that the media have been
suppressing the most obvious and crucial
facts which they cannot fail to know not
only about the fake embargo and the
economic program that's being rammed
down Haitian throats as the United
States proceeds to overturn the results
of the democratic election but even
about the specific incident of the
Harlan County as for the CIA it seems to
have served as an agency of the White
House as it usually does at least as far
as information is available well let's
look a little more bro
not this great plague of violence and
ethnic conflict that's erupted after the
Cold War and is forcing us to conceal
our constant face is there an upsurge of
such violence as a result of the Cold
War
well that's checkable what about the
Balkans
well the Balkans is certainly post Cold
War but post-cold war doesn't mean
result of the Cold War in fact it isn't
a result of the Cold War or its
termination the that region were was a
US ally that virtual client it was
subjected to a standard neoliberal
program through the 1980s and that was a
bigger factor in the breakup and the
violence that followed than anything
having to do with the Russian Empire
what about Africa Rwanda say well that
goes back decades
Burundi had similar massacres about
twenty years ago nobody cared no cold
war connection what about Haiti that's
too ludicrous to discuss are there any
actual incidents that actually are the
effect of the breakup of the Russian
Empire yeah there's some Chechnya for
example the violence and terror there is
a consequence of the breakup of the
Soviet empire but that's hardly a new
phenomenon in world history that calls
for deep thought from from intellectuals
the end of tyrannical rule an imperial
rule quite typically quite typically in
fact without exception as far as I know
leads to an increase in suppressed
conflicts disarray and often worse so
take a look at say post-colonial Africa
or take a look at what happened in India
and Palestine after the British Empire
collapsed or look at the French Empire
in Algeria or Indochina ending up with a
horrendous ethnic conflict but one that
doesn't count because the aggressors
happen to rule history in that case the
same was true of the breakup of the
front of the Dutch Empire horrible
violence and in what's now Indonesia in
all of these
there was a cold war element as in
anything but it was pretty far out on
the margins the the real problem
throughout is described pretty frankly
in u.s. internal documents and even
elsewhere to for example British Foreign
Office records commenting on what's
called the fall of China in 1949 and the
the problem is they say that China is
moving toward an economy and a type of
trade in which there is no place for the
foreign manufacturer the foreign banker
or the foreign trader and that's a
problem and therefore we have to do
something about it and that's the core
element in the extraordinary violence
that has followed the breakup of
traditional empires the point is that as
in Haiti the Chinese didn't quite
understand who constitutes civil society
well the most recent example of the
breakup of an empire prior to the
Russian Empire is the Portuguese Empire
that collapse just 20 years ago and that
led to a huge outbreak of ethnic
conflict in all throughout the place
where there were Portuguese colonies
Africa and Southeast Asia on Africa I'll
just quote there's a lot to say but not
much time let me just quote basil
Davidson British historian of Africa one
of the most respected historians of
Africa he says those responsible for the
Contra subversion in Africa will be
cursed by history for enormous and
terrible crimes which will long weigh
heavily on the whole of southern Africa
he's referring to Britain in the United
States the leading supporters of South
Africa and its murders assault on the
Portuguese colonies of Angola and
Mozambique right away where as soon as
the Portuguese Empire broke up according
to the UN Economic Commission on Africa
more than a million and a half people
were killed and more than 60 billion
dollars of damage was done during the
Reagan years alone that's during period
when we were carrying out constructive
engagement and supporting and subject
being
subject to Davidson's comment and Angola
that war continues much worse than
Bosnia in the same years but basically
unreported because it's not very useful
to point out that the worst killer and
war criminal is a man who was hailed
right here in Washington not long ago as
a great hero and a leading freedom
fighter
well that's Africa what about Southeast
Asia there was a Portuguese colony in
Southeast Asia East Timor and just 20
years ago yesterday yesterday was the
20th anniversary it was attacked in that
case not by South Africa but by another
one of our clients our kind of guy in
that region Suharto with decisive US
military and diplomatic support that
increased under Carter it's continuing
until today although the British have
now taken over as the leading supporter
of the worst atrocity since the
Holocaust relative to the population
which is the only meaningful measure the
United States is still playing a major
role although protests here has put some
limits on US participation and it's
caused the Clinton administration to
work out some tricky techniques to evade
congressional restrictions and so on as
it's done in order to help our kind of
guy continue his exploits their fact is
by recent standards including the
standards of our own actions the
collapse of the Soviet empire while
bloody has been remarkably peaceful as
compared with other recent cases these
are the obvious ones
well what about elsewhere say the Middle
East there there's a bright spot not
just bright but all inspiring one of the
grand successes in reconciling an ethnic
conflict that goes back to the collapse
of the British Empire namely the
israel-palestine agreement now that's
been the biggest international story by
a longshot
since September 28th when the Oslo to
agreement was signed in Washington it
was a day of awe as the headlines put it
it was there was another huge outpour
of emotion and adulation for everyone
involved in the day of awe after the
assassination of Yitzhak Rabine martyr
for peace and Clinton's words a couple
of weeks later well the reasons for the
awe are given by massive internet
newspaper coverage here in abroad I'll
just give a couple of headlines as a
sample headline Israel agrees to quit
wet West Bank
that's the Guardian in London kind of on
the left Israel and the PLO a signed
agreement extending Palestinian rule to
most of the West Bank
that's Reuters repeated in
internationally Financial Times in
London newspapers here and so on
Rabia negotiated the Accord to
eventually cede Israel Israeli control
of the West Bank and Gaza to the
Palestinians that's New York Times
Robbins thinking underwent a remarkable
transformation from 1990 to an
astonishing transformation as he agreed
the peace with the Palestinians that's
the New York Times being proposed
walling off the West Bank and the Gaza
from Israel that's the Washington Post
his plans were inevitably leading to a
real Palestinian state not a Palestinian
Banta Stan as critics claim that's the
left New Statesman in England well
that's a pretty fair sample from the US
and British press so there's good reason
for a day of awe that's pretty
impressive
the accounts have a number of
interesting features one is that the
factual assertions are not just plain
false but ludicrously false if you look
at the actual facts you find that what
happened is something quite different
the agreement breaks the West Bank into
four zones one zone is Greater Jerusalem
which Israel has already annexed and
taken over and if you look at the New
York Times Maps
they've already ceded it to Israel it's
supposed to be under negotiations but
not according to the New York Times it's
part of Israel that's a big area you
know just what it is nobody knows
because it keeps expanding but the the
Railly government including the martyr
for peace and his successor Shimon Peres
have made very clear that it's going to
extend to include ago to include male
adumim to its East and to go virtually
to the Jordan Valley which is really
ping to so essentially to bisect the
West Bank
that's one error one of the four zones
the other three zones which are the only
ones discussed because this one's
already been ceded to Israel the other
three zones of the West Bank do give
some authority of the Palestinians
namely downtown Nablus and torque arm
and a couple other cities that amounts
to people vary in their estimates
something like one to two percent maybe
the outside 3 percent of the West Bank
so there the Palestinian Authority has
control 70 percent of the West Bank
Israel has total control unchallenged
total control and there in the remaining
zone which is on the order of 28 percent
Palestinians have local authority but
Israel has over overriding control veto
power in fact veto power in a hundred
percent of the West Bank and Gaza
according to the agreements that were
signed well there is not a word in the
agreement about any eventual grant
ceding of any control the actual
arrangements are precisely for scattered
bantu stands as indeed is reported in
Israel and as Rabine successor the
dovish Shimon Paris very forcefully
explained not in secret but to a
gathering of ambassadors where he
explained Oslo - he said a Palestinian
state will never happen whatever the New
Statesman and others might choose to
believe furthermore all these plans are
rapidly being implemented with
increasing settlement using your tax
funds using US funds with the agreement
of the Clinton administration as the
Bush administration before it in return
for these concessions Palestinians have
to recognize and under Oslo to do
recognize the legality of existing and
future settlements in the West Bank and
indeed Israeli sovereignty over
in effect any region it chooses to keep
well that's the great day of all what
about Robyn's visions having undergone a
remarkable transformation well they did
actually take 1988 at the peak moment of
us-israeli rejection of any Palestinian
rights at that point
Robyn been defense minister called for
Israel to contain can to control 40% of
the occupied territories that's the
traditional position of his labor party
back to 1968
now he's now settled for only twice that
much along with agreements that rescind
all UN and other decisions about the
legality of the settlements and Israeli
rights and territories so there's a
remarkable transformation but it just
happens to be in the opposite direction
the the same is true instead of a West
Bank resources Israel's got to control
them especially water it did sign a
water agreement with Jordan but in that
agreement Palestinian rights are
completely ignored and of course the
water in Israel is out of the discussion
the water in the Palestinian areas is
has been and will continue to be as far
as we know overwhelmingly used for
Israel itself and for settlements that
is so that settlements can have swimming
pools with green lawns and so on while
villages next-door don't have water to
drink well that's the great settlement
of the day of all in fact what happened
is and the facts are not in dispute on
this take a look at them Israel in the
United States the United States
primarily have rammed through the most
extreme rejectionist proposal that has
ever been put forth anywhere within the
mainstream political spectrum in either
country in fact it's about the same as
the show run plan of 1981 the far right
your own plan as has been pointed out in
Israel I should say so September 28th
was indeed a day of law it was a day of
off or the rule of force and
International Affairs and for the power
of doctrinal institutions in societies
with very
obedient intellectual classes and I
should say what's particularly
remarkable about this is the
subordination of much of the world the
US propaganda in Europe and Latin
America countries intellectuals
countries policymakers have literally
forgotten what they themselves were
advocating four or five years ago and
except by now the u.s. doctrinal system
that is very impressive
it does merit law all of this becomes
even more awe-inspiring if you look a
little bit at the history which has been
suppressed to an unusual extent actually
an extraordinary extent here no time to
review it but what it shows is in brief
and again the plain material in print if
you want to look and it's not in the
least controversial the United States
has but it's totally unacceptable so you
know you got a search for it even
scholarship suppresses it in brief ever
since Kissinger's takeover of Middle
East policy in 1971 the United States
has led the International rejectionist
camp it stood virtually alone in the
world in rejecting a very broad
international consensus of consensus
which Washington itself had crafted but
then abandoned under Kissinger x' in
control that called for israeli
withdrawal from the territories in
return for peace US has rejected that's
in 71 the u.s. then went on to flatly
reject any Palestinian rights and has
continued to in order to block any peace
process the US has had to repeatedly
veto Security Council resolutions to
vote alone or with one or another client
state occasionally a year after year
against General Assembly resolutions
it's been forced to block diplomatic
initiatives from Europe from the Arab
states from the PLO in fact from
everyone and at one it one flat out it
one on the ground and it one in what
passes for history and that's a very
impressive achievement which tells us
quite a lot of a world order and how its
maintained and how its justified by
those who benefit from good education
well let me go back finally to the
convinced
story I think there is a move from
containment but I don't think it's a
move to enlargement rather borrow
another bit of cold war rhetoric it's a
move from containment to rollback there
have been major changes in the
International economy and in the world
seen in the past 25 years of which the
end of the Cold War is only a small part
and they have indeed placed
extraordinary new power a new weapons in
the hands of private tyrannies and the
states that they pretty much dominate
they've enabled them to launch a very
significant attack against democracy
against human rights even against
markets if we look closely and to
rollback the hated expansion of
democracy human rights and freedom that
has been one in a long long and often
bitter popular struggles and we're
seeing that right around us here as in
much of the world well it's not the
first such moment by any means this has
happened before repeatedly this kind of
end of history has been hailed by the
powerful and the privileged and by their
minions
several many times before always wrongly
whether in fact this claim this time
around is right or wrong is not
something for us to predict because we
can't it's something for us to decide
and to determine which indeed we can
[Applause]
[Applause]
before professor Chomsky answers some
questions from the audience it's my
pleasure to present Christopher Hitchens
columnist for the nation and Vanity Fair
never went to shy away from controversy
his latest book the missionary position
is about mother Theresa whom he calls a
leathery old bat it's available at the
book table outside and we highly
recommend it Christopher Hitchens is an
erudite insightful and fearless writer
he is a master of his craft who uses
words with surgical skill to excite to
Lance the pretensions of the
self-important to perform verbal
lobotomies than those with delusions of
grandeur and finally to improve the
health of the body politic there are
journalists who can expose and inform
and there are journalists who can move
you with the beauty and the power of
their prose Christopher Hitchens is one
of the rare people who can do both and
he does it with ironic humor easy grace
and forceful elegance we are pleased
that he could join us here tonight
[Applause]
[Music]
thank you very much Gerry for a
fantastically generous introduction
could I first ask all those who know
that they are volunteers to start moving
and block all the exits please you know
who you are
there are stewards and marshals waiting
for you ladies and gentlemen brothers
and sisters comrades and Friends you
probably thought you'd already paid to
come here and I know that I haven't
drawn the most popular straw in being
the one who stands between you and gnome
and the question-and-answer session but
the fact is that we had covert action
quarterly are quite old hands and have
been in this business a long run and
we're not about to let a captive
audience get away that lightly
we would like you to make a pledge if
you can and will be passing buckets and
baskets around
for you to put money in or IOUs or
checks or any kind of paper currency I
don't know for example if I can just
start the ball rolling here how many
people here would put their hands up and
admit that they pay for home delivery of
the Washington Post that's quite a lot I
do it too I reckon what $250 a year for
that I don't see why the government
doesn't distribute it free quite frankly
254 to have a great world war juve
consensus dumped on your doorstep
now if you'll pay 250 and not really
notice it for that the newspaper that
publishes Henry Kissinger as an op-ed
contributor the newspaper of which I
have Stern once rather brilliantly said
it's a great paper The Washington Post
you never know on what page you'll find
the front-page story that paper who will
put up their hand and say they'll give
250 dollars they'll give the Washington
Post equivalent there you go into the
bucket it goes anymore yes excellent any
more of those well you can keep them you
can keep thinking about it the offer is
not it was not going to expire with time
while you're writing your check or your
pledge or your I owe you or just tugging
that your billfold I just like to say a
few things about our guest of honor
tonight and about and about caq I was
rereading Norman Mailer's armies of the
night recently preparation for an
interview I was doing with him and I
came across the wonderful passage where
mailer is arrested in the march on the
Pentagon and he's thrown into the wagon
by the police who then throw in a member
a uniformed member of the US Nazi Party
in along with him just to show that the
Park Police have a sense of humor and as
this sort of scene clears a bit he may
no realizes that this is him and the
Nazi and one other a sort of thin rather
distant prospective called slightly
Jewish looking sort of academic guy and
he says that it's turns out to be Noam
Chomsky and I went interviewed him later
I said that must be an amazing encounter
he said yes at the time I had no idea
who know him Chomsky was but now and of
course was was
from the first days of the anti-war
movement not just on the day of that
great march on the Pentagon but on many
other days important days to in their
very front rank taking the side of the
victim calling an aggression by its
right name calling people to the
responsibility the realization that in
such a case of aggression you'll morally
obliged to stand with the victim and
that contribution I think will be
remembered he's often pessimistic about
the historical record I nonetheless
think his contribution on that will will
always be remembered as as quite
literally imperishable he was also there
at the funeral of Fred Hampton was
almost the only white face I think who
was present at that funeral
the victim being an assassinated
dissident victim of a national political
police force the Federal Bureau of
Investigation he went all the way to
Managua to offer his solidarity and
practical and moral forms as a lecturer
and as a and as a friend at the time of
the hysterical war of aggression waged
against against Nicaragua by the Reagan
administration and he's also incredibly
helpful open willing and friendly for
the least person who wants to consult
him for research and scholarly purposes
I I recently felt I had to do something
about the Charles Mary Richard
Herrnstein phenomenon the bell curve
phenomena where it suddenly discovered
that the fault is not in the society but
in the genetic makeup of its lower
orders and I thought well probably norm
will have something to say about this
after all he studied the nature-nurture
question rather intently and I rang him
up said what if you got he said well
I've got much recent really but I
suppose I did write the paper about
Richard hansteen concertina is really
the author the late hansteen rather than
charles murray of the Belko a few years
ago he sent me the most the most perfect
and most prescient demolition of Richard
hence keen that it was possible to
imagine this was a time when everybody
in the country was reviewing that damn
book and where the book was getting
really pretty extensive freeride and
where none of these insights and none of
these findings and none of these areas
of contestation were alluded to at all
by the supposedly scholarly reviewers
but you only had to contact the man
himself
and to be shall I say without sounding
fawning enlightened he now must been the
victim he's not himself a victim of
self-pity in any way wouldn't say this
for himself but I can tell you as
someone who's followed here that he's
been the victim of a really
unprecedented campaign of calumny and
defamation and a parallel campaign to
silence and excluded marginalize his
contributions his books go unreviewed in
the major outlets his letters often in
written in defense against appalling
libels are often unpublished or
published in a mutilated form I think
he's born under borne up under this with
tremendous dignity and bearing and and
address my chomskyan syllogism therefore
if I can venture such a thing is that he
has always been there for us and covert
action quarterly will always be it is
here for him and so give generously
how's it going is there anyone who
hasn't has a bag under their nose yet
and they must be some people at the
front I think all right let's see I want
to increase the tempo of giving a little
if what I've just said doesn't move he
austere you how much would you give to
see Barbara Bush in the dock okay where
any member of the Bush family I'm
offering you Barbara I had to review her
ghastly book the other day you can
always do something you know however
small I had to review this damn book for
a stupid tabloid reading through and she
said that Phillip Agee had given away
the name of an American agent in Athens
who later being assassinated and was
morally responsible for this man's
murder and the introduction says that
George Bush read every word of the book
to protect her from having made any
mistakes or committed any errors of fact
so I thought huh rank Phil in Hamburg I
said I think you ought to sue her and he
is suing her and they've already
admitted that they're wrong
it's as good you want anyone want the
buckets back all right another pledge
he's going to him several million
dollars
the publishers already admitted and the
author that their guilt in the matter by
changing this and excising reliable from
the paperback and our old friend Phil
Austin's actually to be vindicated in
the American Court and she might have to
come there and take pardon it I'd say
what's that worth to you I'd say it was
worth a few by few bucks one of those
things that cheers you up give
generously in other words when when Phil
first started writing about this kind of
thing it amazes me looking at his book
now this with the scandal it caused we
had no idea he thought it was bad
Phil edge he helped us to find out how
bad but we and he had not the least idea
how bad it really was it's since his
revelations that we've discovered about
frat that we've had Jennifer harbors
revelations of the collusion direct
collusion between the CIA and the death
squads in Guatemala that we've had
brilliantly reported also in covert
action quarterly the account of the
CIA's part in the arrest of Nelson
Mandela the original arrest that led to
his his first trial and imprisonment and
the arrest of his wife Winnie we've had
the Gladio revelations about the plans
for military crews in every Western
European country in the event of crisis
we've had the Ames Fiasco where it seems
that taxpayers were paying to have the
United States dis inform itself thus I
suppose cutting out the middleman and
now the revelations that the crystal
ball and stargazing faction is
considered to be worth seventeen million
of anybody's money I always thought one
often wonder why the Washington Post has
an astrology column and a horoscope
every day now I think I know it was code
they were talking to each other through
the Washington Post astrology columnist
anyway think of think about that and see
much how much money you can part with CA
cues always had the goods on the the
foul collusion between the national
security state in this country and a
network of dictators and psychopathic
killers who are ready to rent themselves
out to them
I have very often have been lucky enough
to be able to recommend visiting
journalists from overseas to go to the
caq library
to go through the archive to write
stories in the Foreign Press that the
sort that you never see here it's a it's
a service they're very proud and glad to
provide and I'm incredibly proud and
glad to be able to recommend great
satisfaction comes of it
so what's it what's it worth to you is
my question as I hope we can have one
more go-around perhaps I can pluck one
more heart string right for one more
pocket open one more bill Phil did you
see in The Washington Post yesterday
that dr. Michael Mandelbaum great
foreign policy pundit of the Brookings
Institution has issued his final
critique of the Clinton administration's
foreign policy this is one that not even
know my think would have believed in his
in his critique of our um our
vulnerability to our own good intentions
but dr. Malabar really does say the
problem with the Clinton administration
is and its foreign policies it's so
compassionate it is the foreign policy
says this doctor of Brookings
Institution of Mother Teresa now if you
take my view of mother Teresa which is
that she's a valet de pouvoir that she's
a servant of right-wing thugs in power
and right-wing businessmen on the make
and someone who likes to fool the poor I
suppose you could say that this was the
foreign policy of Mother Teresa but I
don't think that was the implication
about either her or President Clinton
but it is I think still and perhaps Nell
would agree that the benchmark remark
about about how we are really much too
kind much too sweet most or I'll twist
taken much too forgiving I will close
with a story that I have known will
forgive me telling about him as we all
Casely do we had to go to the dentist
not long ago now the dentist said to him
it's okay your teeth are in good shape
but you're grinding them rather a lot
aren't you no I'm certain no I'm not I
don't under way of grinding them at all
well said the dentist I've heard that
before actually what's happening this is
common to as you're grinding them in
your sleep no I'm thought maybe I am his
wife and great partner wondered the
wonderful Carol Chomsky agreed to sort
of have around the clock
know him watch just to sort of see
Wilson he wasn't grinding them in his
sleep so they had him over intensive
watch they found he was grinding them
for a 15 20 minute period every day in
the morning while he was going through
the New York Times
now I would just in closing there for a
recall for you the great closing words
from the late master of the movement Joe
Hill don't grind be like no organized
thank you okay your turn I think there's
some mics up here yeah
dr. Chomsky if you could discuss the
current situation in Nicaragua and
comments have been on the split in the
sandanista movement and also the the
follies of the Chamorro government well
let me give you two versions of what's
going on a Nicaraguan one of them was
given by Hillary Clinton who was down
there on round mid-october and I think
she at least stopped at the airport
maybe she saw something else and she
praised the president tomorrow on having
I think her words were reunified the
Nicaraguan family and reeva I don't
control it on close your eyes I've been
blinded for the last hours if she
praised them for her for revitalizing
the economy and reunifying the
Nicaraguan family very upbeat I happened
to be there at the time I have a
daughter and grandson there and I was
visiting and a couple of days before
about three or four days earlier the
there's an ultra-right newspaper the
newspaper the business community the big
glossy newspaper the business community
but the buna and they had had an article
which was a which was on a UNICEF report
that had just come out which I haven't
seen reported here
on Nicaragua which and their headline
said Nicaragua is mortgaging its future
and may be destroyed why because 75% of
families live in extreme poverty
25% of children suffer severe
malnutrition 1/3 of children between 6 &
9 don't go to school the country is
collapsing and has been falling into
total ruin since the United States took
it over in 1990 so there's two versions
you can pick the version of UNICEF and
the right-wing business community and
Nicaragua you can pick Hillary Clinton's
version in fact it you know there are a
lot of third-world countries if you've
been around the third world where it is
possible to sort of drive around and
think you're in a rich country I mean in
Cairo for example you can go from the
airport to the fancy hotel on the Nile
and you know some fancy restaurant and
so on and you think you're on you know
Upper West Side Manhattan or wherever
the rich area of Manhattan is I don't
know or the equivalent part of
Washington you can do that Managua is
not one of them you can't go two blocks
without seeing that the country is
desperate without having your car
surrounded by starving Street waves
asking for a penny or saying that you
know the place is falling to pieces and
if you bother looking any further you
see that it's not impossible as a few
Nicaraguan environmentalists are fearing
that the country may be uninhabitable in
a couple of decades because people are
so poor that they're forced to go up and
cut trees and there's deforestation and
have relatively underpopulated and
resource rich area to the extent that
lakes are beginning to dry up and rivers
are drying up and there's environmental
catastrophes and so on and that's after
a decade of whatever you think about the
Sandinistas no doubt of rather
significant progress by Central
Americans and is astonishing progress
well okay you can take your choice about
what's happening I've already forgotten
the second half of the question well
Diaz split in the sense well I mean the
Sandinistas have plenty to answer for
the good thing about this
I was very critical of myself that some
of you will know right through the 80s
and with plenty of conflicts but there
was one good thing about them several
good things about them first of all they
didn't go around massacring everybody
which by the standards of our colonies
is already pretty good you know so they
get a couple of points for that
secondly they did provide space in which
other people could do things so if
people wanted to carry out health
programs or you know to make a school
for the poor or cooperative or something
yeah they'd help him out and they could
do it again by the standards of our
dependencies that's unheard of in fact
kind of hard to find here but so there
were good things about them on the other
hand they were authoritarian and they
robbed and they you know did plenty of
ugly things the right now the party has
split split is a funny word for I mean
look the the official party which has
almost every least by the polls that's
almost all of the people who support it
is the Ortega faction Sarah Ramirez who
I should say is a personal friend is
separated he was the vice president he's
now running uh he's kind of a kind of
like a mainstream social democrat is got
a separate grouping that's the son
Dennis to split exactly what it means in
the situation the country is very hard
to say you it doesn't make any sense to
interpret the results of elections in
Central America for very well-known
reasons very well understood reasons
which were pointed at years ago by
Central American Jesuits and that is as
they pointed out that the culture of
terror has domesticated people's
aspirations
you just place people under repeated
terror
year after year and it domesticates
their aspirations they don't even hope
for anything anymore
you've killed hope in the title of a
recent book by somebody is here the that
and that's that's the great achievement
of the United States to have killed hope
so people just sort of try to find
survival strategies and
hence the results of elections are
almost meetings even when people vote
may I after you restate the question
because you know as phones are not wired
into the loop system thank you yeah okay
well I'll try to keep the question very
brief you alluded to the fact that the
US has cut back on the foreign aid and
cutting back to the UN because the Cold
War is over and they don't have to give
the bribes out anymore and then you said
you were going to not what I said well
no okay that's true that's true we
always had the most miserly aid program
right that's true but and but it has
something to do with the end of the Cold
War and that the domestic situation also
has something to do with the end of the
Cold War you know having to do with the
fact that you don't need the labor
movement anymore to you know to subvert
the labor movements overseas and you
don't of course you don't need the labor
movement at all because you've got slave
labor around the world and so on what I
wanted to ask is can you give us a
thumbnail sketch of what you're going to
talk about tomorrow for those of us who
are gonna be snowbound didn't know vent
the snow if your snow van they'll be too
the question was I was asked to repeat
the questions the I think there's a
little bit of misinterpretation but let
me state the question as it was stated
and then I'll try to deal with the
misinterpretation
maybe my fault I the questioner said
that I had implied or maybe said that
the end of the Cold War has led to
cutback in US aid because it's not
necessary to bribe countries and it's
led to attack on the labor movement
because we no longer lead need the labor
movement to undermine labor in other
countries and other things like that and
then was asked for a thumbnail sketch of
what I'm gonna talk about tomorrow for
those of you who are snowbound
that's news to me I thought it never
snowed in Washington the first of all I
didn't say if I if I implied it was my
fault but I didn't mean to imply that
these things had to do with the end of
the Cold War the end of the Cold War has
happened but I think that's a very minor
factor in what's going on these changes
have been going
very dramatically for about 25 years and
they have to do with big changes in the
international economy the huge explosion
of financial capital ever since Richard
Nixon dismantled the Bretton Woods
system and the system of regulated
capital which is an extraordinary
phenomenon the increased possibilities
of globalization of production I mean
there's a number of things that have
gone on it's true that the cold and the
cold were contributed to them
at the end of the Cold War contributed
to them primarily here I think you have
to think about what the Cold War was
about in my view what that's mostly
misinterpreted in my view the Cold War
was just a very overblown case of a
north-south conflict it's kind of like
the u.s. conflate with Grenada
you go to the opposite extreme but of
course there's a big difference between
a spec of in the Caribbean that you
can't find in a six of the world so one
of them you get rid of in a weekend and
the other takes 70 years but the
structure is quite similar Russia and
Eastern Europe generally were
third-world deeply impoverished third
world areas for the most part parts were
part of the West and they're going back
to the West like the Czech Republic in
western Poland yeah that was part of the
West and that's going back to the West
most of it was deeply impoverished
third-world countries in fact the
original third world you know it started
splitting from Western Europe around the
15th century getting increasingly more
deeply impoverished as the West began to
develop and be its service area kind of
like the relation between us in Mexico
or something like that
well there's some rules of international
conduct one major rule is that no part
of the third world is or the south
so-called has allowed the strike and
independent courts that's not permitted
they have a function their function is
to serve they try to carry out an
independent course whether it's you know
fishing cooperatives and Grenada or a
populist program in Haiti or you know
you name it you know clinics and health
care and in Nicaragua they got to be
smashed because that's not permitted
when it's in a six of the world even
more
in fact us attack the Western attack
began in 1918 that's when a cold war
began the Russia wasn't conquering
anybody whatever you thought about it
the there's a second rule of
international affairs and that is you
better it's bad enough to strike an
independent course it's worse
- apparently succeed now succeed means
maybe not you know there's no objective
measure of success success means succeed
in a way which will be which will
motivate others to try to do the same
thing and the fear of Russia from 1918
right until the mid-1960s and that's
when our record runs dry you know we
don't have a Declassified record after
that but as from 1918 right away until
the mid early 1960s the great fear was
that they were successful that they were
adamant they were having a demonstration
effect that others would want to follow
and in fact if you think realistically
that's not mistaken people here say look
what a horror was compared at the
Western Europe it's true it was a total
horror but to compare it with Western
Europe is absolute insanity you know I
mean that's like saying that the
Cambridge Massachusetts kindergartens
are a failure and proof ask how much
quantum physics the kids know as
compared with the ones getting their
page these at MIT I mean that's not even
insane you know you want to compare
Eastern Europe and something compare
compare it with something that was
comparable before the this took this
took place so say compare Russia and
Brazil or compare Bulgaria and Guatemala
or something like that that's a same
comparison and there's a good reason why
nobody undertakes it if you have a look
at Brazil and Guatemala and the rest of
them you'll see why nobody undertakes
that comparison except people in the
third world you don't have good
education z' like us they do make that
comparison and planners in the united
states always made that comparison in
the West and they were afraid of what
they found that in comparison with what
we're doing this stuff looks pretty
successful and others were going to try
to follow it and that Henry Kissinger
had a word for it it's a virus that will
infect
others and he was talking about Chile
under a end it was gonna be a virus that
would infect people as far as Italy not
cuz Chile was gonna conquer Italy but
because we'd send the wrong message to
Italian voters namely you can vote for a
social democratic system and maybe it'll
work and when there's a virus you got to
destroy it
and inoculate everything around it and
that's what we did that's you look over
that that's basically the Cold War okay
it's over
so Eastern Europe goes back to what it
was pretty much you know not 100% but
the parts that were part of the West are
becoming part of the West the parts that
were third-world are becoming
third-world and that is that does
contribute to these other phenomenon it
means for in fact that you read the
business press they're very frank about
it the business press which is the best
place to if you want to read the press
that's the one that usually comes close
to telling the truth they tell you that
with Eastern Europe now back in its
third world situation or to put it let
me quote from the Financial Times in
London the world's greatest business
newspaper the as with the impoverishment
and polarization of East Europe as a
result of the capitalist reforms the
Western investors can now move their
production over to Eastern Europe and
undermine the pampered Western workers
who will be forced to give up their
luxurious lifestyles so now in other
words not only can GM and you know B W
and so on invest in Mexico and you know
Brazil and so on but they can also do it
in Poland where they furthermore get
well educated healthy trained people
because this part of the third world
could develop and they can do it at ten
percent the cost of the pampered Western
European workers without any benefits
and incidentally since none of these
guys believe in the free market and
never have the free markets for others
not for yourself they insist on high
tariff protection and you know subsidies
from the government and the usual stuff
that comes along with foreign investment
so in that respect yes it's another
weapon in the hands of
Western power to undermine the pampered
Western workers so the s the Cold War
has an effect but it's a you know it's a
not a big effect and it as with regard
to aid it's virtually nothing what am I
going to talk about tomorrow well what
I'm going to talk about tomorrow is the
rollback on the domestic scene I think
it's going on and the United States is
in effect being subjected to a kind of a
structural adjustment program it's being
turned into a third world Society now
it's so rich you know it has so many
advantages in fact : paralleled this
ought to be by far the most richest cut
if there's one hungry child in the
United States the socio-economic system
is a total catastrophe consider given
the given the wealth of this country
other places you want to know how
wealthy it is I'll give you just one
figure in the 18th century 18th century
the life expectancy of Americans that
level of life expectancy was not reached
by the upper classes and Britain until
this century you know the next richest
people in the world that's one measure
of the extraordinary privilege and
advantages that there are here and in
fact so we're being turned into a kind
of third world Society but you know it's
the United States it's not Haiti and
that's happening all over you can't walk
through any American city without
recognizing a third world city sector of
great opulence in a large group of
people actually the majority who are
suffering or maybe in misery and a big
mass of superfluous people you have to
get rid of all souls Church whoever it
is anyway that's why we go
president Chavez key is honored to share
again this time in space with you as
your greatest student
I had to enquire the technique about
intellectual endeavor we ought to review
the responsibilities of intellect dot
est uncorruptible one why have we failed
to persuade the majority as sinner to
take the necessary action disengaging
himself from this benevolent
the Nile and on Noma sation of evil also
as known as a cultural relativism
that has historically haunted our
condition and here's a case of in point
Richard rulings reply to your letter
Richard William wo Li n you wrote a
letter and he says despite the
considerable itical and culture means at
the disposal of opinion makers and
politician most citizens remain contra
Chomsky surprisingly capable of
penetrating the veil of DC and making up
at their minds then so so what if all
citizens are aware it has a repression
from the systematic mechanism of
economic political control enslave us to
the rich and the powerful so the
question is why you know if why we are
if I got it correctly why we're unable
to convince the majority of people to
look at things the way we think the
world is and are the mechanisms of
control so powerful that it can't be
broken so I believe I'll tell me ought
to be look at to and see see I don't
agree with the assumption I think most
of the populations on their side in fact
I think the evidence is overwhelming
about that so take for example like I
mentioned one case the I only mentioned
one case in fact when I was talking
about public opinion in policy I
mentioned several okay to take the case
I mentioned one of them is the Vietnam
War that's a big issue there has been
sir you know by now forty fifty years of
intense propaganda about the Vietnam War
all of which says it was a noble effort
that went maybe went wrong 70% of the
population says it was fundamentally
wrong and immoral not a mistake
despite that massive propaganda despite
never having heard anyone say that
meaning everyone picked it up on their
own somehow take say the Pentagon budget
the one part of the budget that's
growing up well the popular
I'm against that and so are the
population by six to one it's not a
small amount
takes a budget-balancing it's a big
thing you know we're all supposed to
assume and take for granted that you got
to balance the budget in fact the
political system is is bound that you
know there are differences some guys say
seven years some guys say eight years
you know so that's the menu debate that
in the political system and the you
listen to NPR and they tell you
Americans voted for a balanced budget
and so on well the fact that here the
polls you got to look at a little bit
carefully because they're well-crafted
there's one question asked for headline
writers and there's another question
asked for people who want to know what
public opinion is like so you know how
to frame the messages in which you
deceive people and those are different
questions the question for the headline
writers is would you like a balanced
budget and most everybody said sure you
know that's like asking people would you
like your mortgage to disappear terrific
you know I like my mortgage disappear so
you get a big high number okay that's
for NPR and you know the editorial
writers and so on everybody wants a
balanced budget
then comes the other question which is
for the propagandists who have to figure
out how to frame this so people don't
know what's hitting them and that says
would you like that begins to ask the
rational questions like would you what
would you want your household debts
eliminated if it means giving up your
house or your car or your children's
education and so on well then everybody
no no I don't want a balanced household
budget anymore so when you ask that
question the same question do you want
the budget balanced if it means cuts in
health expenditures or you know social
spending or environment so on well then
populations opposed by you know three to
one or something depending on exactly
how the question is framed so in fact
the population is overwhelmingly opposed
to a balanced budget
now you're not allowed to know that
you're supposed to think everybody wants
a balanced budget
you know Clinton when a response the
Republicans as of course of course we
have to balance the budget okay well
they're the population again and in fact
you know you could ask the question
who's right I mean there is a factual
question is the population right or
is the whole political elite right well
you know I think there's good evidence
about that and I think the population is
right but that's another question in
fact let me just end with this not I do
I think the populations on our side so
do sodas concert as the right-wing
Congress so does the wall street
journal' they all think the populations
are saw on our side and there's proof of
it actually my latest an article and
covered action quarterly where I ended
up giving some evidence about this the
evidence that I cited was the probe
there's a program in Congress called be
funding the left and you know the Wall
Street Journal has big articles about
how we got to defund the left and
Congress is pushing through you know
legislation which will be fun the left
well take a look at who they've got to
be fund and what they're worried they
say it looks really terrible the
government funding always left-wing
organizations we got to stop that all
right take a look at the list the top
organization of the left
that has to be defunded is Catholic
Charities the reason why is because
there are priests and nuns who for
nothing are going out and working with
poor people to try to help them deal
with the fact that they don't have any
heating for their homes and to help and
Head Start program so we've got to
defund the left and stop giving money to
Catholic Charities
the second-biggest program is AARP
American Association of Retired people
not another big left-wing organization
why why do they have to be defunded well
they have to be defunded it's explained
because they happen to have a program
that's trying to help elderly people who
are hungry get work now in fact The Wall
Street Journal had another article
saying that 16 percent of the elderly
are severely malnutrition than many are
literally starving but AARP is trying to
work out some kind of program for them
to get some work so that's another
left-wing organization that has to be
defunded and so it goes on in fact if
you have a look at it
it turns out that the left is everybody
who is not pathologically insane no
that's a pretty large number of people
you know so in fact they think the whole
list is that that you know that we want
you know but we've got everybody on our
side
and in fact I don't think that's
completely wrong so the the it's not
that the propaganda system has you know
turned everybody into a raving lunatic
no it hasn't
people keep their decent instincts but
they are very confused I mean the same
people who say we shouldn't the
government should increase you know the
government the majority of the
population says the government has a
responsibility to help the poor but
another majority the population says the
government should end welfare well you
know what's welfare well helping the
poor and here's where the propaganda
system has work I mean it's convinced
people that we're giving away all our
money you know we're giving all our
money to foreigners we're giving our
money to black women driving Cadillacs
and all that kind of stuff and that kind
of confusion is all over the place and
people don't know what they want they
don't know what they think but they know
what their attitudes are and their
attitudes are pretty sane professor but
you must admit that noting the situation
have not changed in math equation has
not changed have not changed since wins
I mean do we have slavery okay so with
no change a lot of in fact situations
changed a lot in our lifetimes for the
better it's a much better country than
it was thirty years ago way better and
that's a very important meeting like
this could not have been held
inconceivable that it could have been
held thirty years ago and now I can
yield everywhere in the country the most
reactionary place in the country with
huge mob everybody's interested and so
on and so forth those are big changes
and they reflect all sorts of things
that have happened in the country not
because you know people were writing
articles or reading books or anything
like that because plenty of people are
organized and they're organizing because
they know things and they're learning
things and they're contributing by their
actions to other people learning things
and so on that has changed the country
and there's plenty of room for further
change you know things go up and back
like now it's worse than it was a couple
of years ago but that's happened before
it too 1920s were worse than now so hey
what do you see from you that our
contract calls for us to close down ten
minutes ago
so I'm I'm really sorry I thank you all
very very much for coming
